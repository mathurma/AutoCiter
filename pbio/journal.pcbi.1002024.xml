        <p>The division of labor between template and catalyst is a fundamental property of
                    all living systems: DNA stores genetic information whereas proteins function as
                    catalysts. The RNA world hypothesis, however, posits that, at the earlier stages
                    of evolution, RNA acted as both template and catalyst. Why would such division
                    of labor evolve in the RNA world? We investigated the evolution of DNA-like
                    molecules, i.e. molecules that can function only as template, in minimal
                    computational models of RNA replicator systems. In the models, RNA can function
                    as both template-directed polymerase and template, whereas DNA can function only
                    as template. Two classes of models were explored. In the surface models,
                    replicators are attached to surfaces with finite diffusion. In the compartment
                    models, replicators are compartmentalized by vesicle-like boundaries. Both
                    models displayed the evolution of DNA and the ensuing division of labor between
                    templates and catalysts. In the surface model, DNA provides the advantage of
                    greater resistance against parasitic templates. However, this advantage is at
                    least partially offset by the disadvantage of slower multiplication due to the
                    increased complexity of the replication cycle. In the compartment model, DNA can
                    significantly delay the intra-compartment evolution of RNA towards catalytic
                    deterioration. These results are explained in terms of the trade-off between
                    template and catalyst that is inherent in RNA-only replication cycles: DNA
                    releases RNA from this trade-off by making it unnecessary for RNA to serve as
                    template and so rendering the system more resistant against evolving parasitism.
                    Our analysis of these simple models suggests that the lack of catalytic activity
                    in DNA by itself can generate a sufficient selective advantage for RNA
                    replicator systems to produce DNA. Given the widespread notion that DNA evolved
                    owing to its superior chemical properties as a template, this study offers a
                    novel insight into the evolutionary origin of DNA.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>At the core of all biological systems lies the division of labor between the
                    storage of genetic information and its phenotypic implementation, in other
                    words, the functional differentiation between templates (DNA) and catalysts
                    (proteins). This fundamental property of life is believed to have been absent at
                    the earliest stages of evolution. The RNA world hypothesis, the most realistic
                    current scenario for the origin of life, posits that, in primordial replicating
                    systems, RNA functioned both as template and as catalyst. How would such
                    division of labor emerge through Darwinian evolution? We investigated the
                    evolution of DNA-like molecules in minimal computational models of RNA
                    replicator systems. Two models were considered: one where molecules are adsorbed
                    on surfaces and another one where molecules are compartmentalized by dividing
                    cellular boundaries. Both models exhibit the evolution of DNA and the ensuing
                    division of labor, revealing the simple governing principle of these processes:
                    DNA releases RNA from the trade-off between template and catalyst that is
                    inevitable in the RNA world and thereby enhances the system's resistance
                    against parasitic templates. Hence, this study offers a novel insight into the
                    evolutionary origin of the division of labor between templates and catalysts in
                    the RNA world.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>At the core of all biological systems lies the division of labor between the storage
                of genetic information and the manifestation of genetic information, i.e. the
                functional differentiation between DNA, which is the information storage medium
                (template), and RNA and proteins, which are responsible for different aspects of
                operation (catalyst). This fundamental property of life, however, is believed to
                have been absent at the earliest stages of evolution. The RNA world hypothesis,
                which is currently considered to be the most, if not the only, realistic scenario
                for the origin of life, posits that, in the first, primitive replicating systems,
                both the storage of genetic information, and chemical catalysis were embodied in a
                single type of molecules, namely, RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Woese1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Orgel1">[5]</xref>. According to this hypothesis,
                DNA and proteins evolved later as specialized components dedicated to information
                storage and chemical catalysis, respectively, thereby achieving the division of
                labor between templates and catalysts. The emergence of this division marks a
                pivotal event among the major transitions of evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-MaynardSmith1">[6]</xref>. The RNA world hypothesis
                has stimulated extensive studies of reactions catalyzed by natural and synthetic
                ribozymes which revealed a remarkable, previously unsuspected diversity of catalytic
                activities of RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Talini1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Silverman1">[10]</xref>. The catalytic versatility of ribozymes cannot validate
                the RNA World hypothesis but clearly is compatible with this scenario.</p>
      <p>What selective advantage could there be for the evolution of DNA and proteins in the
                RNA world? Proteins are obviously superior to RNA as chemical catalysts because of
                their greater repertoire of chemical moieties and structural flexibility.
                Conversely, proteins are vastly inferior to RNA for the storage of genetic
                information because of the absence of mechanisms for template-directed replication.
                These properties of proteins are compatible with the view that proteins evolved as
                entities specialized in chemical catalysis owing to their superiority to RNA in that
                capacity.</p>
      <p>The case of DNA appears less straightforward. On the one hand, it remains somewhat
                unclear what would be the principal driving forces behind the evolution of DNA in
                the RNA world. DNA is generally a less reactive molecule than RNA thanks to the
                absence of the 2′-hydroxyl at its sugar moiety. In particular, DNA is markedly
                more resistant to hydrolysis than RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Eigner1">[11]</xref>, especially in the presence of
                metal ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Butzow1">[12]</xref>,
                which would certainly be important components of the RNA world given the ion
                requirement for most of the catalytic activities of ribozymes. Hence, it is often
                suggested that DNA has an advantage over RNA as a medium of genetic information
                storage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Lazcano1">[13]</xref>.
                However, Forterre recently argued that the greater stability of DNA could not
                account for the origin of DNA because the advantage of employing DNA for information
                storage lies in the possibility of evolving a longer genome, which in itself would
                not provide any immediate selective advantage to the systems that included DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Forterre1">[14]</xref>. The
                possibility to correct C to U misincorporation is often considered to be another
                advantage of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Lazcano1">[13]</xref>. However, such correction requires specialized catalytic
                machinery and so, again, could not provide a short-term advantage within the context
                of the RNA world. Forterre also proposed an alternative scenario, in which viruses
                evolved DNA genomes under the pressure to evade defense systems of the hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Forterre1">[14]</xref>. This
                hypothesis is predicated on the existence of complex RNA cells encoding, among other
                functions, the defense systems. However, RNA cells might not be a realistic stage in
                the evolution of life for a variety of reasons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Koonin1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, there is no clear experimental evidence demonstrating that DNA is
                inferior to RNA as a chemical catalyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Silverman2">[16]</xref>. DNA molecules that can
                catalyze various chemical reactions have been successfully produced in <italic>in
                    vitro</italic> evolution experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Silverman1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Breaker1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Franzen1">[19]</xref>. Hence, the chemical
                properties of DNA do not necessarily conduce to the fact that the function of DNA is
                restricted to information storage.</p>
      <p>Given these considerations, we ask: What selective advantage could there be for an
                RNA-based evolving system to evolve an entity that is solely dedicated to the
                storage of genetic information, i.e., an entity that is
                    <italic>functionally</italic> equivalent to DNA?</p>
      <p>As a first attempt to answer this question, we consider the evolution of DNA-like
                molecules in RNA replicator systems, the simplest form of the RNA world that can
                undergo Darwinian evolution. Our aim is to examine whether there could exist purely
                population dynamical factors, independent of specific nucleic acid chemistry, which
                would support selection for DNA-like molecules, i.e., molecules solely dedicated to
                the storage of information, in RNA replicator systems. To address this question, we
                construct and investigate minimal computational models of an RNA-like replicator
                system with a built-in possibility to evolve DNA-like molecules.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2">
      <title>Models</title>
      <p>There are two types of molecules in the models developed here: “RNA-like
                molecules” and “DNA-like molecules” (RNA and DNA, respectively,
                for short). The only difference between the two types of molecules is the presence
                or absence of the catalytic capacity—all other possible differences are
                ignored for the sake of simplicity and focus. Thus, an RNA molecule can be both a
                template for replication and a catalyst that replicates other templates, whereas a
                DNA molecule can only be a template for replication (to replicate templates is the
                only catalytic function considered in the models). Moreover, DNA and RNA compete for
                a common resource (precursors) for replication (this direct competition between DNA
                and RNA is expected to make the models more conservative with respect to the
                evolution of DNA). The models do not include protein-like molecules because we
                intend to investigate the simplest possible scenarios under which the evolution of
                DNA can be considered (see the “<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref>” section for more on this point).</p>
      <p>The two types of molecules give rise to four types of replication reactions,
                namely:</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>RNA-dependent RNA synthesis,</p>

        <list-item>
          <p>DNA-dependent DNA synthesis.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>To focus on the population dynamical aspect of the problem, we ignore all specific
                details of the molecular mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Joyce1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Sydow1">[21]</xref> of these distinct polymerization reactions and make the
                following simplification (see the “<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref>” section for more on this point). Regarding the
                substrate specificity, a replicase is either an RNA polymerase or a DNA polymerase
                (Rp or Dp, respectively, for short); i.e., the same catalyst cannot produce both RNA
                and DNA molecules. However, the type of polymerase can be converted from one to
                another as a result of rare mutations (see below). Regarding the template
                specificity, a replicase has a potential to discriminate between RNA and DNA.
                However, for simplicity, it is assumed that replicases do not discriminate between
                different DNA templates and between different RNA templates (to take account of such
                discrimination would make the model too complex for the purpose of the current
                work). It should be noted that, although a catalyst is always RNA, the information
                on a catalyst can be stored either in an RNA template (which itself is the catalyst)
                or in a DNA template. Thus, to distinguish between the RNA-form and DNA-form of
                catalysts, we use superscripts as follows: Rp<sup>RNA</sup> and Rp<sup>DNA</sup>,
                and Dp<sup>RNA</sup> and Dp<sup>DNA</sup>. When it is preferred not to distinguish
                between these two forms, catalysts are simply referred to without superscripts.</p>
      <p>The replication reaction is assumed to occur in two steps, namely complex formation
                between a template and a catalyst (replicase) and actual replication of the

      <p>A molecule produced by replication (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) inherits the

      <p>In addition to the replication reaction, the decay reaction that converts replicators

      <p>The class of replicators customarily called “parasites” is known to play
                important roles for the evolutionary dynamics of RNA-like replicator systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi2">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Konnyu1">[27]</xref>. Parasites are
                molecules that do not catalyze replication of other molecules but can be replicated
                by the catalysts, possibly at a faster rate than the catalysts themselves. Under
                well-mixed conditions, the parasite can bring a replicator system to extinction by
                (over)exploiting catalysts (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi1">[22]</xref>). Because of this inherent
                instability of RNA-like replicator systems against the parasite, it is necessary to
                consider spatial structure in the population of replicators and the discreteness of
                the population, which can prevent the extinction caused by parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Szathmary1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Hogeweg1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, if
                extinction is prevented through spatial pattern formation, the parasite can
                contribute to the evolution of complexity in RNA-like replicator systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi2">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Given these previous studies, we introduced parasites into the models. The models
                assume a special class of molecules, parasites, that have no catalytic activity but
                have an increased rate of complex formation with catalysts by a constant factor
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; e.g., if a parasite is RNA, the complex formation rate is
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the complex
                dissociation rate is unaffected and is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>
      <p>The model replicator system specified above was implemented as a spatially extended,
                individual-based stochastic simulation model. Two models were constructed: one in
                which replicators are assumed to be confined on a surface with finite diffusion (the
                surface model, for short) and another in which replicators are compartmentalized by
                vesicle-like boundaries that are impermeable to replicators (the compartment model).
                In the compartment model, the size of a compartment grows (or shrinks) in proportion
                to the number of replicators inside the compartment, and a compartment divides when
                its size reaches a threshold given by a parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The surface model
                does not assume any factors other than the birth, death and diffusion of replicators
                and so is simpler than the compartment model. However, the compartment model has an
                obvious relevance to the recent experimental efforts to synthesize model
                “protocells” (for reviews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Mansy1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Rasmussen1">[34]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The two models were implemented as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi3">[35]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002024.s001">Text S1</xref>, for
                details). Briefly, the surface model was implemented in two-dimensional cellular
                automata (CA). One square of the CA contained at most one replicator, and empty
                squares were considered to represent the resource (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>); hence, the number of
                replicators the system could sustain was limited both locally and globally. The
                dynamics were run by consecutively applying an algorithm that locally simulates the
                reactions specified above and diffusion. Interactions occurred only between
                molecules that were adjacent to each other on the CA grid. Diffusion was implemented
                as exchange of contents between adjacent grid squares, and the rate of diffusion is
                given by the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Both reactions and
                diffusion were prohibited to occur across CA and compartment boundaries.</p>
      <p>To simulate the dynamics of compartment boundaries, we employed the Cellular Potts
                Model (CPM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Anderson1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Graner1">[37]</xref>. The CPM was implemented in two-dimensional CA. Each
                compartment consisted of a set of grid squares with identical states. The CPM
                algorithm tends to bring the size of each compartment (i.e. the number of squares
                that constitute a compartment) closer to its target size while minimizing the number
                of contacts between different compartments. The CPM was superimposed onto the
                surface model to generate the compartment model. The value of
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was increased so that the internal replicator system within
                a compartment was relatively well-mixed. The dynamics of compartment boundaries and
                those of replicators were coupled by setting the target size of a compartment to be
                proportional to the number of replicators present in the compartment with the factor
                of proportionality <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Chen2">[38]</xref>, for an
                experimental support of this coupling). When the size of a compartment reached the
                threshold (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the compartment was divided along the line of the second
                principal component; the internal replicators were distributed between the two
                daughter compartments according to their location.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Before presenting the results of the simulations, let us first consider replicator
                systems consisting of RNA and DNA in general terms. In such a replicator system,
                there are four replication reactions as listed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Models</xref> section. These four reactions provide for three types of
                replicator systems, which we denote the self-replication system, the transcription
                system and the reverse transcription system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The self-replication system consists
                only of RNA molecules that function both as the templates and as the RNA-dependent

                This system is “primitive” in the sense that both genetic information
                and chemical catalysis are provided by a single type of molecules, so there is no
                division of labor between templates and catalysts. In contrast, the transcription
                system consists of both RNA and DNA and establishes a division of labor between the
                template and the catalyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g001">Figure
                    1B</xref>), where RNA plays the role of the catalyst whereas DNA plays the role
                of the template. An intermediate case is represented by the reverse transcription
                system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), which
                contains DNA molecules but requires RNA molecules to function both as catalyst and
                as template to complete the replication cycle.</p>

                        The prefixes to Rp and Dp denote the type of templates a polymerase depends
                        on: Rd stands for RNA-dependent, and Dd stands for DNA-dependent. Solid
                        arrows represent the template-product relationship. Broken arrows represent
                        the catalyst-reaction relationship. A: Self-replication system consists of
                        an RNA replicase (RdRp). B: Transcription system consists of a transcriptase

      </fig>
      <p>By comparing the three replicator systems, we can see two effects that can be brought
                about by the inclusion of DNA molecules into a replication cycle. First, the systems
                that include DNA are more complex and thus less efficient than the self-replication
                system. The inclusion of DNA requires the joint action of four types of molecules to
                complete a replication cycle (Rp<sup>RNA</sup>, Rp<sup>DNA</sup>, Dp<sup>RNA</sup>
                and Dp<sup>DNA</sup>), regardless of whether replication proceeds via the
                transcription cycle or via the reverse transcription cycle. Assuming that the total
                concentration of molecules is constant, this increase in the complexity of the
                replication cycle leads to a reduction in the concentration of each type of
                molecules and to the corresponding reduction in the rate of multiplication compared
                to the self-replication system.</p>
      <p>Second, however, there is a converse effect: the division of labor between the
                template and the catalyst, which emerges in the transcription system, releases the
                system from a trade-off that exists in the self-replication system. Because
                replication is not an instantaneous process, a catalyst spends a part of its
                lifetime replicating other molecules, and during these times, the catalyst itself
                cannot be replicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi2">[24]</xref>. In the self-replication system (the RNA-only cycle),
                catalysts also serve as templates to be replicated; therefore, the system is
                hampered by the trade-off between the RNA molecules spending time as templates and
                as catalysts (the trade-off between template and catalyst for short). This trade-off
                gives a substantial advantage to a parasite, which spends all of its lifetime being
                a template <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi1">[22]</xref>.
                By contrast, the transcription system is free of such a trade-off: the catalysts
                (RNA) are produced by transcription of the DNA and so do not have to spend any time
                being templates in order to complete the replication cycle. In the reverse
                transcription system, however, the catalysts (RNA) also serve as templates in order
                to produce DNA via reverse transcription. Hence, the reverse transcription system
                does not establish the division of labor between the template and the catalyst (but,
                similarly to the transcription system, it suffers from the reduction in the rate of
                multiplication due to the increased complexity of the replication cycle).</p>
      <p>In the following section, we use the described models to examine whether a replicator
                system, starting from the simple self-replication (RNA-only cycle), can evolve DNA
                molecules and the ensuing division of labor between the template and the
                catalyst.</p>

A
                        simulation was first run with the mutation from Rp to Dp disabled. In this
                        simulation, the system contained a large number of parasites, and the
                        spatial distribution of catalysts and parasites formed traveling wave
                        patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).
                        The front of a wave consists of Rp<sup>RNA</sup>, and it expands into an
                        empty region as the population of Rp<sup>RNA</sup> grows. The back of a wave
                        consists of parasites, and it contracts, leaving empty regions, in the
                        direction of wave propagation due to the extinction caused by parasites

                        system). After the equilibrium was reached, the mutation from Rp to Dp was
                        enabled. The system then displayed the following evolutionary dynamics.
                        Given that the distribution of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of Rp was

                        quickly evolved towards specialization on DNA replication, i.e., increasing
                        the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and decreasing

                        mutation of Rp evolved into a DNA replicase. Upon the invasion of Dp, the
                        population of Rp diverged into two populations that have markedly different

                        replicase) recognized almost only RNA templates (low
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values). Subsequently, the dual specificity Rp
                        evolved towards recognizing only DNA templates by reducing the value of

                        systems, namely, the self-replication system (with the RNA replicase as the

          <title>Parasites enable the transcription system to coexist with the

          <p>Given that every replicator competes for the same resource
                                (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), how can the two replicator systems coexist? To
                        elucidate the mechanism of the coexistence, we ran the following simulation
                            (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t001">Table 1</xref>, No. 2).
                        A system was initialized with a homogeneous population of an idealized, pure
                        transcription system (the values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were set to 0 and 1, respectively, for both Rp and
                        Dp). Mutations were disabled except for those converting catalysts into
                        parasites. In this simulation, the transcription system displayed a distinct
                        spatial pattern with numerous “clumps”, which mainly consisted
                        of Dp<sup>DNA</sup>, and slowly grew, split and occasionally shrank and
                        disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g003">Figure 3</xref>).
                        The system contained relatively large empty regions
                                (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) between the clumps (this was the case even when
                        parasites were absent as becomes obvious from the inspection of the spatial
                        distribution of parasites in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This result indicates that the multiplication of the
                        transcription system is inefficient, which appears to originate from the
                        increased complexity of replication cycle through the inclusion of DNA (as
                        described in the previous section) and from the finiteness of diffusion (see
                            <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002024.s001">Text
                            S1</xref>, Note 2, for details). Moreover, the transcription system
                        contained a far smaller number of parasites compared to the self-replication
                        system (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g002">Figure 2A</xref>);
                        if the influx of parasites through mutation was eliminated, the parasite
                        soon went extinct under the parameters of this simulation. This indicates
                        that the transcription system is resistant against parasites. This can be
                        explained as follows. In the transcription system, the division of labor
                        between templates and catalysts is established, so that the templates
                            (Rp<sup>DNA</sup> and Dp<sup>DNA</sup>) do not spend any part of their
                        lifetimes replicating others, which reduces the advantage of the parasite
                        over the catalyst (the parasite still has some advantage given that

              <p>The surface model was initialized such that the system consisted of
                                the transcription system (see below for the parameter values). No

                                size of CA was 512×512 squares; the other parameters were the
                                same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g002">Figure

          </fig>
          <p>Given the above properties of the transcription system, its coexistence with
                        the self-replication system can be rationalized as follows. First of all,
                        the transcription system is more resistant to parasites. In particular, the
                        parasites that exploit the self-replication system are all RNA templates, so
                        they cannot exploit the transcription system (which replicates DNA
                        templates). Hence, when a traveling wave consisting of Rp<sup>RNA</sup> and
                        the parasite hits a clump consisting of the transcription system, the clump
                        can remain intact whereas the traveling wave is annihilated because the
                        expansion of the wave front is impeded by the lack of resource
                                (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in the regions that are already occupied by the
                        transcription system. However, the transcription system produces large empty
                        regions in the system due to its inefficiency of multiplication. In
                        contrast, the self-replication system can multiply faster, so the traveling
                        waves can propagate into those empty regions before the transcription system
                        expands into those regions. In this way, the self-replication system can
                        thrive along with the transcription system. This mechanism of coexistence is
                        similar to that suggested for grassland ecosystems by Tilman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Tilman1">[39]</xref>,
                        wherein a faster reproducing species was able to thrive along with a slower
                        reproducing species. The latter was able to outcompete the faster growing
                        species locally due to K-selection—in the present models, this is due
                        to differential resistance against parasites—but which always left
                        some area in the system unoccupied due to its slower growth and the
                        occasional local extinction.</p>
          <p>The above explanation implies that parasites are one of the key factors
                        behind the coexistence of the self-replication and transcription systems. To
                        examine whether this is indeed the case, we conducted the following
                        simulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t001">Table 1</xref>,
                        No. 3). A system was initialized with populations of the idealized, pure
                        self-replication system (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were set to 0.4 and 0, respectively) and the
                        idealized, pure transcription system (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were set to 0 and 1, respectively). We compared the
                        dynamics of the system between the cases with and without parasites, with
                        all types of mutations disabled. In this experiment, the absence of
                        parasites caused the extinction of the transcriptase, in support of the
                        hypothesis that parasites are essential for the coexistence of the two
                        replicator systems. The DNA replicase did not go extinct in the absence of
                        parasites because Dp<sup>RNA</sup> can parasitize on the self-replication
                        system given that its <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value is 0 as
                        is the case for parasites by definition. Thus, the short-term,
                        “ecological” stability of the transcription system in the
                        presence of the self-replication system is mediated by the parasites that
                        exploit the self-replication system (“ecological” pertains to
                        the absence of mutation processes; below we discuss the long-term,
                        “evolutionary” stability).</p>

                        turns out to be negative. To address this question, we continued the
                        previous simulation, in which the self-replication system and the
                        transcription system coexisted, by removing the entire population of the
                        self-replication system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t001">Table 1</xref>, No. 4). The result was that the transcriptase evolved
                        towards improved recognition of RNA templates, thus
                        “re-inventing” RNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g004">Figure 4ABC</xref>). After the transcriptase
                        evolved into a dual specificity Rp, a subset of its population evolved to
                        reduce its transcription activity (decreased value of
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), becoming an RNA replicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g004">Figure 4CDE</xref>). After the RNA replicase
                        evolved, the remaining dual specificity Rp evolved into a transcriptase.
                        Thus, the system eventually returned to the original state through
                        re-evolving the self-replication system. To summarize the results of this
                        simulation, the self-replication system is required for the stable
                        evolutionary maintenance of the transcription system: when the
                        self-replication system is eliminated, the transcription system evolves the
                        self-replication system via the evolution of a dual specificity Rp from the
                        transcriptase, which results in the stabilization of the transcription
                        system.</p>

          <p>How and why does the presence of the RNA replicase cause the evolutionary
                        stabilization of the transcriptase? The RNA replicase has two distinct
                        effects on the transcription system:</p>
          <list list-type="order">
            <list-item>
              <p>The catalysts of the transcription system (transcriptase
                                    Rp<sup>RNA</sup> and DNA replicase Dp<sup>RNA</sup>) are
                                directly replicated by the RNA replicase;</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>If the transcriptase evolves into a dual specificity Rp, it will
                                replicate the RNA replicase Rp<sup>RNA</sup>.</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>To determine which of these two effects causes the evolutionary stabilization
                        of the transcriptase, we modified the model such that interactions between
                        the RNA replicase and the transcriptase were prohibited. The following three
                        cases were investigated: 1) The RNA replicase does not recognize the
                        transcriptase as a template; 2) the transcriptase does not recognize the RNA
                        replicase as a template (both RNA and DNA given that it can evolve into a
                        dual specificity Rp); 3) the RNA replicase and the transcriptase do not
                        recognize each other (a combination of 1 and 2). For each of these three
                        cases, we continued the previous simulation that had reached the
                        evolutionary equilibrium. The results showed that the evolutionary
                        stabilization of the transcriptase was obtained only in case 1. In this
                        case, the modification did not qualitatively change the behavior of the
                        system although the transcriptase went extinct after a long time due to
                        fluctuation. In case 2, the transcriptase evolved into a dual specificity
                        Rp, which out-competed the original RNA replicase, and which then underwent
                        speciation into the RNA replicase and the transcriptase, re-establishing the
                        original system as we saw before (note that the model allowed interactions
                        between the descendants of the original transcriptase). In case 3, the
                        transcriptase evolved into a dual specificity Rp, which went extinct after
                        its value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> exceeded that
                        of the RNA replicase. Therefore, the evolution of the transcriptase into a
                        dual specificity Rp is prevented because a dual specificity Rp replicates
                        the RNA replicase Rp<sup>RNA</sup>. This duality makes the dual specificity
                        Rp selectively inferior to the transcriptase which does not waste time and
                        resource (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) on replicating RNA replicase Rp<sup>RNA</sup>. (See

          <title>The transcription system induces the evolution of parasites</title>
          <p>As shown above, parasites mediate the coexistence between the
                        self-replication system and the transcription system. Does this mean that
                        the evolution of Dp was caused by parasites? To analyze the cause and effect
                        relationship between the parasite and the evolution of the transcription
                        system, the model was modified to exclude parasites that are explicitly
                        defined as a class of non-catalytic replicators with an advantage
                                (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for the recognition by catalysts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t001">Table 1</xref>, No. 6). In this
                        model, the difference between catalysts and parasites is continuous as it is
                        determined by the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and

                        between catalysts and parasites: the catalysts that recognize templates less
                        well are “more parasitic” than those that recognize templates
                        better. As before, the simulation was first run until it reached equilibrium
                        with the mutation converting Rp into Dp disabled. In this simulation, the
                        system did not develop a traveling wave pattern; instead, it exhibited
                        continuous production and refilling of small empty spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, the
                        RNA replication activity of the Rp (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was
                        distributed around a single peak; hence, there was no sharp boundary between
                        catalysts and parasites. The RNA replication activity was significantly
                        lower than that which evolved when the system contained parasites as can be
                        seen from the comparison of the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g005">Figure 5A</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002024.s001">Text

          <p>We then enabled the mutation converting Rp into Dp. The resulting system
                        displayed the following evolutionary dynamics. Dp quickly invaded the

                        population of Rp that had higher transcription activity (greater values of
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) out-competed the population of Rp that had lower
                        transcription activity (smaller values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (compare

                        contrast to the model containing explicitly defined parasites, in which the
                        population of Rp underwent speciation with respect to the distribution of

                        evolution of the DNA replicase, the remaining population of Rp evolved
                        towards increasing RNA replication activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). After Rp increased the RNA
                        replication activity sufficiently (i.e., it evolved into a dual specificity
                        Rp), a subpopulation of it started to evolve towards decreasing
                        transcription activity, becoming an RNA replicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g005">Figure 5DEF</xref>). After the RNA replicase
                        evolved, the remaining dual specificity Rp evolved towards decreasing RNA
                        replication activity, becoming a transcriptase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g005">Figure 5FGH</xref>). Interestingly, the
                        population of the evolved RNA replicase displayed a broad distribution of

                        markedly different distributions of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Among these
                        two populations, one population had the values of

                        (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and
                            <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). This
                        population, therefore, resembles the RNA replicase that evolved in the model
                        that included explicitly defined parasites (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). By contrast, the other
                        population of the RNA replicase had the values of
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that were lower than the value of

                        simulation, and it turned out that these values were too small for Rp to
                        survive through self-replication. Thus, this population effectively
                        consisted of parasites. It is most likely that these parasites mediated the
                        coexistence between the RNA replicase and the transcription system.</p>
          <p>To summarize, even though this model did not include explicitly predefined
                        parasites as a separate class of molecules and thus did not allow the
                        emergence of parasites with an advantage (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in the
                        recognition by catalysts, the system evolved a DNA replicase and a dual
                        specificity Rp, which then caused the evolution of an effectively parasitic
                        species. Consequently, the system reached an equilibrium state that was
                        essentially identical to the equilibrium state of the model with explicitly
                        predefined parasites. This result demonstrates the robustness of the
                        equilibrium state observed in the original model. Moreover, it elucidates
                        the cause and effect relationship between the evolution of the transcription
                        system and the evolution of parasites. On the one hand, the parasites
                        provide for the evolution of the transcription system by mediating the
                        coexistence with the self-replication system. On the other hand, the
                        transcription system also allows the evolution of the parasites when the
                        model does not include explicitly predefined parasites, by causing the
                        subdivision of the population of the RNA replicase (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">discussion</xref> in the next section).</p>

          <title>Interpretation of the surface model results</title>
          <p>The results described above show that the transcription system can evolve in
                        the surface model because the division of labor between the template and the
                        catalyst, which is made possible by the inclusion of DNA molecules in the
                        replication cycle, increases the resistance of the transcription system
                        against parasites compared to the self-replication system.</p>
          <p>In addition to this main conclusion, the above results also revealed two
                        general points worthy of note. First, there are two distinct regimes in the
                        stabilization of a certain species by another species, namely, ecological
                        (short-term) stabilization and evolutionary (long-term) stabilization. The
                        results showed that, on the one hand, parasites enabled the transcription
                        system to coexist with the self-replication system. In theoretical ecology,
                        this is known as predator-mediated coexistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Caswell1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Cramer1">[41]</xref>. In this regime, the
                        mediation occurs on a short timescale at which each species does not change
                        its character through evolution, hence ecological stabilization. On the
                        other hand, the RNA replicase generated a selection pressure for the
                        transcriptase not to evolve into a dual specificity RNA polymerase. In this
                        regime, a species exerts a selection pressure on the other species so as to
                        maintain its identity on a long timescale at which the other species would
                        have the potential to evolve new features if the stabilizing species was
                        absent, hence evolutionary stabilization.</p>
          <p>Second, exploration of the model showed that removing any of the three
                        components of the system, namely, the self-replication system, the
                        transcription system and the parasite, at the evolutionary steady state
                        resulted in the restoration of the deleted component through the evolution
                        of the remaining components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g006">Figure 6BCD</xref>). Moreover, there was a mutual dependence among the
                        three components with respect to the ecological or evolutionary stability
                            (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g006">Figure 6A</xref>); e.g.,
                        the parasite enabled the evolution of the transcription system through
                        mediating its coexistence with the self-replication system, whereas the
                        transcription system enabled the evolution of the RNA replicase into a
                        parasite-like species. Thus, the causal relationship among the evolutionary
                        fates of the components—i.e. which species causes the evolution of
                        which species—does not form a linear chain, but rather a cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This
                        circularity is in a sharp contrast with the linear structure of the
                        evolutionary history of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g006">Figure 6BCD</xref>). Therefore, the analysis of
                        an evolutionary trajectory (history) from a single initial condition may not
                        fully elucidate the cause and effect relationships among the evolutionary
                        fates of the species.</p>

          <title>The flow of information</title>
          <p>Given the evolution of the transcription system, it is interesting to
                        consider the separation between template and catalyst in terms of the flows
                        of genetic information. In particular, is the line of descent continued
                        through the replication of DNA in the transcription system? To address this
                        question, we conducted the following experiment. The previous simulation
                            (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t001">Table 1</xref>, No. 1)
                        was continued after having reached evolutionary equilibrium with the
                        mutation converting Rp into Dp disabled. At the beginning of the simulation,
                        each individual replicator was labeled according to whether it was RNA or
                        DNA. A new individual inherited this label from the template from which it
                        was produced regardless of whether the new individual was RNA or DNA. The
                        simulation was run until the entire populations of the RNA replicase,
                        transcriptase and DNA replicase each descended from either RNA molecules or
                        DNA molecules (not necessarily from one molecule). Then, each molecule was
                        re-labeled, and the simulation was continued: this cycle was repeated 200
                        times. The result showed that the entire population of the transcriptase was
                        descended from DNA templates of the transcriptase in more than 98% of
                        the simulations. Given that the mean fraction of DNA molecules in the
                        population of the transcriptase was 65%, the origin of this line of
                        descent was significantly biased towards DNA. Likewise, the entire
                        population of the DNA replicase was descended from DNA templates of the DNA
                        replicase in 100% of the simulations whereas the mean fraction of DNA
                        was 78%. These results show that, in the transcription system, the
                        flow of genetic information is unidirectional from DNA to RNA. Therefore,
                        the transcription system established the separation between the template and
                        the catalyst in terms of the flows of genetic information across
                        generations. By contrast, the entire population of the RNA replicases
                        descended from RNA templates in less than 92% of the simulations.
                        Given that the fraction of RNA among the RNA replicases was 95.5%
                        averaged over time, this line of descent was not significantly biased
                        towards RNA templates.</p>
          <p>The Central Dogma of molecular biology states that the flow of genetic
                        information is unidirectional from nucleic acids to proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Crick2">[42]</xref>. In the
                        strict chemical sense, the Dogma is unrelated to the unidirectional flow of
                        information exhibited by the transcription system in the present model.
                        However, the Dogma may be recast in generalized terms, to assert that the
                        flow of genetic information is unidirectional from templates to catalysts.
                        Under this extended interpretation, there seems to be an analogy between the
                        Central Dogma and the unidirectional flow of information from templates
                        (DNA) to catalysts (RNA) exhibited by the transcription system in the
                        present model.</p>

          <p>After the system reached equilibrium, the mutation converting Rp into Dp was
                        enabled. As a result, the Dp with a high activity in DNA replication (a high
                        value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) quickly invaded the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). However, this Dp did not
                        immediately evolve into a DNA replicase, maintaining a moderate reverse
                        transcriptase activity. After the invasion of Dp, the Rp evolved a high
                        transcription activity and a slightly increased RNA replication activity
                            (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The
                        system remained in this state for a long period of time. The existence of Dp
                        at this stage required a continual influx of Dp through mutations because Dp
                        went extinct if the mutation converting Rp into Dp was disabled after the
                        invasion of Dp. Later on, in a subpopulation of compartments, Dp evolved
                        towards decreasing reverse transcription activity (i.e. decreasing the value
                        of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Concomitantly, Rp in the same compartments evolved
                        towards increasing RNA replication activity (i.e. increasing the value of
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). As a result, compartments containing a replicator
                        system which consists of a DNA replicase and a dual specificity RNA
                        polymerase appeared in the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). This replicator system is
                        henceforth referred to as the transcription-like system. The compartments
                        containing the transcription-like system quickly out-competed the other
                        compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g007">Figure
                        7E</xref>). After the transcription-like system was established, the model
                        displayed the invasion of compartments that contained only Rp<sup>RNA</sup>,
                        which arose through the chance loss of Dp in compartments containing the
                        transcription-like system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). The compartments containing only Rp<sup>RNA</sup>
                        quickly increased its population size, locally out-competing the
                        compartments containing the transcription-like system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). However, the compartments
                        containing only Rp<sup>RNA</sup> displayed the rapid evolution of their
                        internal replicator system, whereby the Rp evolved towards reducing RNA
                        replication activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g008">Figure
                            8C</xref>). Consequently, the compartments containing only
                            Rp<sup>RNA</sup> were eventually out-competed by those containing the
                        transcription-like system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). This cycle of invasion and extinction was observed
                        repeatedly. The next section describes why the system displays this complex

          <p>To elucidate the causes of the results described above, the simulation was

The
                        result showed that compartments containing only Rp<sup>RNA</sup> appeared
                        and quickly out-competed compartments containing the transcription-like
                        system. The same result was obtained when the mutation rate was reduced by
                        an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t002">Table
                            2</xref>, No. 3).</p>
          <p>The above two results, the repeated cycle of invasion and extinction of
                        compartments containing only Rp<sup>RNA</sup> and the extinction of
                        compartments containing the transcription-like system under sufficiently
                        reduced mutation pressure, have two implications. Firstly, compartments
                        increase their fitness by losing the DNA replicase (i.e., when
                            Rp<sup>RNA</sup> remains the only catalyst in a compartment). Secondly,
                        however, compartments containing only Rp<sup>RNA</sup> experience faster
                        evolutionary deterioration of the internal replicator system than
                        compartments containing the transcription-like system, an effect that
                        confers a selective advantage onto the compartments containing the
                        transcription-like system under sufficiently strong mutation pressure.</p>
          <p>To investigate the first effect, we directly measured the fitness of
                        compartments as follows. The model was modified to make the boundaries of
                        the compartments completely unchangeable so the model contained compartments
                        but no compartment dynamics. The model was initialized in a configuration
                        where the size of the compartments was equal to the threshold above which
                        compartments divide in the original model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Two
                        simulations were conducted. In the first simulation, compartments were
                        filled with a population of Rp<sup>RNA</sup>, Rp<sup>DNA</sup>,
                            Dp<sup>RNA</sup> and Dp<sup>DNA</sup> in equal proportion. The values of
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were set such
                        that the transcription-like system was established
                                (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Rp;
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for
                        Dp—these values were obtained from the system depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). In the second
                        simulation, compartments were filled with a population of Rp<sup>RNA</sup>
                        alone (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were the same
                        as before). The simulations were run with all mutations disabled (all the
                        other parameters were the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We then measured the rate at
                        which the compartments lost all internal replicators (i.e. the death rate of
                        compartments) and the density of the replicators in the surviving
                        compartments (directly related to the growth rate of compartments). The
                        result was that the compartments indeed increased fitness by losing the DNA
                        replicase (for the compartments containing the transcription-like system,
                        the death rate was <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the
                        average density of internal replicators was 0.81; for the compartments
                        containing only Rp<sup>RNA</sup>, the death rate was 0 within the timescale
                        of measurement, and the average density of internal replicators was 0.94).
                        This result is understandable because, as discussed above, the inclusion of
                        DNA in a replication cycle leads to a fourfold increase in the number of the
                        types of molecules required for multiplication and so reduces the efficiency
                        of multiplication and increases the chance of stochastic loss of essential
                        molecules. Therefore, compartments increase their fitness by losing the DNA
                        replicase.</p>
          <p>To assess the second effect, we compared the evolutionary deterioration rates
                        between the self-replication system and the transcription-like system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t004">Table 4</xref>, No. 1 and 2).
                        To simplify the comparison, we considered a large, well-mixed replicator
                        system. The greater size of the replicator system reduced the effect of
                        random drift in the population dynamics of replicators and so allowed us to
                        focus on the deterministic aspect of the evolutionary deterioration process
                        over a sufficiently long time (note that selection pressure is a
                        deterministic factor). To this end, we modified the model such that
                        interactions between molecules occur globally (i.e. interactions can occur
                        independent of the locations of molecules) so that the system was
                        effectively well-mixed. Again, two simulations were conducted. In one
                        simulation, the system was initialized with a population of
                        Rp<sup>RNA</sup>, Rp<sup>DNA</sup>, Dp<sup>RNA</sup> and Dp<sup>DNA</sup> in
                        equal proportion. The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were set such that the replicator system was the
                        idealized, pure transcription-like system (to be precise,

                        the other simulation, the system was initialized with a population of
                            Rp<sup>RNA</sup> alone (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and

          <p>The result was that the system consisting only of Rp<sup>RNA</sup> rapidly
                        deteriorated, with the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> quickly
                        decreasing, and eventually went extinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). The
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of Rp<sup>RNA</sup> underwent neutral evolution
                        because of the absence of DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). This rapid deterioration of
                        the replication activity is expected because it is selectively
                        disadvantageous to be a catalyst in a well-mixed self-replication system
                        with complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi1">[22]</xref>. In contrast, the transcription-like system
                        displayed evolutionary deterioration that was qualitatively
                        indistinguishable from neutral evolution (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g009">Figure 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Although the
                        transcription-like system also went extinct eventually, this took much
                        longer time than for the self-replication system (time≈10<sup>5</sup>).
                        This qualitative difference in the rates of evolutionary deterioration of
                        catalysts supports the argument that compartments containing the
                        transcription-like system experience slower evolutionary deterioration of
                        the internal replicator system (the origin of this difference will be
                        elucidated in the next section).</p>

          <p>If the advantage of compartments containing the transcription-like system
                        lies in the slower evolutionary deterioration of internal replicator
                        systems, it is expected that altering the severity of evolutionary
                        deterioration would modulate the evolvability of the transcription-like
                        system. Decreasing the mutation rate of replicators, obviously, delays
                        evolutionary deterioration. Thus, if the mutation rate is sufficiently
                        reduced, the advantage of the transcription-like system must be so
                        insignificant that compartments containing the transcription-like system are
                        unable to out-compete those containing only Rp<sup>RNA</sup>. In fact, this
                        has already been seen in one of the simulations described above (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t002">Table 2</xref>, No. 3).
                        Moreover, the severity of evolutionary deterioration also depends on the
                        population size of the internal replicator system (i.e. the size of
                        compartments, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) because the
                        population size determines the level of random drift in the evolutionary
                        dynamics, which disturbs the deterministic force of selection and,
                        consequently, generates greater variation among the compartments, on which
                        the compartment-level selection operates. Thus, if the size of compartments
                        is smaller, the evolutionary deterioration of the internal replicator system
                        should be slower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi3">[35]</xref>. Therefore, it is expected that, if the size of
                        compartments is sufficiently small, compartments containing the
                        transcription-like system are unable to out-compete those containing only
                            Rp<sup>RNA</sup>. These expectations were indeed confirmed by additional
                        simulations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002024.s001">Text S1</xref>, Note 6, for details).</p>
          <p>To summarize, the transcription-like system can confer both advantage and
                        disadvantage to a compartmentalized replicator system compared to the
                        self-replication system: it impedes the evolutionary deterioration of the
                        internal replicator system but hampers the efficiency of multiplication of
                        that system. The disadvantage due to the reduced efficiency of
                        multiplication is significant regardless of the parameter values because it
                        is a necessary consequence of an increase in the complexity of replication
                        cycle brought about by the inclusion of DNA. In contrast, the advantage due
                        to the slower evolutionary deterioration depends on how fast the
                        evolutionary deterioration proceeds if compartments contain the
                        self-replication system, which, in turn, depends on the mutation rate of
                        individual replicators and the size of compartments (or more precisely, the
                        population size of the internal replicator system). If the rate of the
                        evolutionary deterioration of compartments containing the self-replication
                        system is sufficiently high, the advantage of the transcription-like system
                        more than compensates for the disadvantage, and the evolution of the
                        transcription-like system becomes possible.</p>

          <title>The presence of transcription and the absence of reverse transcription
                        prevents the evolutionary deterioration of catalysts in the internal
                        replicator system</title>
          <p>We next consider the reason why, in the compartment model, the
                        transcription-like system displays slower evolutionary deterioration than
                        the self-replication system. As already mentioned, in the self-replication
                        system, catalysts gain a selective advantage by decreasing the time they
                        spend replicating templates (i.e. by decreasing the value of
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) because of
                        the trade-off between templates and catalysts. By contrast, in the
                        transcription system, the catalysts do not function as templates, so there
                        is no selective advantage for catalysts to reduce the time spent on
                        replicating templates. However, in the transcription-like system, Rp
                        maintains a high RNA replication activity, which raises the question whether
                        this impairs the release from the trade-off.</p>
          <p>To address this question, we consider an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
                        which simulates the population dynamics of the internal replicator system of
                        compartments in the compartment model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t003">Table 3</xref>). Although the ODE model does not
                        fully reflect the evolutionary dynamics of the internal replicator system,
                        it captures the deterministic aspect of the dynamics under idealized
                        conditions where random drift and mutations play no role. This
                        simplification makes it easier to investigate the deterministic stability of
                        replicator systems. The first ODE model we constructed described the
                        population dynamics of one species of RNA polymerase and one species of DNA
                        polymerase (see the equation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002024.s001">Text S1</xref>). The strategy of the analysis
                        was to use the idealized transcription system (i.e.
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for both Rp

                        neither too large nor too small (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t003">Table 3</xref>, No. 1). In the transcription
                        system, there is symmetry between Rp and Dp because of the assumption that
                        catalysts do not discriminate between different templates of the same
                        molecular type. Because of this symmetry, the steady state ratio of
                            Rp<sup>DNA</sup> to Dp<sup>DNA</sup> and that of Rp<sup>RNA</sup> to
                            Dp<sup>RNA</sup> are determined by the initial ratio of Rp<sup>DNA</sup>
                        to Dp<sup>DNA</sup> (i.e., there is structural instability in the
                        system).</p>
          <p>We next considered the effect of adding either RNA replication or reverse
                        transcription to the transcription system. Before describing the results, it
                        is worth noting that adding either of these processes introduces asymmetry
                        into the system. For instance, adding RNA replication makes Rp<sup>RNA</sup>
                        play both the role of catalysts and templates <italic>for RNA
                            replication</italic>, whereas Dp<sup>RNA</sup> plays only the role of
                        templates. Of course, Dp<sup>RNA</sup> also plays the role of catalysts for
                        DNA replication, but so does Rp<sup>RNA</sup> for transcription—there
                        is no asymmetry between Dp and Rp with respect to reactions involving DNA
                        molecules. Due to the above asymmetry, Dp<sup>RNA</sup> will be replicated
                        by Rp<sup>RNA</sup> more often (per molecule) than Rp<sup>RNA</sup> is
                        replicated by Rp<sup>RNA</sup> assuming that the initial condition is
                        symmetric with respect to Dp and Rp. This can be seen from the fact that
                        three times more Rp<sup>RNA</sup> is required than Dp<sup>RNA</sup> in order
                        to produce an equal amount of the two complex molecules (i.e. that between
                            Rp<sup>RNA</sup> and Rp<sup>RNA</sup> and that between Rp<sup>RNA</sup>
                        and Dp<sup>RNA</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi1">[22]</xref>. It is easily seen that adding reverse
                        transcription likewise introduces asymmetry into the transcription
                        system.</p>
          <p>The results of the numerical calculation indicated that adding RNA
                        replication did not adversely affect the survival of the system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t003">Table 3</xref>, No. 2). In
                        contrast, adding reverse transcription led to the extinction of the system
                        (this was the case even when the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was very
                        small, e.g. 0.01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t003">Table
                            3</xref>, No. 3). To determine the origin of this difference, we
                        searched for a factor(s) that dampened the asymmetry generated by RNA
                        replication and a factor(s) that amplified the asymmetry generated by
                        reverse transcription. Let us first consider the case of reverse
                        transcription. If there is no reverse transcription, the initial condition
                        determines the ratio of Rp<sup>DNA</sup> to Dp<sup>DNA</sup> which itself
                        determines the ratio of Rp<sup>RNA</sup> to Dp<sup>RNA</sup>. Let us suppose
                        that the system is initially symmetrical between Rp and Dp. Now, by adding
                        reverse transcription, Rp<sup>DNA</sup> is produced at a slightly higher
                        rate than Dp<sup>DNA</sup> due to the aforementioned asymmetry in reverse
                        transcription, so that the ratio of Rp<sup>RNA</sup> to Dp<sup>RNA</sup>
                        increases through transcription, which, in turn, leads to the further
                        increase of the Rp<sup>DNA</sup> to Dp<sup>DNA</sup> ratio, hence an
                        amplifying factor. Next, for the case of RNA replication, assuming a
                        symmetric initial condition again, adding RNA replication slightly increases
                        the ratio of Dp<sup>RNA</sup> to Rp<sup>RNA</sup>. However, the change of
                        the Dp<sup>RNA</sup> to Rp<sup>RNA</sup> ratio has no effect on the
                            Dp<sup>DNA</sup> to Rp<sup>DNA</sup> ratio because there is no reverse
                        transcription. Thus, transcription tends to bring the Dp<sup>RNA</sup> to
                            Rp<sup>RNA</sup> ratio back to the Dp<sup>DNA</sup> to Rp<sup>DNA</sup>
                        ratio, hence a dampening factor. To summarize, provided the absence of
                        reverse transcription, the transcription of DNA molecules tends to bring the
                        population composition of RNA molecules towards that of DNA molecules and so
                        dampens the bias in the population composition of RNA molecules generated by
                        the asymmetry in RNA replication. In other words, the population of DNA
                        molecules serves as a buffer to the population of RNA molecules.</p>
          <p>The above argument implies that in the absence of reverse transcription,
                        transcription prevents the evolutionary deterioration of catalysts because
                        the selective advantage a catalyst would obtain by increasing the time it
                        spends being a template is effective only in the RNA population, and such a
                        selective advantage would be counteracted by the transcription of DNA
                        molecules. To examine whether this is indeed the case, we extended the ODE
                        model to include the population of an additional species of Rp, which we
                        refer to as Rp′. The strategy of the analysis was to treat Rp′
                        as a mutant of Rp and examine whether Rp′ could out-compete the
                        original Rp when the small amount of Rp′ was introduced into the
                        system, which mimicked the mutation of Rp into Rp′. The value of
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were set to
                        yield the idealized transcription-like system
                                (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Rp, and
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Dp). The
                        system was initialized such that it was symmetrical with respect to Rp and
                        Dp, and the population size of Rp′ (both RNA and DNA) was set to 0.
                        After the system reached equilibrium, the population size of Rp′ (both
                        RNA and DNA) was increased by a small amount (0.001), and the system was
                        allowed to reach a new equilibrium. The result showed that even if Rp′
                        completely lost its catalytic activity (i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), Rp′ was unable to out-compete Rp (the
                        population size of Rp′ remained small; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t003">Table 3</xref>, No. 4). Thus, in the absence of
                        reverse transcription, transcription impedes the evolutionary deterioration
                        of catalysts.</p>
          <p>The above argument shows that the release of catalysts from the
                        template-catalyst trade-off depends not only on the presence of
                        transcription but also on the absence of reverse transcription, i.e.
                        blockage in the flow of information from catalysts (RNA) to templates (DNA).
                        To investigate this issue, we conducted a simulation of the type shown in
                            <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g009">Figure 9</xref>, i.e. the
                        examination of evolutionary deterioration process in a large, well-mixed
                        replicator system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t004">Table
                            4</xref>, No. 3). The system was again initialized with the
                        transcription-like system; however, this time, reverse transcription
                        activity was added to the system (i.e. the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of Dp was set
                        to 1). The result of this simulation showed that addition of reverse
                        transcriptase greatly accelerates the evolutionary deterioration of
                        catalysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g009">Figure

          <p>As shown above, breakage in the flow of information from RNA to DNA
                        (elimination of reverse transcription) is an important factor underlying the
                        advantage of the transcription-like system in a compartmentalized replicator
                        system. However, although reverse transcription activity was much reduced in
                        the transcription-like system, it was not completely absent due to the
                        mutation pressure. Moreover, the transcription-like system maintained a high
                        rate of RNA replication (Rp was dual specific). Therefore we were interested
                        to find out in which direction the information was transmitted among
                        replicators in the long run: from RNA to DNA, or from DNA to RNA, or both?
                        To address this question, we conducted the same simulation as for the
                        surface model in order to trace the line of descent over generations. This
                        simulation showed that the population of the dual specificity Rp was always
                        descended from its DNA templates (i.e. Rp<sup>DNA</sup>). Therefore, from
                        the actual flows of genetic information, the division of labor between the
                        template and the catalyst was established for the dual specificity Rp
                        despite the fact that it maintained a high RNA replicase activity. However,
                        the situation differed for the DNA replicase. The simulation showed that two
                        populations of compartments quickly arose in the system: in one of these
                        populations, the Dp was descended from Dp<sup>DNA</sup>, whereas in the
                        other population the Dp was descended from Dp<sup>RNA</sup>. Because of the
                        finiteness of the system, the entire population of Dp was eventually
                        descended either from Dp<sup>RNA</sup> or from Dp<sup>DNA</sup>, with the
                        choice determined by chance.</p>
          <p>To further examine the case of Dp, we completely removed reverse
                        transcription activity from the model (i.e. the value of
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Dp and its mutation rate were set to zero). The
                        simulation showed that Dp<sup>DNA</sup> was eventually lost from the system
                        whereas Dp<sup>RNA</sup> remained (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t002">Table 2</xref>, No. 2). This is possible because
                            Dp<sup>RNA</sup> can be amplified through RNA replication by the dual
                        specificity Rp. In the absence of Dp<sup>DNA</sup>, the equilibrium value of
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of Dp was slightly decreased (data not shown). This
                        seems to occur because Dp<sup>RNA</sup> was maintained through RNA
                        replication, so the trade-off between template and catalyst set in and
                        caused selection pressure on Dp<sup>RNA</sup> towards decreasing
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This interpretation was supported by a simulation
                        of the type shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g009">Figure
                            9</xref>, i.e. examination of evolutionary deterioration in a large,
                        well-mixed replicator system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t004">Table 4</xref>, No. 4). The system was initialized with the
                        transcription-like system without Dp<sup>DNA</sup>, and reverse
                        transcription activity was completely removed in the same way as above. This
                        simulation showed that Dp evolved towards decreasing DNA replication
                        activity much faster than did the transcription-like system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g009">Figure 9D</xref>; compare with
                            <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002024-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). This
                        result gives further support to the conclusion that DNA molecules can
                        prevent or at least slow down the evolutionary deterioration of catalysts.
                        Moreover, this simulation shows that the survival of Dp<sup>RNA</sup> does
                        not require the existence of Dp<sup>DNA</sup> (because of dual-specificity
                        Rp), which can explain why the line of descent for Dp was not always
                        continued through DNA replication in the original compartment model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t002">Table 2</xref>, No. 2). (See

        <p>The preceding sections argued that the evolution of DNA-like molecules is driven
                    by the ability of the division of labor between the template and the catalyst to
                    eliminate the advantage of parasites originating from the trade-off between
                    template and catalyst. To further test this argument, we removed the complex
                    formation from the models and instead assumed that the replication reaction is
                    an instantaneous process: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This is expected
                    to significantly reduce the effect of the trade-off (but see below). Examination
                    of the models without complex formation showed that Dp did not evolve under
                    various parameter combinations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t001">Table 1</xref>, No. 7; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002024-t002">Table
                        2</xref>, No. 5). This result is in accord with the above argument. However,
                    deviation from this outcome was observed under conditions that were not
                    considered in the original models. Specifically, in the surface model without
                    complex formation, if the decay rate of DNA was substantially lower than that of
                    RNA and if the diffusion rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was sufficiently
                    low, Dp could be evolutionarily maintained (i.e. Dp survived if the system
                    initially consisted of the transcription system and the self-replication system,
                    but it could not evolve if the system initially consisted of the
                    self-replication system only). In the compartment model without complex
                    formation, Dp evolved when the diffusion of molecules across compartment
                    boundaries was enabled and the system included an explicitly predefined
                    parasite. However, it has to be kept in mind that assuming instantaneous
                    replication does not completely remove the trade-off between template and
                    catalyst in RNA-like replicators because, if a catalyst replicates other
                    templates, this leads to local depletion of the resource under finite diffusion,
                    decreasing the chance of the catalyst itself being replicated. This
                    interpretation was supported by analysis of the compartment model in which the
                    complex formation was removed and compartment boundaries were immobilized. In
                    this model, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (diffusion), which
                    was the value used in the compartment models to achieve a relatively well-mixed
                    condition in the internal replicator system, the self-replication system evolved
                    towards decreasing RNA replication activity. Thus, assuming instantaneous
                    replication is not a perfect control experiment with respect to the trade-off
                    between template and catalyst. Nevertheless, the finding that Dp did not evolve
                    in the model without complex formation under the conditions considered in the
                    original models (i.e. no difference between DNA and RNA other than the
                    presence-absence of catalytic ability and no diffusion across compartment
                    boundaries) implies the importance of the trade-off enhancement by complex
                    formation for the evolution of DNA.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It has been customarily assumed that the evolution of DNA should be explained by some
                advantageous properties of DNA as template, e.g., the higher stability of DNA
                compared to RNA. However, the current study shows that, in RNA-like replicator
                systems, the lack of catalytic activity in DNA-like molecules in itself can give
                rise to a selection for the emergence and fixation of DNA molecules. In the surface
                model, DNA allowed the evolution of the division of labor between the template (DNA)
                and the catalyst (RNA), which mitigated the adverse effect of parasites arising from
                the trade-off between templates and catalysts. In the compartment model, DNA could
                cause the retardation of the evolutionary deterioration of the internal replicator
                system of compartments by eliminating the advantage of RNA molecules being
                non-catalytic, i.e. evolving into parasites, which originated from the
                aforementioned trade-off. This retardation required the presence of transcription
                and the absence of reverse transcription. In other words, the information must flow
                from DNA-like molecules (template) to RNA-like molecules (catalyst) but not vice
                versa. This unidirectionality of the information flow is also a form of division of
                labor between the template and the catalyst. Therefore, both models effectively
                yield the same conclusion: DNA can nullify the disadvantage of RNA functioning as a
                catalyst—and hence the advantage of parasites—through establishing the
                division of labor between the template (DNA) and the catalyst (RNA). This advantage
                can more than compensate for the disadvantage due to the reduced efficiency of
                multiplication caused by the increased complexity of the replication cycle.</p>
      <p>Although the transcription system avoids the trade-off between template and catalyst
                through establishing the division of labor between the template and the catalyst, it
                generates the trade-off between replication and transcription whereby a template
                (DNA) must spend a part of its lifetime being transcribed in order to produce
                catalysts (RNA), and during these times, the template cannot be replicated. The
                latter trade-off causes a selection pressure for templates to evolve towards
                decreasing the rate of transcription in exchange for increasing the rate of
                replication. In the present models, however, this selection pressure does not affect
                the evolution because the models do not allow templates to evolve their affinities
                towards Rp and Dp so as to differentiate between replication and transcription. To
                examine the effect of the replication-transcription trade-off on the evolution of
                DNA, we slightly modified the models to allow templates to distinguish between Rp
                and Dp (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002024.s001">Text
                    S1</xref> for details). The results showed that, although the effect of the
                trade-off between replication and transcription was non-negligible as the models
                exhibited the evolution of templates to reduce transcription, it was not large
                enough to qualitatively change the main results obtained with the original models.
                This result corresponds to a well-known fact from the group selection theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Wilson1">[43]</xref> that the
                condition required for the evolution of “weak altruism” (the action that
                is beneficial to the individual that performs it but gives greater benefits to the
                other individuals of the same “group”) is much less strict than the
                condition required for the evolution of “strong altruism” (the action
                that gives no benefit but a cost to the performer of the action). Thus, everything
                else being equal, the selection against strong altruism is stronger than the
                selection against weak altruism. Indeed, in the trade-off between template and
                catalyst, when a catalyst replicates templates, this gives no benefit to the
                catalyst itself and so corresponds to strong altruism. By contrast, in the trade-off
                between replication and transcription, when a template (DNA) is transcribed, this
                gives a benefit not only to the other templates but also to the template that is
                transcribed through the production of catalysts, hence weak altruism. Therefore, the
                suppression of the template-catalyst trade-off should more than compensate for the
                generation of the transcription-replication trade-off.</p>
      <p>Although the order of appearance of different types of biopolymers during primordial
                evolution is still debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Burton1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Freeland1">[45]</xref>, the universality of the translation machinery in all
                domains of life suggests that proteins most likely evolved in the RNA world before
                DNA (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Leipe1">[46]</xref>).
                If RNA molecules functioned predominantly as templates in the RNA-protein world, the
                division of labor between templates and catalysts was established before the
                emergence of DNA. The basic tenet of the present study, namely, that dedicated
                templates (DNA) can release catalysts (RNA) from the trade-off between template and
                catalyst through establishing the division of labor between templates and catalysts,
                seems to be also applicable to the evolution of proteins in the RNA world. Indeed,
                the relegation of the catalytic functions to proteins so that RNA molecules turn
                into dedicated templates might achieve an effect similar to the effect of the
                separation of functions between DNA (template) and RNA (catalyst) in the present
                models. In the RNA-protein world, the trade-off between RNA replication and RNA
                translation becomes relevant as the same RNA molecule is used both for replication
                and for translation. However, this trade-off implies weak altruism as opposed to the
                strong altruism implicit in the template-catalyst trade-off, so the separation of
                functions is likely to be beneficial for the replicator system (see above).</p>
      <p>The question arises whether there could be advantages associated with the emergence
                of DNA (irrespective of its chemical properties) in the RNA-protein world. In this
                case, DNA can release RNA from the trade-off between replication and translation so
                that RNA can be dedicated to translation. This effect might cause a substantial
                reduction in the selective advantage of parasitic templates because the suppression
                of RNA replication due to translation would be more severe than the suppression of
                DNA replication due to transcription assuming equal rates of protein production (the
                rate of DNA transcription can be smaller than that of RNA translation, so DNA
                transcription would impede DNA replication less than RNA translation impedes RNA
                replication). Moreover, if a high rate of protein production is selectively
                advantageous to the system, releasing RNA from the replication function and so
                allowing it to be dedicated to translation might be a substantial advantage to the
                system, causing strong selection pressure for the evolution of DNA.</p>
      <p>The present models assume that Dp can emerge from Rp through a one-step mutation.
                This simplification was made because the central question of the current study was
                whether there could be any selective advantage for an RNA-based evolving system to
                produce DNA-like molecules independent of specific nucleic acid chemistry. It
                appears that our main conclusion on the existence of such a selective advantage
                should be valid independent of specific assumptions on the mutation. To further
                assess the validity of this conclusion, we also investigated the models under two
                different assumptions on the effects of mutations. Under the first assumption, the
                distinction between Rp and Dp was continuous. Each replicase is assigned two
                parameters that determine the product specificity: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the rate constants of RNA and DNA production, respectively.
                The ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> assumed non-negative values with the constraint that
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and could be modified by mutations (in the original model,
                this ratio was either 0 or infinite). Under this assumption, DNA evolved in both the
                surface model and the compartment model. The population of catalysts consisted of
                only one species that catalyzed both RNA and DNA production. Moreover, the surface
                model displayed the evolution of both product and template specificity toward DNA:
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In contrast, the
                compartment model displayed only the evolution of template specificity toward
                        DNA—<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, probably because of
                the between-compartment selection that tends to increase the number of catalysts
                (RNA) within compartments. Under the second assumption on the mutation, a replicase
                was either Rp or Dp as in the original model, but there was a continuous range of
                catalytic capacity associated with each polymerase: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> assumed a value
                between 0 and 1 and could be modified by mutations. When Rp mutated into Dp (through
                a one-step mutation), the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was set to
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. When <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002024.e210" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the surface model
                showed qualitatively the same result as the original model, whereas the compartment
                model did not display the evolution of DNA—a result indicating the greater
                robustness of the results with the surface model. To summarize, these experiments
                with (partially) continuous mutation effect models revealed the evolution of DNA and
                so appear to validate our main conclusion on the intrinsic advantage of the
                template-catalyst separation.</p>
      <p>Kaneko and Yomo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Kaneko1">[47]</xref> proposed that molecules must be a minority to display
                hereditary properties in a protocell (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Kaneko1">[47]</xref>, for the exact meaning of
                “hereditary properties”). In their study, it is conceived that the
                hereditary molecule emerges not as a result of Darwinian evolution due to the
                selective advantage it confers to a protocell but as a physical consequence of
                factors that are not necessarily related to the hereditary properties (such as
                higher-order catalysis and kinetic asymmetry). By contrast, in the present
                compartment model, DNA evolved due to a selective advantage conferred to the
                respective protocells (compartments). Moreover, DNA molecules constituted
                30–40% of the total population of internal replicators and so were not
                a small minority.</p>
      <p>Zintzaras et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Zintzaras1">[48]</xref> investigated the consequence of the trade-off between
                catalytic activity and template affinity to RNA polymerase in ribozymes and proposed
                that the complete absence of competition between two species of ribozymes could lead
                to the evolutionary divergence where one species functions slightly more efficiently
                as a catalyst and the other functions more efficiently as a template. Despite the
                superficial similarity, this form of divergence crucially differs from the division
                of labor between template and catalyst discussed here. In the model of Zintzaras et
                al., the two species were <italic>not</italic> templates for each other, so both
                ribozymes must function as templates to transmit information to subsequent
                generations. In the present models, DNA allows RNA (ribozyme) to not function as
                template at all and releases it from the template-catalyst trade-off. In addition,
                the division of labor between template and catalyst evolved without assuming reduced
                competition between replicators.</p>
      <p>We previously noted an interesting difference between the concepts of genotype as
                applied to modern cells and protocells conceived as vesicle-like compartments
                containing replicators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi3">[35]</xref>. A common assumption is that the genotype of an
                individual is static on the timescale of an individual's lifetime. Although
                valid for modern cells, this assumption might be invalid for the protocell because
                the internal replicator system of a protocell—the population of which can be
                viewed as the genome—undergoes evolutionary deterioration over time comparable
                to the lifetime of a compartment due to the within-compartment selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002024-Takeuchi3">[35]</xref>. The current
                study has shown that the division of labor between template and catalyst can prevent
                such rapid evolutionary deterioration. The evolutionary stabilization of the
                internal replicator system caused by DNA can be considered a step toward the
                evolution of the modern-type, relatively stable genotype in protocells.</p>
