      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>The ability of mice to resist infection with the protozoan parasite, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, depends in large part on the function of members of a complex family of atypical large GTPases, the interferon-gamma-inducible immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins). Nevertheless, some strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic> are highly virulent for mice because, as recently shown, they secrete a polymorphic protein kinase, ROP18, from the rhoptries into the host cell cytosol at the moment of cell invasion. Depending on the allele, ROP18 can act as a virulence factor for <italic>T. gondii</italic> by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating mouse IRG proteins. In this article we show that IRG proteins interact not only with ROP18, but also strongly with the products of another polymorphic locus, <italic>ROP5</italic>, already implicated as a major virulence factor from genetic crosses, but whose function has previously been a complete mystery. ROP5 proteins are members of the same protein family as ROP18 kinases but are pseudokinases by sequence, structure, and function. We show by a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches that ROP5 proteins act as essential co-factors for ROP18 and present evidence that they work by enforcing an inactive GDP-dependent conformation on the IRG target protein. By doing so they prevent GTP-dependent activation and simultaneously expose the target threonines on the switch I loop for phosphorylation by ROP18, resulting in permanent inactivation of the protein. This represents a novel mechanism in which a pseudokinase facilitates the phosphorylation of a target by a partner kinase by preparing the substrate for phosphorylation, rather than by upregulation of the activity of the kinase itself.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an intracellular parasitic protozoan infecting about a third of humankind. Humans, however, are unlikely to be important hosts in terms of the evolution of the parasite because, for completion of the parasite sexual cycle, the infected animal must be eaten by a cat. Therefore, important intermediate hosts for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> are species like mice that are often preyed on by cats. Mice use an intracellular resistance mechanism, the IRG proteins, against <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. In turn, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> appears to have evolved a virulence factor, a protein kinase called ROP18, that inactivates IRG proteins. We show that ROP18 does not act alone. It needs help from the ROP5 pseudokinases, proteins related to ROP18 but without enzymatic activity. ROP5 pseudokinases assist ROP18 by binding to the IRG proteins, holding them inactive, and laying them open to enzymatic attack and likely permanent inactivation by the ROP18 kinase. This mechanism illustrates the principle that members of an enzyme family can lose their enzymatic activity and evolve into regulators or co-factors for the active members.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>) is an intracellular parasitic protozoan of the phylum Apicomplexa, a relative of the malarial Plasmodia. The two groups of human parasites differ greatly in their ecology. In particular, unlike <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, which have narrow host ranges, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> is able to establish productive infection in an extraordinary range of intermediate hosts, differentiating to stable encysted forms which can persist lifelong in all warm-blooded animals, birds as well as mammals. In humans, <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection is generally tolerated with minor symptoms, and an estimated 30%–40% of the world's population carry live brain cysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Montoya1">[1]</xref>. In mice, however, while <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains of the types II and III clonal lineages are largely avirulent, strains of the type I clonal lineage are highly virulent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Sibley1">[2]</xref>, killing immunologically competent but naïve hosts within 10 d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Saeij1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been known for many years that interferon-γ (IFNγ) is essential for resistance against <italic>T. gondii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Suzuki1">[4]</xref>. A previously underexplored family of IFNγ-inducible large GTPases, the IRG proteins (formerly the p47 GTPases), has been shown to carry much of the responsibility for the successful early resistance of mice to avirulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Taylor1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Taylor2">[6]</xref>. Genes encoding four members of the IRG protein family, Irgm1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Collazo1">[7]</xref>, Irgm3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Taylor3">[8]</xref>, Irgd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Collazo1">[7]</xref>, and Irga6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Liesenfeld1">[9]</xref>, have been disrupted and each of the mutant mouse strains shows more or less complete loss of acute resistance to infection with avirulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains. Thus the proteins function non-redundantly in resistance, and some mechanistic basis for this non-redundancy has been outlined as follows. The IRG proteins are simultaneously and massively induced by IFNγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Boehm1">[10]</xref> in all cell types so far studied and accumulate intracellularly in a GDP-bound inactive state. The inactive state is maintained by three dedicated regulatory members of the family: Irgm1, Irgm2, and Irgm3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Hunn1">[11]</xref>. On infection by <italic>T. gondii</italic>, the effector IRG proteins assemble cooperatively, probably in multimers, in a GTP-bound active form over a period of about 60 min on the cytosolic face of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Martens1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Khaminets1">[13]</xref>. IRG protein accumulation disrupts the integrity of the PVM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Martens1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Ling1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Zhao1">[15]</xref> and the enclosed parasite is killed for unknown reasons. The IRG resistance system is efficient in protecting mice from types II and III avirulent strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, but is defeated by virulent type I strains. IRG proteins largely fail to assemble on the PVM of these strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Khaminets1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Zhao2">[16]</xref>. Progress has been made recently in understanding the genetic basis for this striking difference of virulence for mice among different genotypes of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and its relationship to the IRG system. Consistent with the complexity of the interaction between a pathogen and its host, forward genetic screens of <italic>T. gondii</italic> have established the existence of several polymorphic loci contributing to virulence, with complex epistatic relations between them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Saeij2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Taylor4">[18]</xref>. One of these, <italic>ROP18</italic>, encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is secreted into the host cell cytosol at the time of parasite entry. To date, two independent targets of the ROP18 kinase have been identified: the transcription factor ATF6β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Yamamoto1">[19]</xref> and the GTPases of the IRG family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Fentress1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Steinfeldt1">[21]</xref>. ROP18 from virulent type I strains inactivates effector IRG proteins at the PVM by phosphorylation of specific threonine residues in the switch I loop of the nucleotide-binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Fentress1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Steinfeldt1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The present article arises from “pull-down” experiments intended to look for additional <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins associated with one of the effector IRG proteins, Irga6, in IFNγ-induced cells infected with a virulent type I strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The major components found were ROP5 pseudokinases. <italic>ROP5</italic> was identified as the most statistically significant virulence locus in two independent forward genetic screens, one between type II and type III strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Saeij2">[17]</xref>, and one between type I and II strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Behnke1">[22]</xref>. The <italic>ROP5</italic> locus encodes a cluster of closely related polymorphic genes encoding paralogues of ROP18 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Behnke1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese1">[23]</xref>. The <italic>ROP5</italic> locus from each strain encodes three different major isoforms, termed ROP5A, ROP5B, and ROP5C. The three isoforms differ markedly between the virulent (type I and type III) and avirulent (type II) loci, and these differences account for 50%–90% of the variation in virulence following intraperitoneal infections of lab strains of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Behnke1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese1">[23]</xref>. Substitution of the critical catalytic aspartate in the kinase active site and the non-canonical structure of the bound ATP suggests that all the ROP5 isoforms are catalytically inactive pseudokinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-ElHajj1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese2">[25]</xref>. Nevertheless, deletion of the <italic>ROP5</italic> cluster from a highly virulent type I strain, RH, yields a remarkably avirulent product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese1">[23]</xref>. Indeed the RH<italic>Δrop5</italic> strain is even less virulent than the RH<italic>Δrop18</italic> strain, suggesting that ROP5 may be a critical agent of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>'s manipulation of its hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese1">[23]</xref>. In the present study, we describe the first function for the ROP5 pseudokinases: these proteins act as powerful enhancers of ROP18-dependent phosphorylation of IRG proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic>-infected cells. This appears to occur in large part by the ability of ROP5 to bind to an interface on IRG proteins required for GTP-dependent activation and assembly on the PVM. Furthermore, when bound to ROP5, the switch I loop of the nucleotide-binding site of the IRG protein is left exposed and susceptible to phosphorylation by ROP18.</p>

        <title>Irga6 Binds <italic>T. gondii</italic>-Derived ROP5 in Vitro</title>
        <p>To identify <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins interacting with IRG proteins, we prepared Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads loaded with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Irga6 to pull down proteins from detergent lysates of IFNγ-induced L929 fibroblasts that had been infected 2 h earlier with the virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> type I strain, RH-YFP. Specificity control was provided by a parallel pull-down with Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads loaded with GST alone. Proteins were eluted from the beads and differential bands from silver-stained gels were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). In all differential bands the most abundant <italic>T. gondii</italic> peptides were derived from ROP5. In the band with the highest yield, 60% of peptides originating from <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins corresponded to ROP5, representing 86% sequence coverage. Peptides unique to each of the three isoforms of ROP5 were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001358-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the interaction with Irga6 is a property common to all ROP5 isoforms. ROP5 could also be pulled down from lysates of RH-YFP strain parasites prepared directly from human foreskin fibroblasts as demonstrated both by MS (not shown) and by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The efficiency of the pull-down, and therefore presumably the affinity of the interaction between Irga6 and ROP5, was noticeably enhanced when the pull-down was performed in the presence of GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, left hand panel). Equal ROP5 content in the lysates with and without GDP was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, right hand panel). Surprisingly, in view of their substantially different sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Bekpen1">[26]</xref>, GST fusions of two other IRG proteins, Irgb6 and Irgb10, also pulled down ROP5 from RH-YFP lysates, yielding significant though weaker ROP5 signals in Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The recovery of all ROP5 isoforms from the Irga6 pull-downs and the interaction of ROP5 with three different IRG proteins suggest that the ROP5 proteins have evolved as a general interactor with the IRG system.</p>

            <p>Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads loaded at 50 µg protein/100 µl 1∶1 bead suspension with bacterially expressed GST-IRG fusion proteins as bait were incubated at 4°C o/n with whole postnuclear lysates from RH-YFP strain <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Beads loaded with GST served as negative control. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and monoclonal antibody 3E2 was used for detection of ROP5 in subsequent Western blot analysis. (A) In vitro pull-down of ROP5 with bacterially expressed and purified GST-Irga6. A single lysate, equivalent to 50×10<sup>6</sup> organisms per track, was used for GST-Irga6 and GST alone control beads (B) pull-down of ROP5 by Irga6 was markedly enhanced in the presence of 1 mM GDP (left hand blot). Lysates with and without GDP, equivalent to 25×10<sup>6</sup> organisms per track, were prepared from a single batch of <italic>T. gondii</italic>; the right hand blot shows equal ROP5 signals from the supernatants of the pull-downs with GST alone with or without nucleotide. <italic>T. gondii</italic> calnexin provided the loading controls. (C) GST-Irgb6 and GST-Irgb10 also pulled down ROP5, though more weakly than GST-Irga6. One lysate, equivalent to 50×10<sup>6</sup> organisms per track, was used. All four tracks were run on a single gel; the vertical line indicates excision of irrelevant tracks.</p>

              <p>The first three sections (ROP5A, ROP5B, and ROP5C) show peptides that specifically discriminate between the three ROP5 isoforms. Residues in bold type are unique for the specific isoform indicated in the table. Sections 4 (ROP5A+ROP5C) and 5 (ROP5B+ROP5C) show peptides that fit to both indicated isoforms only. The peptides displayed in Section 6 (ROP5A+ROP5B+ROP5C) show peptides that match to all isoforms except that marked with *, which is found in all ROP5 isoforms but ROP5C1. Altogether 51 peptides were found for ROP5C comprising a sequence coverage of 86.2%, 47 peptides for ROP5B comprising a sequence coverage of 70.3%, and 34 peptides for ROP5A comprising a sequence coverage of 55.9%. In total 65 individual peptides for RH-ROP5 were found. Many of those were limited digests of the ones presented in the table and are not shown.

        <title>ROP5 is Required for Efficient Phosphorylation of Irga6 by ROP18</title>

We therefore asked whether ROP5 might be required for Irga6 phosphorylation by ROP18. L929 cells induced with IFNγ were infected with wild-type RH-YFP, RH<italic>Δrop5</italic>, RH<italic>Δrop18</italic>, or left uninfected. Compared with cells infected with wild-type RH-YFP, phosphorylation of the ROP18 target threonines, T102 and T108, was not detectable in RH<italic>Δrop5</italic>- or RH<italic>Δrop18-</italic>infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

The lack of Irga6 phosphorylation in the RH<italic>Δrop18</italic>-infected cells is consistent with evidence that ROP18 is the main kinase of the RH strain that phosphorylates and inactivates IRG proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Fentress1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Steinfeldt1">[21]</xref>, and further suggests that no other virulence kinase in the RH strain can compensate for its loss. The lack of autonomous catalytic activity of ROP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese2">[25]</xref> suggests that this protein acts as a facilitator of phosphorylation of Irga6 by ROP18.</p>

        <title>ROP5 Deficiency Reduces Cell-Autonomous Correlates of Virulence</title>
        <p>The association of IRG proteins with the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) is greatly reduced on virulent type I strain vacuoles compared with type II or type III strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Khaminets1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Zhao2">[16]</xref> and this difference is correlated with lack of phosphorylation of IRG proteins by ROP18 in type II or III strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Fentress1">[20,21]</xref>. Since ROP5 is required for phosphorylation of Irga6 T102 and T108 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and has been shown to associate with the PVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-ElHajj2">[27]</xref> and confirmed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001358.s001">Figure S1</xref>) we predicted that loading of IRG proteins onto the vacuoles of RH<italic>Δrop5</italic> parasites would be enhanced relative to the virulent wild-type RH strain. We therefore enumerated by immunofluorescence the loading of vacuoles with Irga6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3A,B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001358.s006">Table S3</xref>) and Irgb6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3D,E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001358.s006">Table S3</xref>) 2 h after infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with wild-type RH, RH<italic>Δrop5</italic>, or RH<italic>Δrop18</italic> parasites. For Irga6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) in two similar experiments (I, II) there were significant increases in the proportions of vacuoles from both RH<italic>Δrop5</italic> and RH<italic>Δrop18</italic> strains that were detectably loaded relative to RH. At the same time, there was also a striking increase in the intensity of loading of Irga6 onto individual vacuoles, with very few RH vacuoles loaded above the technical threshold, and even those few were barely above the threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). For Irgb6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) the proportions of RH<italic>Δrop5</italic> and RH<italic>Δrop18</italic> vacuoles detectably loaded by visual evaluation were dramatically increased relative to RH.

For technical reasons the automatic threshold for vacuole detection was set at 16,000 pixel units (horizontal line), which loses many vacuoles visibly but weakly loaded with Irga6 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <p>Differential effects on loading of Irga6 and Irgb6 onto vacuoles of virulent and avirulent strains have been reported before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Khaminets1">[13]</xref>. For Irga6, the intensity of loading onto virulent type I strain vacuoles is substantially less than on avirulent strain vacuoles, but the proportion of detectably loaded vacuoles is only a little lower. For Irgb6, the proportion of vacuoles detectably loaded is much lower with type I strains but the few remaining loaded vacuoles carry as much Irgb6 as those harboring an avirulent type II or type III strain. Thus the loss of ROP5 converts the IRG loading phenotype of RH vacuoles to that typical of an avirulent type II or type III strain vacuole. The loss of ROP18 had effects qualitatively similar to the loss of ROP5. Thus, ROP5, like ROP18, contributes very significantly to the known phenotypic differences in IRG protein loading onto the vacuoles, which are associated with virulence. The loss of ROP5, however, appears to have a greater impact on Irgb6 loading than the loss of ROP18.</p>
        <p>We showed earlier that IFNγ treatment of the host cells drastically reduces proliferation of the type II avirulent strain, ME49, compared with the RH strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Zhao3">[28]</xref>. This parameter is correlated with IRG protein loading of the PVM and is thus an additional correlate of virulence. We therefore used this assay to assess the in vitro virulence of the RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> and RHΔ<italic>rop18</italic> strains. The increased loading of IRG proteins onto the PVM in IFNγ-induced cells infected with RH<italic>Δrop5</italic> and RH<italic>Δrop18</italic> (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3</xref>) was associated with a striking inhibition of proliferation relative to RH and RH-YFP, measured in vitro by incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H-uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

        <title>Complementation of the RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> Phenotype in Strains Transgenic for ROP5 Isoforms</title>
        <p>We next sought to demonstrate that the loss of ROP5 was, indeed, responsible for the strikingly avirulent cell-autonomous phenotype of the RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> strain. We showed previously that engineered RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> parasites expressing both of the virulent allelic isoforms, ROP5A<sub>III</sub> and ROP5B<sub>III</sub> with epitope tags, were as virulent in vivo as the wild-type RH strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese1">[23]</xref>. When L929 cells were infected with these RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/B<sub>III</sub> transgenic parasites, Irga6 was phosphorylated on T102 and T108, indicating that these parasites expressed sufficient amounts of the correct ROP5 isoforms to complement the phenotype we had observed for RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, levels of Irga6 and Irgb6 associated with the PVM in MEFs infected with RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/B<sub>III</sub> parasites were returned to those characteristic of the wild-type parasites, both in terms of the percentage of vacuoles loaded with Irga6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) or Irgb6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) and in terms of the amount of Irga6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) loaded. For Irgb6, however, and as discussed further above, the amounts of Irgb6 on loaded vacuoles are not increased by deletion of ROP5 and, thus, are not significantly affected upon complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). As expected from a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-ElHajj2">[27]</xref> ROP5 isoforms A<sub>III</sub> and B<sub>III</sub> could be found at the PVM co-localizing with Irga6 in IFNγ-induced MEFs infected with RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> transgenic parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001358.s001">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

Lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and stained on Western blots with anti-pT102 (upper panel) and anti-pT108 (middle panel) antibodies. Expression of ROP5 isoform A<sub>III</sub> in RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/A<sub>III</sub> resulted in detectably increased phosphorylation of Irga6 compared with RHΔ<italic>rop5-</italic>infected cells. In cells infected with RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/B<sub>III</sub>, phosphorylation of Irga6 was restored almost to wt levels. Arrows on the RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> tracks indicate what is probably residual kinase activity of ROP18 on Irga6 in the absence of ROP5 since these signals are absent from cells infected with RHΔ<italic>rop18</italic> (and unpublished data). Signals of ROP18 serve as infection controls for the ROP18-expressing strains (lower panel). Calnexin serves as a loading control. (B, C, D, E) MEFs were induced with 3 U ml<sup>−1</sup> IFNγ for 24 h and infected with wt RH, RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>, RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/A<sub>III</sub>, or RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/B<sub>III</sub> for 2 h in two independent experiments (I and II, black and grey bars) and positive vacuoles were identified with mAb 10E7 (anti-Irga6) (B) or 141/1 rabbit antiserum (anti-Irgb6) (D). Fluorescent signal intensities shown for Irga6 (C) and Irgb6 (E) for individual vacuoles were determined for visually identified positive vacuoles from experiment II as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Presentation of the data is as described in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3</xref>. As already seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3</xref>, ROP5 deletion and restoration had relatively modest effects on the proportion of vacuoles loaded with Irga6 (5B), while the effects on loading of Irgb6 (5D) were striking. Again as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3</xref>, loss of ROP5 caused a highly significant increase in the intensity of Irga6 loading relative to which RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/A<sub>III</sub>-infection had little effect (5C). However, following infection with RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/B<sub>III</sub> the intensity of Irga6 loading was reduced to the levels of wild-type RH. As already seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3</xref>, loading intensities of the few wild-type RH vacuoles loaded with Irgb6 were the same as for the RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> vacuoles, as well as for the RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/A<sub>III</sub> and RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic>+A<sub>III</sub>/B<sub>III</sub> vacuoles. Significances shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5B and 5D</xref> are all relative to the number of Irga6 or Irgb6 loaded vacuoles of the RH strain.

L929 cells infected with these parasites also showed some increase in phosphorylation of Irga6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) but apparently not enough to inactivate IRG protein activity, because the loading of Irga6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>) or Irgb6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5D,E</xref>) onto the PVM in infected cells was not different from cells infected with RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> parasites. Very weak phosphorylation of Irga6 is also just visible in the RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) presumably due to residual ROP5-independent activity of ROP18. It is premature, however, to conclude from these results that ROP5B<sub>III</sub> has a higher potency than ROP5A<sub>III</sub> in the inactivation of Irga6 and Irgb6, because ROP5A<sub>III</sub> is expressed at only 10%–20% of the level of ROP5B<sub>III</sub> in the transgenic parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese1">[23]</xref>. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the contribution of ROP5 to in vivo virulence is at least in part due to its ability to enhance the phosphorylation of IRG proteins by ROP18.</p>

        <title>ROP5 Binds Irga6 Using a Face Distal from its Pseudoactive Site</title>
        <p>To gain insight into the mechanism by which ROP5 acts, we next sought to obtain structural information on the ROP5:IRG complex. To determine the region of ROP5 involved in binding Irga6, we used a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method combining isotopic labeling of specific amino acid types with analysis of chemical shift perturbation upon complex formation. ROP5 and Irga6 are relatively large proteins by NMR standards; while standard NMR methods usually have an upper size-limit of ∼30 kDa, the ROP5 pseudokinase domain:Irga6 complex is ∼90 kDa. We therefore chose to use isotopic labels on specific methyl groups, which have relaxation characteristics superior to the more common amide-labeling scheme.</p>
        <p>As we have structural information for the pseudokinase domain of ROP5B<sub>I</sub> (PDB: 3Q60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese1">[23]</xref>) and have found that complementation of the RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> strain with the nearly identical ROP5B<sub>III</sub> isoform (S535R/S536R are the only substitutions between ROP5B<sub>I</sub> and ROP5B<sub>III</sub>) enhances the phosphorylation of Irga6 in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), we began by collecting spectra of ROP5B<sub>I</sub> that had been specifically [<sup>13</sup>C]-labeled on the C<sub>ε</sub> of methionines. Spectra of [<sup>13</sup>C]-Met labeled ROP5B<sub>I</sub> showed well-resolved peaks corresponding to the eight methionines in the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). When unlabeled Irga6 was added, three methionine peaks were broadened, consistent with a complex in slow-intermediate exchange. Such spectral changes could indicate conformational changes near to the residues in question, rather than proximity to a binding interface. However, it is important to note that the ROP5 pseudokinase domain appears to be relatively rigid (which is atypical for a kinase domain); the structures of the ATP-bound and -unbound proteins are virtually identical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese2">[25]</xref>. Thus the spectral changes observed are most likely due to a direct interaction of residues on the surface of ROP5 with Irga6. The structure of the ROP5B<sub>I</sub> pseudokinase domain indicates only one surface with a cluster of three methionines that are relatively closely apposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). To verify this region as involved in the interface, we used mutagenesis to alanine to assign two of the methionines, M398 and M404 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001358.s002">Figure S2B</xref>,C). In addition, to verify that the pseudoactive site was not playing a role in the interaction, we also assigned M337 by mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001358.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). M337 occupies the “gatekeeper” position in the pseudokinase domain, and is thus an ideal probe of the pseudoactive site. As expected, the peak corresponding to M337 is completely insensitive to Irga6 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001358.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), whereas both M398 and M404 are sensitive. This strongly suggests that Irga6 is binding near M398 and M404 in a surface that includes one other methionine. There are two other methionines near M398 and M404: M181 and M521 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The side chain of M181 is completely buried, while M521 is highly surface exposed, strongly suggesting that M521 is the third Irga6 sensitive residue. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain sufficient protein to collect spectra of mutants in either of these two methionines, so the assignment of these latter methionines cannot be proven. Importantly, the region of ROP5 containing M398, M404, and M521 is on the opposite side of the protein from the pseudoactive site. This region of the protein surface is one of the least divergent among the various ROP5 isoforms, consistent with a conserved function and our MS data where peptides specific for all three ROP5 isoforms were recovered from the GST-Irga6 pull-down (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001358-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>ROP5 Binding Induces Conformational Changes in Irga6</title>
        <p>To identify the region of Irga6 that interacts with ROP5, we collected spectra using [<sup>13</sup>C]-Met labeled Irga6. Four methionines (M109, M144, M173, and M174) surround the nucleotide-binding site in Irga6 (PDB: 1TPZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Ghosh1">[29]</xref>). We first sought to identify peaks whose chemical shifts were sensitive to the presence of nucleotide. We collected spectra of [<sup>13</sup>C]-Met Irga6 in the presence and absence of GDP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Three peaks showed substantial changes to chemical shift upon addition of nucleotide, and a fourth peak showed minor changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The spectra of nucleotide-free <sup>13</sup>C-Met Irga6 show several peaks with shoulders, suggesting multiple conformations in slow exchange. Two of these peaks are also sensitive to the presence of nucleotide, consistent with crystallographic data indicating partial stabilization of the Irga6 apoprotein structure in presence of GDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Ghosh1">[29]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We next collected spectra of [<sup>13</sup>C]-Met labeled Irga6 in the presence of ROP5B<sub>I</sub> but without nucleotide. As seen in the above experiments with labeled ROP5, several peaks exhibited substantial chemical shift perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The fact that we observe peaks that are broadened as well as those that are shifted suggests that two processes, with slightly different rates, are occurring. Thus, in the ROP5:Irga6 complex, Irga6 appears to undergo some conformational change, in contrast to the conformational stability of ROP5. Interestingly, each of the peaks exhibiting a shoulder in the apo-spectra is sensitive to interaction with ROP5, suggesting that ROP5 may restrict the global conformational dynamics of Irga6. Among the peaks that exhibited the most substantial changes upon ROP5 binding were two of the nucleotide-sensitive peaks. As we did not observe a substantial number of other spectral changes, it is also likely that ROP5 binds near this site. Consistent with this interpretation, when both ROP5 and GDP are present, two peaks exhibit chemical shifts that are distinct from those seen for the apoprotein, or for the individual ligand-bound states (i.e., only ROP5 or GDP). We assigned the peaks corresponding to M173 and M144 by mutagenesis to alanine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001358.s002">Figure S2D</xref>,E). While M144 (which is buried) is largely insensitive to both ROP5 and nucleotide, the peak corresponding to the surface-exposed M173 undergoes the largest additional chemical shift changes upon ROP5 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The second labile peak is not yet assigned.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these data suggest that ROP5 binds close to the activation interface on the nucleotide-binding domain and tends to stabilize a conformation related to the GDP-bound conformation. This would suggest that ROP5 affinity for Irga6 may be sensitive to the nucleotide-bound state of the IRG protein, and indeed as noted above, we observed an increase in ROP5 recovered from an Irga6 pull-down assay when GDP was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with a model for the interaction in which the binding of ROP5 to Irga6 stabilizes (and is stabilized by) the GDP-bound, inactive conformation of the protein.</p>

        <title>Identification of the ROP5-Binding Interface on Irga6 by Mutagenesis</title>
        <p>Irga6 is activated by binding of GTP, followed by oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Uthaiah1">[30]</xref>, and its association with the PVM is prevented by mutations that interfere with GTP-dependent activation of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Pawlowski1">[31]</xref>. GTP-dependent oligomerization depends on the formation of a symmetrical dimer interface between two Irga6 monomers involving the nucleotide-binding site in the G-domain, followed by reciprocal trans-hydrolysis of the GTP to GDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Pawlowski1">[31]</xref>. The NMR data suggested that ROP5 also binds at or near the nucleotide-binding site. We therefore used pull-down assays from RH-YFP detergent lysates to determine the binding of ROP5 to GST-Irga6 proteins mutated at essential, surface-exposed residues on the activation interface; ROP5 binding to the mutant Irga6 proteins was then assayed from scanned Western blots. Mutation of five residues (K161, K162, D164, K196, and P197) on the activation interface blocked ROP5 binding &gt;95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g008">Figure 8A,B,C</xref>). By additional mutagenesis we further defined an extension of the activation interface on Helix 4 not included in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Ghosh1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Pawlowski1">[31]</xref>.

Mutations of residues elsewhere on the activation interface had no or only a weak impact on ROP5 binding, the latter perhaps due to conformational effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g008">Figure 8A,B,C</xref>). Thus, the binding site of ROP5 overlaps with, but is clearly distinct from, the Irga6 activation interface (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g008">Figure 8B,C</xref>). Particularly striking is that mutations of the two threonines, T102 and T108, that are targets for ROP18 phosphorylation on the conformationally active switch I loop did not affect ROP5 binding, suggesting that ROP5 binding would be compatible with the kinase activity of ROP18 on Irga6 occurring in a trimeric complex.</p>

In view of the suggestion from the mutagenesis results that the ROP5 interaction surface does not overlap the threonine targets for phosphorylation by ROP18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g008">Figure 8A,B,C</xref>), we asked whether the conformation of ROP5-bound Irga6 is a better substrate for ROP18 in vitro than the unbound conformer. We therefore added purified ROP5B<sub>I</sub> pseudokinase domain protein to in vitro ROP18-Irga6 kinase reactions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g009">Figure 9A</xref> (left panel), Irga6 phosphorylation on T108 was modestly enhanced by addition of equimolar amounts of ROP5B<sub>I</sub>. To determine whether this increase was due to an effect of ROP5 on ROP18, or an interaction between ROP5 and Irga6, we repeated the experiment using an Irga6 mutant protein, D164A, that does not interact with ROP5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). No increase in phosphorylation on T108 of the mutant protein was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, left panel) compared with the irrelevant protein, BSA (right panels), implying that the enhanced phosphorylation of Irga6 by ROP18 depends on the physical interaction of ROP5 with Irga6. The enhancement of ROP18 phosphorylation by ROP5 in this in vitro system with purified protein reagents is clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), but far smaller than that seen in cells infected with virulent parasites (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g009">Figure 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

      <p>The polymorphic, secreted ROP5 rhoptry pseudokinases are known to play an important part in virulence of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> for mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Saeij2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Behnke1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese1">[23]</xref>, but their mode of action was previously unknown. We have shown in this study that the protein products of virulent alleles of ROP5 are able to bind to at least three effector members of the IRG family of mouse resistance GTPases, Irga6, Irgb6, and Irgb10, and we have identified the probable interaction surfaces on ROP5 and on Irga6. The interaction of Irga6 with ROP5 in infected cells greatly enhances ROP18-mediated phosphorylation of two critical threonines on the conformationally active switch I loop, close to the nucleotide-binding site, a modification shown in earlier studies to be strongly associated with virulence of type I strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Fentress1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Howard1">[34]</xref>. We show that ROP5 plays an essential role in determining the parameters of cell-autonomous virulence in vitro that correlate with in vivo virulence. The parasitophorous vacuolar membranes (PVM) of the RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> strain, lacking ROP5 but carrying a competent allele of the virulent ROP18 kinase, are almost as heavily loaded with IRG proteins in IFNγ-induced mouse cells as are typical avirulent strains; this phenotype is completely complemented in RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> strain transgenic for virulent alleles A<sub>III</sub> and B<sub>III</sub> of ROP5. Furthermore, the intracellular replication of RHΔ<italic>rop5</italic> strain parasites is as efficiently controlled by IFNγ treatment of the cells as is the replication of avirulent strains. Taken together, earlier results, showing that virulent alleles of ROP18 are required for efficient IRG phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Fentress1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Steinfeldt1">[21]</xref>, and the present results, showing that phosphorylation by ROP18 is conditional on the presence of virulent strain ROP5, offer a simple explanation for the previously enigmatic result that type II strains encode an almost certainly functional ROP18 but IRG accumulation at the PVM proceeds unabated: they carry alleles of <italic>ROP5</italic> that are ineffective at assisting ROP18 in the phosphorylation of IRG proteins. Similarly, the fact that type III strains are mouse-avirulent despite the fact that they carry a high-virulence allele of <italic>ROP5</italic> is probably largely due to the virtual null allele of <italic>ROP18</italic> in these strains: expression levels of <italic>ROP18</italic> transcript are several orders of magnitude lower in type III strains than in types I or II, and introduction of a type I or II allele of <italic>ROP18</italic> into a type III strain increases virulence by more than a thousand-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Saeij2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Taylor4">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The NMR results suggest an IRG-binding surface on the ROP5 protein that is not conformationally affected by the interaction with IRG proteins. This surface is distant from the pseudokinase active site, and is largely conserved between ROP5 isoforms, consistent with the evidence that all three isoforms of ROP5 were recovered from pull-downs from type I lysates with Irga6 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001358-t001">Table 1</xref>). The putative ROP5-binding surface on Irga6 partially overlaps the recently defined activation interface on Irga6 whose integrity is required for GTP-dependent oligomerization and the activation of hydrolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Pawlowski1">[31]</xref>. This surface is conformationally modified by GTP-binding to create a stable dimerization interface that is only resolved by GTP hydrolysis. The NMR data suggest that the binding of ROP5 to Irga6 may favor the inactive GDP-dependent conformation of Irga6, an interpretation supported by the increased efficiency of ROP5 interaction with Irga6 in the presence of GDP. Whether ROP5 imposes further conformational modifications on Irga6, as suggested by the NMR results, or only traps the GDP-bound conformation, is not yet clear. Since the putative interaction surface of ROP5 on Irga6 physically overlaps with the activation interface, it was no surprise that purified ROP5 pseudokinase domain could directly block GTP-dependent oligomerization in vitro. Thus competition for the shared interaction surface between Irga6 and ROP5 could by itself contribute to inactivation of the IRG protein. However, it is striking that T102 and T108, the two essential, conformationally labile, conserved switch I loop targets for phosphorylation by ROP18 kinase, are apparently not involved in the interaction with ROP5. It therefore seems likely that upregulation in IRG-specific ROP18 kinase activity by ROP5 is caused, at least in part, by the same mechanism by which ROP5 inhibits Irga6 multimerization; that is, that ROP5 binds adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site and stabilizes a conformation of Irga6 in which the two target threonines, T102 and T108, on the switch I loop can be preferentially phosphorylated. Structural data on the ternary complex is needed to determine whether ROP18 directly contacts ROP5 in the complex.</p>
      <p>A plausible scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g010">Figure 10</xref>) for the interaction of Irga6, ROP5, and ROP18 should be played out on the PVM, where Irga6, ROP5, and ROP18 are largely confined in the infected cell. From the known affinities of Irga6 for GTP (15 µM) and GDP (1 µM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Uthaiah1">[30]</xref> and the cytosolic concentrations of the two nucleotides of ∼300 µM and 100 µM, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Kleineke1">[35]</xref>, Irga6 is predicted to be predominantly in the monomeric, GDP-bound state in the cytosol at equilibrium. Immediately after entry of the parasite, IRG proteins begin to arrive at the PVM, probably by simple diffusion while still in the GDP-bound state, bind transiently to the membrane via an unknown mechanism, and activate locally by GTP-dependent interaction with neighboring IRG molecules. Irga6 is myristoylated and the myristoyl group is essential for stable interaction with the PVM. Furthermore, there are indications that the myristoyl group is conformationally interactive with the nucleotide-binding site and is probably exposed by GTP-binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Papic1">[33]</xref> as is the case with Arf GTPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Goldberg1">[36]</xref>. Although IRG binding to the vacuole is detectable as early as 2.5 min after parasite entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Khaminets1">[13]</xref>, it is likely that ROP5 will initially be in excess relative to the IRG proteins, allowing it to bind and slow their activation. The IRG:ROP5 complex is in equilibrium with the unbound states, and as the IRG protein concentration at the PVM rises, the molar ratios become less favorable for ROP5 and free IRG proteins would tend to activate and oligomerize. However efficient phosphorylation of T102 and T108 proteins by ROP18 in ROP5-assisted complexes will cause permanent inactivation. Without activation of Irga6, the myristoyl group would not interact with the membrane and the inactivated protein would diffuse back into the cytosol, resulting in reduced loading of Irga6, as observed at the virulent vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Steinfeldt1">[21]</xref>).</p>

      <p>Although purified ROP18 can phosphorylate IRG proteins in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Steinfeldt1">[21]</xref> and this article, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001358-g009">Figure 9A,B</xref>) it is difficult to assess how relevant the in vitro conditions are under which this ROP5-independent kinase activity is displayed. Certainly, as we show in this article, ROP18 is scarcely able to phosphorylate IRG proteins in infected cells in the absence of sufficient ROP5, while the presence of virulent ROP5 without ROP18 is not sufficient to confer virulence. Thus, ROP5 and ROP18 appear to act in concert to inactivate the IRG system, ROP5 perhaps holding IRG in an inhibited form just long enough for ROP18 to make the fatal phosphorylation. The complex in which ROP5 and ROP18 both interact with IRG proteins is not clear. From the proximity of the ROP5 binding site on Irga6 to the switch I loop, ROP18 could interact directly with ROP5 during phosphorylation. In an alternative scenario the conformational change in Irga6 caused by ROP5 binding would facilitate access of the ROP18 kinase to its target threonines, without requiring a direct interaction between the two ROP proteins. Further structural and kinetic information is required to resolve this.</p>
      <p>Recently, ROP18 has been shown also to phosphorylate the ER-stress regulator, ATF6β, in infected cells, a target unrelated to the IRG family with a putative effect on virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Yamamoto1">[19]</xref>. Since our data demonstrate that ROP5 acts directly on the IRG family, rather than globally upregulating the kinase activity of ROP18, it is unlikely to play a role in other ROP18 functions. It is likely, however, that ROP5, like ROP18, also targets other host factors. Indeed, genetic data conclusively demonstrated that ROP5 has both ROP18-dependent and -independent effects on virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Saeij2">[17]</xref>. This conclusion can also be drawn from the fact that the deletion of <italic>ROP5</italic> attenuates virulence of type I strains much more than the deletion of <italic>ROP18</italic>, which would not be predicted if the only role of ROP5 was to potentiate the action of ROP18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001358-Reese1">[23]</xref>. Thus it will be interesting to determine what partners, if any, ROP18 requires for its phosphorylation of ATF6β and ROP5 requires for its other, still unknown functions. Note that the functional heterogeneity of ROP5 within a given strain need not imply a variety of different molecular targets since it could as well be explained by the necessity to accommodate to the considerable structural diversity of IRG proteins as by the targeting of completely unrelated substrate molecules.</p>
      <p>It is clear that the IRG resistance system of mice looms remarkably large in the evolution of <italic>T. gondii</italic> virulence. Virulence differentials associated with ROP5 and ROP18 polymorphism together account for about 90% of the presently known virulence differentials for mice between the three clonal lineages. It is therefore likely that the mouse is an evolutionarily important host for <italic>T. gondii</italic> and that there have been a number of reciprocating steps in the co-evolution of <italic>T. gondii</italic> virulence for mice, via the ROP kinases and pseudokinases, and mouse resistance against <italic>T. gondii</italic>, via the IRG resistance mechanism. The polymorphism of the ROP5 and ROP18 virulence systems is likely to be confronted by polymorphic resistance systems in intermediate hosts that find themselves under selective pressure from the parasite. Our own recent work confirms the existence of a widespread polymorphism in the IRG proteins of the mouse associated with differential resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains carrying different virulence alleles (unpublished data). <italic>T. gondii</italic> evolution will have accelerated in recent millenia due to the exceptional abundance of the domestic cat as a definitive host. The traditional prey animals of the domestic cat are likely to have borne the brunt of this ecological shock. The surprising finding that both ROP5 and ROP18, the two principal polymorphic <italic>T. gondii</italic> virulence factors known for the mouse, target the IRG resistance system provides strong evidence that small rodents such as the mouse or other IRG-expressing animals are important intermediate hosts in the complex world-wide ecology of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>

          <p>Native and experimental N-termini of IRG proteins in GST fusions. Shown are the sequences at the N-termini of IRG proteins expressed either as GST-fusion proteins in bacterial expression constructs or cleaved from the fusion as a near-native protein (Irga6). Residues in lower case are derived from the protease cleavage site and the polylinker. GST-Irga6 and GST-Irgb6 contain a thrombin cleavage site, and GST-Irgb10 contains a TEV-protease cleavage site. The protease cleavage sites are indicated by hyphens in the sequence. The first residues of the native protein are in capital letters. The N-terminal residues of the native open reading frames (ORF) are given below.</p>
