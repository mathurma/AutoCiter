<abstract>
<p>Cell-to-cell transmission of toxic forms of α-Synuclein (αS) is thought to underlie disease progression in Parkinson disease. αS in humans is constitutively N-terminally acetylated (αS<sub>acetyl</sub>), although the impact of this modification is relatively unexplored. Here, we report that αS<sub>acetyl</sub> is more effective at inducing intracellular aggregation in primary neurons than unmodified αS (αS<sub>un</sub>). We identify complex N-linked glycans as binding partners for αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and demonstrate that cellular internalization of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> is reduced significantly upon cleavage of extracellular N-linked glycans, but not other carbohydrates. We verify binding of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> to N-linked glycans in vitro, using both isolated glycans and cell-derived proteoliposomes. Finally, we identify neurexin 1β, a neuronal glycoprotein, as capable of driving glycan-dependent uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub>. Importantly, our results are specific to αS<sub>acetyl</sub> because αS<sub>un</sub> does not demonstrate sensitivity for N-linked glycans in any of our assays. Our study identifies extracellular N-linked glycans—and the glycoprotein neurexin 1β specifically—as key modulators of neuronal uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub>, drawing attention to the potential therapeutic value of αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-glycan interactions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The pathologies of Parkinson disease and related synucleinopathies are characterized by the accumulation of aggregates of the neuronal protein α-Synuclein (αS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref001">1</xref>]. The prevailing hypothesis is that toxicity is mediated by prefibrillar oligomers of αS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref002">2</xref>]. Emerging evidence suggests that cell-to-cell transmission of toxic αS species may be the basis of disease propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>αS is a small, soluble protein that is intrinsically disordered in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref004">4</xref>]. It associates peripherally to anionic lipid bilayers through its N-terminal domain, which becomes α-helical upon binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref005">5</xref>]. The localization of αS to nerve terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref007">7</xref>] and to cellular lipid raft domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref008">8</xref>] suggests that there are components or properties of cellular membranes that are important for αS binding and function that may not be fully reproduced by simple lipid mixtures. Indeed, specific components of the extracellular membrane, including proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref009">9</xref>] and proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref010">10</xref>], have been identified as having roles in the uptake of pathogenic αS species.</p>
<p>αS is subject to various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycation, acetylation, and arginylation, some of which are correlated with pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref013">13</xref>]. Mass spectrometry analysis indicates that the majority of these modifications are found on only a very small fraction of αS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref014">14</xref>]. N-terminal acetylation, however, is unique in that it appears to be present on the majority of αS in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref016">16</xref>], in both healthy persons and patients with Parkinson disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref015">15</xref>]. Acetylation of the amino terminus occurs co-translationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref017">17</xref>], and, for many proteins, it is required for recognition of cellular binding partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref018">18</xref>]. Work from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref019">19</xref>] and others have demonstrated that N-terminal acetylation alters the fundamental biophysical properties of αS; it moderately affects its binding to synthetic lipid bilayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref020">20</xref>] and rates of aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref020">20</xref>]. How this modification impacts interactions with other cellular binding partners—and in particular the plasma membrane proteins that have been identified as receptors involved in cellular uptake and aggregation—has not been explored. Here, we investigate the role of N-terminal acetylation of αS on cellular binding and internalization. Using cell biological and biophysical approaches, we demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation of αS confers interactions with extracellular N-linked glycans that impact cellular uptake, identify neurexin 1β as a receptor for glycan-dependent uptake of αS, and provide insight into the mechanism of cellular recognition relevant to uptake.</p>

<title>N-terminal acetylation of αS enhances formation of intracellular aggregates in neurons</title>
<p>Recently, observations that exogenously added aggregates of αS are capable of seeding aggregation of endogenous αS have prompted an interest in understanding the molecular players involved. However, investigations of this phenomenon have relied on aggregates composed of unmodified αS (αS<sub>un</sub>). To determine whether N-terminal acetylation of αS (αS<sub>acetyl</sub>) alters this seeding behavior, primary hippocampal neurons were incubated with preformed fibrils (PFFs) of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> or αS<sub>un</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref021">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). Both αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs resulted in the formation of abundant intracellular aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), demonstrating that the internalized material retains its fibrillar character, as previously characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref002">2</xref>]. However, the kinetics of aggregate formation differ significantly. For αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs, the time course was in good agreement with previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref021">21</xref>]; aggregates were observed in axons by day 7 and had spread to somatodendritic compartments by day 10. For αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs, aggregates in axons were already prevalent by day 3, and spreading to somatodentric compartments was readily apparent by day 7. Measurements beyond 7 days were not possible for neurons treated with αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs due to significant cell death.</p>

<p>To compare the effectiveness of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs in nucleating intracellular aggregate formation and growth, we quantified the total number of aggregates per neuron, reflecting the seeding capacity of the added αS PFFs (i.e., their ability to induce the initial formation of intracellular αS aggregates), as well as total aggregate area per neuron, reflecting the overall ability of the added αS PFFs to accelerate further aggregate growth. This quantification revealed that the overall rate of aggregate formation is &gt;2-fold faster for neurons treated with αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs compared with αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This result demonstrates that αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs are markedly more potent seeds for pathological propagation of αS aggregation in neurons.</p>

<title>αS<sub>acetyl</sub> is more rapidly internalized by SH-SY5Y cells than αS<sub>un</sub></title>
<p>This observation sparked our interest in determining the origin in differences in aggregate propagation in neurons. To do so, human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells were chosen because they retain many of the pathways dysregulated in Parkinson disease and thus are widely used as a cellular model for disease. Moreover, SH-SY5Y cells spontaneously internalize αS without requiring the use of a transfection agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref022">22</xref>]. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with monomer or PFF αS fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (αS-AL488). After 12 hours of incubation, monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub> appeared as puncta, colocalized with an endosomal marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s006">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). In order to make a more quantitative comparison of both kinetics and quantity of uptake between αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub>, cellular internalization was measured as a function of time. Three orthogonal methods were used to quantify uptake: (1) loss of monomer αS from the cell media was measured using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref023">23</xref>], (2) the amounts of internalized monomer and PFF αS were quantified by confocal imaging, or (3) both extracellular and internalized monomer and PFF αS were quantified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s007">S3 Fig</xref>). Results of all three of these approaches are consistent and reveal that both monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> are internalized more rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and to a greater extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s007">S3 Fig</xref>) than αS<sub>un</sub>. Uptake was inhibited at 4°C, indicating that active endocytotic pathways are required (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s008">S4A Fig</xref>). Control measurements made using non-neuronal lineage human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK) cells found no spontaneous internalization of either αS<sub>acetyl</sub> or αS<sub>un</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s008">S4B Fig</xref>), consistent with prior studies of αS uptake by HEK cells that utilized transfection agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref026">26</xref>]. Both SH-SY5Y and HEK cells showed rapid uptake of transferrin, indicating that lack of αS internalization is not due to inherent differences in rates of clathrin-dependent endocytosis between the cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s008">S4C Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Cleavage of extracellular N-linked glycans inhibits uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> by SH-SY5Y cells</title>
<p>Cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been observed to promote uptake of a number of fibrillar amyloid proteins, including αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref027">27</xref>]. To investigate the relevance of proteoglycans to αS<sub>acetyl</sub> uptake, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with Heparinase I/III, an enzyme that cleaves these carbohydrates, for 6 hours. After exchange of media to remove the enzyme, αS-AL488 was added and incubated an additional 12 hours. This incubation period was chosen because it allows for reproducible quantification of puncta, and there is no evidence of protein or fluorophore degradation that may occur at longer time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s006">S2B Fig</xref>). In agreement with previous reports, we found that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with Heparinase reduced the uptake of αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s009">S5A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, however, Heparinase pretreatment did not alter uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs nor that of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s009">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These results prompted us to consider other endoglycosidases, as the majority of cell-surface proteins are modified by glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref028">28</xref>], including a number of proteins that have been identified as receptors for αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref030">30</xref>]. Complex N-linked glycans were selectively removed from SH-SY5Y cells using peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Following incubation with αS<sub>acetyl</sub>, a decrease in the number of intracellular puncta in the PNGase F–treated cells relative to untreated cells was observed, both for monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub>, reflecting a significant decrease in uptake by deglycosylated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2A, 2C and 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s007">S3 Fig</xref>). Removal of N-linked glycans was confirmed using concanavalin A (con A), a lectin that binds α-D-mannose and α-D-glucose moieties found on N-linked glycans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s009">S5C Fig</xref>). Control measurements showed that PNGase F treatment did not impact clathrin-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s009">S5D Fig</xref>). Under our measurement conditions (200 nM protein and 12-hour incubation), neither untreated nor PNGase F–treated cells showed evidence of increased toxicity upon incubation with monomer or PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> or αS<sub>un</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s009">S5E Fig</xref>). Moreover, and strikingly, internalization of monomer and PFF αS<sub>un</sub> did not demonstrate sensitivity to PNGase F treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2B, 2C and 2E</xref>). Lastly, we tested endoglycosidase H (Endo H), which cleaves high mannose N-linked carbohydrates, and found that this enzyme had only a minor impact on uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> by SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s009">S5B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Our observations in SH-SY5Y cells were corroborated in cultured primary hippocampal neurons. Monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub> were readily internalized by primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Removal of extracellular N-linked glycans by PNGase F resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the amount of internalized αS<sub>acetyl</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), while no effect was observed for αS<sub>un</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Similar to our observation in SH-SY5Y cells, PNGase F treatment of neurons caused no defects in clathrin-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s009">S5D Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Removal of complex N-linked glycans alters αS binding to SH-SY5Y GPMVs</title>
<p>Our results thus far support specific interactions between αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and complex, N-linked glycans found on neurons and SH-SY5Y, but not HEK, cells that drive internalization of both monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub>. To investigate the molecular details of the interactions of αS with cell-surface glycans, we used cell membrane–derived giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) that have a lipid and protein composition that closely resembles the cell plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref031">31</xref>]. Thus, they serve as an excellent model of the cell membrane while lacking the active processes of cells, such as uptake, allowing for binding interactions to be observed. GPMVs were harvested from SH-SY5Y cells and incubated with monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488. Both monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488 formed large, bright assemblies on the exterior of the SH-SY5Y GMPVs and caused their clustering, with larger assemblies and more clusters observed with increasing protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s010">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). Monomer and PFF αS<sub>un</sub>-AL488, on the other hand, bound more uniformly and apparently more weakly than αS<sub>acetyl</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s010">S6C Fig</xref>). The images present a striking contrast, suggesting differences in binding affinity for αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub>. Binding of monomer αS to GPMVs was quantified by FCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In these experiments, monomer αS-AL488 was added to GPMVs in a sample chamber, and the amount of αS-AL488 that remained in solution after incubation was determined. After 60 minutes of incubation, 47% ± 4% of αS<sub>un</sub> and 80% ± 6% of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> were bound to the GPMVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Direct quantification of GPMV fluorescence resulting from αS-AL488 binding was consistent with the FCS results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s010">S6D Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Carbohydrates were selectively removed from the extracellular surface of the SH-SY5Y GPMVs by incubation with the same endoglycosidases used in the cell uptake measurements. Treatment with PNGase F resulted in a loss of inhomogenous binding and the bright αS<sub>acetyl</sub> assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s010">S6E Fig</xref>), as well as significantly decreased the amount of bound αS<sub>acetyl</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). In contrast, binding of αS<sub>un</sub> to SH-SY5Y GPMVs was unaltered by PNGase F treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). By comparison, bright αS<sub>acetyl</sub> assemblies were still observed after treatment with Heparinase or Endo H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s010">S6F Fig</xref>), consistent with our cellular uptake measurements. Also consistent with our cellular uptake measurements is that very weak binding was observed for αS<sub>acetyl</sub> to GPMVs derived from HEK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s010">S6G Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Uniform binding of Alexa 488-labeled conA (conA-AL488) to SH-SY5Y GPMVs demonstrates that glycoproteins were distributed throughout the GPMV bilayer in the absence of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s010">S6H Fig</xref>); treatment with PNGase F significantly reduced the amount of conA bound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s010">S6H Fig</xref>).

<title>αS<sub>acetyl</sub> binds complex N-linked glycans with a distinct structure</title>
<p>Because its native function is thought to involve interactions with cellular membranes, binding of αS to synthetic lipid vesicles has been thoroughly investigated by a number of experimental methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref034">34</xref>]. The interaction is mediated through the first approximately 95 residues of αS, which form an α-helix upon binding to synthetic lipid vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref035">35</xref>]. To interrogate the conformational features of αS bound to GPMVs, intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements were made. αS was labeled at residues 9 and 72, positions encompassing much of the membrane-binding domain. Mean energy transfer efficiencies (ET<sub>eff</sub>) of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub> bound to SH-SY5Y GPMVs were 0.43 ± 0.08 and 0.21 ± 0.06, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). This lower ET<sub>eff</sub> measured for αS<sub>un</sub> was consistent with a single, long α-helix that we have previously measured using single-molecule FRET for αS bound to synthetic lipid vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref035">35</xref>]. The higher ET<sub>eff</sub> measured for αS<sub>acetyl</sub> demonstrates that it binds in a distinct conformation. Strikingly, when complex N-linked glycans were removed from GPMVs by treatment with PNGase F, ET<sub>eff</sub> distribution peaks of 0.19 ± 0.06 and 0.17 ± 0.03 were observed for αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>)<sub>.</sub> Our interpretation of these findings is that, in the absence of complex N-linked glycans, αS<sub>acetyl</sub> binds to GPMVs through interactions with the lipid bilayer resulting in a predominantly extended conformation. In the presence of N-linked glycans, αS<sub>acetyl</sub> binding is enhanced, and it assumes a conformation distinct from the extended, membrane-bound α-helix. The higher mean ET<sub>eff</sub> and relatively broad distribution of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> may reflect a dynamic, disordered C-terminal half of the membrane-binding domain that does not strongly associate with the GPMVs in the presence of surface glycans. Binding of αS<sub>un</sub>, on the other hand, occurs primarily through its interactions with the lipid bilayer resulting in the extended helical state even in the presence of N-linked glycans. These results provide a basis for understanding why no differences in GPMV binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) or in cellular uptake (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g003">3B</xref>) were observed for αS<sub>un</sub> upon PNGase F treatment.</p>

<title>αS<sub>acetyl</sub> binds isolated N-linked glycans from SH-SY5Y cells</title>
<p>To identify whether αS<sub>acetyl</sub> binding to glycans requires either the associated glycoproteins or a lipid bilayer, binding to isolated glycans in solution was measured by FCS. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with each of the 3 endoglycosidases used in the cell and GPMV experiments, and the cleaved carbohydrates were retained. The carbohydrates were titrated into αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488 for FCS measurements, and the autocorrelation curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s011">S7A Fig</xref>) were fit to extract the diffusion time and average number of fluorescent molecules, <italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s011">S7B Fig</xref>). The diffusion time—which reflects the hydrodynamic size of the diffusing species—of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> increased more than 25% with increasing concentrations of PNGase F–derived glycans, comparable to similar measurements of conA-AL488 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s011">S7C Fig</xref>). No increase in the diffusion time of αS<sub>un</sub> was observed in the presence of PNGase F–derived glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Similarly, the addition of carbohydrates obtained from Endo H or Heparinase treatment of SH-SY5Y cells or PNGase F treatment of HEK cells resulted in minimal changes in the diffusion time of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> by FCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s011">S7D Fig</xref>). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements showed nonuniform glycan-dependent changes in αS<sub>acetyl</sub> peak intensity in the presence of PNGase F–cleaved glycans, but not simple carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). These changes likely result not only from direct and specific interactions of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> with the cell-derived glycans through its acetylated N-terminus, but also changes in the overall conformational ensemble as a result. Only a minimal increase in signal intensity was observed for αS<sub>un</sub> with PNGase F–cleaved glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). By a filtration-based assay, both monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> were found to pull down PNGase F–cleaved glycans from solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s011">S7E Fig</xref>). In contrast to GPMV images, there was no evidence of glycan-mediated assembly of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s011">S7B Fig</xref>). This may reflect a difference in αS<sub>acetyl</sub> binding to disperse glycans in solution compared to the relatively high density of glycans on the GPMV surface. Alternatively, it could be due to the absence of the relevant glycoprotein(s) because αS<sub>acetyl</sub> binding may involve interactions both with N-linked glycans as well as the associated glycoprotein(s).</p>

<title>Neurexin 1β drives internalization of αS<sub>acetyl</sub></title>
<p>Our results to this point demonstrate that the uptake of both monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> by SH-SY5Y cells or primary neurons is strongly impacted by interactions with complex, N-linked glycans. Our biophysical measurements with GPMVs and isolated carbohydrates support this observation. This prompted efforts to identify a specific glycoprotein binder partner for αS<sub>acetyl</sub>. One recent screen of transmembrane proteins identified neurexin 1β and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), both of which contain a single N-linked glycosylation site in their extracellular domains, as binding partners for αS<sub>un</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref009">9</xref>]. Although this study did not address the impact of N-terminal acetylation of αS, nor of glycosylation of the neurexin 1β or LAG3, it found that both receptor proteins exhibit specificity for PFF over monomer αS<sub>un</sub>, with the effect more striking for LAG3. To specifically address a possible role for glycosylation of these proteins in αS uptake, HEK cells were transfected with either LAG3 or neurexin 1β, each bearing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) tag on its intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s012">S8A Fig</xref>). At comparable transfection levels, the proteins localized to the plasma membrane, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s012">S8B Fig</xref>). αS was labeled with AL594 (αS-AL594) to allow for simultaneous imaging of the transfected protein and exogenously added αS. In the absence of LAG3 or neurexin 1β, no uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> or αS<sub>un</sub> monomer or PFF by HEK cells was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s008">S4B Fig</xref>). Upon the addition of either αS<sub>acetyl</sub> or αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs to LAG3 expressing cells, colocalization with LAG3 on the plasma membrane followed by uptake was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

<p>The results from the neurexin 1β expressing HEK cells stand in striking contrast. Both monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> were internalized by these cells where they colocalized in distinct intracellular puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g007">Fig 7D and 7F</xref>). Intracellular puncta containing neurexin 1β were not observed in the absence of αS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s012">S8A Fig</xref>), demonstrating that αS<sub>acetyl</sub> drives internalization of neurexin 1β during its uptake. We saw no evidence of uptake of monomer or PFF αS<sub>un</sub> in neurexin 1β expressing HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g007">Fig 7D and 7F</xref>). At short incubation times, both αS<sub>un</sub> and αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs colocalized with neurexin 1β on the cell surface; however, only αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs were internalized upon longer incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s012">S8C Fig</xref>). Treatment of neurexin 1β transfected HEK cells with PNGase F greatly decreased binding and uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> monomer and PFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g007">Fig 7E and 7F</xref>). Moreover, neurexin 1β maintained its plasma membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). These data identify neurexin 1β and its glycosylation as key modulators of pathogenic cell-to-cell transmission of αS<sub>acetyl</sub>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we present compelling evidence that cellular internalization of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> by primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells is dependent upon complex, N-linked glycans. αS<sub>acetyl</sub> binds to these complex, N-linked glycans in solution and on cell-derived proteoliposomes. Glycan binding is a novel result for αS<sub>acetyl</sub>, and we propose that it is likely to be critical for recognition of functional protein binding partners. We identify one of those binding partners, neurexin 1β, and show that both its binding to αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and the consequent uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> are dependent upon its glycosylation.</p>
<p>Critically, the underlying factor in our discovery is our use of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and our ability to make direct comparisons between αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un.</sub> Mass spectrometry analysis of αS derived from mammalian brain tissue and various mammalian cells types, as well as from post-mortem human brain tissue, note the presence of the N-terminal acetyl modification on both soluble and insoluble forms of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref037">37</xref>]. However, despite the fact that αS<sub>acetyl</sub> can be produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref019">19</xref>], many studies—including those aimed at understanding function and uptake mechanisms of αS—still rely on the unmodified protein. Current estimates are that approximately 80% of mammalian proteins are modified by N-terminal acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref038">38</xref>]. In contrast to other protein modifications, including side-chain acetylation, no N-terminal deacetylase enzymes have yet been identified, suggesting that N-terminal acetylation is not reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref039">39</xref>]. To illustrate, one recent study found fractional acetylation on lysines 6 and 10 of αS from mouse brain but that the N-terminal acetyl group was ubiquitously present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref011">11</xref>]. For many N-terminally acetylated proteins, e.g., tropomyosin binding to actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref040">40</xref>], this modification is required for recognition of binding partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref041">41</xref>]. Our current work demonstrates that this is true for αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and neurexin 1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g007">Fig 7</xref>) and may also be true for other cellular binding partners of αS. Moreover, the increased uptake (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g003">3</xref>), as well as the resulting enhancement of intracellular aggregate formation induced by αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs relative to αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g001">Fig 1</xref>), provide compelling evidence that N-terminal acetylation of αS has physiological consequences that thus far have been overlooked. From our findings, we speculate that the increased potency of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs in inducing aggregation of endogenous neuronal αS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g001">Fig 1</xref>) may result from more rapid internalization of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFFs relative to αS<sub>un</sub> PFFs. We anticipate that our results may help reconcile conflicting cellular and animal models with biochemical and biophysical studies of αS in which the protein may lack the appropriate modifications.</p>
<p>Disordered proteins such as αS<sub>acetyl</sub> often participate in highly specific—but relatively low-affinity—interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref042">42</xref>]. As such, multivalency provides sufficient avidity for biological interactions between disordered proteins and binding partners in vivo, in examples as diverse as tubulin polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref043">43</xref>], liquid-liquid phase separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref044">44</xref>], and nuclear transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref045">45</xref>]. Intriguingly, interactions between glycan-binding proteins—including lectins—and their binding partners are often described in the same terms. The binding between these proteins and a single glycan is often relatively low affinity (μM-mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref046">46</xref>]. We estimate the apparent K<sub>d</sub> for monomer αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and PNGase F–derived glycans in solution from the FCS data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g006">Fig 6A</xref> to be approximately 10–20 μM. Multivalency both enhances the affinity and confers specificity on the interaction, as high affinity binding only occurs when the correct cluster of glycans is present and in the correct orientation. This requirement may underlie the differences we observe for αS<sub>acetyl</sub> in its interactions with SH-SY5Y and primary neurons relative to HEK cells. While complex N-linked glycans are abundant on all mammalian cells membranes, there are significant differences in the specific glycome between cell types; moreover, the glycome may be modified in response to development or disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref047">47</xref>]. Most glycan-binding proteins are members of well-characterized families and share similar structures or amino acid sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref048">48</xref>]. To our knowledge, there are no prior examples of entirely disordered proteins showing selective binding to complex, N-linked glycans, further underscoring the novelty of our results.</p>
<p>Monomer αS is disordered in solution, with transient helical structure in the amino terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref033">33</xref>]. N-terminal acetylation enhances the helical propensity of the first 12 residues of αS, as well as exerting long-range effects up through approximately residue 50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref049">49</xref>]. These changes in conformational sampling conferred by N-terminal acetylation may have a role in the selective glycan binding of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> relative to αS<sub>un</sub>. Also relevant to our study, which finds that both monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> interact with N-linked glycans, there are several recent structures of αS fibrils that found that the first approximately 45 residues of αS remain flexible and extended—and thus presumably available for binding—in aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref052">52</xref>]. That both monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub> are internalized by SH-SY5Y cells, while only αS<sub>acetyl</sub> uptake is impacted by N-linked glycans and only PFF αS<sub>un</sub> uptake is impacted by Heparinase, strongly suggests that there are multiple modes by which αS interacts with the extracellular plasma membrane. For αS<sub>acetyl</sub>, binding to the extracellular membrane is driven by its specific interactions with N-linked glycans. For αS<sub>un</sub>, binding appears to be derived primarily from interactions with outer leaflet lipids and, for PFF αS<sub>un</sub>, proteoglycans. In all cases, altering the amount of bound αS, whether by cleaving a specific carbohydrate or increasing the amount of glycoprotein (as with neurexin 1β), correspondingly alters the amount of internalized αS.</p>
<p>One consequence of our identification of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> as a glycan-binding protein is that it elicits a reconsideration of interactions between αS and putative binding partners. Many of the proteins identified as such, including glucocerebrosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref053">53</xref>] and Rab3b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref054">54</xref>], as well as the LAG3 and neurexin 1β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref009">9</xref>] examined here, contain N-linked glycosylation sites. Consistent with the description of glycan-binding proteins above, our results with LAG3 and neurexin 1β emphasize the relevance of the specific glycans modifying the glycoprotein in determining binding of αS<sub>acetyl</sub>. Both LAG3 and neurexin 1β are modified by N-linked glycans; however, only the glycans on neurexin 1β mediate binding and uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g007">Fig 7</xref>). As αS is a major target for drug development to treat Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies, identification of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> as a glycan-binding protein provides new considerations for therapeutic approaches.</p>

<title>αS expression and purification</title>
<p>αS was expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21 cells; for αS<sub>acetyl</sub>, BL21 stocks containing the N-terminal acetyltransferase B (NatB) plasmid with orthogonal antibiotic resistance were used. The purification of both αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and αS<sub>un</sub> protein was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref019">19</xref>], with minor modifications. Briefly, two ammonium sulfate cuts were used (0.116 g/mL and 0.244 g/mL) with αS precipitating in the second step. The pellet was resolubilized in Buffer A (25 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) with 1 mM PMSF and dialyzed against Buffer A to remove ammonium sulfate. Dialyzed samples were loaded to an anion exchange column (GE HiTrap Q HP, 5 ml) and eluted with a gradient to 1 M NaCl. αS elutes at approximately 300 mM NaCl. Fractions containing αS were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra concentrators (3,000 Da MWCO). Concentrated samples were then loaded to a size exclusion column (GE HiLoad 16/600 Superdex75) and eluted at 0.5 ml/minute. Fractions containing αS were again pooled and concentrated, then stored at −80°C. All αS constructs used in this work were checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) to confirm correct mass and presence of acetylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s005">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>αS labeling</title>
<p>αS was site-specifically labeled at a single position by introduction of a cysteine at either residue 9 or residue 130. For labeling reactions, freshly purified αS (typically 200–300 μL of approximately 200 μM protein) was incubated with 1 mM DTT for 30 minutes at room temperature to reduce the cysteine. The protein solution was passed over 2 coupled HiTrap Desalting Columns (GE Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) to remove DTT and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl). The protein was incubated overnight at 4°C with stirring with 4× molar excess AL488 or AL594 maleimide (Invitrogen). The labeled protein was concentrated and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl using an Amicon Ultra 3K Concentrator (Millipore, Burlington, MA), with final removal of unreacted dye and remaining GdmCl by passing again over a set of coupled desalting columns equilibrated with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl.</p>
<p>For dual fluorophore labeling for FRET measurements, cysteines were introduced at residues 9 and 72. The protein was labeled as described above, with the following modifications. The protein was first incubated with donor fluorophore AL488 maleimide at a ratio of protein:dye of 1:0.5 for 2 hours at room temperature with stirring. Then, 4× molar excess of acceptor fluorophore AL594 maleimide was added, and the reaction was continued overnight at 4°C. The labeled protein was separated from unreacted dye as described above. αS labeled at these positions has been extensively studied in our lab; as documented in our previous publications, they do not perturb αS binding to lipid membranes and serve as excellent reporters of different conformations of membrane-associated αS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000318.ref055">55</xref>].</p>

The aggregation reaction was analyzed by Congo Red absorbance by diluting 10 μl of the aggregation solution in 140 μl 20 μM Congo Red. The mature fibrils were then pelleted by centrifugation (13,200 rpm for 90 minutes at 4°C), and the supernatant was removed.

<title>Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrates</title>
<p>For cleavage of carbohydrates from GPMVs, endoglycosidases were added to the GPMVs in GPMV buffer at concentrations recommended by the manufacturers (PNGase F: 5,000 units/ml; Endo H: 2,500 units; Heparinase I/III: 2,500 units) and incubated at 37°C for 6 hours. PNGase F was tagged with a chitin binding domain (Remove-IT PNGase F, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). For the images shown in this manuscript, the enzyme was removed by incubation of GPMVs with 50 μl of chitin binding magnetic beads. Control experiments were conducted without removal of PNGase F and found to be comparable. Cleavage of N-linked glycans by PNGase F was confirmed by comparing images of GPMVs +/− PNGase F treatment after incubation with 50 nM conA, a lectin that binds to binding to α-D-mannose and α-D-glucose moieties, or wheat germ agglutinin, a lectin that binds to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and sialic acid. A significant decrease in the amount of both proteins is observed in these images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s010">S6B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>For cleavage of carbohydrates from cells, cells were first plated for 42 hours. After 42 hours, media were removed from cells and replaced with FBS-free media complimented with the endoglycosidase (PNGase F: 5,000 units/ml; Endo H: 2,500 units; Heparinase I/II: 2,500 units). The cells were incubated at 37°C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for an additional 6 hours. The media were then removed and replaced with cell growth media prior to the addition of αS. Cleavage of N-linked glycans from cells was confirmed by comparing images +/−- PNGase F treatment after incubation with 50 nM conA-AL488, showing a significant reduction in the amount of conA bound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s009">S5D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To ensure that PNGase F is removed from GPMVs or cells after incubation (and therefore does not remain associated with either, blocking potential αS binding sites), we compared the amount of PNGase F added to either GPMVs or cells with that removed after incubation. PNGase F (5,000 units/ml) containing a chitin domain was added to chambers containing either GPMVs or cells and was incubated at 37°C for 6 hours, as for the experiments described above. After incubation, the buffer or media containing PNGase F were removed and incubated with chitin magnetic beads to isolate and concentrate the enzyme. Blank chambers containing only PNGase F in buffer or media were subjected to the same treatment; 20 μL of each sample was run on a 4%–12% polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie blue. Gels were imaged using a Typhoon FLA7000 gel imager (GE Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) using Coomassie stain mode.

<p>All cell imaging was carried out by confocal fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus FV3000 scanning system configured on a IX83 inverted microscope platform with a 60× Plan-Apo/1.1-NA water-immersion objective with DIC capability (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For all experiments, the gain setting for the blue channel was kept constant from sample to sample (excitation 488 nm, emission BP 500–540 nm). For detection of αS-AL594, the green channel was used (excitation 561 nm, emission BP 570–620 nm). Images were obtained in 8-well ibidi chambers (μ-Slide, 8-well glass bottom, ibidi GmbH, Germany) coated with Poly-D-lysine and were seeded with 20,000–25,000 cells/well. Cells were cultured for 48 hours after passage before beginning experiments. For cellular uptake experiments, 200 nM αS-AL488 was incubated with cells for 0 to 24 hours before acquiring images. For experiments using deglycosylated cells, cells were pretreated with the tested endoglycosidase for 6 hours as described above prior to addition of protein. For colocalization with lysosomes, cells were treated with 75 nM Lysotracker Deep Red (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hour prior to imaging. For all experiments, the gain setting for each channel was kept constant from sample to sample.</p>

For SH-SY5Y cells, internalized αS was quantified either by analysis of the punctate structures in the cells or by the total cellular fluorescence; for primary neurons, internalized αS was quantified by total cellular fluorescence. For total cellular fluorescence, the integrated fluorescence intensity of the cells is reported. Cellular puncta were analyzed using the Image J particle analysis plug-in. This algorithm detects puncta through a user-defined threshold and counts the number of puncta that meet or exceed the threshold. The threshold was initially defined by manual identification and averaging of a subset of puncta. Colocalization with lysosomes was computed by obtaining a Pearson coefficient using the ImageJ plugin for colocalization (Coloc_2).</p>

Images acquired with this instrument were in lifetime mode but were integrated to obtain intensity-based images comparable to typical confocal images. This instrument has the advantage of very sensitive avalanche photodiode detectors (SPADs) that are capable at detecting nM concentrations of protein. Fluorescence intensities were analyzed via the lifetime mode (both intensity and FRET images) using SymPhoTime 64 (PicoQuant, Berlin, Germany).

<p>For FLIM-FRET experiments, measurements were made of donor-only and donor-acceptor labeled proteins. SPAD signals were processed with the TimeHarp 300 photon counting board and analyzed with the SymPhoTime 64 software (PicoQuant, Berlin, Germany) taking into account the instrument response function to allow consideration of short lifetime components with a high accuracy. FLIM images were acquired for 180 seconds, with a pixel integration time of 40 μs per pixel and an average photon count rate of 10,000–30,000 counts per second. Regions of interest of the GPMV membrane were selected from FLIM images, and fluorescent lifetimes were obtained from TCSPC decay curves fitted by an exponential equation using the SymPhoTime 64 software. Fitting of the fluorescence images was then performed pixel wise with a single exponential model on all pixels above an intensity threshold of 200 photons. By characterizing donor lifetime in the absence and presence of acceptor, ET<sub>eff</sub> can be calculated from:

<title>GPMV binding and cellular uptake by FCS</title>
<p>FCS was used to monitor αS both binding to GPMVs and uptake by cells. FCS measurements were made on the instrument described above. For GPMV binding, experiments were performed in 8-well NUNC chambers (Thermo Scientific, Rochester, NY) containing 250 μl of GMPV at 5 μM phospholipid concentration. The laser focal volume was located to a height of 100 μm from the bottom surface of the wells, above all GMPVs. αS-AL488 (80 nM) was added to wells with GPMVs, and the autocorrelation measurements were taken immediately and after 60 minutes. Each curve was integrated for 30 seconds and repeated 10 times, and data were analyzed as described above. Binding was quantified by measuring the change in the number of molecules, <italic>N</italic>, of fluorescently labeled αS present in the solution surrounding the GMPVs relative to the starting concentration. There was no change in the diffusion time of the αS that remained in the cell media over this time course, evidence that protein is stable and the fluorophore intact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s013">S9B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>For cell uptake experiments, cells were plated in phenol red-free medium in 8-well ibidi chambers (μ-Slide, 8-well glass bottom, ibidi GmbH, Germany) coated with Poly-D-lysine wells and cultured for 48 hours prior to measurements. Control wells contained the same volume of media without cells; these control for nonspecific adsorption of protein to the well surfaces. αS-AL488 (200 nM) was added to the wells at the start of the experiment, and the autocorrelation curves were taken in the medium well above the cells, at a height of 100 μm from the bottom surface of the wells. The curves were collected at regular intervals, over a period ranging from 2 to 24 hours, and each autocorrelation curve integrated for 30 seconds, repeated 10 times. Data were analyzed as described above. Cellular uptake was assessed by measuring the change in the number of molecules of fluorescently labeled αS present in the media surrounding the cells relative to the starting concentration. In between measurements, the chambers were returned to the incubators to maintain the temperature in the wells at 37°C. As a negative control for both the GPMV binding and cell uptake studies, GPMVs or cells were incubated with 80 nM eGFP. There was no evidence of eGFP binding to the GPMVs nor of internalization by SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s013">S9C Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The PNGase F–derived glycans are a heterogeneous mixture of complex glycans of various sizes and monosaccharide building blocks. For comparison with the mono- and trisaccharide measurements, we approximated the amount of PNGase F–derived carbohydrate from μg (as determined by the carbohydrate quantification assay described above) to μM using the molecular weight of glucose, 180.16 g/mol. Thus, the 1.3:1 molar ratio reported in the NMR refers to the approximate number of available monosaccharide groups from the PNGase F glycans; the actual concentration of complex N-linked glycans is much lower.</p>
<p>Binding to the PNGase F–derived glycans results in nonuniform peak intensity increases throughout the sequence of αS. For analysis, 9 peaks showing large increases (T22, K32, T44, H50, T59, T64, G86, G93, and N103) and 9 peaks showing small or no increases (A17, A27, L38, V40, V71, V95, I112, E130, and Y136) were selected to roughly cover the entire sequence. The same residues were used for each analyzed dataset. For each set of peaks, the relative magnitude of increase (compared to αS in solution without glycans) expressed as a percentage was calculated and averaged.</p>

<title>Characterization of monomer and PFF αS.</title>
<p>(A) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to confirm the presence of the N-terminal acetyl group as well as the purity of the samples for both unlabeled and AL488-labeled αS. The expected masses for αS<sub>acetyl</sub><sup>E130C</sup> and αS<sub>acetyl</sub><sup>E130C</sup>-AL488 are 14,576 and 15,174, respectively; for αS<sub>un</sub><sup>E130C</sup> and αS<sub>un</sub><sup>E130C</sup>-AL488, they are 14,434 and 15,132, respectively; the reported values are within expected accuracy for MALDI-TOF. (B) The fibril morphology before and after sonication was examined by TEM at 100,000x magnification. Scale bar = 200 μm.(C) Frequency distribution of PFF length following sonication; 50 fibers were measured, with an average length of 192.2 ± 56.9 nm for αS<sub>acetyl</sub> and 209.7 ± 110.2 nm for αS<sub>un</sub>. (D) PAGE analysis at the end of the aggregation assay indicates that very little monomer αS is present in PFF preparations. 1 = molecular weight standards; 2 = αS<sub>acetyl</sub> pellet; 3 = αS<sub>acetyl</sub> supernatant; 4 = αS<sub>un</sub> pellet; 5 = αS<sub>un</sub> supernatant.

<title>Time-dependent endocytosis of αSacetyl monomer and PFFs.</title>
<p>(A) Time-dependent uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> (green) monomer or PFFs by untreated or PNGase F–treated SH-SY5Y cells. Incubation time indicated above each image. Cells were stained with LysoTracker Deep Red (purple) prior to imaging. (B) Image overlap statistics for (A) of LysoTracker and αS<sub>acetyl</sub> monomer and PFFs at the indicated incubation time. Colocalization was analyzed with the Pearson correlation coefficient. A larger coefficient reflects more overlap between αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488 puncta and LysoTracker puncta (endosomes). Correlation coefficient was computed using the ImageJ plugin for colocalization (<italic>n</italic> = 100 cells, 3 independent experiments). Scale bars = 20 μm.

<title>Quantification of cell uptake measured by PAGE analysis.</title>
<p>Uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> monomer (200 nM αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488) or PFFs (200 nM in monomer units, 20:1 αS<sub>acetyl</sub>:αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488) by SH-SY5Y cells as measured by PAGE analysis with fluorescence imaging of the gels (to detect only αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488). (Upper) Gels show αS<sub>acetyl</sub> remaining in the media at the time points indicated above the gels. Uptake is measured by quantifying the decrease of αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488 in the media as a function of time. Quantification of the gels is shown as the scatter plot for monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub> +/− PNGase F treatment. The measurements are analogous to the FCS measurements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2C</xref> in the main manuscript, and the results of both approaches are comparable. (Lower) Gels show αS<sub>acetyl</sub> internalized by cells at the time points indicated above the gels. Uptake is measured by quantifying the amount of αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488 from lysed cells as a function of time. Transferrin-AL488, which exhibits very rapid uptake kinetics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s008">S4C Fig</xref>), was added to cells for 30 minutes prior to lysis, to be used as loading control. The scatter plot compares the amount of internalized monomer and PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub>, and the bar plot compares the amount of both forms internalized +/− PNGase F treatment. Quantification of gel band intensity was computed using ImageJ. These measurements are analogous to the image analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, and the results from both approaches are comparable. For each experiment, 3 independent measurements were made. The underlying data for this figure can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000318.s001">S1 Data</xref>.</p>

<title>Clathrin-dependent endocytosis.</title>
<p>(A) Inhibition of endocytosis monitored by uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> monomer or PFFs at 4°C. Images are shown of uptake of protein at 37°C and 4°C for each condition. Protein was added to the cells followed by incubation at 4°C for 30 minutes. The controls were then moved to 37°C incubator. The two groups of cells were incubated in the respective temperatures for an additional 4 hours. (B) HEK cells incubated with αS <sub>acetyl</sub> monomer or PFFs for 12 hours. (C) Rates of clathrin-dependent endocytosis of SH-SH5Y and HEK cells compared by loss of 100 nM transferrin-AL488 from extracellular medium of cells as measured by FCS.

<title>Treatment of cells with endoglycosidases.</title>
<p>(A) Heparinase treatment of SH-SY5Y cells inhibits uptake of αS<sub>un</sub> PFF (upper) but not of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> PFF (lower). Images made after 12 hours of incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with 200 nM PFF αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488 or αS<sub>un</sub>-AL488 (concentration in monomer units, 20:1 αS:αS-AL488) following treatment with Heparinase. (B) Heparinase and Endo H treatments of SH-SY5Y cells do not inhibit uptake of monomer αS<sub>acetyl</sub>. Images were made after 12 hours of incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with monomer αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL488 (200 nM) following treatment with Endo H or Heparinase. Quantification of monomer αS<sub>acetyl</sub> uptake by SH-SY5Y cells treated with Endo H or Heparinase shown relative to PNGase F–treated or–untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000318.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Numbers of puncta were computed using the ImageJ plugin for particle analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 100 cells, 3 independent experiments, significance analyzed by Student <italic>t</italic> test.

(D) (Upper) Uptake of transferrin and αS<sub>acetyl</sub> by PNGase F–treated SH-SY5Y cells. Internalization of transferrin-AL488 is not impacted by this treatment, indicating that clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways are functional. Uptake of αS<sub>acetyl</sub>-AL594 is significantly reduced. (Lower) As with the SH-SY5Y cells, uptake of transferrin by primary neurons from embryonic mouse hippocampus is not impacted by PNGase F treatment, indicating that clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways are functional. (E) Colorimetric measure of toxicity following the incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with 200 nM αS<sub>acetyl</sub> monomer or PFFs (concentration in monomer units) for times indicated on plots. Data are expressed relative to vehicle-only addition. Each histogram bar is the average of 8 on-plate repeats across each of 3 independently performed replicates (<italic>n</italic> = 24).

<title>PNGase F does not remain bound to cell membranes after incubation.</title>
<p>(A) The amount of PNGase F before and after treatment of GPMVs and SH-SY5Y cells was examined by PAGE. The majority of the enzyme is recovered from the GPMV buffer or cell media, indicating that it does not remain bound to the membranes, potentially blocking αS<sub>acetyl</sub> binding. (B) αS<sub>acetyl</sub> is stable during incubation with cell media during uptake studies. FCS was used to monitor the diffusion time of αS<sub>acetyl</sub> in media as a function of time during incubation with SH-SY5Y cells. The diffusion time is stable over the 24-hour period, indicating that the protein is not degraded nor is the fluorophore cleaved, both of which would be expected to result in a faster diffusion time. (C) SH-SY5Y GPMVs and cells do not bind or uptake eGFP, respectively. eGFP was used as negative control. The addition of 80 nM eGFP to GPMVs shows no evidence of binding. Likewise, there is no evidence of uptake of eGFP by SH-SY5Y cells following 12 hours of incubation. Scale bar = 20 μm.
