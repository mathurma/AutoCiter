                <p>Perception involves two types of decisions about the sensory world:
                    identification of stimulus features as analog quantities, or discrimination of
                    the same stimulus features among a set of discrete alternatives. Veridical
                    judgment and categorical discrimination have traditionally been conceptualized
                    as two distinct computational problems. Here, we found that these two types of
                    decision making can be subserved by a shared cortical circuit mechanism. We used
                    a continuous recurrent network model to simulate two monkey experiments in which
                    subjects were required to make either a two-alternative forced choice or a
                    veridical judgment about the direction of random-dot motion. The model network
                    is endowed with a continuum of bell-shaped population activity patterns, each
                    representing a possible motion direction. Slow recurrent excitation underlies
                    accumulation of sensory evidence, and its interplay with strong recurrent
                    inhibition leads to decision behaviors. The model reproduced the
                    monkey's performance as well as single-neuron activity in the
                    categorical discrimination task. Furthermore, we examined how direction
                    identification is determined by a combination of sensory stimulation and
                    microstimulation. Using a population-vector measure, we found that direction
                    judgments instantiate winner-take-all (with the population vector coinciding
                    with either the coherent motion direction or the electrically elicited motion
                    direction) when two stimuli are far apart, or vector averaging (with the
                    population vector falling between the two directions) when two stimuli are close
                    to each other. Interestingly, for a broad range of intermediate angular
                    distances between the two stimuli, the network displays a mixed strategy in the
                    sense that direction estimates are stochastically produced by winner-take-all on
                    some trials and by vector averaging on the other trials, a model prediction that
                    is experimentally testable. This work thus lends support to a common
                    neurodynamic framework for both veridical judgment and categorical
                    discrimination in perceptual decision making.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>In daily life, we constantly face two types of perceptual decisions: to identify
                    an object feature (what is the speed of that car?) or to discriminate the same
                    feature among two or more possible categories (is that car going faster than the
                    speed limit?). These decision processes appear to involve very different
                    computations: while identification relies on an analog judgment, categorical
                    discrimination is based on a comparison of the object feature with discrete
                    options. Do they engage entirely separate brain mechanisms? In this work, we
                    showed that these two types of decision making can be instantiated by a single
                    cortical circuit. We used a continuous recurrent network model to simulate two
                    monkey experiments in which subjects were required to make either a
                    two-alternative choice or a veridical judgment about the direction of random-dot
                    motion. The model reproduced salient experimental observations and makes
                    testable predictions. The results demonstrate that a common cortical circuit can
                    perform both categorical discrimination and veridical judgment. Conceptually,
                    this work supports the notion that a cortical circuit endowed with reverberatory
                    dynamics can fulfill multiple cognitive functions such as working memory and
                    decision making.</p>

            <p>Perceptual judgments involve detection, identification and discrimination of objects
                in a sensory scene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Luce1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Jazayeri1">[2]</xref>. Given an ambiguous visual motion pattern, for
                instance, a subject may be asked to detect whether a net motion direction is present
                or absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Cook1">[3]</xref>, to identify the motion direction as an analog
                quantity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Nichols1">[4]</xref>, or to discriminate the motion direction between two
                options (e.g., left or right) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Britten1">[5]</xref>. Using the strategy of single-unit recording from
                behaving monkeys, neurophysiologists have begun to uncover neuronal activity that is
                linked to such perceptual judgments (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Parker1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wang1">[11]</xref>). In
                monkey experiments using perceptual discrimination tasks, neural correlates of
                decision making have been observed in the parietal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Shadlen1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>, premotor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Hernndez1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Romo3">[16]</xref> and prefrontal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Kim1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Machens1">[18]</xref>
                cortical areas. Experimental observations have inspired the advance of neural
                circuit models which suggest that recurrent (attractor) network dynamics can
                underlie temporal integration of sensory information (accumulation of evidence) and
                decision formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Machens1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Deco2">[25]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Focusing on categorical discrimination, those neural circuit models as well as
                abstract ramp-to-threshold models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Ratcliff1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Ditterich1">[30]</xref> are typically
                endowed with a simple architecture consisting of discrete neural pools, selective
                for categorical alternatives. Therefore, they are inadequate for exploring
                perceptual identification that requires neural representation of analog quantities,
                such as motion direction that can be an arbitrary angle between 0° and
                360°. On the other hand, probabilistic estimation of an analog stimulus
                feature has been studied from the perspective of optimal population coding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Jazayeri1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Seung1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Pouget1">[32]</xref>. These
                studies centered on optimal algorithms for reading out a stimulus feature from
                sensory neural populations, such as inferring the orientation of a visual stimulus
                from neural activity in the primary visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Seris1">[33]</xref> and the direction of a
                motion stimulus from activity profiles across the middle temporal visual area (MT)
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Jazayeri1">[2]</xref>.
                However, such probabilistic inference is believed to occur in higher-order cortical
                areas downstream from primary sensory areas, and the underlying circuit mechanism
                remains unclear. In particular, it is unknown whether probabilistic estimation and
                categorical discrimination engage distinct decision processes or can be realized by
                a shared neural circuit mechanism.</p>
            <p>In the present work, we investigated this outstanding question using a continuous
                recurrent network model of spiking neurons, which was initially proposed for spatial
                working memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Compte1">[34]</xref>. We applied this model to the simulation of two
                monkey experiments using random-dot visual motion stimuli. In a two-alternative
                forced-choice direction discrimination task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), the monkey was trained to
                discriminate the motion direction by making a saccadic eye movement to one of two
                peripheral choice targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Shadlen1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Huk1">[35]</xref>. It was found that ramp-like spiking activity of
                neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) is correlated with the
                monkey's choice. By contrast, in a direction identification task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), the monkey was
                required to report veridically its perceived direction of motion in the visual
                stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Nichols1">[4]</xref>. On some trials, electrical stimulation was applied
                simultaneously to MT neurons when the monkey viewed the random-dot display.
                Microstimulation could bias the monkey's judgments toward the preferred
                direction of MT neurons at the microstimulation site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Nichols1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Salzman1">[36]</xref>. It was argued that
                both vector-averaging and winner-take-all algorithms might contribute to the
                interpretation of activity profiles of MT neurons. But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Nichols1">[4]</xref> collected only
                behavioral data and did not record neural activity in MT or downstream cortical
                areas. Thus, the neural mechanism for veridical judgments about the motion direction
                remains unknown.</p>

                    <p>(A) Reaction-time version of a two-alternative forced-choice direction
                        discrimination task. A trial began when the monkey fixated a point on the
                        display monitor. Two choice targets then appeared in the periphery. One was
                        within the response field (RF) of the recorded neuron, and the other was in
                        the opposite hemisphere. After a delay, a dynamic random-dot display
                        appeared, where a fraction of dots moved coherently toward one of the two
                        targets while the others moved randomly in all other directions. The monkey
                        was allowed to make a saccadic eye movement toward a target at any time when
                        it was ready. (B) Direction identification task. After fixation, a
                        random-dot motion stimulus appeared inside a target ring and lasted 1 s.
                        When the fixation point was extinguished, the monkey made a saccadic eye
                        movement to the location on the target ring toward which the dots had moved.
                        On some trials, electrical stimulation was simultaneously applied to MT
                        neurons.</p>

            <p>Here we show that the continuous recurrent network model is capable of reproducing

                categorical discrimination and veridical judgment can be subserved by a common
                cortical circuit endowed with reverberatory dynamics.</p>

                <p>Our model is designed to simulate two perceptual decision tasks in which the
                    decision is about the net direction of a random-dot motion stimulus. Since the
                    directional angle is a one-dimensional quantity, we used a continuous network
                    model in which each neuron is selective for a motion direction, from 0°
                    to 360°. Our model network does not directly map onto LIP, in which
                    neurons have response fields in a two-dimensional visual space. However, our
                    model is adequate for simulating the two tasks, and we do not anticipate that a
                    two-dimensional version of our model would behave in qualitatively different
                    ways.</p>
                <p>The model network is composed of <italic>N</italic><sub>E</sub> pyramidal cells
                    and <italic>N</italic><sub>I</sub> interneurons. The network architecture is

                        <p>(A) Schematic illustration of network structure. The network is composed
                            of 2,048 pyramidal cells and 512 interneurons. Excitatory cells are
                            labeled and arranged by their preferred motion directions (from
                            0° to 360°). The connectivity between pyramidal cells is
                            structured, and the synaptic strength is a Gaussian function of the
                            difference between their preferred directions (solid curve). Connections
                            to or from inhibitory interneurons are broad. (B) Spatial profile and
                            time course of input rates in the direction discrimination task.
                            External inputs to the network from two targets and the motion stimulus
                            are separately modeled as excitatory synaptic currents mediated by AMPA
                            receptors, with presynaptic spikes emitted based on Poisson processes.
                            Poisson rates are depicted in the figure as a function of preferred
                            directions of neurons and time: the maximum input rate from two targets,
                            the input rate from the motion stimulus for four different motion
                            strength, and their corresponding time courses, respectively (from top
                            to bottom). For the target input, the effects of spike-rate adaptation
                            and divided attention upon stimulus onset are included. (C) Spatial
                            profile of input rate in the direction identification task. The inputs
                            from both the motion stimulus and microstimulation are modeled as
                            excitatory synaptic currents. The profiles of Poisson rate are shown for
                            four different stimulus directions with the microstimulated direction
                            fixed at 90°.</p>

                <p>The network is endowed with pyramidal-to-pyramidal, pyramidal-to-interneuron,
                    interneuron-to-pyramidal, and interneuron-to-interneuron connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). For the sake of
                    simplicity, only the connectivity between pyramidal cells is structured.
                    Recurrent excitatory currents are mediated by AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and NMDA
                    receptors (NMDARs), while inhibitory currents are mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub>
                    receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub> Rs). External excitatory inputs include those from
                    MT neurons, which represent visual motion stimuli and electrically elicited
                    directional signals. When simulating the categorical discrimination task,
                    additional inputs represent the presentation of choice targets. All neurons also
                    receive background synaptic input mimicking spontaneous activity outside the
                    local network. In simulations, all these external currents are mediated
                    exclusively by AMPARs.</p>

                    Poisson process with a rate of 1.5 KHz independently from cell to cell. The

NMDA currents have a voltage dependence that is controlled by

                    [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] = 1

                <p>In simulations of the discrimination task, the maximum recurrent synaptic
                    conductances (in <italic>µ</italic>S) were taken as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These conductances are scaled inversely proportionally to the
                    number of pyramidal cells and of interneurons, respectively. This is to keep the
                    total synaptic conductances unchanged when network size is varied. With these
                    parameter values, NMDAR channels contribute 85% to recurrent
                    excitatory charge entry at a holding potential of −65 mV. To simulate
                    the identification task, we decreased the conductance values except <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Meanwhile, we increased the ratio of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> so that the overall recurrent inhibition is decreased. The
                    following values were used: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as well as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and

                    In this case, NMDAR channels contribute 83.5% to recurrent excitatory
                    charge entry at a holding potential of −65 mV. Three features are
                    worth noting. First, recurrent excitation is taken to be primarily mediated by
                    NMDARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wang3">[38]</xref>. Second, the network is dominated by recurrent

                    models the spike-rate adaptation of upstream neurons encoding the targets and
                    the presumed divided attention upon stimulus onset. The adaptation time constant
                        <italic>τ</italic><sub>ad</sub> was set to 80 ms. Upon the stimulus
                    onset, the strength of target input is assumed to be reduced, presumably
                    resulting from a cross inhibition between upstream neurons separately signaling
                    the motion stimulus and the targets, or because the subject's covert
                    attention is shifted from the targets to the stimulus. Consequently, the neural
                    activity decreases momentarily, resembling a brief
                    ‘dip-and-rise’ in firing rate of LIP neurons. We used the

                    the model circuit receive excitatory synaptic input from MT neurons representing

                    80% representing a vivid suprathreshold stimulus unless specified
                    otherwise. This is so because the experimental study aimed to investigate the
                    interaction between this suprathreshold motion stimulus and microstimulation at
                    varying angular distances. Other parameter values were chosen so that the

                <p>For both the direction discrimination and identification tasks, we used the same
                    measure to read out direction judgment. It is determined by a population vector
                    scheme as follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Georgopoulos1">[43]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000253.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic> is the instantaneous firing

                            <italic>θ<sub>i</sub></italic>. Especially, the value of
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>PV</sub> at stimulus offset is denoted by
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>E</sub>, which represents a direction
                    estimate on individual trials. <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic> is calculated as
                    follows. For each time window of 40 ms (with a sliding window being 5 ms), the
                    total spike number is counted and divided by the time window.</p>
                <p>For the reaction-time version of the discrimination task, we also read out
                    decision time based on threshold crossing of neural population firing rates.
                    Specifically, we calculated the instantaneous population firing rates,
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub>, of two
                    neural pools separately centered at <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>, each consisting of 140 cells and
                    spanning 360°×(140/2048)∼24°. That is, each
                    pool consists of cells with their preferred directions within
                    ∼±12° around <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub>
                    or <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>. The time bin was 40 ms, and a
                    sliding window of 5 ms was used to smooth data. Decision time is calculated by
                    assuming that a decision is made whenever <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> or
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> first reaches a prescribed threshold, which
                    was set to 57 Hz to fit behavioral data. Decision times can be compared with
                    experimentally recorded reaction times by adding a non-decision response time
                    ∼70 ms (i.e., the additional time it takes for a monkey to generate a

                <p>Model simulations used the same protocol as in the reaction-time version of a
                    two-alternative direction discrimination task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g003">Figure 3A</xref> displays typical
                    network activity in response to both two targets and a random-dot motion
                    stimulus at zero coherence. The network activity is monitored by plotting its
                    spatiotemporal firing pattern (<italic>upper panel</italic>). A trial begins
                    with the network in a resting state in which cells exhibit low spontaneous
                    firing. Two targets are then separately presented at
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> (90°) and
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub> (270°), instructing the
                    network two choice options. In response, two neural pools separately centered
                    around <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub> show persistent elevated activity,
                    with neural discharges quite asynchronous. Thus, the profile of network activity
                    exhibits two symmetric ‘bumps’ separately centered at
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>. That is, there is no
                    winner-take-all competition in the symmetric state. This has also been observed
                    in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong2">[23]</xref>
                    and can be understood as follows. In our model, recurrent excitation is
                    dominated by the NMDARs-mediated current, which saturates at high firing rates
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wang3">[38]</xref>. The winner-take-all mechanism requires not only
                    global inhibition but also recruitment of synaptic excitation. This recurrent
                    excitation saturates at (symmetric) high firing rates, and thus no
                    winner-take-all occurs.</p>
                <p>Upon the onset of motion stimulus, neural activity decreases transiently owing to
                    a reduced efficacy of target input (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). The biological origin of this reduction is currently unknown;
                    possible scenarios include a cross inhibition between upstream neurons
                    separately signaling the targets and the motion stimulus and that the
                    subject's covert attention may be shifted from the targets to the
                    stimulus. After the visual signal reaches the decision circuit (with a latency
                    of 200 ms), the two neural pools integrate the signal and compete against each
                    other through shared inhibitory feedback from interneurons. Eventually, one
                    neural pool wins the competition and increases its activity, while the
                    other's activity is greatly suppressed, leading to a categorical
                    choice. Note that winner-take-all competition occurs even when the stimulus
                    input is uniform across the network. This is interpreted as follows. The
                    symmetric state with high firing rates is stable only for sufficiently strong
                    inputs. It disappears and is replaced by asymmetric states (with one of the two
                    bumps growing while the other shrinking) when the target input is reduced to
                    lower levels after stimulus onset, similar to the behavior of a model network
                    composed of discrete neural pools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong2">[23]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The decision process can be revealed by showing the time course of population

                    resembling the LIP response to target presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Shadlen1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Huk1">[35]</xref>. After the motion stimulus is delivered, both
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> first
                    decrease and then rise together to nearly the same level as before stimulus
                    onset. Such a dip-and-rise has been widely observed in experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Huk1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Sato1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Li1">[46]</xref>. Afterwards,
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> begin to
                    diverge over time, with <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> climbing up while
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> decaying down in this example. This subserves
                    the formation of a binary decision. A choice is made when
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> reaches a prescribed threshold. Throughout
                    the decision process, there is a dynamic balance between recurrent excitation
                    and inhibition, as the activity of interneurons builds up in parallel with that
                    of winning pyramidal cells (data not shown). This excitation-inhibition balance
                    is important for ensuring network stability and, together with background
                    synaptic noise, contributes to stochastic network dynamics. Given the stimulus
                    at zero coherence, this stochasticity determines the choice outcome on any given
                    trial, and thus the decision is at chance level across trials.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g003">Figure 3A</xref> also displays the
                    time course of the mean firing rate of the pyramidal cells which are not
                    activated directly by the two target inputs (blue curve). After the presentation
                    of two targets, since the two activated neural pools (in the
                    “bumps”) excite interneurons, which in turn send feedback
                    inhibition globally to the entire network, those pyramidal cells show a
                    suppressed activity compared to the spontaneous state. After the visual stimulus
                    reaches the decision network, those cells also receive an extra external
                    activation (e.g., the motion stimulus is uniform at zero coherence). Meanwhile,
                    the feedback inhibition decreases because of the drop of neural activity in one
                    of the two bumps. These two factors combined lead to the increase of firing
                    activity of those cells.</p>
                <p>In the monkey experiment, coherence level or motion strength
                    <italic>c</italic>′ refers to the fraction of dots that move
                    coherently in one particular direction (e.g., 90°) while the others move
                    randomly in all other directions with a uniform distribution in the random-dot
                    display. This is implemented in the model as bell-shaped input profiles (see
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which mimic
                    the activity profiles of MT neurons at different coherence levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Britten2">[39]</xref>.
                    In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g003">Figure 3B</xref> is shown the
                    network activity on single trials with stimuli at nonzero coherence levels.
                    After two targets are presented, two bumps separately develop around
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>. Since the targets exist throughout
                    the trial, they ‘instruct’ the network two choice options
                    and always exert an influence on the decision process. After stimulus onset,
                    neural activity first decreases briefly and then rises. Furthermore, there is a
                    transition from the symmetric state to the asymmetric state, where one bump
                    eventually becomes predominant over the other. This transition occurs faster
                    with increasing coherence level.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g003">Figure 3C</xref> displays the time

                        <italic>c</italic>′ values. Immediately after stimulus onset,
                    there is a dip-and-rise in population activity, which is independent of motion
                    strength, similar to the observation from LIP neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Huk1">[35]</xref>. About
                    200 ms after stimulus onset, <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> begin to diverge and vary in a ramp-like
                    pattern, which underlies the network's temporal integration of sensory
                    inputs. The ramping activity is faster with a larger slope at higher
                    <italic>c</italic>′. Moreover, at lower <italic>c</italic>′,
                    immediately after the dip-and-rise, the firing rate of the winning pool shows a
                    momentary plateau for ∼100 ms before it ramps up (see
                    <italic>red</italic>, <italic>green and blue solid curves</italic>). This
                    biphasic behavior (i.e., plateau-and-ramp) has been observed in LIP activity
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Ditterich1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Huk1">[35]</xref> and in our previous model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong1">[21]</xref>.
                    Therefore, the graded ramping activity reflects the quality of sensory evidence,
                    and the ultimate divergence in spiking rate of competing neural pools gives rise
                    to a choice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g003">Figure 3C</xref> is
                    remarkably similar to the LIP activity observed experimentally (see Figure 7A in

                    neuron was recorded at a time in the experiment. Nevertheless, the simulation
                    results can be compared with the physiological data, if the activity of the
                    winning (respectively losing) pool is mapped onto that of an LIP neuron on
                    trials when the monkey's choice is toward (respectively away from) its
                    preferred direction. Therefore, the model reproduces the salient characteristics
                    of LIP activity correlated with perceptual decision making.</p>

                    saccadic response is triggered, the up-ramping activity of LIP neurons reaches a
                    stereotypical level that is independent of coherence level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Huk1">[35]</xref>. The
                    generation of saccadic motor responses is not explicitly modeled here. At each
                    coherence level, the sum of the mean decision time and a fixed non-decision time
                    (about 70 ms) is comparable with the experimentally measured reaction time
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In
                    addition, the mean decision time decreases nearly linearly with
                    <italic>c</italic>′ on a logarithmic scale, in agreement with the
                    behavioral data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>. Consistent with the population activity
                    shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, the mean
                    decision time is longer on error trials than on correct trials. Note that the
                    shape of the histogram for decision time depends remarkably on coherence level
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). At
                    high coherence levels, decision times are narrowly distributed around a short
                    time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). At lower
                    coherence levels, the up-ramping neural activity is slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), resulting in longer decision
                    times and broader distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Decision times are more variable on error trials (right
                    panels) than on correct trials (left panels). Thus, our model reproduces salient

                    random-dot motion stimulus was presented for a fixed duration of 1 s, followed
                    by a saccadic eye movement indicating the monkey's judgment. On some
                    trials, electrical stimulation was simultaneously applied to MT neurons for 1 s,
                    and its impact on the monkey's direction estimates was measured. In
                    this task, the monkey had the complete freedom to report veridically its

                    activity on three trials. Owing to noisy input and stochastic neural dynamics,
                    the network activity varies from trial to trial. On the first trial, one bump

                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>PV</sub> at stimulus offset, approximately
                    equals <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>; that is, the direction estimate
                    corresponds to the microstimulated direction. On the second trial, a single bump

                    and hence the estimate corresponds to the stimulus direction. On the third

                    equals 174°, closer to the stimulus direction than to the

                <p>The model network integrates external inputs in the form of slow ramping
                    activity, as if the motion stimulus and microstimulation provide conflicting
                    evidence for direction judgments. This can be seen in the time course of
                    population firing rates, <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub>, of the two neural pools separately centered
                    at <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> and

                    trials, <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> first
                    ramp up together and then begin to diverge at a time that varies considerably
                    from trial to trial. After the diverging point, one further ramps up, while the
                    other ramps down. On the third trial, <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> remain comparable with
                        <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> slightly larger than
                    <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub>, consistent with the fact that the direction
                    estimate is closer to the stimulus direction. Therefore, even when the motion
                    strength is as high as 80%, the network behavior can be drastically
                    distinct on different trials. This implies that the integration process is
                    essentially stochastic. Moreover, here direction estimates are based on the
                    profile of network activity, i.e., population averaging. If we instead used a
                    scheme in which direction estimate is assigned by the preferred direction of the
                    most active neuron, it would always be around either

                        Δ<italic>θ</italic> = |<italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>−<italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub>|

                    Qualitatively, three types of effects can be distinguished. First, for a small
                        Δ<italic>θ</italic> (e.g., 45° with
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 45°
                    or 135°), direction estimates from individual trials spread out between
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>. Second, for an intermediate
                        Δ<italic>θ</italic> (e.g., 135° with
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 225°
                    or
                    <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 315°),
                    the distribution of <italic>θ</italic><sub>E</sub> values is
                    discontinuous; most estimates cluster around either
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> or
                    <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>, but other estimates scatter between the
                    two directions. Third, for a large Δ<italic>θ</italic> (e.g.,
                    180° with
                    <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 270°),
                    the distribution of <italic>θ</italic><sub>E</sub> values is bimodal,
                    narrowly centered at <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g007">Figure 7D</xref> depicts the shift
                    of the mean value of <italic>θ</italic><sub>E</sub> away from the
                    stimulus direction because of microstimulation, which can bias direction
                    estimates toward the microstimulated direction. This effect occurs over nearly
                    the whole range of stimulus directions (except for
                    Δ<italic>θ</italic> = 0°
                    or 180°). To show the overall effect of microstimulation, we calculated
                    both the center-of-mass of all single-trial direction estimates in the absence
                    of microstimulation and that in the presence of microstimulation. The black

                <p>To understand the above three types of probabilistic direction identification, we
                    investigated the network dynamics as Δ<italic>θ</italic> was
                    systematically varied. When Δ<italic>θ</italic> is small, the

                    the other (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g002">Figure 2C</xref>,

                    Consequently, the network response is relatively simple, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g008">Figure 8A</xref> for

                <p>On the other hand, for
                    Δ<italic>θ</italic> = 180°,
                    the input profile consists of two independent peaks, and two disjoint neural
                    pools are activated. Thus, the network initially exhibits a bimodal activity
                    profile, but the two bumps compete against each other over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). At stimulus
                    offset, one of the two bumps wins, and <italic>θ</italic><sub>E</sub>
                    is close to either <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> or
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub> (on the first and second trials). On
                    very few trials (15 among 1800 trials), two bumps are visible (on the third
                    trial); nevertheless, <italic>θ</italic><sub>E</sub> is still close to
                    either <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> or
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>. In this sense, direction judgment
                    is determined by winner-take-all for a great
                    Δ<italic>θ</italic>.</p>
                <p>For a broad range of intermediate Δ<italic>θ</italic> between
                    70° and 170°, the input profile has two peaks at
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>, but their width and height are not
                    identical. The interaction of a visual stimulus and an artificially elicited
                    directional signal is different from the visual-visual interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Treue1">[42]</xref>.
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g008">Figure 8B</xref> shows the
                    network activity for
                    Δ<italic>θ</italic> = 130°,
                    similar to the case with
                    Δ<italic>θ</italic> = 110°
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The network
                    behavior evolves based on the winner-take-all competition on some trials, where
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>E</sub> is close to either
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub> (on the first trial) or
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> (on the second trial). On the other
                    trials, however, two bumps develop initially and are sustained across the trial,
                    in which cases the direction estimate is determined by vector averaging
                        (<italic>θ</italic><sub>E</sub> = 120°
                    on the third trial). In other words, direction estimates stochastically switch
                    between the values determined separately by the winner-take-all and
                    vector-averaging mechanisms across trials.</p>
                <p>We found that the percentage <italic>P</italic> of trials on which the direction
                    identification results from vector averaging decreases with increasing
                        Δ<italic>θ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). <italic>P</italic> is larger than
                    80% for
                    Δ<italic>θ</italic> = 80°;
                    but it quickly becomes smaller than 10% for
                        Δ<italic>θ</italic>&gt;100° and smaller than
                    5% for Δ<italic>θ</italic>&gt;150°.
                    Therefore, for a sufficiently large distance between the two directional
                    signals, the winner-take-all mechanism predominates. This can be explained as
                    follows. The two neural subpopulations selectively responsive to the two input
                    signals are sufficiently separated, so that they do not overlap nor excite each
                    other significantly through localized lateral excitatory connections. Their
                    interaction is mostly through shared feedback inhibition that underlies the
                    winner-take-all competition. Owing to trial-to-trial neuronal fluctuations,
                    however, the net inhibitory interactions may be insufficient to suppress the
                    activity of either subpopulation on some trials, in which cases the direction
                    estimation is determined by vector averaging.</p>
                <p>We further quantified the network's decision behavior by plotting the
                    histograms of direction estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). For a small Δ<italic>θ</italic> such as
                    70°, all estimates lie between <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub>
                    and <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>, and the histogram is approximately
                    Gaussian-distributed. For an intermediate Δ<italic>θ</italic>
                    such as 110°, most estimates are close to either
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> or
                    <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>, but there is also a substantial
                    fraction of estimates in between. Accordingly, the histogram is bimodal. For a
                    large Δ<italic>θ</italic> such as 180°, all estimates
                    lie close to either <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> or
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>, so that the histogram consists of
                    two narrow and isolated peaks. These results confirm the above conclusion that
                    the network's direction judgments are based on vector averaging when
                        Δ<italic>θ</italic> is small, winner-take-all when
                        Δ<italic>θ</italic> is large, and a mixture of both for
                    intermediate Δ<italic>θ</italic> values.</p>

                    direction estimate is calculated separately for trials where the motion stimulus
                    with
                    <italic>c</italic>′ = 80%
                    is presented alone (without microstimulation) and for trials where
                    microstimulation is applied together with the 0% coherence stimulus.
                    These two medians form a wedge (shown for our model in the left half of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). <italic>R</italic>
                    is then defined as the proportion of actual direction estimates (on the trials
                    with both the 80% coherence stimulus and microstimulation) that lie
                    within the wedge, divided by 0.5. As a result, <italic>R</italic> can be used to
                    quantify the aforementioned three behavioral types. For instance, vector
                    averaging implies that direction estimates lie completely within the wedge, so
                    that <italic>R</italic>≃1/0.5 = 2. On

                    the experimental observation (Figure 6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Nichols1">[4]</xref>). Moreover, there
                    is a plateau at <italic>R</italic>≃1.35 for a range of intermediate
                        Δ<italic>θ</italic> values, a feature also present in the
                    monkey data, which indicates a mixture of the winner-take-all and
                    vector-averaging mechanisms. Note that the <italic>R</italic> curve is quite
                    similar to the <italic>P</italic> curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g008">Figure 8D</xref>. Therefore, both the two entirely
                    different measures confirm the mixed strategy for direction identification over
                    a wide range of intermediate Δ<italic>θ</italic> values.</p>
                <p>We reasoned that when the sensory stimulus and microstimulation provide
                    conflicting signals, time integration may be important to resolve the ambiguity.
                    In neuronal terms, a longer stimulus viewing time should allow one of two bumps
                    in the network activity pattern to evolve to become dominant at the expense of
                    the other. We tested this prediction by computing <italic>R</italic> under the
                    condition where the motion stimulus lasted 2 s instead of 1 s. Indeed, with a
                    longer stimulus viewing time, <italic>R</italic> generally becomes lower and is
                    smaller than 1.15 when Δ<italic>θ</italic>≥110°
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000253-g009">Figure 9B, cross</xref>). This

            <p>Growing evidence indicates that in a random-dot motion discrimination task, while MT
                neurons encode motion directions, perceptual decisions are made downstream, perhaps
                in the parietal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Gold1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Shadlen1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Huk1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Shadlen2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Hanks1">[49]</xref> or the prefrontal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Kim1">[17]</xref>. Similarly, in a detection
                task (that requires a ‘yes or no’ binary response) using
                near-threshold somatosensory stimuli, neural activity in the prefrontal cortex, but
                not in the primary somatosensory cortex, was found to covary trial-by-trial with the

                a ‘decision circuit’ to subserve perceptual judgments? We have
                previously proposed a cortical circuit model endowed with slow reverberatory
                excitation and feedback inhibition, which allows for the temporal integration of
                sensory stimuli and the formation of categorical choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wang2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong2">[23]</xref>. This type of model

                <p>In a two-alternative direction discrimination task, a subject must be instructed
                    what are the discrete choice options by visual targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>. In the continuous
                    recurrent network model, we implemented the two targets (at
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> and
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>) and examined how the network
                    integrates a motion stimulus biased by the targets and makes a categorical
                    choice (<italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> or
                        <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>). In consonance with the previous
                    models with discrete neural pools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wang2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong1">[21]</xref>, our model reproduces
                    salient observations of LIP activity in the monkey experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>.
                    First, the population firing rates of two competing neural pools first increase
                    together and then diverge, with one continuing to build up while the other
                    decaying down. Second, cells exhibit ramp-like activity, which is slower at
                    lower motion strength. Third, the activity of the winning pool is higher on
                    correct trials than on error trials, whereas the opposite is true for that of
                    the losing pool. Furthermore, at the behavioral level, our model reproduces the
                    psychometric and chronometric functions as well as the observation that the mean
                    reaction time is longer on error trials than on correct trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Roitman1">[13]</xref>.</p>
                <p>In our model, slow temporal integration is instantiated by reverberatory
                    excitation mediated by NMDARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wang2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong1">[21]</xref>. This is mainly
                    related to its slow synaptic kinetics. We further tested this mechanism by
                    partially replacing NMDARs with much faster AMPARs at recurrent excitatory
                    synapses. As a result, the network's ability to integrate input signals
                    is significantly reduced and the network's performance also
                    deteriorates (data not shown). Experimentally, it would be interesting to
                    measure whether direction discrimination becomes more impulsive and less
                    accurate when NMDAR antagonists are applied to LIP in behaving monkeys. On the
                    other hand, other slow positive feedback processes, such as short-term synaptic
                    facilitation and those involving specific ion channels, could also contribute to
                    time integration, which remains to be investigated experimentally and
                    theoretically. In sum, we suggest that strong reverberation in a cortical
                    microcircuit should be slow in order to subserve cognitive-type computations.</p>
                <p>Recurrent excitation must be balanced by feedback inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Compte1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Brunel1">[51]</xref>. Lateral inhibition
                    between neural pools involved in decision computation is consistent with the
                    observation that the microstimulation of one neural pool in LIP not only speeds
                    up the choices in its preferred direction but also slows down the choices in its
                    null direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Hanks1">[49]</xref>. <italic>Ditterich</italic> found that an
                    accumulator model produces reaction time distributions with long right tails,
                    inconsistent with the behavioral data, and that the inclusion of lateral
                    inhibition worsens the problem, resulting in even longer right tails especially
                    at low coherence levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Ditterich1">[30]</xref>. This is not the case in our model; the
                    decision time distributions, although not Gaussian-distributed, do not show
                    pronounced right tails, similar to those observed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Ditterich1">[30]</xref>.
                    A distinguishing feature of our nonlinear network model is strong recurrent
                    excitation, which is absent in linear accumulator models. The positive feedback
                    mechanism ultimately leads to an acceleration of ramping neural activity toward
                    a decision bound, preventing excessively long decision times. Indeed,
                        <italic>Ditterich</italic> showed that the monkey's reaction time
                    distributions can be well fitted by the accumulator model with an additional
                    assumption that the decision bound decreases over time. This is functionally
                    equivalent to a temporally increasing ramping slope, which naturally occurs in
                    our recurrent circuit model.</p>

                    identification task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Nichols1">[4]</xref>, assuming that the network represents a
                    cortical area like LIP, downstream from MT. In the absence of physiological
                    data, we assumed for the sake of simplicity that the inputs separately
                    representing the motion stimulus and the electrically evoked directional signal
                    sum linearly before being fed into the decision circuit. We also took into
                    account lateral inhibition in MT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Heeger1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Ardid1">[53]</xref>,

                    which represents a nonlinear effect.</p>
                <p>Since MT neurons are broadly tuned to visual motion signals, an important issue
                    is how to link MT activity profile to subjects' percept. A number of
                    studies have explored decoding strategies that the brain might use when there
                    are two coexisting competing signals, each activating a different pool of MT
                    neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Treue1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Salzman2">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Groh1">[55]</xref>.
                        <italic>Nichols and Newsome</italic> inferred from the monkey's
                    behavioral performance that different decoding schemes might be used when the
                    angular distance between the direction signals is smaller or larger than
                    140° <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Nichols1">[4]</xref>. MT neurons with nearly opposite direction
                    preferences appeared to compete to determine the monkey's percept, as
                    predicted by winner-take-all; whereas MT neurons with preferred directions as
                    different as 140° could cooperate to influence the monkey's
                    percept, consistent with vector averaging or other distributed coding.</p>
                <p>In our decision circuit, which is downstream from MT, direction judgments are
                    based on the activity of all neurons. That is, we always use the population
                    vector for direction estimation, and such estimates are in good agreement with
                    the behavioral data. Nevertheless, when the stimulus and microstimulated
                    directions are separated by a sufficiently large distance, direction judgments
                    naturally instantiate winner-take-all, whereas when they are close to each
                    other, direction judgments are consistent with vector averaging.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, for the two directions with an intermediate angular distance, the
                    network displays a “mixed strategy”, i.e., perceptual
                    estimates are produced by winner-take-all on some trials and by vector averaging
                    on the other trials. A prediction is that within this mixed-strategy regime,
                    quick responses are based on vector averaging, whereas a longer integration of
                    conflicting signals is more likely to yield a winner-take-all based categorical
                    choice. Such temporal tradeoff should be observable at the level of neural
                    activity. These specific model predictions can be tested in future
                experiments.</p>

                <title>Readout of Direction Judgments by Neurons Downstream from LIP</title>
                <p>In the present work, we used a simple method (i.e., the population-vector
                    analysis) to read out a direction estimate on each trial. In the future, it
                    would be worthwhile to explicitly examine the neural circuit mechanism
                    underlying the readout process. While cortical areas like LIP may be critically
                    involved in accumulating information and making choices, the actual saccadic
                    response that signals the monkey's decision is produced downstream. For
                    instance, neurons in the superior colliculus, a command center for saccadic eye
                    movements, respond to both the targets and the random-dot motion stimulus in the
                    direction discrimination task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Horwitz1">[56]</xref>. It has been proposed that burst firing of
                    movement neurons in the superior colliculus may be triggered when the synaptic
                    excitation from ramping cortical neurons exceeds a threshold, thereby providing
                    a cellular basis for a decision bound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Lo1">[22]</xref>. It will be worth
                    exploring whether the superior colliculus circuit provides additional mechanisms
                    that contribute to readout of perceptual decisions.</p>
                <p>In fact, we have already developed an extended model in which a second circuit
                    (that mimics the superior colliculus) receives synaptic input from the decision
                    circuit and can generate a burst of activity signaling a saccade. This is
                    essentially a continuous network version of the cortico-superior colliculus
                    model (with four discrete neural pools) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Lo1">[22]</xref>. In this double-ring
                    model, it is natural to read out direction estimates without assuming the
                    threshold crossing of neural firing rates. Preliminary data (not shown) suggest
                    that this extension does not significantly alter the conclusions drawn in this

                <title>Comparison with Other Models</title>
                <p>It is worth noting that the continuous recurrent network model is adequate for
                    the simulation of two perceptual decision tasks. In both tasks, the decision is
                    about the coherent motion direction, which is a one-dimensional feature. In our
                    network, each neuron has a preferred motion direction to which it is most
                    sensitive. When the readout of direction judgments is based on population
                    vector, downstream neurons will pool the activity of LIP neurons to produce a
                    directional signal for saccadic eye response. Compared with the previous spiking
                    network models on perceptual discrimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wang2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong1">[21]</xref>, which have discrete
                    (usually two) neural pools rather than a continuous network like ours, our work
                    represents a distinct advance in the field. It would be rather straightforward
                    to extend this one-dimensional model to a two-dimensional network model. For
                    example, a two-dimensional firing-rate model for saccadic action selection (not
                    perceptual decisions) has been proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wilimzig1">[57]</xref>. However,
                    computer simulations of such spiking neural circuits are computationally costly,
                    especially for stochastic decision tasks where thousands of trials are required
                    to gather necessary statistics under each condition (just as in the monkey
                    experiments).</p>
                <p>In this work, we have focused on the reaction-time version of the categorical
                    discrimination task, in which a simulated trial is terminated when either of two
                    population firing rates first reaches a threshold, and the corresponding choice
                    and decision time are recorded. In the direction identification task, the
                    response signaling a veridical judgment is produced at the offset of the visual
                    stimulus presentation, as in the experiment of <italic>Nichols and Newsome</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Nichols1">[4]</xref>.
                    Neither of the task paradigms involves working memory, and we did not
                    specifically simulate the fixed-duration version of the discrimination task

                <p>While our model was based on that designed for spatial working memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Compte1">[34]</xref>, we
                    changed some parameter values to reproduce comparable behavioral data from the
                    monkey experiments (such as the psychometric and chronometric functions for the
                    discrimination task and the <italic>R</italic> plot for the identification
                    task). Interestingly, with this new set of parameter values, the network does
                    not exhibit self-sustained persistent activity. This is at variance with our
                    previous work using a model with discrete neural pools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wang2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong1">[21]</xref>. In the future, it
                    would be interesting to use the same model to simulate the fixed-duration
                    version of the categorical discrimination task (where two targets exist
                    throughout the trial) and analyze systematically to what extent the ability to
                    carry out decision computation depends on the working memory capacity in the
                    continuous network model (as we have previously done with the discrete model
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Wong1">[21]</xref>).</p>

                <title>A Cognitive-Type Cortical Circuit Capable of Performing Multiple Functions</title>
                <p>A continuous recurrent network model, which was originally developed for mnemonic
                    delay-period activity in spatial working memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Compte1">[34]</xref>, has been
                    elaborated in several ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Tegnr1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Carter1">[61]</xref>.
                    Direction-selective persistent neural activity has been observed in both the
                    prefrontal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Funahashi1">[62]</xref> and the posterior parietal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000253-Gnadt1">[63]</xref>. We
                    argue that a cognitive-type cortical circuit like the parietal or prefrontal
                    cortex is equipped with strongly recurrent connectivity to subserve both
                    internal representation of information and dynamic decision computations. On the
                    other hand, it is still unclear to what extent a network's capacity of
                    decision computations and that of working memory necessarily depend on each
                    other. Conceivably, top-down control signals could adaptively modulate a
                    cortical circuit such as LIP, so that it can operate in different dynamical
                    regimes to fulfill different computational demands. Regardless, the present
                    work, by demonstrating that a single cortical circuit is able to perform the
                    veridical judgment and categorical discrimination tasks, represents a
                    significant step toward uncovering the circuit and neurodynamical underpinnings
                    of cognition.</p>
