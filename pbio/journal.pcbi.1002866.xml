      <abstract>
        <p>To understand the complex relationship governing transcript abundance and the level of the encoded protein, we integrate genome-wide experimental data of ribosomal density on mRNAs with a novel stochastic model describing ribosome traffic dynamics during translation elongation. This analysis reveals that codon arrangement, rather than simply codon bias, has a key role in determining translational efficiency. It also reveals that translation output is governed both by initiation efficiency and elongation dynamics. By integrating genome-wide experimental data sets with simulation of ribosome traffic on all <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> ORFs, mRNA-specific translation initiation rates are for the first time estimated across the entire transcriptome. Our analysis identifies different classes of mRNAs characterised by their initiation rates, their ribosome traffic dynamics, and by their response to ribosome availability. Strikingly, this classification based on translational dynamics maps onto key gene ontological classifications, revealing evolutionary optimisation of translation responses to be strongly influenced by gene function.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Gene expression regulation is central to all living systems. Here we introduce a new framework and methodology to study the last stage of protein production in cells, where the genetic information encoded in the mRNAs is translated from the language of nucleotides into functional proteins. The process, on each mRNA, is carried out concurrently by several ribosomes; like cars on a small countryside road, they cannot overtake each other, and can form queues. By integrating experimental data with genome-wide simulations of our model, we analyse ribosome traffic across the entire <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genome, and for the first time estimate mRNA-specific translation initiation rates for each transcript. Crucially, we identify different classes of mRNAs characterised by different ribosome traffic dynamics. Remarkably, this classification based on translational dynamics, and the evaluation of mRNA-specific initiation rates, map onto key gene ontological classifications, revealing evolutionary optimisation of translation responses to be strongly influenced by gene function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The expression of genes can be considered as a two-stage process, beginning with transcription and the production of an mRNA, followed by translation of that mRNA into protein by the cell's ribosome population. Gene expression must be tightly regulated to control protein composition, enabling the cell to rapidly respond to a wide range of environmental conditions. For this reason, cells exert fine control over gene expression, both at the transcriptional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Spellman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Shalon1">[2]</xref> and post-transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ideker1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ghaemmaghami1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One key mechanism of post-transcriptional control of gene expression is translational regulation. The process of translation can be divided in three main phases, namely initiation, elongation and termination. Whereas termination is generally believed to be a fast process and therefore not limiting for translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Arava1">[7]</xref>, the respective contributions of initiation and elongation to translational regulation are still under debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Gingold1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>On one hand, the translation initiation rate, or the rate at which ribosomes access the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) and start translating the ORF, is regulated in part by formation of secondary structures in the 5′ leader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Kudla1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Livingstone1">[10]</xref>. The presence of secondary structures inhibits the ability of an mRNA to sequester ribosomes, thereby lowering the effective translation initiation rate. The 5′ leader composition is characteristic of each mRNA, resulting in a heterogeneity of the ribosome recruitment process among the transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Kozak1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Sagliocco1">[12]</xref>. Despite the importance of this process in gene expression regulation, there are currently no estimates of <italic>in vivo</italic>, mRNA-specific translation initiation rates based on refined traffic models, and how they regulate genome-wide patterns of protein expression. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that translation elongation itself controls gene expression, being regulated by the rate of supply of tRNAs, particularly in microorganisms with codon biased genomes. Within families of isoacceptor tRNAs, members are not all present at the same concentration in the cell, leading to variation in delivery times, and the introduction of stochastic pauses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Buchan1">[13]</xref>. Such pauses control ribosome transit, regulating ribosome queue formation. There is evidence that a ramp of slow codons near the 5′ end of some open reading frames regulates the flow of ribosomes onto an mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Tuller1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ingolia1">[15]</xref>, and pausing during elongation on any mRNA will affect queue dynamics, and thus the flux (or current) of ribosomes along the mRNA. However, there is no knowledge of how, on a genome-wide scale, the dynamic flux of ribosomes along an mRNA might be crucial in regulating protein expression.</p>
      <p>Here, we address these two problems: first, we estimate mRNA-specific <italic>in vivo</italic> translation initiation rates on a genome-wide basis by integrating a computational model of mRNA translation with experimental datasets of ribosome occupancy. Crucially, we show that translation initiation rates are correlated with gene function. Second, we show that the translation dynamics response of each mRNA is characteristic of its gene ontology, by elucidating how ribosome traffic, moving with variable speed across the codon field, responds to a range of initiation rates. We also show that codon arrangement rather than codon usage, clearly separates mRNAs into distinct classes typified by their responses to variations of the translation initiation rate. This suggests that not only codon usage but also codon arrangement is a selectable determinant of gene expression.</p>

        <title>The model</title>
        <p>Our model describes how ribosomes bind to the mRNA, move along it performing the translation, and dissociate from the mRNA at the stop codon, releasing the finished protein into the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ciandrini1">[16]</xref>. The mRNA is represented by a unidimensional lattice, with each site denoting a codon. Ribosomes are represented by particles occupying 9 codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ingolia1">[15]</xref> that attempt to bind the mRNA with a rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, provided that the binding region is not obstructed by another ribosome. The particle on-rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mimics the initiation of translation, in which several processes have been condensed into just one step. The factors influencing the initiation of translation, such as secondary structures in the 5′UTR, concentration of initiation factors and ribosome availability, are all included in this parameter and will be discussed below. Subsequently, ribosomes advance on the polynucleotide chain (elongation) following a two-state dynamics: (1) recognition of the cognate tRNA with rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depending on the codon <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and (2) translocation towards the next codon with rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g001">Figure 1</xref>). At the last codon, the ribosomes detach and release the protein with a rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (termination).</p>

        <p>The cognate tRNA-capture rates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be estimated from data on tRNA abundances, which are assumed to be proportional to their gene copy numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Percudani1">[17]</xref>, and by considering further corrections such as the wobble base pairing (see Supplementary Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002866.s006">Text S1</xref>). Effects of competition for near-cognate and non-cognate tRNAS were found not to materially affect any of the conclusions of this study (see Supplementary Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002866.s006">Text S1</xref>), and are therefore neglected. The translocation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has been measured to be 35 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Savelsbergh1">[18]</xref>, and is codon independent. The termination rate is determined by the concentration of the release factors; the termination process is assumed to be fast, comparable to the translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Arava1">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the model takes into consideration steric interactions between ribosomes, so that even if a ribosome sitting on codon <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has already captured the cognate tRNA, it cannot translocate if the next codon is occupied by another ribosome. Hence, it is an exclusion process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Chou1">[19]</xref> exhibiting different regimes characterised by the flow of particles and by their density along the lattice. In particular, if the sequence contains slow sites, then queues of particles behind the slow sites or high density phases appear when the on-rate of particles is of the same magnitude as the bottleneck rate.</p>
        <p>In contrast to commonly used exclusion models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Tuller1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Reuveni1">[20]</xref>, our model accounts for the processes involved in the mechano-chemical ribosome cycle, condensing them in two main steps: capture of the tRNA and translocation. It includes the crucial fact that ribosomes can capture a cognate tRNA while they wait for the next lattice position to become vacant. In contrast, ribosomes from simpler exclusion models unrealistically “lose” immediately the captured tRNA if they cannot move to the next codon. This is a key difference, which leads to different dynamics of ribosome traffic and transitions between traffic regimes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ciandrini1">[16]</xref>. This effect is further enhanced by the fact that the time scales related to the capture of the tRNA and translocation are strongly separated, with the translocation being much faster. Furthermore, the two-state ribosome reproduces the dwell-times observed in single-molecule experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Wen1">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In summary, our model predicts the current of ribosomes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or translation rate, and the density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of ribosomes on a particular mRNA (number of ribosomes divided by the ORF length), taking as input the specific sequence of codons of the mRNA. Both the translation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the ribosome density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are predicted as a function of the translation initiation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. the rate at which ribosomes arrive at the start AUG codon; their functional dependence on the initiation rate thus varies from sequence to sequence as a consequence of different codon compositions and codon arrangements.</p>

        <p>Previous works, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Reuveni1">[20]</xref>, could only estimate the translation initiation rate as the value that maximised the predicted correlation of the ribosome current with experimental data. Furthermore, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has usually been considered as a unique, fixed value (the same for each of the mRNAs), but it is well known that the translation initiation rate depends on several mRNA-specific factors, such as the structural properties of the mRNA leader region. Knowledge of mRNA-specific values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, therefore, would provide important insight into control of gene expression at the level of translation. Siwiak and Zielenkiewicz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Siwiak1">[22]</xref> present specific initiation rates, however with a simple model that neglects ribosome kinetics and traffic (the comparison is discussed in the Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002866.s007">Text S2</xref>). Here we present a novel approach to identify the initiation rate of each individual mRNA for the whole genome.</p>
        <p>We first apply our translation model to all mRNA sequences of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The model predicts the translation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the ribosome density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on each mRNA as a function of the translation initiation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Then, by utilising genome-wide experimental data of ribosome density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-MacKay1">[23]</xref> for yeast grown under non-stressed conditions, we identify the physiological translation initiation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the one which, when used in our simulations, replicates the experimentally observed density:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002866.e029"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e029" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>This yields a value of the translation initiation rate for each mRNA <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as shown by the genome-wide distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Using the genome-wide experimental data of ribosome density from Arava et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Arava1">[7]</xref> yields a very similar distribution of initiation rates (see Section 4 of Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002866.s006">Text S1</xref>). The knowledge of this distribution reveals how translational regulation of gene expression works at the level of initiation by correlating the values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with the biological functions of the corresponding genes, encoded in their Gene Ontology (GO) annotations.

        <p>The assignment of initiation rates correlates with protein abundances typical of given GO categories: regulatory proteins are usually present at low levels. In contrast, proteins involved in translation, ribosome biogenesis and metabolic processes are abundant. This result is a signature of the divergent translational control that distinct genes exhibit at the level of initiation, suggesting that factors influencing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such as secondary structure in the 5′ leader region, have been shaped by evolution to contribute to the delicate balance of cellular protein composition.</p>
        <p>To show that the procedure introduced above can be applied under different conditions, we carry out a similar analysis under pheromone treatment by using the corresponding measurements of ribosome densities from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-MacKay1">[23]</xref>, and estimate the initiation rates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> under these conditions. The initiation rates do not substantially change, consistent with the finding by Mackay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-MacKay1">[23]</xref> that only a small number of mRNAs exhibit altered densities after pheromone treatment. However, with our analysis we identify two mRNAs, <italic>SAG1</italic> and <italic>HO</italic>, which exhibit a radical change in their initiation rate value under pheromone treatment. Importantly, these two mRNAs have been shown to present altered 5′UTR sequences that explain their significant ribosome density change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Law1">[24]</xref>.</p>

          <p>The origin of these two types of ribosome traffic lies in the codon arrangement: <italic>smooth</italic> behaviour mRNAs contain either rare codons at the 5′ end, or no rare codons at all, whereas <italic>abrupt</italic> behaviour mRNAs contain rare codons or clusters of rare codons within the main body of the mRNA.

In contrast, if the bottleneck is right at the beginning of the mRNA, no queue can be formed and therefore the polysome size increases smoothly with the initiation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Romano1">[28]</xref>.</p>

          <p>Strikingly, these two categories, each with distinct initiation rate response criteria (smooth or abrupt) correlate with the biological function of the encoded proteins: GO annotations (process) related to translation are significantly over-represented in <italic>smooth</italic> sequences (<italic>cytoplasmic translation</italic>, P-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>translation</italic>, P-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Conversely, <italic>abrupt</italic> sequences are connected to several processes, mainly involving regulation, e.g. <italic>biological regulation</italic>, P-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>metabolic process</italic>, P-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <italic>cellular response to stimulus</italic>, P-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

          <p>If one considers the abundance of the transcripts in the cell (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Beyer1">[30]</xref>), then 68% of the total mRNA population belongs to the <italic>smooth</italic> type. This indicates that highly transcribed genes have preferentially slow codons at the 5′ end rather than in the main body of the mRNA. In this way, highly transcribed genes avoid having queues of ribosomes which might deplete a large amount of essential cell resources. <italic>Abrupt</italic> sequences, on the other hand, constitute only 14% of the transcribed mRNAs; this is consistent with the fact that <italic>abrupt</italic> sequences typically encode regulatory proteins, which are in general of low abundance.</p>

          <title>Responsiveness of translation rate to changes in initiation rate</title>
          <p>A further characteristic we can conjecture from our genome-wide simulations, is how the translation rate changes upon variations in the initiation rate around the physiological value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> quantified above. As previously mentioned, the value of the translation initiation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depends on several factors, such as the amount of free ribosomes, initiation factors, and folding features of the 5′ UTRs, all of which are strongly influenced by stress and nutrient conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Mayer1">[31]</xref>. The knowledge of the responsiveness of translation rate to variations of the initiation rate, therefore, theoretically provides key insight into the mechanisms of translational regulation of gene expression.</p>
          <p>In order to study translation rate change responsiveness, or ‘gearing’, we study the combined role of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the presumed gradient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the translation rate, which quantifies the responsiveness of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> around the physiological value of the initiation rate (see ‘Materials and Methods’). We find that these two quantities are highly correlated (Spearman's rank<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, p-value<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g005">Figure 5</xref>. This indicates that, according to our model, genes characterised by a small initiation rate, such as regulatory genes, have in general a high translation rate gradient, suggesting that the corresponding proteins are produced at low levels under normal conditions but their synthesis can be rapidly increased upon changes in the initiation rate. Conversely, genes characterised by a high initiation rate, such as genes encoding proteins involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis, exhibit in general a medium-to-low value of the translation rate responsiveness, implying that their synthesis is tuned to be efficient, but stable against variations in initiating ribosomal subunit availability. Moreover, by dividing the distributions into quartiles, we identify sixteen different regions; a number of them exhibit significant enrichment in specific GO annotations determined principally on the basis of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

This in turn indicates that the gearing function, or responsiveness to ribosome availability, is also coupled to gene function.

          <p>In summary, our genome-wide analysis shows that the type of ribosome traffic on mRNA is significantly correlated with the biological function of the encoded protein: essential proteins that need to be constitutively produced, such as ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in translation, typically exhibit a smooth increase of polysome size upon increments of the initiation rate, a large physiological initiation rate and a high maximal overall translation rate. In contrast, proteins such as the ones involved in responses to stimuli typically exhibit an abrupt increase of the polysome size with the initiation rate, present a small physiological initiation rate and a low maximal overall translation efficiency.

        <p>In order to show that the genome-wide correlation between translational efficiency and biological function obtained above is not only the consequence of codon usage but is strongly influenced by the order in which codons are used in the mRNA, we simulate the translation of a library of randomised ORFs such that both amino acid sequence and codon composition remain identical. That means, two ORFs belonging to the library have exactly the same codon usage but the arrangement of these codons is different. Here we show that, even though all these randomised ORFs have exactly the same codon usage indices such as the CAI, codon adaptation index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Sharp1">[32]</xref>, and tAI, tRNA adaptation index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Reis1">[33]</xref>, their predicted protein production rate can be very different. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows how the different values of predicted protein production rate (ribosomal current <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for a fixed initiation rate) are distributed for 2,000 synonymous randomised codon sequences of a typical <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> gene (YPL106C).</p>

        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g006">Figure 6</xref> clearly shows that the relative positioning of codons has a crucial effect on the translation efficiency, suggesting that very different cellular production rates can be achieved through evolution of the codon arrangement.

        <title>Validation of genome-wide translation rate prediction by experimental data</title>
        <p>While several models of protein synthesis have been developed over the last decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-vonderHaar1">[34]</xref>, the role of codon sequence and stochastic ribosomal movement has been investigated only recently.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The phenotype exhibited by any cell is dictated by its proteomic composition. How much of each type of protein is expressed is governed by a range of factors, including the level of transcription and stability of the encoding mRNA, the half-life of the protein, and how efficiently its mRNA is translated. A number of strategies have been employed to predict translational efficiency, many of which utilise the observation that not all codons are used with equal frequency, and that codon usage frequency is proportional, at some level, to the abundance of the corresponding decoding tRNA species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ikemura1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Dong1">[36]</xref>. Initially, measures such as the codon adaptation (CAI) index were developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Sharp1">[32]</xref>, which correlate high protein abundance with over-use of the sub-set of codons found in a group of very-highly expressed genes, normally those encoding the ribosomal proteins. However, such approaches frequently struggle to predict the expression level of less abundant proteins. More recently, dynamic TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process) models have been employed to simulate the flow of ribosomal traffic, including queuing interactions between adjacent ribosomes on the polysome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Reuveni1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Sharma1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Brackley1">[41]</xref>. Even though these models represent a big step towards a more complete description of the translation process, most of them miss one essential component, namely the mechano-chemical ribosome cycle. By including this mechanism into an exclusion process we showed that the mathematical description of translation becomes much more accurate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ciandrini1">[16]</xref>. Here we applied this model to simulate the translation of every mRNA in the transcriptome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> leading to the estimates of the individual translation initiation rates unique to each of the 6,000 genes in yeast. We furthermore showed that mRNA sequences can be classified according to their ribosome traffic characteristics, and crucially, this classification maps to gene ontology assignments.</p>
      <p>Even though the role of the translation initiation rate has been shown to play a central role in translational control of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Kudla1">[9]</xref>, to our knowledge no genome-wide estimations of these rates have been reported, considering ribosome traffic effects. The translation initiation rate, i.e. the rate at which ribosomes start translating the ORF, condenses many factors, such as cytoplasmic ribosome availability, initiation factors and secondary structures on the 5′UTRs, all of them strongly dependent on nutrients and stress conditions. Some approaches consider the translation initiation rate to be fixed for every transcript, thereby neglecting the key factors that make the initiation rate unique to each transcript. In contrast, by considering traffic dynamics, we determined the first genome-wide estimate of initiation rates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each and every mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g002">Figure 2</xref>) by integrating our stochastic model of ribosome traffic with data of ribosome densities across all mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-MacKay1">[23]</xref>. Our analysis showed a wide range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values under these non-stress conditions. Importantly, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values are strongly correlated with gene function, explaining for example why translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs, which typically have a very high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value, is very efficient. These values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are expected to be influenced by the degree of secondary structure of the 5′ leader sequence, and indeed we did find a significant correlation with the free energies of the secondary structures. The strongest connection involving <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was however a negative correlation with mRNA length, mirroring the findings from experimental research that described lower ribosome densities on longer mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Arava1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ingolia1">[15]</xref>. In contrast to the explanation that the effect could be caused by bottlenecks of slow codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ingolia1">[15]</xref> (see Supplementary Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002866.s006">Text S1</xref>) this negative correlation supports the idea that due to the circular structure of mRNAs, the ends of shorter mRNAs can interact more easily than longer mRNAs, thereby promoting ribosome recycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Arava1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Chou2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-McCarthy1">[43]</xref>. Indeed following detailed experimental analysis using ribosome density mapping, Arava and colleagues concluded that lower densities on longer mRNAs are best explained by lower rates of translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Arava2">[27]</xref>, mirroring our findings in this work. To summarise, we interpret the correlation between the estimated initiation rates and the ORF lengths as a possible indication of a regulatory mechanism that allows circularised mRNAs to load ribosomes more efficiently onto their transcripts, leading to the observed ribosome-ORF length relationship.</p>
      <p>Our analysis furthermore identified two main distinct classes of mRNAs regarding their responsiveness to changes in the initiation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: some sequences exhibited an <italic>abrupt</italic> change in the polysome size upon a change in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas <italic>smooth</italic> sequences showed a gradual increase. Calculations with artificial sequences revealed that sequences with rare codons in the main body of the ORF belong to the <italic>abrupt</italic> class, whereas sequences with either no rare codons or rare codons at the 5′ end belong to the <italic>smooth</italic> class <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Romano1">[28]</xref>. Crucially, we note that the classification of mRNAs into <italic>smooth</italic> and <italic>abrupt</italic> responders maps onto particular gene ontological classifications. <italic>Smooth</italic> responder mRNAs as a class are highly over-populated with ribosomal protein mRNAs and translation factors. Conversely, the <italic>abrupt</italic> class contains disproportionate numbers of regulatory proteins, including nucleic acid-binding transcription factors, and cell cycle proteins. One reason why ribosomal protein mRNAs are predominantly of the <italic>smooth</italic> response type might relate to the massive manufacturing scale of ribosome biosynthesis; in yeast, ribosomal protein mRNAs account for nearly 30 percent of all mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Holstege1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Warner1">[45]</xref>. <italic>Smooth</italic>-type responses to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be of selective advantage for a cell, since if ribosome queues were established on such a large proportion of the cell mRNA population they would sequester a large numbers of ribosomes, with deleterious consequences for cell fitness. On the other hand, it has been recently found that cell-cycle regulated genes predominantly adopt non-optimal codon usage (with no ramp of slow codons at the beginning, and therefore of the <italic>abrupt</italic> class) to achieve elongation-limited mRNA translation; this can generate cell cycle-dependent oscillations in protein abundance induced by changes in the tRNA pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-FrenkelMorgenstern1">[46]</xref>. Therefore, it is apparent that the cell coordinates codon usage and codon arrangement to achieve translational gene expression control.</p>
      <p>Our results also showed important differences in the computationally deduced slope of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> production rate curve in response to increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Some mRNAs are what we term highly geared, that is, small increases in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> produce relatively large increases in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This type of super-responsive mRNA was significantly enriched in regulatory proteins, which also have a relatively small initiation rate. We speculate that this might be a mechanism to facilitate rapid responses to changed environmental conditions, allowing, for example, rapid synthesis of transcriptional repressors that in physiological conditions are severely limited by the initiation (low <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Conversely, low geared mRNAs, where increases in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> produce proportionately lower responses in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, were enriched in ribosomal proteins. Since ribosomal proteins are used to manufacture ribosomes, lower gearing of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsiveness to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> may help prevent undesirable positive feedback effects. We furthermore classified mRNA sequences according to the maximal translation rate that they can achieve, i.e. their saturation value, and our analysis revealed that <italic>abrupt</italic> sequences have predominantly a small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas <italic>smooth</italic> sequences are characterised by a large <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This correlates with the levels of the corresponding proteins: regulatory proteins are typically present in low abundance, whereas ribosomal proteins are highly abundant. Moreover, this might prevent possibly deleterious consequences of over-producing regulatory proteins, including cell cycle factors, during occasional bursts of ribosomal availability that would lead to a very large increase in the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> for example, this occurs upon sudden glucose depletion: translation initiation is rapidly inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Ashe1">[47]</xref> but some mRNAs (including those involved in carbohydrate metabolism) continue to be translated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Castelli1">[48]</xref>, thereby being exposed to a spike in ribosome availability. Similar complex translational re-programming, coincident with a partial cell-wide shut down of translation initiation, occurs in response to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Shenton1">[49]</xref>. Hence, by having a high responsiveness to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a low <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>abrupt</italic> sequences can have a very rapid gene expression upregulation, on one hand, but a controlled maximum translation rate, on the other hand. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g008">Figure 8</xref> summarises our findings on the initiation rates and the consequences of different (mRNA-specific) dependencies of the protein production rate on the initiation step.</p>

          <title>Initiation rate: summary of the findings.</title>
          <p>(<bold>A</bold>) For a given ‘physiological’ number of ribosomes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we found mRNA-specific initiation rates, distributed over a broad range of values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Different regions of the distributions can be mapped to certain GO annotations. For example, mRNAs with small physiological initiation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are regulatory proteins while genes involved in translation have a larger initiation rate. (<bold>B</bold>) Changes in initiation (induced, for instance, by variations in the ribosomal pool, e.g. available ribosomes increase to a value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are estimated by our modelling and theoretically perceived by the transcript in different ways, according to their current-initiation relationship <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In particular, some mRNAs have a large gearing factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such as regulatory proteins, while other messengers, such as translation associated ones, are less sensitive to changes of the initiation rate. (<bold>C</bold>) For very large initiation rates the protein production rates reach a maximal elongation-limited value, i.e. only depending on the sequence of codons. We discover that translation associated genes have a larger maximal production rate when compared to other mRNAs, such as regulatory proteins, whose production might need to be capped. (<bold>D</bold>) In general we find two main groups of sequences classified according to their current-initiation relationship <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Abrupt sequences, usually regulatory proteins, present an abrupt ‘kink’ in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, meaning that the protein production rate can quickly saturate above specific values (sequence-dependent) of the initiation rate. Genes involved in translation like ribosomal proteins are instead classified as smooth sequences, since their sequences are such that this abrupt crossover does not exist.</p>

      <p>Incidentally, this classification of proteins according to their translation dynamics, coincides with the classification according to protein stability. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002866-Belle1">[50]</xref>, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteome was analysed using a clustering approach to classify proteins according to half-life, and the stable protein cluster was enriched with proteins involved in protein production, including ribosomal proteins and enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism. Moreover, the unstable protein cluster was enriched with cell cycle proteins and proteins involved in transcriptional regulation. Therefore, our analysis indicates that stable proteins tend to have a low responsiveness in their production rate to external changes which change the initiation rate, whereas unstable proteins production responses very effectively to external changes. Hence, our analysis strongly suggests that the cell coordinates dynamics of protein degradation with the dynamics of protein production.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have shown how our stochastic model representing the ribosome traffic flow on mRNAs is able to discern and describe the biological interplay between translation initiation and elongation, at a single-codon level. We have illustrated how the application of this model across the entire genome can be used to infer mRNA-specific translation initiation rates <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that selection of codon arrangement is likely to be an important mechanism to tune the translation system to meet the competing demands of ribosome biosynthesis and translation of all other mRNAs in the cell. With our approach, mRNA sequences can be classified according to their translation dynamics, mapping to key gene ontological classifications; codon arrangement plays a fundamental role in this classification, indicating that it is optimized through evolution to match the corresponding gene function. Moreover, gene-specific physiological values of initiation rate can be used to determine the translational efficiency for each mRNA; this allows the prediction of genome-wide protein abundances with a significant increase in correlation when compared with previous approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We foresee this type of analysis will be of great value to understand how the economics of translation are regulated on a cell-wide basis, and how codon arrangement is optimised to control gene expression in response to the translational remodelling that occurs in response to many environmental stresses.</p>

        <title>Stochastic simulations</title>
        <p>For each mRNA sequence of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> we performed a stochastic simulation of translation, one mRNA at a time, following the rules explained above and summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002866-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Our algorithm is a continuous time Monte-Carlo based on the Gillespie algorithm, and therefore it gives the real-time dynamics of the system.</p>
        <p>In each simulation of individual mRNAs we let the system reach the steady-state. Then we measured, at constant interval times, two quantities: the current <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of ribosomes along the mRNA, i.e., how many ribosomes per unit time finish translation, and the density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of ribosomes on the mRNA, i.e., the total number of ribosomes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> divided by the length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (in codons) of the mRNA. Therefore, the current <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> gives the translation rate, and the density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> determines the polysome size. We then averaged these quantities over the entire time interval of the simulation. We ran the simulations for a broad range of initiation rates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between 0 and 5 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, making sure that the plausible physiological regime for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> variation was covered, and we fixed the other parameters as explained in the previous sections. The obtained curves <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were then smoothed with a ten-points running average.</p>

Since both the distributed physiological values of the initiation rates and different codon sequences cause a different dependence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the derivative <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002866.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> differs from mRNA to mRNA.</p>
