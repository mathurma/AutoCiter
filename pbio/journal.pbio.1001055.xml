      <p>Within most multicellular species, it is variation within individuals in how the
                genome is expressed, not variation between individuals in the genome itself that
                produces the larger, more rapidly induced phenotypic variability. For example, in
                many temperate-zone bird species, the testes increase in size by ∼100-fold over
                the course of a few weeks with the annual onset of the breeding season, a rate and
                magnitude of change within individuals that vastly exceeds the variation between
                individuals of the same species examined at the same stage of breeding. Feeding in
                some snakes elicits a change in digestive physiology and morphology that can include
                a doubling in liver, pancreas, and intestine mass and changes in stomach pH from
                7–8 to 1–2, all within a week or so. Massive phenotypic variation. Zero
                genomic variation.</p>
      <p>These examples of phenotypic change are impressive in their magnitude as well as
                their speed, both of which influence the accessibility of selection. But these rates
                of change are relatively modest compared to the speed with which behavior can drive
                phenotypic change in animals. Behavior, as a field of study, has provided a
                perspective on phenotypic variation that few other disciplines, including
                epigenetics, can match, yet it has been through its integration with other levels of
                biological organization that has enabled the most insight. Just as architects
                consider both the surrounding physical environment as well as the eventual occupants
                in designing a building, behaviorists must consider both the ecological context and
                the developmental and physiological mechanisms that give rise to the behavior. As
                Niko Tinbergen suggested in 1963, behavior cannot be completely understood in the
                absence of understanding the forces that ultimately and proximately influence it,
                and it is therefore no wonder why behavioral research that integrates across
                multiple levels of biological organization has been so well received by the larger
                biological research community in recent times.</p>
      <p>The integration of multiple levels of biological organization combined with the
                importance of intra-individual phenotypic flexibility together serve as general
                themes throughout <italic>The Flexible Phenotype: A Body-Centred Integration of
                    Ecology, Physiology, and Behaviour</italic>, a new book by Theunis Piersma and
                Jan A. van Gils. Piersma and van Gils take the reader through a loose history of
                their research program on the migration stop-over ecology, behavior, and physiology
                of the red knot (<italic>Calidris canutus</italic>), a migratory shorebird that has
                served as the foundation for their long-time collaboration. Although they load their
                story with examples and anecdotes from numerous other species, it is primarily the
                focus on the red knot that has enabled these authors to understand not only
                migratory stop-over biology, but more generally behavior, ecology, and digestive
                physiology as a whole. The writing style is more conversational than that to which
                we are typically accustomed as readers of the scientific literature. But beneath
                such whimsical section titles as “Thermometers Do Not Measure Feelings”
                and “It Takes Guts to Eat Shellfish” is a foundation of scientific
                rigor.</p>
      <p>Part I of the book, “Basics of Organismal Design,” details the principles
                of water, heat, nutrient, and energy balance and explores the concept of
                symmorphosis, which posits that organisms are economically designed. Among the
                several intriguing ideas discussed in this section was one on the evolution of
                endothermy raised by Marcel Laassen and Bart Nolet in 2008. The adaptive basis for
                the evolution of endothermy has confounded researchers for decades, but, over the
                years, many converged on the idea that the elevated activity levels enabled by
                endothermy allowed better exploitation of relatively less active herbivores as a
                food resource. In other words, endothermic carnivores could more easily prey on
                herbivores. Taking an integrative approach by combining digestive physiology with
                foraging ecology, Laassen and Nolet hypothesized that endothermy evolved as a
                mechanism for burning the excess carbon consumed as part of a primarily herbivorous
                diet. Thus, endothermy may have first evolved in herbivores, not carnivores.
                Although researchers are sure to debate the evolutionary origins of endothermy for
                years to come, the utility of an integrative approach in this example was clear.</p>
      <p>Part II, “Adding Environment,” begins by discussing the relationships
                between metabolic rate, activity, and performance. But it is not until the authors
                integrate ecology into their thinking that questions regarding performance limits
                can be satisfactorily answered, because it is the ecological environment that
                governs the severity of the punishment for over-exertion, either in terms of
                survival or reduced reproductive value. The concept of phenotypic flexibility is
                detailed in the next chapter, which offers many examples and provides insight from
                the authors as well as others on the adaptive significance of phenotypic
                flexibility. Of particular interest is the discussion on the 2007 book <italic>The
                    Tinkerer's Accomplice</italic>, in which author J. Scott Turner builds on
                previous reasoning from Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin that most of an
                organism's phenotype is due not to natural selection on particular genes, but
                rather to “agents of homeostasis,” the self organization that follows
                from how developing structures interact with their immediate environment—be it
                the internal physiological and anatomical environment or the external physical,
                ecological, and social environment. A remarkable example is provided in the annual
                growth and shedding of antlers in deer. Antlers don't just get larger with each
                year's new growth, they can also retain certain “memories” of
                previous years' damage. That is, an antler that incurs velvet damage during its
                growth one year will retain evidence of that damage in subsequent years, even though
                the original damaged antler had long since been shed. Although the phenomenon is
                surprising, a probable mechanism rooted in the “memories” of neurons
                that innervate the velvet is not. Indeed, the internal regulator of most behavioral,
                physiological, and even anatomical plasticity in vertebrates is the nervous system.
                Because the vertebrate brain is the primary integrator of environment, physiology,
                and behavior, behavioral flexibility and the physiological and morphological
                flexibility of the body periphery cannot be completely understood in the absence of
                understanding neuroplasticity. It is therefore a bit surprising that Piersma and van
                Gils only occasionally mention the fundamental role of the nervous system in
                regulating most forms of organismal plasticity.</p>
      <p>In “Adding Behaviour,” Piersma and van Gils introduce the details of
                their model system, the red knot, particularly as it pertains to optimal foraging
                and digestive plasticity, all the while underscoring the importance of integration
                and also of using natural, field-based systems for answering questions about
                phenotypic flexibility. In doing so, they introduce the concept of Bayesian
                updating, in which an individual combines prior information with new information to
                modify its behavioral decision, presumably in an adaptive fashion. This process
                requires the formation, consolidation, and retrieval of memories, none of which are
                possible in vertebrates without neuroplasticity.</p>
      <p>Finally, in “Towards a Fully Integrated View,” the authors provide
                perhaps the most compelling rationale for the importance of integration in
                understanding behavior. Much of what makes it so compelling are the examples, in
                particular one, in which researchers discovered how the psychology of elk can
                reorganize an ecosystem. The fear of wolves (not necessarily the presence of wolves)
                drives elk from some areas that may afford little protection, thus releasing the
                streamside growth of aspen and willow that otherwise would be stunted by grazing.
                The presence of these mature trees provides a resource for beavers, whose dams cause
                the streams to meander and generate a mosaic of biodiverse microhabitats for
                everything from birds to butterflies. The conclusions: elk paranoia elevates
                butterfly diversity…and integration is essential.</p>
      <p>This book is not simply a list of examples of how integration has helped us
                understand some behavioral problem; rather, it is more of a guide for using
                integration to investigate behavior as a vehicle for phenotypic flexibility. The
                integration that facilitates this process is difficult to practice. For the work of
                Piersma and van Gils, it requires expertise in physiology, behavior, and ecology,
                and, as these authors point out, attempting to be a jack of all of these trades runs
                the risk of mastering none of them. With their new book, Piersma and van Gils
                clearly demonstrate mastery not only at the three components of their integration,
                but also at the very process of integration, which is long overdue to be recognized
                as a trade in and of itself.</p>
