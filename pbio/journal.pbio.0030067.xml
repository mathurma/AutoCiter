				<article-title>Location, Location, Location: How Position Affects Gene Expression in the Nucleus</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The functional consequences of long-range nuclear reorganization were studied in a cell-by-cell analysis of gene expression and long-range chromosomal interactions in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila</named-content> eye and eye imaginal disk. Position-effect variegation was used to stochastically perturb gene expression and probe nuclear reorganization. Variegating genes on rearrangements of Chromosomes X, 2, and 3 were probed for long-range interactions with heterochromatin. Studies were conducted only in tissues known to express the variegating genes. Nuclear structure was revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes to the variegating gene and heterochromatin. Gene expression was determined alternately by immunofluorescence against specific proteins and by eye pigment autofluorescence. This allowed cell-by-cell comparisons of nuclear architecture between cells in which the variegating gene was either expressed or silenced. Very strong correlations between heterochromatic association and silencing were found. Expressing cells showed a broad distribution of distances between variegating genes and their own centromeric heterochromatin, while silenced cells showed a very tight distribution centered around very short distances, consistent with interaction between the silenced genes and heterochromatin. Spatial and temporal analysis of interactions with heterochromatin indicated that variegating genes primarily associate with heterochromatin in cells that have exited the cell cycle. Differentiation was not a requirement for association, and no differences in association were observed between cell types. Thus, long-range interactions between distal chromosome regions and their own heterochromatin have functional consequences for the organism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>From the broad level of the whole chromosome down to the individual gene, interphase chromosomes in every organism studied adhere to common organizational principles (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b01">1</xref>]). An aspect of chromosome structure important for organism function is long-range chromosomal interactions (LRCIs) between distant loci. LRCIs have been linked with gene silencing by insulators in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b03">3</xref>] and with Polycomb silencing of homeotic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b05">5</xref>]. LRCIs between euchromatic loci and heterochromatin can silence genes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b07">7</xref>]). LRCIs are not static, for example, the polar organization of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila</named-content> embryonic chromosomes changes as homologous loci pair and LRCIs within the nucleus form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b11">11</xref>]. Mouse immune cells adopt unique contacts between silenced genes and heterochromatin during differentiation and cell fate specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b14">14</xref>]. These changes appear to be functional rather than merely structural, such that altering LRCIs appears to have profound biological consequences.</p>
      <p>Live studies of green-fluorescent-protein-tagged chromosomal loci reveal how LRCIs can change. Individual loci exhibit Brownian motion constrained to a defined volume, as observed in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b17">17</xref>], mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b18">18</xref>], and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b19">19</xref>]. Constraints are under developmental and cell cycle control, as evidenced by the observation that individual loci in male <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila</named-content> pre-meiotic spermatocyte nuclei are more tightly confined in late G2 than in early G2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b19">19</xref>]. Relaxing constraints to allow considerable motion permits new LRCIs to form, while constraining loci more tightly can stabilize them. Developmental control of locus confinement could reconfigure a basic polar chromosomal organization into relatively stable developmental and cell-fate-specific architectures.</p>
      <p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila</named-content> position-effect variegation (PEV) is an ideal system to study the functional consequences of altered LRCIs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b21">21</xref>]). PEV occurs when chromosome rearrangements juxtapose euchromatic genes and heterochromatin, producing a variegated expression pattern such that the gene is silenced in some but not all cells. These rearrangements also cause the affected genes to form long-range interactions with heterochromatin in a subset of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b22">22</xref>]. Genetic evidence suggests that PEV may utilize these long-range interactions to silence genes. PEV can skip over one gene to silence another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b23">23</xref>] or silence a wild-type locus on a homologous chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b24">24</xref>]. In the case of <italic>bw<sup>D</sup></italic> variegation, chromosome rearrangements that alleviate PEV move the affected gene farther away from heterochromatin, while rearrangements that move the locus closer to heterochromatin enhance PEV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b26">26</xref>]. This suggests that juxtaposition between a gene and heterochromatin allows for gene-to-heterochromatin interactions that can cause silencing. Once formed, these contacts may cause a gene to be silenced either by repackaging the gene into heterochromatin or by a specific silencing activity sequestered within heterochromatin itself.</p>
      <p>Interaction with heterochromatin does seem to correlate with the silencing of specific genes, but the connection between association with heterochromatin and silencing has not been directly verified. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to identify chromosomal and heterochromatic loci are not generally compatible with the detection of gene expression. Furthermore, studies that have examined the connection between LRCIs and silencing by modulating the amount of PEV-induced repression have given conflicting results: one study found a correlation between relaxed silencing and relaxed association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b22">22</xref>], whereas another did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b24">24</xref>]. Because the affected gene's expression was not compared to its association with heterochromatin on a cell-by-cell basis, it remains unclear whether, in a given cell, a heterochromatin-associated locus was silenced or expressed.</p>
      <p>For the first time, to our knowledge, we present an experimental system that compares the expression of a variegating gene and its association with heterochromatin on a cell-by-cell basis for three different variegating genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila</named-content> whole-mount tissues. Multiple lines were chosen to ensure that results could be generally applied to PEV, rather than being limited to a specific rearrangement. The positions of variegating chromosomal loci and regions of heterochromatin were probed by FISH while fluorescent detection of eye pigments or variegating gene proteins marked gene expression. The affected gene in each line is quite far (&gt;10 MB) from the centromere, with a block of heterochromatin placed nearby either through insertion or inversion. This provided an easy assay for long-range interactions with centromeric heterochromatin, as an interacting gene would relocate a significant distance across the nucleus to interact with centromeric regions. The variegating genes used are expressed in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila</named-content> eye or eye imaginal disk; therefore, our examinations were limited to these tissues. Cell types, developmental stages, and cell cycle states were identified to determine what effects these variables might have on LRCIs with heterochromatin.</p>
      <p>Our results show that interactions between variegating loci and heterochromatin are tightly correlated with gene silencing. Cells in which the variegating gene has been silenced exhibit a tight distribution of distances, suggesting direct interaction between heterochromatin and the distally located gene. Expressing cells, however, show a much broader distribution, with far fewer interactions between variegating loci and heterochromatin. Furthermore, these interactions with heterochromatin are primarily found in non-dividing cells in the eye disk. Differentiation is not required for LRCIs to occur, and interactions did not differ between cell types.</p>

        <title>LRCIs Are Strongly Correlated with Gene Silencing</title>
        <p>Using gene expression as a functional assay, the consequences of LRCIs between chromosomal loci and heterochromatin were probed on a cell-by-cell basis. The first variegating gene examined was the <italic>brown</italic> gene on the <italic>bw<sup>D</sup></italic> rearrangement.

Our experiments were greatly simplified by working in a <italic>scarlet</italic> background as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b26">26</xref>] as this eliminated the brown pigments from the eye. Therefore <italic>brown</italic>-expressing cells contained red pteridine pigment while non-expressors contained none (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions from <italic>brown</italic>-expressing cells were quite different from those of silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The distribution of distances from expressing cells was broad, centered around 1 μm and extending to about 2 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Looking at the cumulative percentage plots, few nuclei (10%) had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances shorter than 0.5μm, and barely 25% had distances shorter than 0.75 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>G, blue line). Silenced cells, however, had a tight distribution of distances centered around 0.5 μm, with virtually all variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances being under 1 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Cumulative percentage plots show nearly 40% of distances were shorter than 0.5 μm, and nearly 80% of nuclei had distances shorter than 0.75 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>G, red line).

        <p>The second variegating gene examined was the <italic>white</italic> gene in the In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic>.

LRCIs between <italic>white</italic> and the 1.688 satellite correlated strongly with PEV-mediated silencing of <italic>white</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">2</xref>E, and 2H). As before, cells expressing the variegating gene had a broad distribution of distances, in this case centered at 1.5 μm and continuing to 4 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Cumulative percentage plots reveal that only 20% of nuclei expressing <italic>white</italic> had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances under 1 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>H, blue line). The distance distribution for silenced cells was much narrower than that for expressing cells, with distances centered around 0.8 μm and extending to only 2 μm in total distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Cumulative percentage plots show that over 60% of nuclei from silenced cells had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances of under 1 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>H, red line) compared to 20% for expressing cells. Differences between expressing and silenced populations of cells were highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030067-t001">Table 1</xref>). Despite the marked differences in association levels between expressing and silenced cells, the distributions of distances overlapped considerably between expressing and non-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">2</xref>E).</p>
        <p>The third variegating gene examined was the heat-shock inducible beta-galacosidase transgene located on the In(3L)BL1 rearrangement. The expression of beta-galactosidase in In(3L)BL1 showed no preference for cell type, and was only found behind the morphogenic furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g001">1</xref>D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b29">29</xref>]. In(3L)BL1 nuclei showed patterns of interaction and expression similar to those seen in the <italic>brown</italic> and <italic>white</italic> variegating lines. Expressing cells showed a broad distance distribution centered around 1.5 μm and extending out to nearly 4 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Cumulative percentage plots show barely 15% of expressing cells had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances 1 μm or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>I, blue line).</p>
        <p>In(3L)BL1 silenced nuclei displayed a rather narrow distribution, with a median distance of under 1 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). As in In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic> disks, cumulative percentage plots also showed more than 60% of silenced nuclei had distances between the silenced gene and heterochromatin under 1 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>I, red line). The narrow distribution of distances meant that silenced nuclei rarely had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances greater than 2 μm, while expressing cells had greater distances in at least 50% of cells. Also similar to In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup>,</italic> variegating genes in silenced cells were not 100% associated with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">2</xref>F), with 40% of silenced nuclei having variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances greater than 1 μm. Additionally, some expressing cells had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances less than 1 μm, in this case roughly 10%.</p>

        <title>Interaction between Variegating Genes and Heterochromatin Primarily Occurs in Non-Dividing Cells</title>
        <p>While it was clear that silencing of a variegating gene was tightly correlated with its interaction with heterochromatin, it was not known what other factors might affect this interaction. A study of how cell cycle progression and differentiation might affect interactions between a variegating gene and heterochromatin was undertaken. The cell cycle had previously been implicated as a force that periodically disrupts LRCIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b30">30</xref>]. The third-instar eye imaginal disk is an excellent tissue to explore this possibility because it contains well-separated populations of dividing and non-dividing cells. The anterior portion of the eye imaginal disk contains dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g003">Figure 3</xref>A [left of dotted line] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g003">3</xref>B). The morphogenic furrow contains cells arrested in G1. Posterior to the morphogenic furrow, many cells cease dividing and differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g003">Figure 3</xref>A [right of dotted line] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g003">3</xref>C). Because of our sample preservation methods (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), it was also possible to distinguish each individual photoreceptor cell and cone cell by their unique three-dimensional position and nuclear shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g003">Figure 3</xref>D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b31">31</xref>]). Our results therefore contain three groups of nuclei: nuclei from dividing cells anterior to the morphogenic furrow and differentiated cone cell nuclei and photoreceptor cell nuclei from behind the morphogenic furrow.</p>

          <p>Entirely different results were found for cone and photoreceptor cells behind the morphogenic furrow. The distributions in both cases were substantially skewed, with a long tail of distances representing cells in which <italic>brown</italic> was greater than 1 μm from heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">4</xref>G). Cumulative percentage plots reveal that interactions were far more common in differentiated cells behind the morphogenic furrow than in the dividing anterior cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>J, purple and green lines). The majority of nuclei in both cone cells and photoreceptor cells had their variegating gene closer than 1 μm to the centromeric heterochromatin on 2R. Statistical tests showed that the distributions of cone cells and photoreceptor cells were significantly different from dividing anterior cells (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030067-t001">Table 1</xref>) but were not significantly different from one another (<italic>p</italic> = 0.15). This argues that differences between cell types do not have a significant effect upon <italic>brown</italic>-to-centeromeric-heterochromatin LRCIs. Cone cells and photoreceptor cells are also different in shape and nuclear volume. The fact that no difference in heterochromatic association was found suggests that in these cell types nuclear shape and volume do not play a meaningful role in LRCIs with heterochromatin.</p>

          <p>The inverted X chromosome In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic> displayed similar results to that of <italic>bw<sup>D</sup></italic>. Gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions in anterior cells were nearly Gaussian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), such that few nuclei had variegating genes closer than 1 μm to the centromeric heterochromatin (&lt;10%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>K, red line).

Cone cells and photoreceptor cells displayed nearly identical distributions and were not statistically distinct (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0319). These distributions are markedly different from those of anterior cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), with most nuclei exhibiting a shorter variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">4</xref>H). The cumulative percentage plots confirm this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>K, purple and green lines), in that posterior cells routinely showed association levels 40% higher than anterior cells.</p>

          <title>In(3L)BL1</title>
          <p>The line In(3L)BL1 was a notable exception to previous results as it had an almost bimodal distribution of distances in cells anterior to the morphogenic furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). The cumulative percentage plots show dividing nuclei with variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances less than 1 μm (25%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>L, red line). This may be due to confounding effects of the multiply inverted balancer TM3. Gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions from differentiated cells were not substantially skewed towards shorter distances relative to anterior cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">4</xref>I). There were few noticeable differences, as shown in cumulative percentage plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>L, purple and green lines relative to blue). These differences were not statistically significant between cone and anterior cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0567; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030067-t001">Table 1</xref>) nor between photoreceptor and anterior cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.6600; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030067-t001">Table 1</xref>). Distributions from cone and photoreceptor cells were not significantly different (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0184; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030067-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">4</xref>I), nor were there any noticeable differences between the cell types in the cumulative percentage plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g004">Figure 4</xref>L, purple and green lines).</p>
          <p>Data from each variegating locus were compared with the behavior of loci on wild-type chromosomes; variegating loci behaved quite differently from those on wild-type chromosomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref> and part 2 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Differentiation Is Not Necessary for Association</title>
        <p>Because LRCIs were found in differentiated nuclei, this suggested that differentiation was important for interaction with heterochromatin. Alternatively, cessation of the cell cycle may allow loci to interact with heterochromatin because the periodic anaphases are eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b09">9</xref>]. The unique cell cycle profile of the eye imaginal disk presented an elegant way to distinguish between these two possibilities. Eye disk cells anterior to the morphogenic furrow divide in a band (I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g005">5</xref>B) and arrest in the furrow at G1, as cartooned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g005">5</xref>B. Posterior to the furrow, cells either differentiate into ommatidia or replicate their DNA. Some cells in this undifferentiated pool divide in the second mitotic wave (II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g005">5</xref>B) and differentiate immediately. The remaining cells pause in G2 and await a signal to divide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b32">32</xref>]. These G2-arrested cells behind the morphogenic furrow have been in interphase since the first mitotic wave ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b32">32</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, shaded nuclei). If interaction requires differentiation, these G2-arrested cells should show less association than differentiated cells. If these G2 cells show equivalent levels of association, then a sufficiently long cell cycle permits variegating genes to interact with heterochromatin. G2 cells are easy to identify in third-instar eye disks as their nuclei react to anti–cyclin A antisera and are basal to differentiated and dividing nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g005">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g005">5</xref>E; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b34">34</xref>]).

It appears that the morphogenic furrow is a transition state, whereby variegating genes that were once quite far from heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) begin to associate with centromeric regions on the same chromosome.

        <title>Variegating Genes Associate with Heterochromatin at Their Own and Other Centromeres</title>
        <p>An appreciable percentage of loci were found far from centromeric <italic>cis-</italic>heterochromatin, even in PEV-silenced nuclei. These silenced yet far loci may form LRCIs with heterochromatin on other chromosomes (<italic>trans</italic>-heterochromatin).

In two sets of experiments per line, probes marking variegating loci were compared with two different heterochromatic probes: one marked <italic>cis-</italic>heterochromatin while another identified <italic>trans</italic>-heterochromatin. Each variegating gene was examined for promiscuous interaction with centromeric heterochromatin on each large chromosome. Data were sorted based on whether the variegating gene was within 1 μm of heterochromatin on its own chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g007">Figure 7</xref>A), on a different chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g007">Figure 7</xref>B), or on both chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g007">Figure 7</xref>C).</p>

        <p>As in Dernburg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b09">9</xref>], the <italic>brown</italic> locus on the <italic>bw<sup>D</sup></italic> chromosome interacted primarily with heterochromatin on the same chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). Interactions with <italic>trans</italic>-heterochromatin on Chromosomes X and 3 where the <italic>brown</italic> gene was not associating with <italic>cis</italic>-heterochromatin were generally limited to 5%–10% of examined nuclei. Interactions where the <italic>brown</italic> gene was close to heterochromatin on multiple chromosomes were also infrequent, between 2%–5% of examined nuclei.</p>
        <p>The In(3L)BL1 chromosome differed from the <italic>bw<sup>D</sup></italic> chromosome in that comparable levels of association were observed between <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g007">Figure 7</xref>E). The In(3L)BL1 chromosome's transgene interacted similarly with heterochromatin on Chromosomes 2 and 3 (20% of nuclei examined), but only 10% with the X chromosome. Interactions of the variegating gene with heterochromatin on multiple chromosomes were less common, at around 5%–10% of nuclei examined. The variegating locus on In(3L)BL1 seemed to show a preference for associating either with heterochromatin on its own chromosome or that of Chromosome 2.</p>
        <p>The In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic> line showed similar levels of association with heterochromatic blocks on all three chromosomes, with around 10% of nuclei exhibiting distances less than 1 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g007">Figure 7</xref>F). Unlike in the other lines examined, the variegating gene was rarely close to heterochromatin on multiple chromosomes, suggesting that the <italic>white</italic> locus interacts with only one block of heterochromatin at a time.</p>
        <p>While the <italic>bw<sup>D</sup></italic> chromosome exhibited a marked preference for associating with heterochromatin on its own chromosome, the other two lines did not. This suggests that the tails of the distances seen in the silenced cells of In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic> and In(3L)BL1 could well be explained by interaction with heterochromatin on other chromosomes. <italic>bw<sup>D</sup>'</italic>s infrequent association with blocks of heterochromatin on other chromosomes may explain the smaller tails seen in the distributions of <italic>bw<sup>D</sup></italic> disk nuclei.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The variegating rearrangements studied here cause a nuclear reorganization with clear consequences for the organism. The rearrangements alter the behavior of affected loci relative to wild-type (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref> and part 2 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>), changing their nuclear position. This in turn increases the likelihood that nearby genes will contact and form persistent interactions with heterochromatin. Those loci that do interact with heterochromatin may be silenced. Supporting this conclusion is the observation that variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions in silenced cells are vastly different from those of expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">2</xref>F). Silenced nuclei show a tight unimodal distribution with a peak centered around short distances, 0.5 μm in the case of <italic>bw<sup>D</sup></italic>, and 0.8 μm in the case of In(3L)BL1 and In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic>. We posit that the lower variability of these silenced cell distributions means that variegating genes are forming persistent contacts with heterochromatin. Because the same level of association was seen between recently differentiated nuclei and those that had differentiated as many as 12–18 h before (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref> and part 5 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>), this suggests that the interactions are quite persistent and do not appear and disappear periodically. Distances of nearly a micron may seem inordinately high. However, since the analysis scheme measured between FISH signal centers, distances will never be zero even when FISH signals overlap considerably. This is compounded by the relatively large volume occupied by heterochromatic FISH signals. However, FISH signals that we classified as interacting based on distance were often touching or partially overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Unlike silenced cells, expressing cells have a broader, nearly Gaussian distribution centered at 1.0–1.5 μm and extending to nearly 4 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">2</xref>C). We interpret the more variable distribution to mean that expressing loci are not interacting with heterochromatin and are therefore less restricted.</p>
      <p>Despite clear differences between expressing and silenced loci behavior, we do not see absolute distinctions between them. Appreciable numbers of silenced loci are far from <italic>cis-</italic>heterochromatin, while some expressing loci are quite close. Some of these results may be explained by limitations of our experimental procedures. Not all centromeric heterochromatin is labeled by our FISH methods. It remains possible that a “far silenced” gene may be interacting with heterochromatin not labeled by our oligonucleotide probes in either <italic>cis-</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>-heterochromatin. Two lines exhibited significant association with <italic>trans</italic>-heterochromatin, suggesting that this could explain cases where silenced genes are not associated with labeled <italic>cis-</italic>heterochromatin. Some of the expressing yet heterochromatin-close cases may have expressed the gene for some time before contact with heterochromatin silenced the variegating locus. Our use of accumulated gene product to mark gene expression would mask these examples. While FISH methods do not drastically perturb nuclear structure, these methods may impact interloci distances somewhat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b37">37</xref>]. Heat shock utilized for the In(3L)BL1 line may explain its unique behavior relative to other chromosomes, as heat shock has been shown to affect nuclear structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b02">2</xref>]. A live chromosomal imaging system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b15">15</xref>] that tracks the long-range interactions of a variegating gene with heterochromatin should provide the best control for sample manipulations discussed here.</p>
      <p>Specific biological interactions may also explain the “far silenced” and “close expressing” loci. Interaction with heterochromatin may be required for the establishment but not the maintenance of silencing. Once a gene is silenced, chromosomal motion may pull it away from centromeric heterochromatin without changing the affected gene's expression. A second possibility is that the proximal block of heterochromatin near the variegating locus can occasionally silence the gene by itself. For example, the block of heterochromatin near the <italic>white</italic> gene in In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic> is known to be a weak silencer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b38">38</xref>]. The observation that variegating loci in some expressing cells seem to interact with heterochromatin (upper limit of 20%) may mean that interaction does not guarantee silencing. Early transcriptional activation allows a gene to escape PEV, arguing that once a gene is expressed, future interactions with heterochromatin might not silence it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b39">39</xref>]. The timing of interaction relative to the normal expression pattern of the gene may therefore be critical. Some genes vary in their sensitivity, such that interaction with heterochromatin may not necessarily result in silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b41">41</xref>].</p>
      <p>Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g002">Figure 2</xref> and the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030067-t001">Table 1</xref>, we can determine what the differences between expressing and silenced cells mean in terms of chromosomal and nuclear dimensions. In silenced cells, the median distance between the variegating locus and heterochromatin is nearly halved relative to expressing cells. For example in In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic> the distance falls from around 1.5 μm in expressing cells to 0.85 μm in silenced ones. Based upon calculations of linear base pair distance, this is what we would expect if the silenced locus is located 9 MB closer to heterochromatin than in the expressing case, or about half of a chromosome arm. Given the complex folding of an interphase chromosome arm, this reduction is likely more pronounced than a linear calculation would suggest. Additionally, the behavior of a silenced locus is different in ways far more dramatic than merely “closeness” to heterochromatin. The distribution of distances for silenced loci are also less variable than for expressing loci, roughly half that of an expressing locus. This becomes particularly clear when we imagine the variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distance in statistical terms, using two standard deviations as a 95% confidence interval. Using the In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic> case as an example, the expressing locus might be anywhere from 0 to 3 μm from heterochromatin, while the silenced locus will not be found farther than 1.7 μm away. Thinking about this in terms of three-dimensional nuclear volume, this means than an expressing locus will inhabit a 95% confidence volume five times larger than that of a silenced locus. We posit that the shorter median distance and reduced variability in position relative to heterochromatin suggests a persistent interaction.</p>
      <p>It is not known to what extent the association of a variegating gene with heterochromatin is a cause or an effect of gene silencing. Even though our results argue that the two events are connected, a gene could be silenced by local factors and associate with heterochromatin independently. Future examinations of this problem would require a live study to pinpoint precisely when interactions occur. If interaction occurs before the gene is silenced, that suggests that the interaction could be a cause of silencing. If interactions occur after silencing, however, this would suggest that the interaction is merely a side effect. Studying the persistence of such associations will reveal whether interaction with heterochromatin causes loci to be more constrained than non-interacting loci, which could explain why gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions from expressing cells are so much broader than those of silenced cells.</p>
      <p>Now that specific interactions with heterochromatin have been shown to be closely correlated with silencing, one can ask how such interactions form. Time-lapse studies have shown that individual loci can move substantial distances within the nucleus, eventually bringing the variegating locus into contact with heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b19">19</xref>]. Additional live studies found that chromosomal loci can be held in place after contacting certain structures such as the nuclear envelope or the nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b42">42</xref>]. Once contact is made, the proximal and centromeric blocks of heterochromatin may mediate a persistent interaction through multimerization of proteins such as HP1. Loci on wild-type chromosomes will not form persistent interactions because they lack a proximal block of heterochromatin. Interestingly, studies have found that as interphase progresses, nuclear motion decreases such that contacts between euchromatic loci and heterochromatin may stabilize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b44">44</xref>].</p>
      <p>Recent insights into the molecular behavior of heterochromatin proteins suggest how persistent interaction with heterochromatin may silence genes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b45">45</xref>]). We hypothesize that the associated loci, because of intimate (possibly molecular) contact, acquire the molecular features of heterochromatin. The chromatin of PEV-silenced genes acquire heterochromatic features such as a regular nucleosome array, insensitivity to nucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b46">46</xref>], and binding of heterochromatin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b48">48</xref>]. This altered chromatin structure seems to occlude the affected gene's promoter, preventing the loading of RNA polymerase and transcriptional activators, thereby preventing gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b49">49</xref>].</p>
      <p>A model of how LRCIs with heterochromatin occur in the eye disk is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030067-g008">Figure 8</xref>. In dividing cells anterior to the morphogenic furrow, few loci interact with heterochromatin. As cells pass into the morphogenic furrow, the G1 cell cycle arrest allows loci to explore their chromosome territory and make contacts with regions of heterochromatin on their own and possibly other chromosomes. Loci that contact heterochromatin may form persistent interactions that cause silencing. The normal expression pattern of the <italic>white</italic> gene, for example, is now altered by association with heterochromatin. Instead of being expressed in every r8 cell behind the morphogenic furrow, as in a wild-type chromosome, its expression pattern is periodically interrupted by silenced cells. Loci that contact but do not form persistent interactions remain relatively unconstrained.</p>

Long-range interactions are not observed anterior to the morphogenic furrow in regularly dividing cells. In the morphogenic furrow, G1 arrest allows variegating genes the time to begin to find and associate with blocks of heterochromatin. Once behind the morphogenic furrow, variegating loci in more cells associate with heterochromatin, and once formed these interactions persist. When a developmental signal is sent for a gene to be expressed, its association with heterochromatin greatly affects its chances for being expressed, such that a gene interacting with heterochromatin is far less likely to be activated than one that is not.</p>

          <title>Detection of gene expression</title>
          <p>Detection of gene expression in In(3L)BL1 relied on immunofluorescence of the beta-galactosidase gene product after heat shock at 37 °C. Eppendorf tubes containing a 1-ml agarose plug were preheated for one hour at 37 °C in a circulating water bath. The plug was removed, larvae were placed inside the eppendorf tube, and the pre-warmed plug was loosely placed over the larvae and the tube sealed. Larvae were incubated in the water bath for 5 min, followed by immersion in a room temperature water bath and a 1 h recovery period. Eye disks were dissected, followed by blocking for 4 h in PBS +0.1% Tween 20 (PBT) plus 5% dry milk (Nestle, Solon, Ohio, United States). Disks were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody in PBT at a dilution of 1:1,000 (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) for 2 h. After three 30-min washes in PBT, disks were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pennsylvania, United States) at a 1:500 dilution in PBT for 1 h. After three more washes in PBT, the horseradish-peroxidase-coupled antibody was treated with fluorescent coumarin-coupled tyramide signal amplification reagents (TSA-direct, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wellesly, Massachusetts, United States) to develop a stable fluorescent stain that would survive FISH.</p>
          <p>Detection of gene expression in the line In(1)<italic>rst<sup>3</sup></italic> relied on immunofluorescence to the <italic>white</italic> gene product.

Anti-White antibody staining proceeded as anti-beta-galactosidase staining, except that anti-White primary antibody was used at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in PBT and stained overnight. The primary antibody was detected by anti-rabbit horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at dilution of 1:500, followed by treatment with tyramide as described above.</p>
          <p>For <italic>bw<sup>D</sup>,</italic> adult eyes were embedded in polyacrylamide immediately after dissection (see below), stained with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI in PBS (pH 7.4), and imaged at low magnification with an Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) 20 × 0.8 NA lens to identify gross structural features for later realignment. Select regions of each eye were imaged under a 1.4 NA 100x lens to acquire high-resolution three-dimensional images of each nucleus. The precise positions of both high and low magnification datasets were recorded for realignment after FISH. Expressing cells were identified by their bright autofluoresence.</p>

          <p>Adult eyes were processed for FISH similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b58">58</xref>] with modifications described below. Adult eyes were placed within a nail polish ring on a #1.5 20 × 30 mm coverslip in 13.5 ml of Tris (pH 8.0). Then 6.5 ml of 3X activated acrylamide buffer (Buffer A+, 15% acrylamide, and 0.333% bis-acrylamide) was added. Twenty-five microliters of 20% ammonium persulfate and 25 μl of 20% sodium sulfite were added to 500 μl of acrylamide buffer immediately before addition to tissue. The acrylamide buffer drop was mixed by repeated pipetting, and sealed with a clean 20 × 30 mm coverslip. After 30 min of polymerization, the top coverslip was removed and pads washed four times in Buffer A+, followed by DAPI staining and pigment imaging.</p>
          <p>After pigment imaging, pads were stepped into 2XSSCT/50% formamide and incubated with probe and hybridization solution overnight at 37 °C before denaturation. Pre- and post-FISH washes proceeded as described for eye disks in PCR tubes, except that washes were extended to 1 h apiece in humid chambers with agitation.

Imaginal disks were imaged with a 60x Olympus 1.4 NA oil lens while adult eyes were imaged on an Olympus 20 × 0.8 NA oil lens followed by a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) 100 × 1.4 NA oil lens. For adult eyes, the same tissues examined for pigmentation were re-imaged and carefully aligned with pre-FISH images.

          <p>Image analysis was performed with the Image Visualization Environment software package PRIISM ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b62">62</xref>]; D. Diggs and E. Branlund, unpublished data). The Water algorithm automatically identified nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b63">63</xref>] and segmented them into three-dimensional objects. After segmentation the center point of each object was the starting point to find the nuclear periphery. The nuclear lamin signal was found by searching for pixels above an intensity threshold a specified radial distance from the center point. Pixels above the threshold were marked and refined by a second- and third-order surface harmonic expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b10">10</xref>]. Individual FISH signals within each modeled nucleus were identified based on their intensity peak above background (M. Lowenstein and D. Diggs, unpublished data). FISH signal distances were measured and sorted by nucleus membership. Distances were measured from the intensity-weighted center of mass rather than from the edge of each FISH signal. This means that even overlapping FISH signals will return a measured distance. Differences between different groups of nuclear distances were tested for statistical significance by the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030067-t001">Table 1</xref>), which is a two-sample rank-sum test for position that makes no assumptions regarding the distributions of sample data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-03-12-b64">64</xref>].</p>

          <p>Groups of distances mentioned previously were tested for statistical significance relative to one another (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030067-t001">Table 1</xref>). Variegating chromosomal loci close to heterochromatin were considered to be interacting, while loci farther away were considered to be not interacting. Data were presented in two different ways. First, standard histograms presented the full distribution of the data including any subpopulations. Second, cumulative percentile plots with percent association between variegating genes and their own centromeric heterochromatin plotted as a function of gene-to-heterochromatin distance more clearly distinguished varying interaction levels between different cell populations. This plotting method also revealed that the exact placement of a cutoff for interaction between loci was unimportant, as clear differences could be seen at distances less, equal to, or greater than 1 μm. As a general rule 1 μm in distance was used as a cutoff for interaction. This cutoff was not intended to be mechanistically meaningful, but to serve as a rule of thumb for thinking about the results.</p>
