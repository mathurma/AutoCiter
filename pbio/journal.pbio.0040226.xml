				<article-title>A Chemical Facilitator of Plant-Fungus Communication</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The association of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi with plant roots is the oldest and ecologically most important symbiotic relationship between higher plants and microorganisms, yet the mechanism by which these fungi detect the presence of a plant host is poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that roots secrete a branching factor (BF) that strongly stimulates branching of hyphae during germination of the spores of AM fungi. In the BF of 
					<italic>Lotus,</italic> a strigolactone was found to be the active molecule. Strigolactones are known as germination stimulants of the parasitic plants 
					<italic>Striga</italic> and 
					<italic>Orobanche</italic>. In this paper, we show that the BF of a monocotyledonous plant, 
					<italic>Sorghum,</italic> also contains a strigolactone. Strigolactones strongly and rapidly stimulated cell proliferation of the AM fungus 
					<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Gigaspora rosea</named-content> at concentrations as low as 10<sup>−13</sup> M. This effect was not found with other sesquiterperne lactones known as germination stimulants of parasitic weeds. Within 1 h of treatment, the density of mitochondria in the fungal cells increased, and their shape and movement changed dramatically. Strigolactones stimulated spore germination of two other phylogenetically distant AM fungi, 
					<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Glomus intraradices</named-content> and 
					<italic>Gl. claroideum</italic>. This was also associated with a rapid increase of mitochondrial density and respiration as shown with 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic>. We conclude that strigolactones are important rhizospheric plant signals involved in stimulating both the pre-symbiotic growth of AM fungi and the germination of parasitic plants.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In the immediate area surrounding plant roots, called the rhizosphere, roots are in active contact with soil-borne microorganisms. Besides the beneficial or competitive interactions between roots and microorganisms that involve microbial nutrient cycling, plant supply of carbon substrates, and competition for nutrient sources, plant roots and soil microbes also interact more intimately. Roots exude not only large quantities of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, vitamins, purines, nucleosides, enzymes, hormones, inorganic ions, and CO<sub>2</sub>, but also small amounts of a variety of flavonoids, terpenoids, and other secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b001">1</xref>] that serve as early chemical mediators of more specific plant-microbe interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b002">2</xref>]. Some of them act as chemoattractants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b003">3</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b004">4</xref>], as antibiotics that confer resistance to bacterial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b005">5</xref>], or as root signals that specifically induce microbial genes necessary for the establishment of compatible associations with plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b006">6</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>About 80% of all plant species form intimate symbiotic associations with a class of ubiquitous soil microorganisms called arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, yet little is known about how these fungi detect the presence of their plant hosts. As obligate biotrophs, the survival of these fungi depends on their ability to associate rapidly with plant roots and to set up symbiotic relationships with them. Spores of AM fungi can germinate in the absence of a host (non-symbiotic growth); however, further growth and branching of germinating hyphae prior to root infection (pre-symbiotic growth) require the presence of compounds released by roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b007">7</xref>]. Among the diversity of molecules present in root exudates and active in hyphal branching, flavonoids have often been proposed to switch AM fungi from non- to pre-symbiotic growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b008">8</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b009">9</xref>]; micromolar concentrations of some of them can stimulate growth of AM fungi. However, the roots of chalcone synthase mutants of maize, which are deficient in flavonoid synthesis, are colonised normally by AM fungi, demonstrating that flavonoids are not essential for the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b010">10</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>In earlier studies, a branching factor (BF) from hairy root cultures of 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Daucus carota</named-content> was discovered that strongly stimulates branching of the germinating hyphae of 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Gigaspora</named-content> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b011">11</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b012">12</xref>]—a response similar to that typically observed when hyphae of AM fungi grow in the presence of living roots. BF induces mitosis in the hyphae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b012">12</xref>], which is necessary to form new hyphal branches and increase root–fungus contacts. We found this BF also in several other mycotrophic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b012">12</xref>]. BF first induces expression of genes related to mitochondrial activity in the fungus (after 1h), then increases the rate of respiration (after 1h 30 min) and mitochondrial reorganization (after 4h) before stimulating fungal ramification (after 24h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b013">13</xref>], suggesting that the branching response is the result of a metabolic switch.
			</p>
      <p>Preliminary investigations of BF of 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. carota</named-content> indicated that the active component is a low-molecular-weight lipophilic molecule present in root exudates at extremely low concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b012">12</xref>]. Among candidate molecules in root exudates that share these characteristics and are already known to be involved in plant–soil organism interactions are the strigolactones—potent germination stimulants of parasitic weeds such as 
				<italic>Striga</italic> and 
				<italic>Orobanche</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b014">14</xref>] (
				<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Like AM fungi, these parasitic plants are obligate biotrophs whose survival depends on rigorous host recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b015">15</xref>]. Recently Akiyama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b016">16</xref>] demonstrated that the BF of the dicotyledenous (dicot) plant 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Lotus japonicus</named-content> contains the strigolactone 5-deoxy-strigol. This report also showed that 5-deoxy-strigol, strigol, sorgolactone, and the strigolactone analogue GR24 stimulate hyphal branching of the AM fungus 
				<italic>Gi. margarita</italic> at subnanomolar concentrations.
			</p>
      <p>To substantiate the hypothesis of strigolactones as important stimulants of AM fungi, our aim was to examine whether: i) the BF isolated from a monocotyledonous (monocot) plant species contains strigolactones; ii) among known stimulants of 
				<italic>Striga</italic> and 
				<italic>Orobanche</italic> seed germination, strigolactones specifically stimulate AM fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b015">15</xref>]; iii) strigolactones not only stimulate hyphal branching of germinating spores of AM fungi but also are the molecules responsible for activating mitochondria, the typical response to BF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b013">13</xref>]; iv) strigolactones are active on more than one AM fungal species.
			</p>
      <p>Our data show that strigolactones must indeed be a widespread class of rhizospheric stimulants of AM fungi produced by dicots as well as monocots. They also demonstrate that these molecules provoke a rapid and strong cellular response targeted on mitochondrial apparatus in the fungus.</p>

					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). To see whether AM fungi respond to one or more of these compounds, we tested the effect of GR24, parthenolide, artemisinin, and dihydrosorgoleone on hyphal branching of

        <p>5-deoxy-strigol was found to be the active substance in the BF of 
					<italic>L. japonicus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b016">16</xref>]. For generalisation purposes, it is essential to determine whether the BF of other plants, particularly in divergent ones like monocots, also contains strigolactones. Therefore, we analysed the BF of 
					<italic>Sorghum</italic> because the strigolactones of this plant species have already been characterized
					<italic>. Sorghum</italic> contains at least two strigolactones: sorgolactone and, in smaller amounts, strigol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b021">21</xref>]. We collected root exudates from 
					<italic>Sorghum</italic> seedlings that had germinated for 5–30 d. The organic content of the exudates was extracted in ethyl acetate and separated using C18 fractionation. All fractions were tested for activity in the fungal branching assay. 24 h after its application, the most hydrophobic fraction (fraction 6) could be seen to stimulate hyphal branching of 
					<italic>Gi. rosea</italic>. Sorgolactone was identified in this fraction by using ESI-MS/MS from the (M + Na<sup>+</sup>) 339 m/z ion showing the loss of the specific D ring of strigolactones (daughter ion at 242 m/z) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040226-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Fraction 6 was further separated using C18 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the subfraction that eluted in the same position as a synthetic sorgolactone marker was collected. This fraction also stimulated hyphal branching.

				</title>
        <p>We carried out a quantitative dose-response analysis of the effect of GR24, GR7 (another strigolactone analogue that contains only the BCD rings; 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>), and synthetic sorgolactone on 
					<italic>Gi. rosea</italic> hyphal branching (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040226-t001">Table 1</xref>). GR7 stimulated branching at concentrations above 10<sup>−7</sup> M, whereas GR24 and sorgolactone were still significantly active at 10<sup>−11</sup> M and 10<sup>−13</sup> M, respectively. This shows that GR24 and sorgolactone are more potent branching stimulants than GR7, and thus that the A ring, absent from the GR7 molecule, is probably required for a maximum activity.
				</p>
        <p>To determine whether the stimulation of hyphal branching by strigolactone observed after 24 h was also significant after several days, hyphal branching and hyphal length were measured up to 2 wk after stimulation with 10<sup>−7</sup> M GR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040226-g002">Figure 2</xref>). GR7 was used for this assay because a large amount was needed and it was available commercially. Stimulation of hyphal branching by GR7 was maintained throughout the 2-wk period. At the end of the experiment, the treated spores had produced 2.8-fold more hyphal branches than control spores. The hyphae that grew from the treated spores were also longer. Hyphal branching, therefore, seems to be a durable effect, suggesting that the stimulated fungus enters a new morphogenetic program, preceding the symbiotic stage.

        <title>The Strigolactone Analogue GR24 Induces a Rapid Mitochondrial Response in the Fungus</title>
        <p>Tamasloukht et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b013">13</xref>] showed that before 
					<italic>Gi. rosea</italic> cells began to branch in response to BF isolated from carrot hairy roots, they produced more mitochondria and their respiratory rate increased. These important fungal responses involve the oxidative catabolism of lipids—the main form of carbon storage in AM fungi—and the production of ATP. This raises the possibility that strigolactones in BF are responsible for stimulating fungal respiration and lipid catabolism. To address this question, we tested the effect of GR24 on mitochondrial density, shape, and movement in 
					<italic>Gi. rosea</italic>. Living hyphae were stained with Mitotracker Green, a fluorescent vital stain specific for mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b022">22</xref>], and observed by fluorescence microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b013">13</xref>]. After only 1 h of GR24 treatment, the mitochondrial density increased by 23% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040226-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This phenomenon was more pronounced after 5 h of treatment (32%; 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040226-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To substantiate these data, we used monoclonal antibodies against the yeast mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COX) subunit I and against the yeast mitochondrial porin protein to observe the mitochondria by immunofluorescence microscopy in fixed fungal hyphae (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Double-labelling with the two antibodies showed clearly co-localised staining (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). We calculated the fluorescence intensity of fungal cells labelled with each antibody before and after exposure of the fungus to GR24. Consistent with the Mitotracker Green test, we found a significant increase in mitochondrial density with the anti-porin antibody as well as with the anti-COX antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040226-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

        <p>Observations of living cells stained with Mitotracker Green showed that the shape and distribution of the organelles was also remarkably modified. In control cells, the mitochondria appeared spherical and randomly distributed, whereas in treated cells they adopted a thread-like structure oriented parallel to the hyphal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040226-g004">Figures 4</xref> and 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040226-g005">5</xref>). Their motility was also affected: in control hyphae the mitochondria made circular movements and moved short distances, whereas in the GR24-treated hyphae the mitochondria moved faster and in an oriented fashion (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Videos S1</xref>–
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv004">S4</xref>). These changes in shape and movement might reflect increased fission and fusion of the mitochondria, typical of active organelle biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b023">23</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b024">24</xref>] and consistent with the observed higher mitochondrial density. Taken together, these data show that GR24 provokes a rapid and strong cellular response in

        <title>Strigolactone Analogues GR7 and GR24 Are Active on Phylogenetically Distant AM Fungi</title>
        <p>Buée et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b012">12</xref>] reported that the BF of carrot hairy roots was active not only on several 
					<italic>Gigaspora</italic> species but also on the phylogenetically distant AM fungus 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic>. Similarly, Tamasloukht et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b013">13</xref>] verified that the higher mitochondrial activity and rate of respiration seen in 
					<italic>Gi. rosea</italic> in response to carrot BF was also seen in 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic>. The fact that 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic> responds in the same way as 
					<italic>Gigaspora</italic> to BF indicates that the molecular mechanism is widespread among AM fungi. This is important also because the genome of 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic> is currently being sequenced, so this fungus is likely to become the model AM fungus of choice for further investigations.
				</p>
        <p>The branching response of 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic> is difficult to assess due to its thin, multiple germ tubes; therefore, we replaced this test with a germination test. We observed that 10<sup>−7</sup> M GR7 and 10<sup>−7</sup> M GR24 increased the percentage of spores that germinated by 55% and 50% (300 spores tested per treatment), respectively, compared to their respective controls. We then tested the effects of GR7 and GR24 on the rate of respiration of 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic> spores. 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic> is a suitable species for quantitative measurements of its oxygen consumption in a polarograph due to the small size of its spores and hyphal tubes. We found an average increase of 35% after 5 h in the presence of 10<sup>−7</sup> M GR7 or GR24. This 5-h treatment was too short for the spores to produce new hyphal growth; therefore, the higher rate of respiration in response to GR7 and GR 24 must have been an intrinsic response from pre-existing material rather than a simple cellular growth response. To test the hypothesis that the cellular basis for these physiological responses is mitochondrial as in 
					<italic>Gi. rosea,</italic> we labelled hyphae of 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic> germinated spores with Mitotracker Green. After 1 h of treatment with 30 nM GR24, an increase of 30% fluorescence density was obtained (
					<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, as in 
					<italic>Gi. rosea,</italic> mitochondria of 
					<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic> appeared more often with a threadlike structure in stimulated hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040226-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Mitochondria of

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that the BF produced by roots of the monocot 
				<italic>Sorghum</italic> contains a strigolactone and that strigolactone analogues induce strong physiological effects on three diverse AM fungi, as does authentic BF. We have shown also that the BF of the dicot 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. carota</named-content> stimulates seed germination of 
				<italic>Orobanche,</italic> as do strigolactones. Akiyama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b016">16</xref>] showed that the active ingredient of the BF of 
				<italic>L. japonicus,</italic> another dicot, is a strigolactone. Taken together, these data indicate that strigolactones, previously defined as stimulants of germination of parasitic weeds, are also involved in early AM fungus–host-root interactions in a wide range of plant and fungus species.
			</p>
      <p>The fact that many plant species are hosts to AM fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b026">26</xref>] and/or to parasitic weeds suggests that strigolactones are widespread in the plant kingdom. Yet, due to their very low concentrations and the lack of easy analytical methods to detect them, these small lipophilic molecules have been detected in only a few higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b027">27</xref>]. Since the discovery of strigol, the first strigolactone to be characterised (in cotton in 1966 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b028">28</xref>]), only five other natural strigolactones have been described: strigyl acetate, isolated from cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b029">29</xref>]; sorgolactone, from 
				<italic>Sorghum</italic> and maize; alectrol, from cowpea; orobanchol, from red clover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b015">15</xref>]; and 5-deoxy-strigol, from 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. japonicus</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b016">16</xref>]. Recently, an ESI-MS/MS method was developed using multiple reaction monitoring that was suitable for the detection and quantification of several strigolactones in the same sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b029">29</xref>]. We also used the ESI-MS/MS but in the enhanced product ion (EPI) mode to be more confident in molecular identification. With this type of analysis, all daughter ions and their respective abundance are visible after collision. This method proved very sensitive in our hands (with a limit of detection of 10<sup>−9</sup> M for standard sorgolactone), enabling us to detect sorgolactone not only in 
				<italic>Sorghum</italic> root exudates but, more directly, in roots and shoots. If strigolactones are also present in shoots of maize, this may explain the presence in maize stem of a non-identified germination stimulant of 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Striga hermonthica</named-content> seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b030">30</xref>]. For now, nothing is known about the biosynthesis pathway of strigolactones; however, Matusova et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b031">31</xref>] suggested that strigolactones may be derived from the carotenoid pathway. This hypothesis is consistent with the presence of strigolactones in shoots.
			</p>
      <p>Plants produce thousands of chemicals, many of them with strong biological activities. It would not be surprising, therefore, if AM fungi had learned to interact with many of these chemicals during the course of evolution. Therefore, strigolactones may not be the only one class of molecule in plant roots that stimulates hyphal growth. None of the other stimulants of parasitic weed germination we tested had any activity on 
				<italic>Gi. rosea,</italic> indicating the structural specificity of strigolactones as AM fungal stimulants. Moreover, the very high activity of strigolactones and the fact that they are active not only on 
				<italic>Gigaspora</italic> species: 
				<italic>Gi. margarita</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b016">16</xref>], 
				<italic>Gi. rosea</italic> (this study), and 
				<italic>Gi. gigantea</italic> (unpublished data) but also on two 
				<italic>Glomus</italic> species (this study) considered to be phylogenetically distant from the Gigasporaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b025">25</xref>], argue in favour of an important role for strigolactones in hyphal growth. Studies with strigolactone mutants or ecotypes of plants that produce less or no strigolactones—ideally in model plants such as 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Medicago truncatula</named-content> and 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. japonicus</named-content>—will be crucial to establish whether or not strigolactones are essential for establishing the mycorrhizal symbiosis.
			</p>
      <p>Sorgolactone was active on germinating 
				<italic>Gi. rosea</italic> hyphae at concentrations as low as 10<sup>−13</sup> M, or even lower (considering the dilution effect in the assay; see 
				<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Such high sensitivity has never been reported before in AM symbiosis. The lowest concentrations of flavonoids active in AM fungal growth are in the micromolar range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b009">9</xref>]. The fact that strigolactones are active at these very low concentrations and that rapid and extensive cellular reorganisation occurs in the fungus suggests that strigolactones act through a signalling pathway. The high turnover of strigolactones in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b032">32</xref>] is also consistent with a signalling role.
			</p>
      <p>The rapid and strong induction of mitochondrial activity in the fungus in response to strigolactones, we believe, illustrates the most significant effect of strigolactone on AM fungi. This mitochondrial response was found in 
				<italic>Gi. rosea</italic> and 
				<italic>Gl. intraradices,</italic> two distant AM fungi. It was correlated to a higher respiration rate with 
				<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic>. We hypothesize that hyphal branching in 
				<italic>Gi. rosea</italic> and activation of spore germination in 
				<italic>Gl. intraradices</italic> and 
				<italic>Gl. claroideum</italic> are physiological consequences of this metabolic stimulation. Activation of the mitochondria leads to oxidation of lipids—the main form of carbon storage in AM fungi. From their observations of fungal spore germination in the absence of roots and in the presence of root exudates, Bécard and Piché [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b033">33</xref>] proposed that a mechanism prevents AM fungal spores from using their carbon reserves until they encounter some specific root exudates. Strigolactones may be that crucial component of root exudates that switches on lipid catabolism in the pre-symbiotic stage of the fungus, which is characterised by the capacity of the fungus to use its full energy potential.
			</p>
      <p>Interestingly, two types of unrelated organisms, AM fungi and parasitic weeds, respond to the same molecules, the strigolactones. These organisms have in common the fact that they are root obligate biotrophs, that their survival relies on efficient host recognition, and that they respond with their germinative structures. The production of strigolactones by plants may well have given them a selective advantage during evolution by encouraging their advantageous association with AM fungi. The parasitic weeds, which appeared much later in evolution than AM fungi, may then have exploited the production of strigolactones by roots for the purpose of colonising their hosts. Thus, the signal transduction systems through which AM fungi and parasitic weeds detect strigolactones may have emerged independently by convergent evolution.</p>
      <p>A similar evolutionary mechanism might have given rise, from the ancestral mycorrhizal (Myc) signalling pathway, to the more recent nodulation (Nod) signalling pathway, activated by Nod factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b034">34</xref>]. Myc factors have not been isolated and characterised yet, but they are suspected to be essential symbiotic signals produced by AM fungi that activate the plant's symbiotic program. In the legume 
				<italic>M. truncatula,</italic> gene expression and root development respond to (a) diffusible compound(s) produced by AM fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b037">37</xref>]. It will be interesting to investigate whether the strigolactone stimulation of AM fungi is strictly required for Myc factor production, as is the case for Nod factor production by 
				<italic>Rhizobium</italic> in response to plant flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b038">38</xref>]. Whether directly or indirectly, we expect that strigolactone stimulation of fungal respiration will increase production of Myc factors, and will help us to isolate and characterise these fungal symbiotic signals.

The lipophilic fraction was dried and re-dissolved in 1 ml of methanol. Insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation, and the methanol phase was diluted with one volume of water. Purification was carried out by HPLC (Spectraphysics, Newport, United States) with a C18 column (Hypurity Elite C18, 250 × 3 × 5 μm, Hypersil, Thermo Electron, Cergy-Pontoise, France). The samples were separated using a gradient from 80:20 (v:v) water/acetonitrile (AcN) to 100% AcN at a constant flow rate of 400μl/min<sup>−1</sup>, and fractions were collected every 2 min. The absorbancy of the eluates at 300 nm was monitored with a model Spectra 100 detector (Spectraphysics), and the data were integrated with Borwin 1.5 chromatography software (Borwin, Varian, Les Ulis, France). The fraction with activity in the

					<italic>.</italic> To verify that dihydrosorgoleone and resorcinol were the predominant molecules (molecular ion: m/z 360 and 374, respectively) an aliquot dissolved in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (100 μl) was analysed by GC-MS on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 12n HP-1 column and a Hewlett-Packard series 5989A mass detector (electron impact). Chromatography was performed under the following conditions: an initial oven temperature of 60 °C, a ramp of 20 °C/min up to a temperature of 100 °C, and a ramp of 8 °C/min up to a temperature of 290 °C. Total runs lasted 26 min. Resorcinol is believed to be a stabiliser of dihydrosorgoleone. This hydrophobic extract was tested at dilutions from 10<sup>−3</sup> M to 10<sup>−7</sup> M. The strigolactone analogue GR 24 was generously provided by B. Zwanenburg (Nijmegen University, Netherlands) and was prepared in 100% acetone and diluted with water to get 10<sup>−7</sup> M to 10<sup>−13</sup> M final concentrations. GR7 (Argus Fine Chemicals, Brighton, United Kingdom) was diluted 50:50 in methanol:water from 10<sup>−5</sup> M to 10<sup>−11</sup> M. Synthetic sorgolactone was purchased from Chiralix B.V.

Two small wells in each half of the petri dish, near the hyphal tip, were cut in the gel with the tip of a Pasteur pipette and 5μl of the solution to test was injected in each well. 24 h later, hyphal branching was recorded either “semi-quantitatively,” based on branch density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040226-b012">12</xref>], or quantitatively by counting newly formed hyphal branches. The molecules tested were: parthenolide, arteminisin, dihydrosorgoleone (and resorcinol), the strigolactone analogues (GR24, GR7) and synthetic sorgolactone. Hyphal elongation was measured with a 2-mm square grid. Mean values were compared using the one-way Anova test (

A time-course was also carried out with the strigolactone analogue GR7. GR7 was not injected but incorporated, after autoclaving the medium, at a final concentration of 10<sup>−7</sup> M. The number of hyphal branches and the number of centimeters of elongated hyphae (main germ tube plus branches), per germinating spore, were recorded from day 5 to 14.

					<italic>Sorghum</italic> seeds (around 80) were transferred to a sterilised funnel culture system: a 15-cm diameter filter unit packed with glass wool moistened with 100 ml of sterile distilled water and placed on top of a 500-ml vacuum flask. Each culture unit was incubated in a growth chamber under a day/night cycle of 16/8 h, at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity. At 24-h intervals, root exudates were collected by suction. Every 24 h, the glass wool was washed with 150 ml of sterile distilled water. Root exudate samples were extracted three times with 50 ml of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extracts were dried in a rotary evaporator at 23 °C, redissolved in 2 ml of methanol and stored at −20 °C. They were then pooled and dried in a rotary evaporator, redissolved in 3 ml of water:AcN (70:30, v:v) and chromatographed on a 6-ml C<sub>18</sub> column Mega Bond Elut (Varian) using increasing concentrations of AcN as the mobile phase: (80:20 water:AcN) fraction 1, (70:30) fraction 2, (60:40) fraction 3, (50:50) fraction 4, (40:60) fraction 5, and (0:100) fraction 6. The fractions were dried in a rotary evaporator and purified by HPLC. 50-μl samples were injected into a 25-cm × 3-mm Hypurity Elite C<sub>18</sub> reverse-phase column (Hypersil) with a 5-μm pore size. A SP8800 Ternary HPLC Pump (Spectraphysics) was used. The samples were separated using a gradient from 70:30 water: AcN to 100% AcN at a constant flow rate of 400 μl/min, and fractions were collected every 2 min. The absorbance of the eluent was monitored at 239 nm (λ<sub>max</sub> of synthetic sorgolactone as determined with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer; Cary 100 Scan, Varian). The ESI-MS/MS analyses were performed using a 4000 Q Trap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with a Turbo V (MDS Sciex, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) source for electro-spray ionisation in the positive ion mode. The mass range of the system is up to 3000 m/z. The samples were infused at a rate of 20 μl/min and monitored in the EPI scan mode at a scan rate of 250 amu/s in the positive ion mode. A standard solution of synthetic sorgolactone at 10<sup>−7</sup> M in AcN:water:HCOOH (90:10:0.1) was used for the optimisation procedure. The nebuliser gas flow was 40 psi, and the capillary voltage was 4400 V. Fragmentation was performed by collision induced dissociation with nitrogen at a collision energy of 28 V. Declustering potential was 90 V. To detect sorgolactone in 
					<italic>Sorghum</italic> tissues, roots and leaves of 4-wk-old 
					<italic>Sorghum</italic> seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen. Crushed material was extracted, purified, and analysed as above.
