In a simulation model of an evolving population of asexually replicating RNA molecules, initially deleterious mutations accumulated at rates nearly equal to that of initially beneficial mutations, <italic>without</italic> impeding evolutionary progress. As the mutation rate was increased within a moderate range, deleterious mutation accumulation and mean fitness improvement both increased. The fixation rates were higher than predicted by many population-genetic models. This seemingly paradoxical result was resolved in part by the observation that, during the time to fixation, the selection coefficient (<italic>s</italic>) of initially deleterious mutations reversed to confer a selective advantage. Significantly, more than half of the fixations of initially deleterious mutations involved fitness reversals. These fitness reversals had a substantial effect on the total fitness of the genome and thus contributed to its success in the population. Despite the relative importance of fitness reversals, however, the probabilities of fixation for both initially beneficial and initially deleterious mutations were exceedingly small (on the order of 10<sup>−5</sup> of all mutations).</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Mutations are the fuel of natural selection. It is widely believed that most mutations are deleterious, that is, they harm the organisms in which they occur. Thus, biologists would like to understand how deleterious mutations impact evolution. Most of the theoretical work on this problem makes an important assumption: mutations that start bad stay bad. It may be possible, however, for an initially bad mutation to become good (beneficial) by interacting with subsequent mutations. In this study, Cowperthwaite, Bull, and Meyers show that such “fitness reversals” are surprisingly common and can lead to the fixation of initially deleterious mutations. Perhaps mutations that undergo such changes serve as stepping stones for greater evolutionary progress.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported in part by a fellowship from an National Science Foundation IGERT graduate training grant in Computational Phylogenetics and Applications to Biology to MCC (NSF DGE-0114387) and a research grant to JJB (NIH GM-57756).

Accumulation of deleterious mutations is expected to affect the rate and course of many biological processes such as sexual selection, development of cancer, and senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b006">6</xref>]. The theoretical work underlying these predictions makes an important assumption: the fitness effect of a deleterious mutation is constant until the mutation disappears or fixes.</p><p>In the standard infinite population experiencing a combination of natural selection and random mutation, deleterious mutations should not fix, but accumulate to a level perfectly balanced by mutation and selection. Some processes can lead to deleterious mutations fixing in infinite populations, however. For example, in Eigen's quasispecies model, high rates of mutation can overwhelm selection and shift the mutation–selection balance such that deleterious mutations accumulate to exceedingly high levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b008">8</xref>]. In finite populations, several processes may also allow deleterious mutation fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b009">9</xref>]. The best studied of these is random genetic drift—the stochastic fixation of deleterious mutations in relatively small populations. Additionally, if recombination is rare and the population size is finite, then deleterious mutations can hitchhike to fixation with independently acting beneficial mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b011">11</xref>].</p><p>The fixation of deleterious mutations certainly reduces the fitness of populations. It may be possible, however, for the fitness effect of an initially deleterious mutation to change over time. In particular, compensatory mutations may evolve that reduce the negative impact of deleterious mutations or, in extreme cases, the resulting fitness may be even higher than the fitness of the ancestor in which the deleterious mutation arose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b012">12</xref>]. Such compensatory mutations may appear before (or after) the deleterious mutation has fixed. Metaphorically speaking, while fixed deleterious mutations are generally expected to be bad, they may be stepping stones to distant adaptive peaks.</p><p>Evolutionary geneticists have long considered mutations that ameliorate or compensate for the deleterious effect of a prior mutation. The literature on this subject, however, focuses almost exclusively on compensatory mutations occurring after the fixation of the initial deleterious mutation, and therefore does not address the likelihood that the initial mutation will fix in the first place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b015">15</xref>]. One possible explanation for this emphasis is convenience—both mathematical and experimental. To greatly simplify the evolutionary dynamics, population-genetic models of adaptation typically assume that selection is much stronger than mutation: strong selection, weak mutation (SSWM). Under this assumption, a deleterious mutation will disappear or fix before secondary mutations arise in the genome and thus the fitness effect of a deleterious mutation remains unchanged throughout its evolutionary trajectory to either fixation or loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b016">16</xref>].</p><p>If the mutation rate is relatively large, however, additional mutations may arise in the genome carrying the initially deleterious mutation before it fixes or is lost. Such secondary mutations change the genetic background and thus potentially change the fitness effect of the initial deleterious mutation. The background selection literature has frequently considered the scenario in which a good mutation is driven to extinction by bad mutations (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b017">17</xref>] and references therein). Our interest, however, is in a process involving epistasis between mutations that results in amelioration of the deleterious effect and, ultimately, the fixation of an initially bad mutation. Although this process seems to have been largely ignored in the population genetics literature, one notable study by Kimura shows that mutations at two linked alleles, which are singly deleterious but jointly neutral, can both fix relatively rapidly even in large populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b018">18</xref>]. There has also been recent interest in the ability of populations to escape from local optima via less fit intermediate genotypes (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b012">12</xref>] and references therein).</p><p>Here we use a computational model of asexually replicating RNA molecules to study the fixation of deleterious mutations. We first observe that initially deleterious mutations fix at a far greater rate than expected for an evolving asexual population and that some populations achieve high mean fitness despite rapidly accumulating deleterious mutations. We then reconcile this paradox by systematically characterizing the processes leading to fixation, which include random genetic drift, hitchhiking upon independently acting beneficial mutations, and fitness-effect reversals upon secondary (compensatory) mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Simulation Model</title><p>We used a computational simulation of a population of replicating and evolving RNA molecules. Similar simulation models have been extensively used in previous studies of evolutionary dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b024">24</xref>]. The program, RNAvolver (available from MCC upon request), was designed to make straightforward comparisons to existing theory by simulating a stochastic, discrete-generation, asexually replicating population with a fixed size. The fitness function is based on the folding of RNA sequences into secondary structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b025">25</xref>]. The fitness effect of a mutation thus stems from a biologically explicit model of molecular structure and is not simply selected from a probability distribution of mutational effects, as in simpler evolutionary models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>In our model, the genotype of each member of the population is the primary RNA sequence of <italic>L</italic> = 76 nucleotides, which is similar in size to a typical tRNA molecule. The focal phenotype is RNA secondary structure (“shape,” informally), which provides the scaffold for functional tertiary structure and has been highly conserved during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b027">27</xref>]. In the simulation program, the “fitness” of each genotype is a function of its repertoire of probable secondary structures, which we predict using thermodynamic minimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b030">30</xref>]. The folding algorithm is relatively accurate for shorter molecules, but is not able to model pseudoknots (a common tertiary structure motif) and other noncanonical interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b032">32</xref>].</p><p>Fitness depends on both similarity to a reference shape (the “target,” <italic>t</italic>) and thermodynamic stability, which is believed to impose a selective constraint on both naturally and artificially evolved RNA molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b033">33</xref>]. To assign fitness to a molecule, we first predict the <italic>ensemble</italic> of lowest free energy shapes (all shapes within 3 kcal/mol of the groundstate) using the ViennaRNA-1.5 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b030">30</xref>] and then measure the structural difference between each shape (<italic>σ</italic>) in the ensemble and the target structure <italic>t</italic>.

To determine the Hamming distance between two shapes, we measured the number of positions at which the parenthesized representations (e.g. ((((....)))), where matching parentheses are paired bases and dots are unpaired bases) of the shapes differ. For example, two structures that differ by exactly one base pair would have a Hamming distance of two. By setting fitness equal to a hyperbolic function of the distance to the target shape, we model strong selection for that target, that is, only molecules very similar to the target are expected to function well.

This fitness function assumes that both the structure of the molecule and its thermodynamic stability are important for function. The range of fitness values possible given our choice of parameters is 0.99–100.0. Prior studies show that the evolutionary dynamics are relatively robust to the particular choice of fitness function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b024">24</xref>].

Population size was held fixed at <italic>N</italic> = 1,000, which was a compromise between minimizing computational time and maximizing <italic>N</italic>. Mutation rates were identical for all bases in the RNA alphabet. These mutation rates spanned the range of published estimates for microorganisms including viruses and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b034">34</xref>].

For each genotype containing the mutation, we verified that the mutation was always present in the lineage leading from the initial deleterious mutation, and never lost and subsequently reacquired. The subsequent analysis considers all deleterious mutations that met this 95% criteria (henceforth referred to as the “fixation threshold”).

This model assumes that there are no subsequent changes in the mutant lineage before fixation or loss. We used Kimura's equation to predict the role of drift in the ascent of deleterious mutations and defined <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> as the average number of individuals that produce progeny in each generation, which gave an upper bound for <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>. Individuals produced roughly equal numbers of offspring in each generation (unpublished data), however, so the actual value of <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> was likely close to this value. We emphasize that our populations significantly deviate from the idealized ones Kimura considered, and therefore these calculations are only intended to serve as a rough approximation of what might be expected to occur by drift alone. For example, under the SSWM approximation, mutations necessarily arise and proceed to fixation (or loss) one at a time; in our model, multiple mutations can simultaneously proceed to fixation or loss.

We focused our attention on the smaller subset of deleterious mutations that fixed in the populations. Three distinct processes accounted for the success of these mutations: 1) random genetic drift, 2) hitchhiking, and 3) fitness reversals, i.e., the fitness effect changed from bad to good.</p><p>We discuss these processes in reverse order, beginning with the most prevalent and unexpected of the three: fitness reversals driven by compensatory mutations. Suppose a deleterious mutation arises and decreases the fitness of the genotype carrying it by a factor <italic>s</italic>. Population-genetic models of adaptation generally assume conditions of strong selection and weak mutation, SSWM, and, therefore, during the trajectory to either fixation or loss, no additional change occurs in the genotype carrying the deleterious mutation. Under the SSWM assumptions, <italic>s</italic> would not be expected to change during the evolutionary trajectory of the mutation. If the SSWM assumptions are relaxed, however, a genome carrying the deleterious mutation may experience additional mutations before it fixes or is lost from the population, and thus the <italic>s</italic>-value of the initial mutation may change.</p><p>For each genome experiencing a deleterious mutation (<italic>g<sub>0</sub></italic>), a complete genealogy was kept of every genotype that descended from it. A deleterious mutation (δ) was considered fixed when at least 95% of the genotypes in the extant population retained δ throughout their evolutionary histories. Starting with the extant population in which δ was first fixed, we searched backward to identify the most recent common ancestor genotype (<italic>g<sub>MRCA</sub></italic>) of all genotypes that retained δ. Since the populations were evolved under moderately high mutation rates, <italic>g<sub>MRCA</sub></italic> often contained δ p-lus several subsequent mutations at other sites that arose after δ and before the fixation of δ.</p><p>We identified the single-descendant lineage of genotypes that captured the history of mutations beginning at <italic>g<sub>0</sub></italic> and ending at <italic>g<sub>MRCA</sub></italic>: {<italic>g<sub>o</sub>, g<sub>1</sub>,…, g<sub>i</sub> ,g<sub>MRCA</sub></italic>}, which we referred to as the “descendant lineage” of δ. The typical number of subsequent mutations in the descendant lineage was 2–10 (2–40) in populations experiencing <italic>U</italic> = 0.08 (<italic>U</italic> = 0.32). Each subsequent mutation could have altered the fitness effect of δ before its fixation, and therefore we measured the fitness effect (<italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>) of δ at each “step” along this single descendant lineage from <italic>g<sub>0</sub></italic> to <italic>g<sub>MRCA</sub></italic> (δ was necessarily present at each step). We used this temporal series of <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic> to capture the changing fitness effect of δ.</p><p>Many of the deleterious mutation fixation events were characterized by dramatic fitness reversals before fixation occurred, as the genotypes containing δ accumulated additional mutations. These subsequent mutations rapidly transformed δ from a liability into an asset and, thereby, increased its probability of success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020141-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Both the rate and magnitude of the fitness-effect reversals appeared to increase with mutation rate. For a random sample of deleterious mutations that never fixed, the pattern was markedly different. These mutations typically remained a liability upon subsequent mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020141-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), though the few deleterious mutations that persisted for five or six steps appeared to have acquired some small-effect compensatory mutations.

We simulated the adaptation of asexual populations of 1,000 individual RNA genomes that each coded for a phenotype, which consisted of a set of thermodynamically probable secondary structures. In turn, fitness depended on the overall similarity of a molecule's phenotype to a target shape. The effect of a mutation was determined by measuring its impact on the shape of the molecule (its phenotype), and thus the distribution of fitness effects behaved as might be expected of a biological system.</p><p>The novel result is that nearly one-third of the mutations that evolve in the MRCA lineage (the single genealogical history from the starting genotype to the MRCA of the ending population) arise with deleterious effects, yet this apparent load of deleterious mutations does not impede adaptation. This can be explained by the frequent occurrence of fitness reversals, that is, more than half of these deleterious mutations do not stay deleterious, but become neutral or beneficial through interactions with compensatory mutations. Importantly, the compensatory mutation(s) arise and reverse the deleterious effect well before the deleterious mutation fixes, and the beneficial combination of mutations then ascends together to fixation.</p><p>Kimura described a special case of our process in a model of neutral compensatory mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b018">18</xref>]. He derived the time for transition between a wild-type genotype (AB) to a double mutant (A′B′), which has fitness identical to the wild-type. To create the double mutant, however, the population needed to pass through the deleterious intermediates A′B or AB′, which each had fitness 1 − <italic>s</italic>. He showed that under continuous mutation pressure, the double mutant can fix relatively rapidly, even in large populations. The fixation time for the double mutant was not unreasonably long, being slightly longer than the fixation time for a pair of neutral mutations and much shorter than the fixation time for a pair of unconditionally deleterious mutations.</p><p>A major question is whether this process occurs in nature. There is abundant experimental evidence that the fitness effect of a mutation can depend on genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b039">39</xref>]. There is also evidence that compensated deleterious mutations are present in the genomes of flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b040">40</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b041">41</xref>]. There is, however, a lack of empirical evidence (as opposed to negative evidence) for the full process we describe, although it would be difficult to observe without detailed histories of the substitution events. In a study using the AVIDA software, Lenski and colleagues observed a moderate number (15%) of initially deleterious mutations that ultimately fixed. One of those deleterious mutations reversed its fitness effect and provided the basis for further fitness gains, though it was not stated whether the reversal occurred before fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b042">42</xref>].</p><p>Two factors may be necessary for this process to occur: a high mutation rate and epistasis. The mutation rate must be high enough that a second, interacting mutation arises in the genome before the first mutation is lost or fixed. While background selection typically refers to pairs of mutations (one beneficial and one deleterious) that have net negative fitness effects and no epistatic interactions, here we focus on pairs of mutations (with at least one deleterious) that epistatically interact to yield net positive fitness effects. We conjecture that, to the extent background selection is occurring, fitness reversals may likewise be important to the evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, the mutation rate of interacting sites must be high enough to have a reasonable probability of creating the right combinations. Some natural systems are characterized by high mutation rates, including RNA viruses. Additionally, there is a sense that the self-replicating molecules present at the origin of life may have had high error rates, and so may fit this model. In the early stages of the process, a small population size may be important to the extent that it affects the rate of drift.</p><p>Ascent via fitness reversals also requires a rugged (epistatic) fitness landscape. Although epistasis is widely recognized in genetics and evolution, the process described here requires an extreme form of it: the fitness effect of a mutation actually reverses (from bad to good) in the presence of a second mutation. Most studies of epistasis focus on the weaker form in which the fitness effect of a first mutation undergoes small changes in response to a second interacting mutation.</p><p>Recent theoretical and experimental efforts, however, are beginning to elucidate additional details of these stronger epistatic interactions (so-called “sign epistasis”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b039">39</xref>]. For instance, one recent study of cefotaxime resistance demonstrated strong epistatic interactions between mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b039">39</xref>]. Their findings, however, were interpreted within the same SSWM assumptions previously mentioned. As a result, they reached the conclusion that the evolutionary optimization process is limited to a succession of individual mutations that each increase fitness. If the SSWM assumptions are relaxed, however, then many more evolutionary trajectories may be possible, in particular those that involve deleterious mutations followed by compensatory mutations that reverse the initial deleterious effect.</p><p>Other studies suggest that compensatory mutations occur at relatively high frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b043">43</xref>]. For example, in the virus φX174, Poon and Chao estimated that fitness recovery following a deleterious mutation proceeded by compensatory mutation (as opposed to back mutation) in about 70% of the cases examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b015">15</xref>]. As another example, Poon et al. estimated, using data from 129 deleterious mutations in a wide range of organisms and genes, that approximately 12 compensatory mutations exist for each deleterious mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b043">43</xref>]. Compensatory evolution, as we observed in simulated RNA, may therefore be a general feature of more complex organisms.</p><p>Our results are a natural extension of previous work examining compensatory evolution in viruses and bacteria. As noted above, those studies almost exclusively considered compensatory beneficial mutations appearing after the fixation of a deleterious mutation and demonstrated that the compensatory effect depends on the presence of the initial deleterious mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b044">44</xref>]. The compensatory interactions we observe occur <italic>prior</italic> to fixation (or loss) of the deleterious mutation, and thus have a fundamentally different evolutionary implication: they alter the fitness effect of a deleterious mutation sufficiently early to sway its ultimate evolutionary fate.</p><p>While it is widely recognized that asexuality poses several problems to adaptation through processes such as clonal interference, background selection, and Muller's ratchet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020141-b045">45</xref>], the relative contributions of each to the “cost of asexuality” is not known. A natural extension of this study is, therefore, to partition the fates of beneficial and deleterious mutations into this broader set of mechanisms. Classifying just the processes preventing fixation of beneficial mutations, however, would be nontrivial. In our model, all processes that affect the fates of beneficial mutations are occurring simultaneously, and, furthermore, epistasis is rampant and a mutation will typically be followed by others before fixation or loss.</p><p>In our study, deleterious mutations accumulated rapidly without impeding adaptation—a result counter to most theoretical predictions. We attribute our results, at least in part, to the fact that the fitness effect of a mutation can change dramatically and rapidly upon additional mutations. It remains unclear whether these reversions are sufficient not only to ensure fixation of the original mutation, but also to constitute major adaptive steps.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank S.
