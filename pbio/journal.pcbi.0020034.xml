SAGE tags are mapped to known transcripts to determine the gene of origin. Tags that map neither to a known transcript nor to the genome were hypothesized to span a splice junction, for which the exon combination or exon(s) are unknown. To test this hypothesis, we have developed an algorithm, SAGE2Splice, to efficiently map SAGE tags to potential splice junctions in a genome. The algorithm consists of three search levels. A scoring scheme was designed based on position weight matrices to assess the quality of candidates. Using optimized parameters for SAGE2Splice analysis and two sets of SAGE data, candidate junctions were discovered for 5%–6% of unmapped tags. Candidates were classified into three categories, reflecting the previous annotations of the putative splice junctions. Analysis of <italic>predicted tags</italic> extracted from EST sequences demonstrated that candidate junctions having the splice junction located closer to the center of the tags are more reliable. Nine of these 12 candidates were validated by RT-PCR and sequencing, and among these, four revealed previously uncharacterized exons. Thus, SAGE2Splice provides a new functionality for the identification of novel transcripts and exons. SAGE2Splice is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cisreg.ca" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cisreg.ca</ext-link>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) analysis is used to profile the RNA transcripts present in a cell or tissue sample. In SAGE experiments, short portions of transcripts are sequenced in proportion to their abundance. These sequence tags must be mapped back to sequence databases to determine from which gene they were derived. Although the present genome annotation efforts have greatly facilitated this mapping process, a significant fraction of tags remain unassigned. The authors describe a computational algorithm, SAGE2Splice, that effectively and efficiently maps a subset of these unmapped tags to candidate splice junctions (the edges of two exons). In two test cases, 7%–8% of analyzed tags matched potential splice junctions. Based on the availability of RNA, sufficient information to design polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, and the confidence score associated with the predictions, 12 candidate splice junctions were selected for experimental tests. Nine of the tested predictions were validated by PCR and sequencing, confirming the capacity of the SAGE2Splice method to reveal previously unknown exons.

It is estimated that between 35%–65% of human genes are alternatively spliced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b002">2</xref>]. The <italic>slo</italic> gene, for example, is estimated to produce more than 500 distinct transcripts, which regulate various responses of the hair cells of the inner ear to sound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b003">3</xref>]. Identification of the transcripts present within a cell can provide insights into the regulatory processes that control the cell-specific interpretation of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), in which a representative tag (14 to 26 base pairs [bp]) is excised from each transcript, is a powerful and efficient technology for high-throughput qualitative and quantitative profiling of global transcript expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b005">5</xref>]. SAGE quantitatively measures transcript levels, providing the absolute number of each transcript-specific tag within a library of all tags. That no prior knowledge of the transcripts being studied is required makes SAGE advantageous over array-based methods for the discovery of novel transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b011">11</xref>].</p><p>An essential step in the analysis of SAGE data is the assignment of each tag to the transcript from which it was derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b010">10</xref>]. This process, termed <italic>tag-to-gene mapping,</italic> involves comparison of tag sequences to transcript databases. A commonly used technique is to compare SAGE tags to predicted tags (also known as <italic>virtual tags</italic>). Based on known transcript sequences, predicted tags are those expected to be generated by a SAGE protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b012">12</xref>]. Often, the predicted tags closest to the 3′ end of transcripts are emphasized, because SAGE protocols impart a location bias. However, in a SAGE experiment, due to alternative splicing or incomplete enzyme digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b014">14</xref>], tags can be excised from other positions. The choice of sequence databases impacts the quality of tag-to-gene mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b010">10</xref>]. A highly curated and more complete transcriptome database not only facilitates mapping of more tags, but also increases confidence in the mappings. Many resources have been developed for mapping SAGE tags to genes, including SAGEmap from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b015">15</xref>], the National Institutes of Health Cancer Genome Anatomy Project's SAGE Genie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b016">16</xref>], the Mouse SAGE Site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b017">17</xref>], Identitag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b012">12</xref>], and DiscoverySpace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b018">18</xref>]. Despite these efforts, however, a major problem of tag-to-gene mapping exists as approximately one third of the tags are unmapped. Inability to map tags limits the information obtained in SAGE studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b010">10</xref>]. The identification of unmapped tags remains an active research topic in SAGE analysis.</p><p>Recent studies have attempted to map SAGE tags that did not match the known transcriptome. Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b019">19</xref>] studied 1,000 unmapped SAGE tags from publicly available libraries by generating longer cDNA fragments from SAGE tags for gene identification (GLGI), and concluded that 67% of the unmapped tags originated from novel transcripts. In an analysis of unmapped long SAGE tags (21 bp), Saha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b020">20</xref>] predicted 60% were from transcripts of novel genes and 40% were from unidentified internal exons of predicted genes. Gorski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b008">8</xref>] identified 225 cases of genes that previously had been unidentified by gene prediction programs. Each of these studies affirmed the capacity of SAGE profiling to facilitate identification of novel transcripts.</p><p>Tags that do not map to the transcriptome or to the genome may span adjacent exons of which one or both were previously unidentified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b008">8</xref>]. We analyzed predicted tags derived from known transcripts and observed that between 2% to 6% of these tags span a splice junction. Thus, even tags that do not map to the genome are anticipated to be a resource for the discovery of novel transcripts. To test our hypothesis, we developed an algorithm, SAGE2Splice, for mapping tags to potential splice junctions in a genome. Applying this new method for tag-to-gene mapping, we demonstrated that 5%–6% of unmapped tags span candidate splice junctions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Some Predicted SAGE Tags Span a Splice Junction</title><p>We defined four distinct types of spliced tags, tags that span a splice junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020034-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

A Type 1 tag also spans two known exons, but the junction is not present in the transcriptome databases. A Type 2 tag spans a previously known exon and a previously unknown exon.

From 17,848 sequences studied, 198,419 predicted tags were extracted based on the identification of all NlaIII restriction sites. A total of 193 RefSeq sequences (approximately 1.08%) did not contain a NlaIII restriction site and thus were unable to give rise to a SAGE tag. Among the predicted tags, 12,297 (6.2%) overlapped a splice junction (Type 0). In addition, 14 predicted tags traversed two splice junctions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020034-t001">Table 1</xref>). These were due to very small exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b021">21</xref>], between 1 bp and 4 bp in length. Since the SAGE technique excises tags from the NlaIII restriction site closest to the 3′ end of transcripts, from the RefSeq sequences, 17,655 predicted tags were extracted from the 3′-most position and investigated. Among these predicted tags, only 292 (1.6%) were Type 0. The different Type 0 frequencies between the all-position set and the 3′-most set reflects that exons are generally longer at the 3′ end of a transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b021">21</xref>]. In the analyzed RefSeq sequences, the average length of all exons was 262 bp, whereas the average for all 3′-most exons was 1,068 bp. Hence, at the 3′-most position, the probability of finding a splice junction within a tag is lower than that from the set of all NlaIII positions.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0020034-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020034.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>A Total of 6.2% of Predicted Tags from All NlaIII Restriction Sites and 1.6% from 3′-Most Sites Were Found to Span a Known Splice Junction (Type 0 Tags)</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020034.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col3" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col4" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Tag Position</td><td><hr/>Number of Predicted Tags<sup>a</sup></td><td><hr/>Number of Type 0 Tags</td><td><hr/>Number of Tags Spanning Multiple Junctions</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>All NlaIII</td><td>198,419</td><td>12,301 (6.2&percnt;)</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>3&prime;-most NlaIII</td><td>17,655</td><td>283 (1.6&percnt;)</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p><sup>a</sup>Curated RefSeq cDNA collection was analyzed to detect NlaIII restriction sites and the downstream 17-bp sequences (predicted SAGE tags).

Previous studies have shown that, although a typical intron is 40–125 bp in length, the average length is approximately 1,000 bp because the sizes of introns vary over a very wide range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b022">22</xref>].

Ninety percent of introns were smaller than 10,000 bp and 95% were smaller than 20,000 bp.

PWMs for splice junctions with respect to true donors (B) and true acceptors (C) were applied to true splice junctions defined by RefGene annotations and to randomly selected genome sequences containing the canonical dinucleotide pair at the appropriate position. The scores, which were computed based on the profile model, for donors and acceptors were plotted and showed that true splice junctions acquired high scores.

For each junction type, we constructed a matrix representing the frequency of each nucleotide at each position. Position weight matrices (PWMs) were constructed by converting the frequencies into scores relative to the expected frequency of a randomly selected nucleotide (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). By using these scoring matrices, we generated genuine score distributions for true splice junctions in RefSeq and empirical score distributions for randomly selected sequences from the genome. By superimposing the genuine distribution on the empirical distribution, it was shown that genuine splice junctions typically had high scores and were located on the far-right end of the empirical curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020034-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Hence, we incorporated these properties into our SAGE2Splice algorithm for ranking and determining the likelihood of candidates.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The SAGE2Splice Algorithm</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Pre-processing the input SAGE tags.</title><p>In a 21-bp SAGE tag, if a splice junction exists within the sequence, one of the two portions is no shorter than 11 bp in length. Each 21-bp tag is therefore split into two equal portions of 11 bp (overlapping by one bp), which are used as search strings simultaneously. We term these equal-sized portions as the <italic>halftags</italic>. Prior to a search, complementary sequences for the halftags were constructed because genes can be located on either strand of the genome. The program reads the sequences of each chromosome one segment of 100,000 bp at a time. To perform a complete search, the algorithm holds three such segments in memory at any one time: the previous segment, the current segment, and the next segment. Searching for a candidate splice junction in SAGE2Splice consists of three progressive levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020034-g003">Figure 3</xref>). At each level, only if the defined matching criteria are fulfilled will the algorithm proceed to the next level. Otherwise, the algorithm imports a new segment of the genome into memory, and the search starts over from the first level.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020034-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020034.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>SAGE2Splice Algorithm Searches the Genome for Novel Splice Junctions</title><p>By splitting each tag into two halftags and making complementary copies, the algorithm searches for candidate splice junctions against continuous segments of the genome in three progressive steps.

Positions of all matches are stored as a tab-delimited string. A complementary halftag match, indicating a position on the complementary strand, is stored as a negative position. If at least one halftag match is found, the algorithm proceeds to Search Level 2. Otherwise, the next segment of the chromosome is imported, and the search for candidate splice junctions returns to Search Level 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Search Level 2: Extending halftags.</title><p>SAGE2Splice searches for one boundary of a potential candidate intron before searching for the other boundary. During Search Level 2, SAGE2Splice attempts to find, for each halftag match, one of the edges of a potential intron. From Search Level 1, a 5′ halftag match to the genomic segment indicates a search of a potential donor intron-exon boundary in Search Level 2. Conversely, a 3′ halftag match suggests a search for the acceptor boundary. Hence, in the second level, the SAGE2Splice algorithm extends the first level halftag match, base by base against the original tag. At every base extension, depending on whether or not the halftag match is 5′ or 3′, the respective intron boundary dinucleotide is added and matched to the genome segment. As a result, all potential candidates for one edge of an intron are discovered for every halftag match. For the 5′ halftag match, the extension is toward the 3′ end and the donor dinucleotide is GT, whereas for the 3′ halftag match, the extension is toward the 5′ end and the acceptor dinucleotide is AG. A match of the complementary halftags indicates a potential candidate on the complementary strand of the genome sequence and, thus, the base extension direction is opposite that of the sense strand. If a potential intron–exon boundary is found, the algorithm continues to Search Level 3. Otherwise, SAGE2Splice reads the next genomic segment and returns to Search Level 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2c4"><title>Search Level 3: Searching remaining portions.</title><p>In Search Level 3, the remaining tag portion for the corresponding candidate splice junction is sought within 10,000 bp, or a maximum distance set by the user. If the preceding level found a candidate donor junction, the search looks for candidate acceptor junctions with the conserved dinucleotide, AG, toward the 3′ direction, in accord with the definition of splice junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b022">22</xref>]. If, on the other hand, the previous search returned a candidate acceptor junction, the search for candidate donors is toward the 5′ direction and the conserved dinucleotide is GT. Searches for the remaining tag portions for the complementary halftag are in the opposite direction. When a candidate splice junction is returned, the algorithm proceeds to scoring and ranking the candidate. Because a match in Search Level 1 could be close to the edges of the current genomic segment, having the previous and the next segments in memory allows for potential matches located beyond the current segment. If, however, Search Level 3 does not return a candidate splice junction, the search returns to Search Level 1 to start on a new segment of the chromosome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Scoring Candidate Splice Junctions</title><p>Once a candidate is discovered and returned by Search Level 3, for both the donor and the acceptor, 10 bp flanking each side of the boundary are extracted and evaluated using the respective PWM. Probability values (<italic>p-</italic>values) are generated by determining the position of the observed scores within the empirical score distributions. For a tag that matches multiple candidates, SAGE2Splice ranks the candidates according to the composite <italic>p-</italic>value. After this process, SAGE2Splice returns for each candidate the following information to the user: the chromosome number; the two tag portions with their positions, scores, and <italic>p-</italic>values; the composite <italic>p-</italic>value; and the predicted intron length.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Efficiency Tuning of SAGE2Splice</title><p>Five parameters affect the performance of SAGE2Splice, including the number of SAGE tags in the search, the length of SAGE tags, the cutoffs for <italic>p-</italic>values, the cutoff for maximum intron length, and the length of genomic segment in memory. Other than the length of genomic segment in memory, all factors depend on either the input SAGE tags or user-specified parameters. We investigated the use of genomic segments of different lengths to fine-tune SAGE2Splice for best performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020034-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrates a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020034-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As we varied the overall <italic>p-</italic>value cutoffs, it was observed that when a specificity of close to 95% was achieved, sensitivity dropped to 55%. The ROC curve shows that, although SAGE2Splice can achieve high sensitivity, specificity suffers dramatically at such settings. Moreover, the positive predictive value, which indicates the proportion of the candidates that are true positives, decreases as the <italic>p-</italic>value cutoffs increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020034-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

In the ROC curve, the point with the minimum number of misclassified candidates (defined by a tangent line for which the slope equals 1) occurs when the composite <italic>p-</italic>value cutoff is approximately 0.0025, leading to a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 0.9 and a specificity of 0.82 (false positive rate = 0.18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020034-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Among the 200,000 unmapped SAGE tags in the Mouse Atlas of Gene Expression Project (detailed below) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b025">25</xref>], 261 such tags, which did not map to RefSeq, Ensembl, Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC), or the mouse genome, were found to match these EST-predicted tags.

As illustrated, a minimum length of 5 bp for the shorter edge produces reliable predictions. In many cases, laboratory researchers are prepared to test multiple candidate predictions.

Conversely, all candidates with a splice junction closer to the center of the tag were confirmed by RT-PCR. These observations are consistent with our Edge Length and Rank Analysis (see above), which suggested a minimum length of 5 bp for reliable predictions. Thus, we recommend eliminating candidates with edges less than 5 bp.

By using a scoring system that generates a probability value for each candidate splice junction, SAGE2Splice allows users to assess the quality of the candidates. Furthermore, the in silico validation pipeline automatically classifies the candidates into three categories, based on overlaps with annotated and predicted exons. We identified candidate junctions for 7%–8% of unmapped tags, using parameters designed for high specificity. This is the first attempt to investigate systematically SAGE tags that span splice junctions and to use this characteristic for transcript identification. The online version of SAGE2Splice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cisreg.ca" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cisreg.ca</ext-link>) allows users to search the genome sequences for human, mouse, rat, and worm, the four most common organisms in NCBI's SAGE database. All source code and data are available for download from the SAGE2Splice Web site.</p><p>Scanning a genome for potential splice junctions is computationally challenging. The mouse genome, roughly 3 Gb, takes on the order of several minutes to scan. Disk access dominates the running time when the number of input tags is low. As the number of input tags increases, the search time becomes dominant. Due to the increased probability of observing halftag matches that trigger more computationally intensive searches, longer maximum intron length settings increase runtime. The time efficiency of SAGE2Splice is <italic>O(nm)</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of input tags and <italic>m</italic> is the size of the genome. Since SAGE2Splice reads and keeps only a fixed length of genomic segment in memory at any time, memory usage is minimal. Memory space is dependent on the number of input tags, and, thus, is defined as <italic>O(n)</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of input tags.</p><p>The portion of tags corresponding to splice junctions in a SAGE library is unknown. Incomplete enzyme digestion or alternative splicing at the 3′ end of a transcript could give rise to multiple tag types from the same gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b013">13</xref>]. Thus, we expect the portion of spliced tags in a SAGE experiment to be higher than 1.6%, which was based on predictions from the 3′-most tags in RefSeq transcripts, but lower than 6.2%, which was based on predicted tags from all positions. Among the high expression and or high sequence-quality unmapped tags, the portion of spliced tags is expected to be higher. In both analyses of unmapped SAGE tags, 7%–8% consistently matched a candidate splice junction when high specificity parameters were used. By applying our recommendation to filter out candidates with a minimum edge length less than 5 bp, this value is reduced to 5%–6% of unmapped tags matching a candidate splice junction. This observation is not inconsistent with the recent recognition of the complexity of the mammalian transcriptome brought about by alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b001">1</xref>].</p><p>One area for improvement of the SAGE2Splice algorithm would be to incorporate methods to also detect non-canonical candidate junctions. As in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b024">24</xref>], we adopted PWM profiles for splice site detection. In addition, SAGE2Splice uses tag sequence as support and includes a criterion for the presence of the canonical dinucleotide prior to scoring the candidates. This heuristic requirement for the canonical dinucleotide pair limited our searches to about 96.27% of potential splice junctions (according to known splice junctions in RefSeq annotation). We would like to incorporate methods such as decision trees into our splice junction evaluation scheme and, thus, allow SAGE2Splice to detect non-canonical candidate junctions.</p><p>SAGE2Splice is demonstrated to be a potent tool for computational prediction of novel splice junctions using unmapped tags. The results indicate that unmapped SAGE tags represent a rich resource for the discovery of novel transcripts. As the annotation of genomes and the characterization of genes and transcripts continue, systematic exploration of candidate novel splice junctions through the use of SAGE2Splice will help elucidate the transcriptome.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Source of transcripts and known splice junctions.</title><p>The genomic sequences of C57BL/6J mouse (mm5, May 2004) and the RefGene annotation database of RefSeq transcripts (July 16, 2004) were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b029">29</xref>].

The UCSC genome annotation pipeline maps the transcript sequences to the mouse genome and identifies the exon coordinates.</p><p>For each transcript, the RefGene annotations include the chromosome, the orientation, the exon coordinates, and the translated region coordinates. Based on this information, we developed programming scripts in the Perl language (version 5.6) to re-construct the RefSeq sequences from the mouse genome sequence.

By counting the occurrences of each nucleotide at every position, frequency matrices were constructed for donor and for acceptor patterns. Assuming that in a random sequence all four nucleotides have equal probability, we converted these matrices, for every nucleotide at every position, to PWMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020034-b031">31</xref>] by using the formula <inline-formula id="pcbi-0020034-ex001"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020034.ex001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>

					. To generate empirical score distributions for <italic>p-</italic>value assignments, 100,000 sequences of 20 bp in length and containing G and T at the 11th and 12th positions were randomly selected from the genome, and each were scored by the donor PWM. Similarly, 100,000 sequences of 20 bp containing A and G at the ninth and tenth positions, were selected and each scored by the acceptor PWM. Empirical distributions were generated by ranking the scores. For each candidate intron, the proposed donor and acceptor junctions were scored separately, according to their respective matrices. A <italic>p-</italic>value was assigned based on the relative position of the observed score on the junction's empirical distribution. Assuming independence, a composite <italic>p-</italic>value was computed as <italic>p(Donor, Acceptor) = p(Donor)p(Acceptor)</italic>.
