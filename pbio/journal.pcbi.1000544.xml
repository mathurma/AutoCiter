<p>We study apo and holo forms of the bacterial ferric binding protein (FBP) which exhibits the so-called ferric transport dilemma: it uptakes iron from the host with remarkable affinity, yet releases it with ease in the cytoplasm for subsequent use. The observations fit the “conformational selection” model whereby the existence of a weakly populated, higher energy conformation that is stabilized in the presence of the ligand is proposed. We introduce a new tool that we term perturbation-response scanning (PRS) for the analysis of remote control strategies utilized. The approach relies on the systematic use of computational perturbation/response techniques based on linear response theory, by sequentially applying directed forces on single-residues along the chain and recording the resulting relative changes in the residue coordinates. We further obtain closed-form expressions for the magnitude and the directionality of the response. Using PRS, we study the ligand release mechanisms of FBP and support the findings by molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the residue-by-residue displacements between the apo and the holo forms, as determined from the X-ray structures, are faithfully reproduced by perturbations applied on the majority of the residues of the apo form. However, once the stabilizing ligand (Fe) is integrated to the system in holo FBP, perturbing only a few select residues successfully reproduces the experimental displacements. Thus, iron uptake by FBP is a favored process in the fluctuating environment of the protein, whereas iron release is controlled by mechanisms including chelation and allostery. The directional analysis that we implement in the PRS methodology implicates the latter mechanism by leading to a few distant, charged, and exposed loop residues. Upon perturbing these, irrespective of the direction of the operating forces, we find that the cap residues involved in iron release are made to operate coherently, facilitating release of the ion.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Upon binding ligands, many proteins undergo structural changes compared to the unbound form. We introduce a methodology to monitor these changes and to study which mechanisms arrange conformational shifts between the liganded and free forms. Our method is simple, yet it efficiently characterizes the response of proteins to a given perturbation on systematically selected residues. The coherent responses predicted are validated by molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicate that the iron uptake by the ferric binding protein is favorable in a thermally fluctuating environment, while release of iron is allosterically moderated. Since ferric binding protein exhibits a high sequence identity with human transferrin whose allosteric anion binding sites generate large conformational changes around the binding region, we suggest mutational studies on remotely controlling sites identified in this work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Functional proteins are complex structures, which may remain mainly unmodified as a result of a multitude of mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Zhang1">[1]</xref>, yet may have their energy surface go through significant changes upon perturbing highly specific regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Eisenmesser1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Volkman1">[4]</xref>. The various accessible states populated may be manipulated by inducing short and long-range conformational changes in the structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Tang1">[5]</xref>; alternatively, a dynamical control may take place without any significant structural variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Zhuravleva1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Tsai1">[7]</xref>. To explore the presence or the absence of such “shifts in the energy landscapes,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Tsai2">[8]</xref> one needs to perturb the protein structure, and observe the response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Baysal1">[9]</xref>. The perturbation may be in the form of changing the environmental factors (e.g. changes in ionic concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Hamilton1">[10]</xref>), or may target specific locations on the structure itself, either through chemically modifying the residues (inserting mutations) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Blaber1">[11]</xref> or by inducing site-specific perturbations (e.g. as is done in single molecule experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Min1">[12]</xref>, or through ligand binding). Ubiquitous post-translational modifications are also possible. The response may be measured directly, as a change in the overall conformation of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-HenzlerWildman1">[13]</xref>, or indirectly, e.g., through determining the kinetic parameters, and proposing kinetic models that explain the observations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Prytkova1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Velyvis1">[15]</xref> The purpose in such work is to understand and therefore control the response of the protein for a plethora of reasons, including, but not limited to, the design of efficient drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Atilgan1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Wells1">[17]</xref>, or to tailor enzymes serving as “materials.”<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Atilgan2">[18]</xref></p>
<p>Linear response theory (LRT) has been recently used to study conformational changes undergone by proteins under selected external perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Ikeguchi1">[19]</xref>. This approach has recently been applied to the study of the conformational switching upon phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Latzer1">[20]</xref>. In this study, we develop a toolkit that we term perturbation-response scanning (PRS) which is based on sequential application of LRT to study the origins of structural changes undergone by protein molecules. Similar approaches have been adopted in other work, whereby the perturbations on residues are introduced by modifying the effective force constants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-SacquinMora1">[21]</xref> or distances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Zheng1">[22]</xref> between contacting pairs.</p>
<p>PRS relies on systematically applying forces at singly selected residues and recording the linear response of the whole protein. The response is quantified as both the magnitude of the displacements undergone by the residues, and their directionality. Closed form expressions that summarize the theoretical implications of the PRS technique in the limit of a large number of perturbations introduced at a given residue are provided. We note that we have previously studied the stability of proteins using a similar sequential perturbation-response approach, based on inserted displacements followed by energy minimization of the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Baysal1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Baysal2">[23]</xref>. Therein we have also shown that the response of the system is within the linear regime for local distortions of atoms up to ca. 1.5 Å, despite the large local forces brought about <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Baysal1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Using PRS, we analyze the ferric binding protein A (FBP) as an example system, and describe alternative approaches that may have evolved in the structure to control function. The validity of the methodology is supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. FBP is involved in the shuttling of Fe<sup>+3</sup> from the mammalian host to the cytoplasm of pathogenic bacteria. To make iron unavailable to such pathogens, host organisms have iron transport systems such as the protein transferrin that tightly sequester the ion. Pathogens have developed strategies to circumvent this approach, one of them being the development of receptors for the iron transport proteins of the host. FBP resides in the periplasm, and receives iron from these receptors to eventually deliver it to the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Chen1">[24]</xref>. The protein is made up of two domains characteristic of periplasmic Fe<sup>+3</sup> binding family as well as the host protein transferrin. These host/pathogen iron uptake proteins are thought to be distantly related through divergent evolution from an anion binding function.</p>
<p>Fe<sup>+3</sup> is bound to FBP with remarkable affinity, with association constants on the order of 10<sup>17</sup>–10<sup>22</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> depending on the measurement conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Dhungana1">[25]</xref>. It was recently shown that a relatively high affinity of iron binding is required for the removal of iron from transferrin, and its transport across the periplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Khan1">[26]</xref>. Yet, this high affinity poses a Fe<sup>+3</sup> transport dilemma, suggesting another necessary step for the release of the ion. It is of interest to understand how Fe<sup>+3</sup> is eventually released from the binding site for subsequent use by the pathogen. One mode of action that has been suggested involves the control of the Fe<sup>+3</sup> release kinetics by the exchange of synergistic anions forming relatively stable intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Dhungana1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Boukhalfa1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Heymann1">[28]</xref>. Another involves the direct action of chelators on the ion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Dhungana1">[25]</xref>. It has also been shown that mutants of FBP that are defective in binding the synergistic anion are still capable of donating iron, suggesting the possibility of still other alternative mechanisms for the process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Khan2">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>FBP is referred to as bacterial transferrin due to the similarities with transferrin in the structural folds, the highly conserved set of iron-coordinating residues, and their usage of a synergistic anion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Dhungana2">[30]</xref>. They do, however, differ in size, transferrin being made up of two-lobes having high sequence identity with each other (e.g. 45% in human transferrin). Each lobe itself is comparable to FBP in size, fold, and iron binding location. In transition from the open to the closed form, only one of the sub-domains in each lobe undergoes significant reorientation, similar to FBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Wally1">[31]</xref>. Despite the resemblance, the iron binding/release kinetics in the two lobes differ. It has been implicated that there may be several approaches used for iron release in transferrins, including chelating agents and synergistic anions acting directly around the ferric binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Adams1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Abergel1">[35]</xref>. Additionally, it has been shown that chloride and other ion concentrations are effective on the kinetics, and it has been proposed that allosteric anion binding sites that trigger large conformational changes exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Hamilton1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Harris1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Zak1">[37]</xref>. Based on the similarities between FBP and transferrin, it is of interest to find out if these routes also exist for FBP, and if they do, what the details of the mechanisms are. It is also of significance to determine possible binding locations on the surface as well as to understand the physical origin of such control.</p>
<p>In the current work, we study FBP in detail due to an extensive literature on the iron uptake mechanisms of this and evolutionarily related proteins; moreover, the molecular dynamics (MD) results of the apo structure have previously been analyzed by perturbing a singly selected residue with linear response theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Ikeguchi1">[19]</xref>. We develop the PRS scheme such that, (i) we systematically apply LRT by scanning every residue on the protein so as to discriminate between residues that have major contributions to the biologically significant displacements, measured by x-ray experiments; (ii) we provide closed-form expressions for both the magnitude and the directionality of the response; (iii) we carry out further analysis of the response to uncover regions in the protein where coherent responses occur. Our findings are in agreement with a model where iron uptake by the protein is a favored process in the fluctuating environment, while iron release is specifically managed through several mechanisms including chelation and allosteric control. Furthermore, our findings suggest additional locations on the protein surface, far from the binding site, for allosteric control of iron release. The observations fit the “conformational selection” model whereby the existence of a weakly populated, higher energy conformation that is stabilized in the presence of the ligand is proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Boehr1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Ma1">[39]</xref>; the hypothesis has recently been supported by NMR experiments by studying the protein structural ensemble of up to microseconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Lange1">[40]</xref>.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The new tool introduced in this work for the analysis of remote control strategies utilized by proteins is based on applying forces at a given residue as a perturbation, and recording the displacements of all the residues as the response. Since the procedure is repeated sequentially for all the residues in the protein, we term the technique, perturbation-response scanning (PRS). Below, we first review the theory and then outline the details of the PRS technique. Finally, we describe the MD simulations.</p>

<p>In the notation used, <bold>r</bold> and <bold>f</bold> refer to the bond and internal force vectors along the edge connecting any two nodes, respectively. On the other hand, <bold>R</bold> and <bold>F</bold> are vectors on the nodes and are referred to as the position and external force vectors, respectively. There are <italic>m</italic> interactions pertaining to each residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g001">Figure 1</xref>, as an example, schematically illustrates the interactions for a residue that has six interactions, <italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>m</italic> = 6), and a total of <italic>M</italic> interactions for the system of N residues. In the absence of an external force acting on the system, the equilibrium condition for each residue, <italic>i</italic>, necessitates that the summation of the internal, residue-residue interaction forces must be zero for each residue. Therefore,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where the 3×<italic>m</italic> coefficient matrix <bold>b</bold> consists of the direction cosines of each force representing the residue-residue interaction. The row indices of <bold>b</bold> are <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, or z. Here Δ<bold>f</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is an <italic>m</italic>×1 column matrix of forces aligned in the direction of the bond between the two interacting residues. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g001">Figure 1</xref>, residue <italic>i</italic> has six contacts; and, thus, Δ<bold>f</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is a 6×1 column matrix. Following the example outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g001">Figure 1</xref>, equation 1 sums up the projection of these six forces on the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and z-axes. This algebra gives rise to three independent equations involving six unknown interaction forces, which are the residual interaction forces of residue <italic>i</italic> with its contacting neighbors. One can write the equilibrium condition (equation 1) for each residue. This results in a total of N sets of equations, each of which involves the summation of forces in three respective directions. Consequently, generalizing equation 1 to the whole system of N nodes and a total of <italic>M</italic> interactions, one can write the following algebraic system of a total of 3N number of equations consisting of <italic>M</italic> number of unknown residue-residue interaction forces<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>with the 3N×<italic>M</italic> direction cosine matrix <bold>B</bold> and the <italic>M</italic>×1 column matrix of residue-residue interaction forces, Δ<bold>f</bold>. It is straightforward to generate the matrix <bold>B</bold> from the topology of the native structure (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the protein data bank (PDB) file<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Berman1">[43]</xref>) with a specified <italic>r<sub>c</sub></italic>. As an example, apo FBP has 309 residues and a total number of 1542 interactions when the cut-off distance of 8 Å is selected.</p>
<p>In the presence of an external force, Δ<bold>F</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the equilibrium consideration for each residue dictates that the summation of the residue-residue interaction forces for each residue must be equal to the external, applied force on the same residue. Then, the equation 2 may be cast into the following form<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>Under the action of external forces, each residue experiences a displacement, Δ<bold>R</bold>, which is termed the positional displacement vector. Moreover, the bond distance between any two residues changes in the amount of Δ<bold>r</bold> in accord with the positional displacements of the two residues which participate in the bonding. Therefore, there must be compatibility between the total of 3N number of positional displacements and the changes that take place in the intra-residual distances, a total of <italic>M</italic> number of distortions. This compatibility is very similar to the form given in equation 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Yilmaz1">[42]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>Within the scope of an elastic network of residues that are connected to their neighbors with linear-elastic springs, the residual interaction forces, Δ<bold>f</bold>, are related to the changes in the contact distances, Δ<bold>r</bold>, through Hooke's law by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where the coefficient matrix <bold>K</bold> is diagonal. Inasmuch as the native structures are stabilized predominantly by homogeneous tertiary contacts rather than specific interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Bahar1">[44]</xref> we take the entries of <bold>K</bold> to be equivalent in this work. Note that we validate this assumption by comparing the residue cross-correlations obtained from the simplified Hookean potential in equation 5 with those from all atom MD simulations (see the subsection <bold>Molecular Dynamics simulations</bold> below, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><bold>Results</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Discussion</bold></xref> for details).</p>
<p>Thus, rearranging equations 3–5, one gets the forces necessary to induce a given point-by-point displacement of residues:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>On the other hand, one may choose to perturb a single or a set of residues, and follow the response of the residue network through,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where the Δ<bold>F</bold> vector will contain the components of the externally applied force vectors on the selected residues. The (<bold>BKB<sup>T</sup></bold>) matrix is equivalent to the Hessian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Atilgan3">[41]</xref> and its inverse has six zero eigenvalues, corresponding to the global translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the system.

<p>Our detailed PRS analysis is based on a systematic application of equation 7.

For a selected residue <italic>i</italic>, the force Δ<bold>F</bold><italic><sup>i</sup></italic> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>so that the external force vector is constructed as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e011" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>The direction of the applied force vector deserves special attention. Here we choose the forcing direction randomly, attributing no bias due to the specific contact topology or the solvent exposed nature of the residue being perturbed. The forcing directions are uniformly distributed within a sphere enveloping the residue; therefore, the forcing may well be termed isotropic. It is definitely possible to favor specific directions leading to anisotropy in forcing, since there are no intrinsic constraints in the methodology dictating the opposite. A plausible forcing scenario for contact with a ligand, similar to one in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Ikeguchi1">[19]</xref> may also be conceived to determine the associated conformational changes. For specific applications, such as pulling experiments in which the application point and the direction of the forcing is identified (see, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Bertz1">[45]</xref>), we can simulate the experimental loading conditions. If one does not explicitly know where such forces arrive at, however, the response of the different locations of the molecule under the action of a virtually applied isotropic force field is monitored by scanning the whole protein.</p>
<p>We then compute the resulting (Δ<bold>R</bold>) vector of the protein through equation 7, as we explain in detail in the following. Let the elements of <bold>G</bold> in equation 8 be <italic>g<sub>lm</sub></italic> where <italic>l</italic> and <italic>m</italic> denote the indices for the second order partial differential of the total energy with respect to the directionality (<italic>l</italic>, <italic>m</italic> = <italic>x<sub>j</sub></italic>, <italic>y<sub>j</sub></italic> or z<sub>j</sub>; <italic>j</italic> is the residue index.) When a force is applied only at residue <italic>i</italic>, equation 7 in expanded form becomes:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula>The right-hand-side vector gives the displacement recorded in all the residues in response to a perturbation at a selected residue <italic>i</italic>,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula>Thus, a perturbation operates on the 3N×3 super-column of <bold>G</bold> that belongs to the residue being perturbed.

<title>Correlations between predicted and experimental x-ray structures</title>
<p>Using PRS, we scan the protein by consecutively perturbing each residue, and record the associated displacements as a result of the linear response of the protein. We define <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the theoretical predictions of the displacement of each residue, <italic>k</italic>, as a response of the system to applied forces on residue <italic>i</italic> (equation 13).

Thus, in calculating the correlations with the x-ray experiments, first a best-fit between the fixed domains of the predicted and the experimental structures are made. This is due to a generally used convention to interpret displacements in multi-domain proteins so as to accentuate the response of the moving domain to see the biological relevance of the observed changes. These calculations are repeated over at least five scans. The overall PRS scheme is summarized in Algorithm A, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Analysis on the directionality of the response</title>
<p>If the collection of forces applied on a specific residue is independent and large in number, they will appear in a spherically symmetric set of directions. The responses, however, may be distributed along a line or in a plane so that the net response is still zero. Thus, although the perturbations are isotropic, the response may well be anisotropic. Deviations from such a spherically symmetric distribution of responses hint at the roles of certain residues in the remote control of the ligand, as will be shown in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><bold>Results</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Discussion</bold></xref> section.</p>
<p>For an analysis that probes the directionality of the recorded responses, we proceed as follows: We first concentrate on those residues for which the Pearson correlation between experimental and theoretical displacements is large. Amongst them, we further locate those residues, <italic>i</italic>, that are distant from the ligand binding site, <italic>l</italic>, (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the distance between them, <italic>d<sub>il</sub></italic> » <italic>r<sub>c</sub></italic>). For the selected residue, <italic>i</italic>, <italic>k</italic> forces are applied such that Σ<italic><sub>k</sub></italic> Δ<bold>F</bold><italic><sub>k</sub><sup>i</sup></italic> = 0; <italic>k</italic> is large and ensures that a spherically symmetric region around <italic>i</italic> is covered. The sum of the responses on each residue <italic>j</italic> is zero, Σ<italic><sub>k</sub></italic>Δ<bold>R</bold><italic><sub>k</sub><sup>j</sup></italic> = 0. The results are visualized as vector plots on the protein structure (as will be exemplified in the subsection <bold>Local and remote modulation of Fe ion dissociation</bold>).</p>
<p>One may further analyze the eigenvalue structure of the <bold>G</bold><italic><sup>ki</sup></italic> submatrix to have an understanding on the nature of the response by decomposing it using the transformation<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e028" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(20)</label></disp-formula>The three orthogonal vectors defined by <bold>U</bold>, <bold>u</bold><italic><sub>j</sub></italic>, give the three principal axes of the line of action of residue <italic>k</italic> in response to perturbations in <italic>i</italic>. The size of the associated elements, <italic>λ<sub>j</sub></italic>, provide the contribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, of each vector to the overall response to the perturbation Δ<bold>F</bold><italic><sup>i</sup></italic> (equation 13). Thus, if there is one dominant eigenvalue in <bold>G</bold><italic><sup>ki</sup></italic>, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then no matter what the values of the elements of Δ<bold>F</bold><italic><sup>i</sup></italic>, they will be projected on the associated eigenvector, <bold>u</bold><sub>1</sub>. Therefore, the collection of responses Δ<bold>R</bold><italic><sup>ki</sup></italic> to a number of perturbations will all be collected in a line along <bold>u</bold><sub>1</sub>. Similarly, if two eigenvalues dominate, <italic>i.e.</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then the collection of responses will occur in the plane defined by <bold>u</bold><sub>1</sub> and <bold>u</bold><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The degree of collectivity of the response of a group of neighboring residues to a perturbation on <italic>i</italic> may also be measured using equation 20. If the response of the neighbors possesses collectivity, then various symmetries in their action may be expected. For example, if the residues collectively move in a line to open a cap, not only each is expected to have a single dominant eigenvalue, but also the eigenvectors belonging to these dominant eigenvalues are to be parallel; <italic>i.e.</italic>,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000544.e032" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(21)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>θ</italic> is the angle between the two eigenvectors, and <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> are the two residues whose responses are being compared.

Thus, we ensure that the response that is reflected on the collective motion of the fixed domain is removed. Note, however, that this is done only to achieve a quantitative comparison with the all-atom study in reference 19 and the overall conclusions of the study are not affected by this choice. When no superimposition is applied, the values of the correlations, <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> (equation 19) are lower in value, but their relative ordering does not change; for example, the largest correlations in the apo form reduce from 0.98 to 0.90 and those in the apo form reduce from 0.89 to 0.80.</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
<p>To provide a basis for comparison with results from an all-atom approach, we have performed MD simulations on both the apo and the holo forms of FBP in water.

The holo form additionally has the Fe<sup>+3</sup> ion. Three chloride ions are added to achieve charge neutrality in the latter system. The protein is soaked in a solvent box such that there is at least a 5 Å layer of solvent in each direction from any atom of the protein to the edge of the box. The simulated protein-water complexes have 5156 and 5368 water molecules, respectively for the apo and holo forms. The CharmM27 force field parameters are used for protein and water molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Brooks1">[49]</xref>.</p>

<p>Long range electrostatic interactions were calculated using particle mesh Ewald (PME) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Darden1">[53]</xref>. The cutoff distance for non-bonded van der Waals interactions was set to 12 Å with a switching function cutoff of 10 Å. Rattle algorithm was used to fix the bond lengths to their average values.

<p>Both systems were first subjected to energy minimization with the conjugate gradients algorithm until the gradient tolerance was less than 10<sup>−2</sup> kcal/mol/Å. 500 ps MD runs in the NVT ensemble at 310 K were carried out on the resulting systems. The final structures were then run in the NPT ensemble at 1 atm and 310 K until volumetric fluctuations were stable to maintain the desired average pressure. This process required 500 ps long MD runs at the end of which the average volume is maintained at 196900±700 and 203300±600 Å<sup>3</sup> in the apo and holo structure runs, respectively.

<p>The RMSD of the trajectories were calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000544.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For the holo form stabilized by the Fe ion, equilibration is reached within 500 ps, with the value 1.4±0.1 Å averaged over the remaining 9.5 ns trajectory. On the other hand, the RMSD of the apo form displays larger fluctuations, and the point of equilibration is harder to judge for this form. The RMSD is 1.6±0.3 Å averaged over the last 9.5 ns trajectory, and 1.8±0.2 averaged over the last 5.0 ns. The results presented in this manuscript are those obtained from the last 5.0 ns of the simulations for both forms of FBP. Note that, we have repeated the analyses for the last 9.5 ns of the trajectories, without any significant difference in the results.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Based on linear response theory, we apply perturbations at selected points along the chain to diagnose the response of FBP. The protein is known to have a Fe<sup>3+</sup> binding location, and the structure of the holo form is also known. The overall RMSD between the two forms is 2.48 Å. FBP has two domains, termed as the fixed and moving domains, respectively (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g004">figure 4a</xref> the two structures are superimposed on the fixed domain residues: purple apo-, green holo-FBP). The difference in the contact numbers of the two forms is shown in the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g004">figure 4a</xref>. The main motion in the protein is hinge, with the moving domain residues closing up on the Fe binding location and the total number of contacts in the protein increasing from 1542 to 1576. The Fe ion brings in only 11 of the new contacts. For 111 residues, the contact number remains unchanged; others lose/gain up to three contacts, with the exception of residue 293 having four additional contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g004">Figure 4a</xref>). The conformational change is mainly governed by a hinge motion around the Fe-binding location; yet, the two structures have distinct features. It is therefore of interest to see the extent to which the two conformations are inter-convertible, so as to describe the mechanisms governing the high affinity iron binding and its selective release.</p>

<title>Validation of the coarse grained model</title>
<p>Since the methodology employs the Hessian obtained from a coarse-grained potential in equation 7, we first determine the extent to which this potential represents the actual interactions between residue pairs. We compare the correlations obtained from the network model with those from the MD simulations for both the apo and the holo forms (by applying equations 8 and 9 for the former, and equations 22, 8, and 9 for the latter). We find that the coarsened protein model reproduces the residue-wise MD correlations; the Pearson correlations between the data are 0.76 and 0.74, respectively for the apo and holo forms. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g004">Figure 4b</xref> we display a comparative map of the correlations obtained by the two approaches for holo FBP. A cross-section through a sample residue, Asp47 that resides on a flexible loop on the surface of the moving domain, is also displayed at the top of the figure. The two approaches agree well, including the regions of negative correlations, which lie below the solid and dashed lines for the respective cases of coarse-grained and MD results, and corroborate the results in reference 19. Note that therein equation 7 was computed for perturbations introduced to Glu57 only. In the next subsection, we elaborate on the results obtained for this residue, which directly contacts the ion in the holo structure.</p>
<p>The relative magnitudes of the residue-by-residue displacement vectors between the experimental apo – holo structures after superimposing their fixed domains is shown in the bottom curve of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g005">Figure 5</xref>. It was previously shown that applying forces on residue 57 near the ferric binding site yields the expected atomic displacements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Ikeguchi1">[19]</xref> Therein, the correlation coefficient between the theoretical and experimental relative displacements, computed from the displacement vectors between the holo and apo forms, was reported to be 0.95. Example cases of the computed displacements using equation 7 are shown in the middle and upper curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g005">Figure 5</xref>. Here, a single perturbation on residue 57 is placed in a randomly chosen direction on the apo and holo structures, respectively, and the fixed domains of the resulting structures are superimposed. The correlation coefficient, <italic>C</italic><sub>57</sub> (equation 19), between these curves and the experimental curve is 0.95 and 0.92, respectively for these example cases. The close agreement of the residue-by-residue displacements between the current methodology and the all-atom approach in reference 19 justifies the assumptions that (i) the Hessian obtained from the elastic network adequately describes the system; (ii) it suffices to take the contacts to be homogeneous (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the <bold>K</bold> matrix in equation 7 is identity). We next investigate whether residue 57 is unique in reproducing the conformational response of the protein by performing PRS.</p>

<p>The latter two curves are nudged for ease of comparison; their baselines are shown by dashed lines. Since the calculated displacement is proportional to the imposed force in LRT and therefore may be rescaled by a proportionality constant, the magnitude of the force is adjusted so as to make the average displacement the same as that of the x-ray experiment.</p>

<title>Non-reciprocal response to localized perturbations throughout the protein uncovers landscape properties</title>
<p>We now perform the residue-by-residue scan on the protein. Starting from each of the initial conformations, (i) apo form and (ii) holo form with the Fe ion as an additional node in the network, we compute Δ<bold>R</bold> for each residue and record the response obtained as outlined in the subsection <bold>Correlations between predicted and experimental structures</bold>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g006">figure 6</xref> we display the resulting correlation coefficients <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> between the calculated and the experimental data for every residue (equation 19). Note that each point on these figures is the result of the comparison of the displacements of the 309 residues in response to a perturbation applied at the selected residue, <italic>i</italic>, such as that obtained from the correlation between the middle and bottom curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g005">figure 5</xref>.

In fact, on average, perturbing 169 of the 309 residues (55%) of this protein lead to displacements that are correlated with a coefficient of 0.90 or better with experiments. When we perform PRS on the holo form as the input structure, only 24 out of 309 residues (8%) that perform better than 0.90 correlation remain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g006">figure 6b</xref>).

The standard error on the mean increases with decreasing correlations, as determined from the averages of five perturbations in randomly selected directions. For correlations greater than 0.90, it is less than 0.05 for the apo, and 0.02 for the holo form; the largest errors on the mean are 0.2 for the least correlated values in both cases.</p>

<p>In perturbing the residues of the apo FBP, the residues that give the worst correlations are 105 and 205–207, all in the fixed domain of the protein. Residue 105 is in the core of the β sheet structure located in this domain and 205–207 are at the turn adjoining a helix to a β strand. Additional residues with the largest deviations between the experiments and predicted values of the structural differences are due to perturbations in the fixed domain. Finally, residues 23 and 249, located in the core of the moving domain also lead to poorer predictions. These relatively low-correlation responses (<italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> = 0.58–0.75) are not due to high coordination numbers of the involved residues which span a wide range of 4–13 contacts, implying a more intricate set of interactions leading to these results.</p>
<p>In perturbing the residues of the holo FBP, the number of residues that leads to a highly correlated Δ<bold>R</bold> profile with the crystal structure is reduced. The residues whose perturbation leads to displacements with the largest <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> [<italic>i.e.</italic>, those that lie above the dotted line] and the lowest <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> are listed in the caption to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g006">Figure 6</xref>. All of the latter are located in the fixed domain. The Fe ion is known to bind FBP with very high affinity, assisted by the coordinating phosphate ion. Those with high <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> values are not distributed throughout the structure, but are clustered in two α-helices in the fixed domain, and on loops in the moving domain. Thus, once the Fe ion is bound, the structure becomes stabilized such that it can be moved towards the apo form only through perturbing specific residues. Direct force application at the Fe ion itself leads to an average correlation coefficient of 0.88.</p>
<p>The high <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> values resulting from the perturbation of many residues on the apo structure merely suggest that the motions are <italic>directed</italic> towards the holo form. Whether it will actually inter-convert to that structure depends on the energy barrier between the two forms. It may further be that the holo form may only be stabilized in the presence of its ligand. The existence of a weakly populated, higher energy conformation that is stabilized in the presence of the ligand, so that the equilibrium is shifted towards this minor species has been experimentally observed,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Lange1">[40]</xref> supporting the “conformational selection” hypothesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Boehr1">[38]</xref> This viewpoint of “shifts in the energy landscapes” was put championed a decade ago by Nussinov and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Ma1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Tsai3">[55]</xref>. It is highly probable that following an applied perturbation on any given residue, the structure will originally tend towards the holo conformation, but will return to the average apo conformation before reaching the holo state due to the incessant bombardment from the surroundings. Yet, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g006">figure 6a</xref>, most of the perturbations applied at a variety of residues distributed throughout the protein lead to very high correlations with the displacements obtained from x-ray structures. This implies that the conformational changes attempted by the apo form of the protein in its dynamical environment are narrowly distributed, and tuned towards the holo form. These results further suggest that the apo and holo forms are probably closely located along the free energy landscape. In the next subsection, we rely on the directionality information provided by the PRS to uncover the mechanisms that dictate protein function.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3a3">
<title>Local and remote modulation of Fe ion dissociation</title>
<p>To provide further understanding of how the protein operates structurally, we turn to the few residues that give high correlations in the presence of the ligand. These include residues that are either in the fixed domain that support the ferric binding region or those that are located in the moving domain loops. Thus, it is possible to manipulate the bound form of the protein towards the unbound form by either directly perturbing the Fe-binding residues, or by controlling the distant flexible loops. If there is a directionality preference in the response of residues, they should additionally be revealed by the current analysis. Such a preference may be imposed by the excluded volume, or may be the result of coupling between the motions of subsets of nodes.</p>
<p>In the previous subsection we have shown that in holo FBP, singly placed forces on the residues listed under the caption to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g006">figure 6</xref> reproduce the displacement profile from x-ray structures with very high precision. The relative magnitudes of the displacements are correctly captured by this procedure. On the other hand, the recorded response also has a directionality that is concealed in these correlations. One measure of directionality is the overlap, defined as the cosine of the angle between the calculated and measured direction of motion. However, this definition eliminates information on the magnitude of the motion, and even if the applied methodology captures the essential motions of key residues, many others that have no preferred direction of motion blur the statistics. Therefore, the results from a selected subset of the residues may be more informative, as demonstrated by Gerstein and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Alexandrov1">[46]</xref>. In fact, we find that overlap distributions over all the residues are close to those of a random distribution of angles (results not shown). We therefore perform the following alternative analysis (see Algorithm B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g003">Figure 3</xref>): For a selected residue, for instance, from those that have the highest correlations (<italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic>&gt;0.9), we introduce a large collection of perturbations in directions that are spherically symmetric around it, so that their vectorial sum is zero. For each perturbation, we monitor the resulting response in the residues directly contacting the Fe<sup>+3</sup>. The directional response is also analyzed analytically by applying equations 20 and 21.</p>
<p>The residues for which <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic>&gt;0.9 and are far from the Fe ion (<italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>-Fe</sub> » <italic>r<sub>c</sub></italic>) are D47, D52, both at the tips of distant loops as well as the loop spanning 232–236. The results for the perturbations on D47 (<italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> = 0.91, <italic>d</italic><sub>47-Fe</sub> = 28.5 Å) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g007">figure 7a</xref>, where the applied forces are in red and the responses are in orange. We observe that many of the residues that have high displacements are found to move in a plane, due to constraints imposed by chain connectivity. Others, usually those with small magnitudes, move in a spherical region, whereas a few show movements along a line; response sets intermediate of a line and a plane are also observed. We further focus on the responses of the 11 residues whose C<sub>α</sub> atoms are within 8 Å of the ion; three are located in the moving domain (residues 8, 9 and 57), and the remaining are in the fixed domain. The volume they take up in the protein is shaded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g007">figure 7a</xref>. This region is magnified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g007">figure 7b</xref>, where the recorded responses to selected perturbations are shown. The upper left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g007">figure 7b</xref> focuses on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g007">figure 7a</xref> to show that the moving domain residues contacting the Fe ion operate in a coherent fashion at the tip of the cap that opens the exit of the Fe ion. Here, we define coherence as the tendency of residues to move along parallel lines. The local eigenvector analysis described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> section (equations 20 and 21) confirms that upon perturbing these highly correlating residues, the inverse of the Hessian operates on a single dominant eigenvalue (<italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub>&gt;0.8) whose associated eigenvectors are parallel to each other (cos <italic>θ</italic>&gt;0.95). The coherence is also obtained for forces applied on residues 52 and 232–236 (<italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic>&gt;0.9 and <italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>-Fe</sub>&gt;21 Å). We also perform the same analysis to the correlation matrix obtained from MD simulations (equations 22, 8 and 9). The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000544-t001">Table 1</xref> for perturbations on residues 47 and 52 where both PRS and MD predict coherent response with a single dominant eigenvalue and parallel eigenvectors.</p>

<p>On the other hand, directly perturbing the Fe ion, as well as other local residues for which <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic>&gt;0.9 and <italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>-Fe</sub>≈<italic>r<sub>c</sub></italic>, destroys this coherence of the cap residues; <italic>i.e.</italic>, they move in a much wider range of directions as exemplified by perturbing Fe ion and residue 57 in the right hand side panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g007">figure 7b</xref>. These do not have dominant eigenvalues in the cap residues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000544-t001">Table 1</xref>) and the angles between the eigenvectors that belong to the largest eigenvalue of pairs of residues 8, 9 and 57 are larger than 30°, making the response in this region far from coherent.

<p>In the lower left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g007">Figure 7b</xref>, we display the response of the binding region residues to a collection of perturbations on residue 105, which gives the lowest correlations in holo FBP (recall <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g006">Figure 6c</xref>). We find that the magnitude of the induced response is insignificant, although the cap residues act more coherently compared to local perturbations, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000544-t001">Table 1</xref>; MD correlations also corroborate this tendency.</p>
<p>Thus, by jointly focusing on the specific distantly located residues which (i) invoke a large amount of correlations in the whole protein, and (ii) induce local cooperativity in the binding domain, one may be able to uncover sites that remotely control function in the protein. Interestingly, the same analysis carried out on the N-lobe of human transferrin implies K278 in that protein as an allosteric controller (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000544.s002">Text S1</xref>, section E). This residue resides in a bulging loop, and does not have a structurally aligned counterpart on bacterial FBP. These observations open the way to the design of agents that specifically target the pathogen, while the functionality of the host is not altered.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we introduce the PRS methodology based on systematically perturbing all residues of a protein, and classifying both the magnitude and the directionality of the recorded linear response. The approach is unique in that the cross-correlations between residues are processed as input for further predictions on the system behavior, unlike other methods where they are the final results. Closed-form expressions for the magnitude and the directionality of the response are also provided. The protein FBP is studied in detail, and results using PRS for additional cases are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000544.s002">Text S1</xref>. All computer programs used in the analyses are available upon request. The findings on FBP are also supported by MD simulations.</p>
<p>For the particular case of FBP, our analysis suggest the existence of two alternative mechanism of Fe ion release in FBP: (i) Local control of the ion by synergistic anions and chelators acting in the binding groove, and (ii) remote control by ions acting on distant charged residues located in solvent exposed loops (<italic>e.g.</italic>, D47, D52, K234) due to their observed ability to mechanically control the cap over the ligand binding region. For FBP, the former type of control has been evidenced by a plethora of experiments where the exchange of synergistic anions forming relatively stable intermediates or the direct action of chelators on the ion have been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Dhungana1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Boukhalfa1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Heymann1">[28]</xref>. There are no mutational studies on FBP directly implicating the distant residues mentioned in latter scenario. However, it was recently shown that <italic>H. influenza</italic> strains expressing mutant proteins that are defective in binding the phosphate anion are capable of donating iron, calling for mechanisms of iron transport that do not involve a synergistic anion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Khan2">[29]</xref> Furthermore, the kinetic effect of chloride and perchlorate (which does not coordinate to Fe<sup>+3</sup>) has called for anion binding sites on the surface of FBP, similar to those found in transferrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Boukhalfa1">[27]</xref>. Allosteric anion binding sites that trigger large conformational changes located at the surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Hamilton1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Harris1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Zak1">[37]</xref> have been determined in the structurally and functionally similar protein transferrin. In particular, R124 located in the N-lobe of the latter has been found to control iron release rate by anchoring synergistic anions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Adams1">[32]</xref>. Structural alignment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Shatsky1">[56]</xref> of transferrin with FBP shows that this position is equivalent to F142 located in the helix supporting the Fe binding region; the latter is amongst the residues that result in the highest correlations with the experimental data upon perturbation. Similarly, K206 which provides anion binding sites in human transferrin N-lobe holds an equivalent position to that of E193 in FBP, the latter also showing high displacement correlation following its perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g006">figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>The results resolve the so-called Fe<sup>+3</sup> transport dilemma: The protein is ready to uptake the ion in the apo structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g006">figure 6a</xref>), but it is necessary to perturb highly specific locations along the chain for its release in holo FBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g006">figures 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000544-g007">7</xref>). This mode of action provides a mechanism for recent NMR observations of ligand binding whereby the energy landscape of the free protein is made-up of a set of coupled low-free energy states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Tang1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Lange1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Boehr2">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Vendruscolo1">[58]</xref>. Therein, ligand binding is considered as the source for shifts in the landscapes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Boehr1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Ma1">[39]</xref>. PRS confirms this view for the particular case of FBP, and further provides the mechanisms on how the ligand binding region may be manipulated, as outlined by scenarios (i) and (ii).</p>
<p>In summary, the PRS methodology introduces an efficient approach to determine regions in the protein that mechanically moderate binding region motions. It may therefore be used to determine candidate sites for mutational studies. In a forthcoming study, the biological implications from the results of PRS will be presented on set of twenty proteins that display various types of motions such as shear, hinge, allosteric, partial refolding as well as more complex protein motions, as classified in the Database of Macromolecular Motions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Flores1">[59]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although studies such as the current one help estimate allosteric sites, they do not provide information on pathways along which the remote communication takes place. As future work, it is of interest to locate these paths. Robust techniques to predict them using evolutionary information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Lockless1">[60]</xref> or the specificity of the interactions within the residue networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Atilgan4">[61]</xref> have been developed. Cross-correlation information from MD simulations have been used with residue network properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Atilgan5">[62]</xref> to generate information on remote communication pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Lockless1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Ghosh1">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000544-Ghosh2">[64]</xref>. Complemented with point mutation studies, such analyses will not only aid the protein design process, but will also uncover the physics of remote communication between residues.</p>
