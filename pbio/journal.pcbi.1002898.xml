      <abstract>
        <p>The sleeping brain exhibits characteristic slow-wave activity which decays over the course of the night. This decay is thought to result from homeostatic synaptic downscaling. Transcranial electrical stimulation can entrain slow-wave oscillations (SWO) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG). A computational model of the underlying mechanism predicts that firing rates are predominantly increased during stimulation. Assuming that synaptic homeostasis is driven by average firing rates, we expected an acceleration of synaptic downscaling <italic>during</italic> stimulation, which is compensated by a reduced drive <italic>after</italic> stimulation. We show that 25 minutes of transcranial electrical stimulation, as predicted, reduced the decay of SWO in the remainder of the night. Anatomically accurate simulations of the field intensities on human cortex precisely matched the effect size in different EEG electrodes. Together these results suggest a mechanistic link between electrical stimulation and accelerated synaptic homeostasis in human sleep.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Sleep pressure is reflected in the power of slow-wave activity: it is high after extended wakefulness and gradually decays in the course of the night. Transcranial stimulation with slow-oscillating currents can entrain electro-encephalographic slow-wave oscillations (SWO) and transiently increase their power. Motivated by the results from a multi-scale computational model, we tested in humans whether 25 minutes of transcranial stimulation attenuates the decay of SWO in the remainder of the night. A Finite-Element Model (FEM) is used to estimate the current flow in the brain and a network model of spiking neurons determines the resultant effect on SWO. This multi-scale model predicted increased neuronal firing rates leading to accelerated synaptic downscaling. As a consequence, the decay of SWO power and spatial coherence after stimulation is reduced. In addition to reduced decay rate, the model was also able to successfully predict, in the human experiments, the spatial distribution of the effect across EEG electrodes. These combined experimental and modeling results suggest a mechanism by which electrical stimulation can accelerate synaptic homeostasis and thereby influence a putative process of sleep regulation. The ability to accelerate the homeostatic function of sleep may have important practical implications.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human sleep is characterized by distinct sleep stages which can be readily identified in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Of particular interest is the activity in the 0.5–4 Hz frequency band known as slow-wave activity (SWA). The power of SWA increases following extended waking and decreases in power and spatial coherence throughout the night <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Riedner1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Nir1">[2]</xref>. SWA activity is thought to reflect a homeostatic mechanism that regulates sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Borbly1">[3]</xref>. These changes in power have been hypothesized to result from potentiation and downscaling of synaptic connections during wakefulness and sleep respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Liu1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Esser1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Homeostatic plasticity refers to a physiological feedback mechanism that regulates average firing rates by altering synaptic strength: high firing rates lead to synaptic depression and low firing rates to potentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Turrigiano1">[10]</xref>. A link between homeostatic plasticity and sleep homeostasis is supported by the parallels between firing rates and SWA: namely, extended waking results in increased cortical firing rates at the beginning of sleep, and firing rate decays again during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Vyazovskiy1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we consider slow-wave oscillations (SWO, 0.5–1 Hz) in the human EEG as a marker for sleep homeostasis and its modulation by transcranial electrical stimulation. We found that a relatively short 25 minutes of stimulation in humans during slow-wave sleep at the beginning of the night had a lasting effect on homeostatic decay of SWO in the hours following stimulation.</p>
      <p>The effects of transcranial electrical stimulation on brain activity have been the subject of intense investigation in the last decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Nitsche1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Fregni1">[13]</xref>. A number of studies show specific enhancement in human cognitive performance including memory, language, computational, and executive function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Marshall1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Dockery1">[17]</xref>. The mechanisms leading to the observed cognitive effects of weak electrical stimulation in human behavioral studies remain fundamentally unaddressed. The current mechanistic explanation is limited to the notion of neuronal excitability where function is “increased” or “decreased” by virtue of neuronal polarization with anodal or cathodal stimulation respectively. However, the basic physics of current flow calls this simple notion into question as cortical folding leads to varying polarity across cortex making the origins of polarity specific effects unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Datta1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, while acute effects of uniform week electric fields are well characterized, including modulation of firing rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Reato1">[19]</xref>, it is less clear how these acute effects translate into specific long term effects.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that stimulation during slow-wave sleep alters neuronal firing rates, which would modulate homeostatic synaptic downscaling and thus alter the homeostatic decay of SWO. A multi-scale computational model makes this hypothesis explicit by linking the macroscopic domains of current flow in the entire head with the microscopic cellular effects of polarization. The model shows that network dynamics of SWA can rectify bi-directional polarization leading to an unidirectional increase of firing rates and synaptic downscaling. A number of predicted effects of stimulation on SWO are subsequently confirmed by the present human EEG sleep data. Specifically, the data confirmed the prediction of diminished SWO decay in the hours after stimulation, and the multi-scale model accurately predicted the effect sizes across multiple scalp electrodes.</p>
      <p>The ability to accelerate sleep homeostasis may have important practical implications given that SWA is widely considered to be a marker of the restorative power of sleep.</p>

        <title>SWO power and spatial coherence decay with time during sleep</title>
        <p>In a study on memory consolidation during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Marshall1">[14]</xref> Marshall et al. stimulated participants during the first period of slow-wave sleep with slow-oscillating unipolar stimulation (0.26 mA switched on and off at 0.75 Hz). Positive (anodal) electrodes were placed bilaterally over lateral prefrontal cortex and negative (cathodal) electrodes over left and right mastoids. EEG was recorded simultaneously from 11 electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figures 1.A.1, 1.A.2</xref>). To characterize the long term effects of stimulation on slow-wave activity, we computed here for each participant the power-spectrum over the course of the night. Slow-wave activity (0.5 Hz–4 Hz) is modulated in time as participants cycle through non-REM and REM sleep stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figure 1.B.1</xref>, average over 10 participants). Note that the EEG data were aligned based on sleep stages (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), and sleep-stage cycle-durations are fairly reproducible across subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Marshall1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Achermann1">[20]</xref>. We estimated decay rates of power and coherence as a linear fit on a logarithmic scale (dB), which corresponds to an exponential decay in time (example traces in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002898.s001">Figure S1</xref>.A–B) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Dijk1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Achermann2">[23]</xref>. In the present data the homeostatic decay of power in the band of slow-wave oscillations (0.5 Hz–1 Hz) amounted to −1.22<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.18 dB/hour (mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sem, p-value = 0.0001, N = 10, Student's t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figure 1.B.3</xref>, analysis window of 4.5 h marked in black, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In addition to changes in power, the computational model, which will be presented in the following sections, predicted that the spatial coherence of SWO should also decay. The coherence-spectrum between electrode pairs was computed and averaged across all pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figure 1.C.1</xref>, average over 10 participants). In the band of SWO, coherence decays at a rate of −0.70<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.12 dB/hour (mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sem, p-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, N = 10, Student's t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figure 1.C.3</xref>). The present measure of spatial coherence is normalized by power. Thus, its decay does not simply capture a decrease in power but reflects instead a break-up of large scale coherent oscillations over distant cortical areas consistent with recent recordings in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Nir1">[2]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Homeostatic decay of SWO is altered by slow-oscillating transcranial electrical stimulation</title>
        <p>Our hypothesis on homeostatic plasticity predicted that the decay of SWO should be altered by the transcranial slow-oscillating stimulation administered to participants for 25 minutes (spectrograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figures 1.B.2, 1.C.2</xref>). Specifically, we expected a reduced rate of decay in both power and spatial coherence in the hours following stimulation. This prediction was confirmed by the present data: the post-stimulation decay rate for power averaged over all electrodes is reduced to −0.69<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.18 dB/hour (N = 10, paired shuffled statistics, p = 0.016, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figure 1.B.3</xref>) and similarly, the rate of spatial coherence is reduced to −0.15<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.12 dB/hour (N = 10, p = 0.009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figure 1.C.3</xref>). Significant differences in decay rate are found also when analyzing individual electrodes in isolation (p-values corrected for false discovery rate are between 0.013 and 0.035 for all electrodes except F7 with p = 0.132) and the same is true for coherence (p-values between 0.013 and 0.031 except T3 with p = 0.063). The wider band of SWA (0.5–4 Hz) yielded essentially the same results (p<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.05). Changes in sleep structure are hard to assess from the average spectrogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figures 1.B-0.C</xref>. Previous analysis already dismissed possible changes in terms of time spent in different sleep stages during the 60 minutes after the stimulation or the whole night, nor were there differences in the number of sleep cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Marshall1">[14]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In summary, as predicted, the decay of SWA, which is widely considered to be a marker of sleep homeostasis, is reduced in the hours following electrical stimulation. In the following section we make quantitative predictions of this phenomenon by detailing our hypothesis in the form of a multi-scale computational model. We include a finite-element model of the current flow in the brain as well as a network model for slow wave oscillations.</p>

        <p>To determine the expected effects of stimulation for this specific human experiment we first simulated the current flow in an anatomically accurate model of the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g002">Figure 2.A.1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Electrodes were placed as in the human experiments and currents were monophasic (ON/OFF). As a result of the typical folding of human cortex, different cortical regions experience electric fields of varying magnitudes and, more importantly, of opposing polarities (blue and red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g002">Figure 2.A.2</xref>). Thus, neurons in adjacent cortical areas will experience opposing membrane polarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g002">Figure 2.A.3</xref>). This finding is not unique to the specific electrode montage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Datta1">[18]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Slow-oscillating stimulation increases firing rate during SWO despite mixed polarity</title>
        <p>To examine the effect of differing stimulation polarities on SWO we developed a simple network model of UP/DOWN state transitions. Single-compartment excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons were recursively connected and arranged on a 2D lattice (900 neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g002">Figure 2.B.1</xref>). The model reproduces slow-wave oscillations by virtue of an activity-dependent slow recovery variable in a fashion comparable to previous models of SWO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Esser1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Bazhenov1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Cunningham1">[26]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g002">Figure 2.B.2</xref>). The recovery variable acts to decrease neuronal excitability after periods of high activity (UP-state) and recovers after periods of quiescence (DOWN-state). The parameters of the model were chosen to reproduce key features of SWO in humans, such as oscillation frequency and coherence time, and the firing rate of single neurons was adjusted to match animal <italic>in vitro</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g002">Figure 2.B.3</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Note that network parameters were chosen here to reproduce the irregular slow-wave pattern typical of human EEG data (i.e. short coherence times, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These contrast the very regular oscillations often measured in <italic>in-vitro</italic> preparations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Cunningham1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-SanchezVives1">[27]</xref> which can be readily reproduced by the present model by increasing the strength of synaptic connections (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The effects of weak-field stimulation were implemented as a weak current injection to pyramidal neurons. The specific model of field-to-neuron coupling was validated at multiple frequencies in terms of firing rates, spike timing and entrainment using rat hippocampal slice recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Reato1">[19]</xref>. The same modeling approach was also used to model acute entrainment of slow waves oscillations in cortical ferret slices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Frhlich1">[28]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Different areas of the network were subjected to depolarizing or hyperpolarizing fields corresponding to the mixed polarities of the macroscopic field distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g002">Figure 2.B.1</xref>). We find that when the network is subjected to constant current stimulation, average firing rates during slow-wave oscillations were increased or decreased depending on the predominant stimulation polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.A.1</xref>). However, when stimulation was turned on and off at the same rate as the slow-oscillations (0.75 Hz), firing rate was only increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.A.2</xref>). This remarkable rectification of field-effects on firing rate is the result of the entrainment of the slow-wave oscillation to the applied oscillating field as will be explained below.</p>

        <title>Entrainment of SWO to oscillating stimulation explains rectification of firing rate effect</title>
        <p>The network model suggests that weak oscillating stimulation can entrain SWO even for very low amplitude fields (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002898.s002">Figure S2</xref>.A) and that entrainment results from a modulation of the duration of the UP and DOWN state (Figures S2.B.1-S2.B.2). Entrainment, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Marshall1">[14]</xref> is confirmed here with the present analysis of EEG data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002898.s002">Figure S2</xref>.C.1-C.2, Pz electrode, Rayleigh test, 5 trials per 13 subjects considered, p = 0.017). Entrainment of UP/DOWN-state transitions for weak applied fields have also been reported in ferret slices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Frhlich1">[28]</xref> and spiking activity was also entrained in <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings in rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Ozen1">[29]</xref>. Neither study reported any long term effects of fields on SWO.</p>
        <p>For monophasic stimulation, as in the present study, entrainment occurs regardless of polarity, but does so with opposing phase for opposing polarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.A.3</xref>). In the case of depolarizing stimulation (anodal with currents flowing into cortex), the ON period of stimulation aligns with the UP-state, while in the case of hyperpolarizing stimulation (cathodal with currents flowing out of cortex), the ON period aligns with the DOWN-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.A.4</xref>). The depolarizing field during the UP-state can increase the firing rate of this active state. However, hyperpolarizing fields during the DOWN-state can not reduce firing rate as the network is already quiescent.</p>
        <p>Thus, while DC stimulation may lead to mixed effects on firing rate across space, applying slow-oscillating ON/OFF stimulation during SWO may rectify the effects of fields leading to an unidirectional increase in firing rate.</p>

        <title>Electrical stimulation affects homeostatic downscaling in the network model</title>
        <p><italic>In vivo</italic> animal experiments suggest that synapses undergo downscaling during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Cirelli1">[5]</xref> and that this coincides with a reduction in firing rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Vyazovskiy1">[11]</xref>. This is consistent with homeostatic synaptic plasticity, which adapts synaptic strength so as to stabilize firing rate to a set level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Turrigiano2">[30]</xref>. We implemented here a slow, activity-dependent negative feedback on excitatory synaptic strength. Given the relatively high firing rate of the UP-state, this leads to widespread synaptic downscaling (green curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.B.1</xref>), and in turn, to a decrease in the power of slow-wave oscillations in the course of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.B.2</xref>). Spatial coherence of slow-wave oscillations also decreased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.B.3</xref>). Both results are consistent in direction and magnitude with the present human EEG data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figures 1.B.1 and 1.C.1</xref>).</p>
        <p>We argued above that slow-oscillating stimulation leads to an acute increase of firing rate, even at the small field intensities expected on human cortex of less than 0.5 V/m. In the network model this increased firing rate caused faster synaptic downscaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.B.1</xref>, using a field magnitude of 0.31 V/m). With this accelerated downscaling <italic>during</italic> stimulation, at the end of stimulation, firing rates are reduced as compared to the sham condition. Thus, with a diminished drive for downscaling, in the hours <italic>after</italic> stimulation the rate of SWO decay was correspondingly reduced – in power as well as spatial coherence (decays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figures 3.B.2–3.B.3</xref> and results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g004">Figures 4.A.1–4.A.2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Accurate spatial prediction of effect size</title>
        <p>To further test the link between stimulation and downscaling, we analyzed the effect size for each of the 11 recording sites. For the human experiment the rate of decay in power was determined for each electrode and averaged across subjects for the sham and stimulation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g004">Figure 4.B.1–4.B.2</xref>). We ran the model without stimulation using random synaptic weights and selected for each location a set of weights that approximately matched spatially the EEG sham condition in terms of their decay rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g004">Figure 4.B.3</xref>). We then applied stimulation to the model of each “location” using the intensity distribution of fields found in the FEM model in the vicinity of each electrode. We used the field intensity orthogonal to the cortical surface since cell polarization is approximately proportional to the field intensity in the main axis of pyramidal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Radman1">[31]</xref>. The average value of the electric field chosen was 0.93 V/m (in this case the stimulation is depolarizing or hyperpolarizing for different locations of the network; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This resulted in a decay rate for each “location” as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g004">Figure 4.B.4</xref>. The spatial distribution is remarkably similar to the one observed in the human EEG. Indeed, the effect size of stimulation versus sham across electrodes was significantly correlated with the predicted values (N = 11 electrodes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, p = 0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g004">Figure 4.C</xref>).</p>
        <p>In summary, the model not only explained the systematic reduction in decay rate of SWO power after stimulation despite mixed polarity stimulation, but it also predicted the effect size in each location by considering the specific mix of polarities near each electrode.</p>

      <p>Slow-wave activity has long been associated with the restorative function of sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Bonnet1">[32]</xref> and recovery from wakefulness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Cirelli1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Dijk1">[21]</xref>. EEG slow-wave oscillations reflect periodic transitions between UP and DOWN states broadly distributed over the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Steriade1">[33]</xref> and are thought to be involved in plastic mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Steriade2">[34]</xref>. The power of SWA has been linked to learning; for instance, practice on a visuomotor task preceding sleep increases SWA and its strength correlates with task performance following sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Huber1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Landsness1">[8]</xref>. SWA is also hypothesized to play a crucial role in memory consolidation by virtue of its ability to group the activity of various brain rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Diekelmann1">[35]</xref> (e.g. hippocampal ripples; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Siapas1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Isomura1">[37]</xref> and thalamo-cortical spindles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Mlle2">[38]</xref>.)</p>
      <p>A predominant feature of SWA is its decay in the course of the night. Many investigators attribute this decay to homeostatic downscaling of synaptic strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Cirelli1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Huber1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Esser1">[9]</xref>. In their view, synaptic connections that became stronger during wakefulness are reduced in magnitude during sleep. Consistent with homeostatic synaptic plasticity, this decrease coincides with a reduction in firing rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Vyazovskiy1">[11]</xref>. Homeostatic plasticity represents a negative feedback that adapts synaptic strength resulting in a steady level of neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Turrigiano1">[10]</xref>. Synaptic downscaling during sleep has been postulated to serve a number of important functions, such as maintaining computational efficiency of the brain by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of synaptically decoded information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Diekelmann1">[35]</xref>; allowing maximum storage efficiency while preventing hyperactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Pearlmutter1">[39]</xref>; and maintaining synaptic normalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Sullivan1">[40]</xref>. The physiological substrate for the scaling of synaptic connections could be explained by considering that the levels of neuromodulators strongly differ from waking to NREM sleep, for example the concentrations of acetylcholine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Hasselmo1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Gais1">[42]</xref> and norepinephrine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Constantinople1">[43]</xref> are significantly altered. Alternatively, spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) during neuronal bursts in slow-wave sleep may favor synaptic depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Lubenov1">[44]</xref>. Downscaling has also been proposed to results from bursts of activity leading to long-term-depression during NREM sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Czarnecki1">[45]</xref>. Recent studies also point to a possible role of glial cells in determining synaptic scaling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Stellwagen1">[46]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We previously showed that slow-oscillating transcranial electrical stimulation can modify endogenous slow oscillatory activity on a short term basis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Marshall1">[14]</xref>. The question for the present work was whether cortical homeostatic mechanisms are influenced by slowly oscillating transcranial stimulation.</p>
      <p>Anatomically accurate models of current-flow in transcranial stimulation estimate that the electric fields induced at the cortical level for a typical 2 mA stimulation are at most 1 V/m <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Datta1">[18]</xref>. This may polarize a cell by no more than a fraction of a millivolt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Radman1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Bikson1">[47]</xref>. While these intensities seem very small, there are a number of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments explaining the basic mechanisms by which such low-amplitude electric fields may nevertheless acutely alter neuronal activity, both at the single cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Radman2">[48]</xref> and at the network level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Reato1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Francis1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-MolaeeArdekani1">[51]</xref>. In particular, it has already been shown, both experimentally and using computational models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Reato1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Frhlich1">[28]</xref>, that the effects resulting from the modest membrane polarization of isolated neurons are significantly amplified on the network level due to the dynamic nature of network activity. This can result in altered firing rates and altered oscillatory rhythms. For instance, the modulation of gamma activity with theta oscillations in the hippocampus is conceivably entirely due to the small fields generated endogenously in the theta band <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Reato1">[19]</xref>. Similarly, slow-wave activity can be entrained by very weak endogenous fields <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Frhlich1">[28]</xref> or weak applied currents <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Ozen1">[29]</xref>. Most importantly, however, there are a multitude of studies in human showing long term plastic effects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Fregni1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Clark1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Brunoni1">[56]</xref>, just to name a few). These are often simply described as lasting changes in neuronal excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Nitsche3">[57]</xref>. However, the mechanisms by which weak stimulation could modulate/induce plasticity are less well understood. In humans, both enhancing and suppressing effects have been found with either polarity of stimulation. Some studies argue that depolarizing currents enhance glutamatergic or NMDA dependent Hebbian-type plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Liebetanz1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Clark2">[59]</xref>, while other studies have invoked homeostatic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Fricke1">[60]</xref>. Lasting effects on synaptic efficacy have only recently been found <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Fritsch1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Ranieri1">[62]</xref>. These studies demonstrate that very specific conditions on network activity are required in addition to weak-field stimulation in order to observe lasting changes in synaptic efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Reis1">[63]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study we have aimed to provide a detailed explanation of how weak fields, which are capable of modulating network firing rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Reato1">[19]</xref>, may alter ongoing homeostatic plasticity, and how this translates into observable macroscopic effects on EEG slow-wave oscillations. Crucial for our predictions was a network model of slow-wave oscillations that is based on UP/DOWN state transitions. We showed that SWO entrain to weak-field slow-oscillatory stimulation consistent with experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Frhlich1">[28]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Ozen1">[29]</xref>. We also confirmed entrainment here again on the human EEG data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002898.s002">Figure S2</xref>.C.1). The model exhibited entrainment for depolarizing, hyperpolarizing and mixed polarity stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figures 3.A.3–3.A.4</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrate how this entrainment rectifies the effects of fields of mixed polarity to result only in increased firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.A.2</xref>). When combined with homeostatic plasticity, the model reproduced slow-wave decay in power similarly to previous more complex computational models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Esser1">[9]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.B.2</xref>). Interestingly, the present model also reproduced the recently observed breakup of global coherent oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Nir1">[2]</xref> reflected here in declining spatial slow-wave coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.B.3</xref>) – a finding that we confirmed also in the human EEG data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figure 1.C.1</xref>). We used a simple negative feedback on firing activity to implement homeostatic plasticity. Specifically, the model predicted that an acute increase in the firing rate results in a faster homeostatic downscaling of synapses. Thus, we predicted a reduced decay of slow-wave decay (in power and coherence) in the hours after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g003">Figure 3.B.2–B.3</xref>). Human SWO subsequent to stimulation were indeed modulated as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figure 1.B.3–C.3</xref>). The results are further confirmed by the precise agreement of model predictions with the varying effect size observed across electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g004">Figure 4.B–4.C</xref>).</p>
      <p>The choice of a target firing rate was made to reproduce the experimentally observed decrease in firing rate during slow-wave sleep as reported in <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Vyazovskiy1">[11]</xref>. Previous models of SWO implemented a reduction of synaptic strength explicitly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Esser1">[9]</xref> or implicitly using STDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Olcese1">[64]</xref>. More complex models of plasticity, such as the BCM model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Bienenstock1">[65]</xref> are expected to lead to similar predictions.</p>
      <p>An alternative interpretation of the observed reduction in decay rate after stimulation may be an alteration of sleep stages, e.g. the first slow waves stage was disrupted. However, it is not clear how this hypothesis would lead to different effects at different electrode locations. It is also possible that fields have a direct effect on synaptic strength, but current literature suggests that very specific conditions need to be satisfied for plastic effects to be observed. While we made no direct observation of firing rates nor synaptic strengths, the agreement between the present multi-scale model and the human EEG data does support the hypothesis that field-induced cell polarization results in an increase of firing rate and that this accelerates synaptic downscaling during oscillatory transcranial stimulation.</p>

        <title>Human EEG data after stimulation in sleep</title>
        <p>EEG data was recorded on human subjects from the beginning of the night sleep until wake the next morning in the study described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Marshall1">[14]</xref>. Briefly, transcranial stimulation with slow-oscillating currents (ON/OFF at 0.75 Hz with trapezoid waveform) was performed after subjects had attained stable stage 2 or deeper non-rapid eye movement sleep (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Rechtschaffen1">[66]</xref>). Stimulation was repeated altogether 5 times for 5 minutes followed by 1 minute intervals without stimulation (total of 25 minutes stimulation plus four one-minute intervals). Anodal stimulating electrodes were placed bilaterally at F3 and F4 and cathodal electrodes on mastoids M1 and M2 (10/20 system, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g001">Figure 1.A.1</xref>). Current intensity on each hemisphere oscillated between 0.26 mA (on) and 0.0 mA (off) and was below perception. To assure that stimulation intensities were below perception thresholds we stimulated subjects for 10 seconds (active and sham) when subjects where in bed but lights were still on. Immediately after, subjects were asked whether they had felt anything on their head. The subjects responses did not differ between the active stimulation or sham stimulation, indicating that the stimulation was indeed below perception. Note that the stimulation used in the study are significantly lower than the maximum used during transcranial stimulation (2 mA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Fregni1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Monti1">[55]</xref>) and so well below the current amplitudes considered safe for human studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Nitsche4">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Liebetanz2">[68]</xref>. To test further for possible side effects, heart rate was monitored during sleep, i.e. during stimulation and thereafter. No obvious changes in heart rate were observed during the stimulation. The experimental protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Lübeck.</p>
        <p>For the present analysis EEG data with complete sleep scores included 10 subjects for the sham conditions and 13 subjects with active stimulation. Paired tests were thus limited to 10 subjects. Acute entrainment of EEG to the oscillatory stimulation on this data has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Marshall1">[14]</xref>. However, this previous analysis did not consider the phase of entrainment nor slow-wave spatial coherence, and more importantly, it did not analyze long term decay of SWO in the hours following stimulation.</p>

          <title>Power and spatial coherence changes in the human EEG data</title>
          <p>Slow-wave power varies significantly with different sleep stages. In order to compare slow-wave power from different recording sessions it is therefore important to align sleep stages. The EEG data were aligned to the first uninterrupted 1 minute period in sleep stage 2. With this, the SWO power (0.5–1 Hz) in the minute preceding the stimulation period did not differ between sham and stimulation conditions (N = 10 and N = 13 for sham and stimulation conditions respectively, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). SWO power was measured for each electrode in periods of 40 seconds by averaging power in the corresponding frequency bins after Fourier transform. Spatial coherence was determined from the normalized cross-correlation by Fourier transforming, squaring, and averaging across SWO frequency bins. Values are computed for each electrode by averaging coherence of all pairs involving the electrode. These power and coherence measures are obtained for all 40 seconds intervals. Their decay rate during the night was measured as the slope of these curves using a linear robust fit. The fit considered a 4.5 hour period starting at the end of the stimulation until 30 min before the end of the shortest signal (to avoid contamination from awakening). Non-parametric statistics were obtained by randomizing the labels (sham vs stimulation) and computing mean decay rates with random labels. p-values were computed using these shuffle statistic. Correction for multiple comparisons across electrodes controlled the false-discovery rate (FDR).</p>

          <title>Model for the generation of slow-wave oscillations</title>
          <p>At the network level, slow waves oscillations are thought to reflect a periodic transition between an active “UP” state and a quiescent “DOWN” state. To simulate elevated firing activity of the UP state we increased the level of intrinsic excitability of neurons by increasing the variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in Izhikevich's voltage equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Izhikevich1">[69]</xref>. If firing rate in such an active UP state is very high then a variety of factors may contribute to a gradual decay of neuronal excitability. Thus, we made the dynamics of this variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> activity-dependent to reflect a negative feedback. Specifically, in our model the instantaneous firing rate of a neuron modulates the excitability of that same neuron as follows:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002898.e044"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e044" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the value of the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in steady state conditions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for excitatory and inhibitory neurons respectively); <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reflects the neuron's firing rate (low-pass filtered spike train with time constant 0.9 s) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a proportionality constant (set in the simulations to 6). Physiologically, such a negative feedback on excitability with this time scale has been variably ascribed to neuromodulators (acetylcholine, norepinephrine), ionic concentrations (potassium and calcium), ionic channels (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-dependent potassium channels, persistent sodium channels) or metabolic support.</p>

With the present parameters the relationship between injected current and induced polarization was measured as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002898.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is in mV.

This homeostatic rule states that inputs to a post-synaptic neuron that is spiking faster than the target firing rate become weaker, while inputs to neurons not firing enough become stronger.

        <title>Finite Element Model of transcranial electrical stimulation</title>
        <p>The FEM computations follow a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Datta1">[18]</xref>. Briefly, an anatomical MRI with 1 mm resolutions for an adult male was segmented and different tissues (gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, skull, scalp, eye region, muscle, air, and blood vessels) were assigned conductivity values from the literature. Virtual electrodes were placed as in the human experiment and a finite-element mesh was generated. To compute electric field distribution in the brain the Laplace equations with Neumann boundaries were solved in COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2 (Burlington, MA) with electrodes drawing 0.26 mA. The radial component of the resultant electric field was computed as the dot product of field vectors with a unit vector that is normal to the cortical surface. These radial components were collected in a volume of a 35 mm diameter around each EEG electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g006">Figure 6.A</xref> shows radial fields at mesh points of the FEM within such a volume). These values were then sorted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g006">Figure 6.B</xref>) and the resulting field profile was applied along one direction of the 2D network lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g006">Figure 6.C</xref>). The top and bottom 3.12 percentile were exclude and amplitudes scaled to an average of 0.93 V/m.</p>

        <p>The fields computed by the FEM are significantly smaller than what we used in the network simulations. However, there are a number of parameters that may magnify the specific effect size. The polarization of the cell membrane in response to applied fields used here was based on in-vitro experiments in rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Radman2">[48]</xref>. Human cortical cells are larger, which may result in larger membrane polarizations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002898-Radman1">[31]</xref>. More importantly, we observed for the present model that the effect of polarization on network firing rate is an increasing function of the number of incoming synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002898-g007">Figure 7</xref>). A realistic network architecture with hundreds if not thousands synaptic inputs is thus expected to lead to a larger effect size.</p>

The 5 stimulation periods for all the subjects were aligned and the exponential decay from the AC-coupled amplifier was removed. The residual was fit to as sinusoid in frequency, phase and amplitude. Entrainment phase was only analyzed for the Pz electrode as this was the electrode with the smallest stimulation artifact. Note that the EEG recording equipment was AC-coupled resulting in a constant phase delay. Thus absolute value of phase is not relevant here. Nevertheless, a consistent phase across subjects despite anatomical differences is indicative of the predicted entrainment to a preferred phase.</p>
