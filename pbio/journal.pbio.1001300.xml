        <p>Social contact with fungus-exposed ants leads to pathogen transfer to healthy nest-mates, causing low-level infections. These micro-infections promote pathogen-specific immune gene expression and protective immunization of nest-mates.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Due to the omnipresent risk of epidemics, insect societies have evolved sophisticated disease defences at the individual and colony level. An intriguing yet little understood phenomenon is that social contact to pathogen-exposed individuals reduces susceptibility of previously naive nestmates to this pathogen. We tested whether such social immunisation in <italic>Lasius</italic> ants against the entomopathogenic fungus <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> is based on active upregulation of the immune system of nestmates following contact to an infectious individual or passive protection via transfer of immune effectors among group members—that is, active versus passive immunisation. We found no evidence for involvement of passive immunisation via transfer of antimicrobials among colony members. Instead, intensive allogrooming behaviour between naive and pathogen-exposed ants before fungal conidia firmly attached to their cuticle suggested passage of the pathogen from the exposed individuals to their nestmates. By tracing fluorescence-labelled conidia we indeed detected frequent pathogen transfer to the nestmates, where they caused low-level infections as revealed by growth of small numbers of fungal colony forming units from their dissected body content. These infections rarely led to death, but instead promoted an enhanced ability to inhibit fungal growth and an active upregulation of immune genes involved in antifungal defences (<italic>defensin</italic> and <italic>prophenoloxidase</italic>, <italic>PPO</italic>). Contrarily, there was no upregulation of the gene <italic>cathepsin L</italic>, which is associated with antibacterial and antiviral defences, and we found no increased antibacterial activity of nestmates of fungus-exposed ants. This indicates that social immunisation after fungal exposure is specific, similar to recent findings for individual-level immune priming in invertebrates. Epidemiological modeling further suggests that active social immunisation is adaptive, as it leads to faster elimination of the disease and lower death rates than passive immunisation. Interestingly, humans have also utilised the protective effect of low-level infections to fight smallpox by intentional transfer of low pathogen doses (“variolation” or “inoculation”).</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Close social contact facilitates pathogen transmission in societies, often causing epidemics. In contrast to this, we show that limited transmission of a fungal pathogen in ant colonies can be beneficial for the host, because it promotes “social immunisation” of healthy group members. We found that ants exposed to the fungus are heavily groomed by their healthy nestmates. Grooming removes a significant number of fungal conidiospores from the body surface of exposed ants and reduces their risk of falling sick. At the same time, previously healthy nestmates are themselves exposed to a small number of conidiospores, triggering low-level infections. These micro-infections are not deadly, but result in upregulated expression of a specific set of immune genes and pathogen-specific protective immune stimulation. Pathogen transfer by social interactions is therefore the underlying mechanism of social immunisation against fungal infections in ant societies. There is a similarity between such natural social immunisation and human efforts to induce immunity against deadly diseases, such as smallpox. Before vaccination with dead or attenuated strains was invented, immunity in human societies was induced by actively transferring low-level infections (“variolation”), just like in ants.</p>

        <title>Immunological Memory at the Individual and Society Level</title>
        <p>The first encounter of a host with a particular pathogen often leads to the outbreak of the disease, yet a secondary exposure rarely causes illness, due to the immunological memory of the host. Whereas immune memory in vertebrates is well appreciated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Janeway1">[1]</xref>, the phenomenon of an individual developing specific immunity against a subsequent pathogen exposure—referred to as immune priming—has only recently been described in invertebrates, both within the lifetime of an individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Keith1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Tidbury1">[8]</xref> and in transgenerational protection of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Tidbury1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Roth2">[12]</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Vorburger1">[13]</xref>). In contrast to vertebrates, the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood in invertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hauton1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Kurtz2">[15]</xref>. In addition to this immunological memory at the level of individuals, a similar phenomenon occurs at the colony level in insect societies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref>. Society members act collectively, similar to cells in a body, and work as a superorganism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Wheeler1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Wilson1">[20]</xref> in multiple aspects, including anti-pathogen defence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Cremer1">[21]</xref>. For instance, an initial pathogen contact of a colony due to the presence of exposed individuals has been shown to lower the susceptibility of their nestmates to infection when they are later exposed to the same pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref>. In addition to this physiological “social immunisation,” the collectively performed hygiene behaviour that complements individual defences in social insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Cremer2">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-WilsonRich1">[24]</xref> is also affected. Allogrooming of exposed individuals by their nestmates occurs more frequently in colonies with previous experience with this pathogen than in naive colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Reber1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Walker1">[26]</xref>. In contrast to individual immune priming, social immunisation thus refers to a protection of naive individuals of a colony after social contact to exposed individuals.</p>
        <p>The phenomenon of social immunisation occurs broadly in insect societies—in unrelated social host species (ants and termites) and against divergent pathogen taxa (fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Traniello1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref> and bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>)—yet the mechanisms underlying this effect are largely elusive (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>) and have only been hypothesised upon for fungal pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Rosengaus1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Traniello1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Feffermann1">[27]</xref>. In this study, we therefore aimed to determine the underlying causes of social immunisation in colonies of the ant <italic>Lasius neglectus</italic> after exposure of single individuals to the entomopathogenic fungus <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic>, a common natural pathogen of ants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hughes1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Reber2">[29]</xref>. In this system, we have previously described that 5 d of social contact to an individual exposed to fungal conidia (conidiospores; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hajek1">[30]</xref>) led to a lower susceptibility of nestmate ants when challenged with a high fungal dose after this period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref>. It remained open, however, which social interactions may trigger this effect and how they elicit changes in nestmate immunity.</p>

        <title>Potential Routes to Social Immunisation</title>
        <p>The observed protection in nestmates of exposed ants may be caused by the active upregulation of their own immune systems following social contact to the fungus-exposed individual. Alternatively, social transfer of immune mediators produced by colony members may lead to passive protection of nestmates without requiring the activation of their own immune systems (as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Rosengaus1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Traniello1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Feffermann1">[27]</xref>). The active and passive route to social immunisation may also act in concert.</p>
        <p>Active upregulation of the nestmates' immune system may be caused by perception of a trigger signal elicited from the exposed individual, possibly of behavioural or chemical nature. In humans, mere visual perception of sick individuals was recently shown to cause preventive stimulation of the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Schaller1">[31]</xref>. Similarly, in plants, herbivory defence was promoted by perception of volatile chemical cues elicited by an attacked neighbouring plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Heil1">[32]</xref>. Active stimulation of the immune system can also be caused by low-level infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Rosengaus1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Tidbury1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Wakelin1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Yamada1">[34]</xref>, which may result from social transfer of the pathogen from the exposed individual to its nestmates (as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Rosengaus1">[3]</xref>), occurring during “normal” social interactions, or as a byproduct of collective sanitary behaviour such as allogrooming of the exposed individual by its nestmates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Cremer2">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hughes2">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Passive immunisation may result from a social exchange of antimicrobials produced by the exposed individuals and transferred to their nestmates. Possible transfer pathways include the “external route” over the body surface or the “internal route” by exchange of body fluids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>. The external body surface (cuticle) of ants is covered with antimicrobial substances produced in an ant-specific gland (metapleural gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Yek1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-FernndezMarn1">[37]</xref>) and nestmates could easily pick up these substances and apply them on their own bodies by allo- and self-grooming. Immune effectors produced inside the body of infected individuals may be exchanged during the common social feeding behaviour of regurgitation and feeding of trophallactic droplets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Wheeler2">[38]</xref>, as has recently been suggested as a mechanism for social immunisation of ant colonies after bacterial exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>. Whereas bacterial infections are typically orally transmitted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-SchmidHempel1">[39]</xref>, entomopathogenic fungi are externally transmitted, making distinct disease dynamics of these pathogen taxa likely.</p>
        <p>In this study, we applied a multi-level approach to determine the functional mechanism of social immunisation of ant colonies against a fungal pathogen. We analysed the behavioural interaction rates between group members and determined whether social contact may lead to exchange of the pathogen or immune effectors, or whether social immunisation may be triggered by social signals. We determined both the physiological immunity of fungus-exposed individuals and their nestmates, as well as their immune gene expression. Lastly, we developed an epidemiological model to explore long-term colony-level effects of social immunisation depending on the underlying mechanisms.</p>

        <p>We have previously shown that social contact to a <italic>Lasius</italic> worker exposed to conidia (dispersal form, conidiospores; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hajek1">[30]</xref>) of the entomopathogenic fungus <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>, but not to control-treated ants, increased the survival of previously naive nestmates when challenged with the same <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> strain 5 d later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref>. We now directly assessed the immune function of nestmates with a novel and sensitive “antifungal activity assay.” We incubated ant tissue with blastospores (within-host infection form; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hajek1">[30]</xref>) of the fungus to measure the ability of ants to inhibit fungal growth. We found a significantly higher antifungal activity in nestmates of fungus-exposed as compared to nestmates of control-treated individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This was true not only after 5 d of social contact to an exposed individual, but already after 3 d (GLM, <italic>F</italic> = 3.859, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.017; treatment type [fungus treatment versus sham control]: <italic>F</italic> = 10.634, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; time [3 versus 5 d post-treatment]: <italic>F</italic> = 0.001, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.973; interaction [Treatment Type×Time]: <italic>F</italic> = 0.942, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.338).</p>

        <p>To understand the mechanism behind increased antifungal defence in nestmates of exposed ants, it is important to study the behaviour of group members. First, behavioural changes of individuals after fungal exposure may be a signal to their nestmates to upregulate their immune system. Second, the social interactions define the routes and opportunities for potential exchange of immune effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Richard1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton2">[41]</xref> or the pathogen itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Naug1">[42]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Behaviourial Interactions as Pathways for Pathogen Exchange Among Colony Members</title>
        <p>Compared to control-treated ants, which did not elicit social immunisation in their nestmates, fungus-exposed ants did not show significantly changed rates of either brood care behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref> or self-grooming activity (LVU, unpublished data). Similarly, other studies found that pathogen exposure had no effect on self-grooming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Walker1">[26]</xref> or only when doses present in the colony were very high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Reber1">[25]</xref>. This makes it unlikely that nestmates may have perceived a trigger signal by social interaction or potential observation of the individual behaviour of exposed ants.</p>
        <p>To obtain information on possible pathways for transfer of the pathogen or immune mediators, we analysed the social interactions between colony members in more detail. As in our original experimental setup we grouped five naive nestmates with a single treated <italic>Lasius</italic> worker that had either received infectious <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> conidia (fungus treatment) or the same treatment without the pathogen (sham control). We observed three types of social interactions between group members. Antennation behaviour—that is, nestmate recognition behaviour by antennal contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Wilson2">[43]</xref>—occurred extremely rarely (6.6% of all interactions). Moreover, rates did not differ between treated and nestmate ants or among nestmates, for both fungus treatment and sham control (Generalised Linear Model [GLM] with negative binomial errors, LR <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 1.969, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.579; data not shown). All other social interactions observed between group members consisted of (a) allogrooming (i.e., cleaning the body surface of another ant) and (b) trophallaxis behaviour (i.e., exchange of regurgitated liquid food droplets) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Wilson2">[43]</xref>. Both may be important pathways for social immunisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Rosengaus1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Traniello1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Feffermann1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>It is well known that nestmates actively contact exposed individuals and remove infectious material with their mouth by allogrooming, which is a very efficient social sanitary behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Wilson2">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Oi1">[44]</xref> increasing survival of pathogen-exposed individuals, but typically not compromising the survival of the nestmates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Reber1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hughes2">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Rosengaus2">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig2">[46]</xref>. Still, the grooming ant may contract the pathogen if it is not able to kill all infectious material in its mouth (infrabuccal pockets; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Schabel1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Siebeneicher1">[48]</xref>) or gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Chouvenc1">[49]</xref>, or if it unintentionally rubs off conidia with other body parts than the mouth during this intimate social interaction. In addition, allogrooming may lead to uptake of antimicrobial substances from the body surface of an exposed individual similar to exchanges of cuticular waxes important for nestmate recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Lenoir1">[50]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In our experiment, allogrooming rates between treated individuals and their nestmates were higher than among nestmates, but independent of the treatment type (fungus versus sham control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; GLM with negative binomial errors, LR <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 15.134, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; ant pairing [treated-nestmate versus nestmate-nestmate]: Wald <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 14.501, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; treatment type [fungus versus sham control]: Wald <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.006, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.939).

        </fig>
        <p>Despite the lack of difference between the two treatment types, intensive grooming towards treated individuals provides a potential route for transfer of either the pathogen itself or external immune effectors. One important factor is the timing of allogrooming expression during the infection course of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>. Entomopathogenic fungi like <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> infect their hosts by external adhesion onto and active penetration of the cuticle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Thomas1">[52]</xref>. After contact to the insect cuticle, the conidia first adhere loosely to the body surface within several hours and then germinate and form a penetration plug to actively enter the host body within approximately 24 to 48 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig2">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Vestergaard1">[53]</xref>. Infection of the host and onset of an active immune response therefore occurs with a time delay of 2 to 3 d after exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Bell1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Mak1">[55]</xref>. Allogrooming in the first 1 to 2 d would therefore allow for pathogen transfer, whereas after this time exposed ants lose their infectiousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Walker1">[26]</xref>. Intensified allogrooming 3 or 4 d after exposure would instead indicate exchange of external antimicrobial substances.</p>
        <p>We analysed the time course of allogrooming frequency between treated individuals and their nestmates and found no change over time in the control treatment (GLM with repeated measures, time: <italic>F</italic> = 0.973, <italic>df</italic><sub>Huynh-Feldt</sub> = 3.648, <italic>p</italic> = 0.416). Allogrooming between nestmates and fungus-exposed individuals, however, was significantly higher in the first 2 d compared to later phases of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; time: <italic>F</italic> = 4.006, <italic>df</italic><sub>Huynh-Feldt</sub> = 3.306, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006 [day1 versus day2: <italic>p</italic> = 0.178; day1 versus day3: <italic>p</italic> = 0.041; day1 versus day4: <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; day1 versus day5: <italic>p</italic> = 0.014]). Based on these data we suggest that if a transfer between group members occurs via allogrooming, it more likely involves a transfer of conidia, detachable early after exposure, than immune effectors, which can only be upregulated and transferred to the cuticle after infection of the individual 24–48 h after exposure.</p>
        <p>Social feeding via regurgitation and transfer of a trophallactic droplet may promote transfer of internal antimicrobial substances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>. However, we found no differences in the rates of trophallaxis among all four groups, that is, neither between treated ants and their nestmates nor among the nestmates in either the fungus treatment or the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; GLM with negative binomial errors, LR <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 2.555, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.465). Our data show that fungal exposure does not alter trophallaxis rates between exposed individuals and their nestmates, making passive immunisation by transfer of internally produced antimicrobial substances rather unlikely in our model system. Our findings after fungal exposure contrast with observations that trophallaxis rates between individuals injected with dead bacteria or bacterial cell wall components (but also wounding controls) were increased compared to trophallaxis rates among untreated individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-deSouza1">[56]</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Aubert1">[57]</xref>).</p>
        <p>Taken together, our behavioural observations strongly suggest exchange of the fungal pathogen between the fungus-exposed ant and its nestmates during intensified, early grooming as the most likely mechanism for the observed anti-fungal protection in the nestmates. We therefore determined if fungal conidia indeed were transferred from the exposed individual to its untreated nestmates by direct tracing of fluorescently labelled conidia.</p>

        <title>Pathogen Transfer to Nestmates Occurs After Social Contact to an Exposed Ant</title>
        <p>We applied conidia of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> labelled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) onto the exposed ant and determined their presence or absence on the cuticle of all group members after 2 d of social contact. We expected maximum pathogen transfer to have occurred at this time as (a) grooming activity between exposed ants and their nestmates is most intense in the first 30 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and (b) conidia are no longer transferable after this time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Walker1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Vestergaard1">[53]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As expected we found high amounts of conidia on all directly exposed individuals (15/15) and furthermore detected low numbers of conidia on the cuticles of 37% (17/45) of nestmates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s003">Figure S1</xref>; for negative controls see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Interestingly, not only the quantity but also the location of conidia differed: whereas directly exposed individuals carried them mostly in areas likely difficult to reach by grooming such as joints and the antennal grooves, conidia on nestmates were rather attached to antennae and legs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s003">Figure S1</xref>), suggesting that nestmates pick up the pathogen from the fungus-exposed individual during grooming. We can thus confirm pathogen transfer to the nestmates. In a next step we determined if the transferred conidia successfully established an infection in the nestmates.</p>

        <title>Fungus Transfer Leads to Sublethal Low-Level Infections in Nestmates</title>
        <p>To quantitatively determine the infection load of directly fungus-exposed individuals and their nestmates over the course of the experiment, we sterilised their body surface to destroy all remaining conidia, dissected the ants, and plated their body contents on agar plates to count emerging fungal colony forming units (CFUs). We used morphological determination, as well as PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Destfano1">[58]</xref>, to confirm that outgrowing CFUs were indeed <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>, which was the case for all CFUs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s004">Figure S2</xref> as an example). None of the 30 negative controls (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) and none of the individuals measured within 24 h after exposure (0/10 fungus-treated, 0/14 nestmates; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s005">Figure S3</xref>) showed fungal growth, confirming that we effectively sterilised the ants and measured only live fungus from inside the body.</p>
        <p>Three as well as five days after exposure, CFUs grew from the body content of nearly all directly exposed ants (80% [8/10] and 90% [9/10]) and a similarly high number of nestmates (64% and 64% [each 9/14]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s005">S3</xref>; Fisher's exact test; day 3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.653; day 5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.341). These data show that fungal infections in nestmates were more common than estimated from external pathogen transfer using labelled conidia. This may either indicate that we did not detect all conidia or that an additional infection route via the infrabuccal pocket in the mouth or the gut system occurred, for instance if groomed-off conidia were not completely prevented from germinating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Schabel1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Chouvenc1">[49]</xref>.

To this end, we exposed isolated ants with a conidia dose that led to the same death rate (LD<sub>2</sub>) and infection level as observed in the socially exposed nestmates. We found that low-dose, directly exposed ants had a significantly increased antifungal activity 3 d after exposure compared to control-treated ants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

        <p>We have established that low-level infections, caused by social contact or direct low-dose exposure, lead to increased antifungal activity. Yet this does not exclude that nestmates with social contact to an exposed individual may also obtain signals that could actively trigger their antifungal immunity (similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Schaller1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Heil1">[32]</xref>). To test this, we performed a “spatial-separation experiment” in which body contact and pathogen transfer to the exposed individual were prevented, whereas exchange of visual signals or volatile chemicals was still possible. The antifungal activity of nestmates of fungus-exposed individuals did not differ from that of nestmates of control-treated ants after 3 d of this constrained contact (<italic>t</italic> test: <italic>t</italic> = −0.376, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.711). These data suggest that a visual or volatile signal alone—at least one that acts over distance—is not sufficient to promote antifungal activity in the nestmates. Non-volatile chemical signals, such as cuticular hydrocarbons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Howard1">[65]</xref> that are part of the ants' cuticle, may in theory still play an additional role. However, their perception would always require body contact, which promotes pathogen transfer at the same time. We conclude that low-level infections alone provide a sufficient explanation for an active social immunisation of nestmates. We then tested if it may be complemented by a passive transfer of antimicrobial substances among nestmates.</p>

        <title>Passive Transfer of Antimicrobial Substances Is Unlikely</title>
        <p>We performed a “temporal-separation experiment” and allowed the exposed ant to interact with its nestmates for 48 h. In this period, the pathogen (a) lost its ability to be transferred (for confirmation see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) and (b) established an infection in the ants, likely triggering an immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Vestergaard1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Mak1">[55]</xref>. After this time, we separated the treated individual and its “early nestmates” and added five “new nestmates” to both (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Three days later, we measured the antifungal activity of the new nestmates. We found no difference between new nestmates of control-treated versus fungus-exposed ants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; <italic>t</italic> test: <italic>t</italic> = −0.159, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.876) or between new nestmates of early nestmates to a control-treated versus exposed individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g005">Figure 5B</xref>; <italic>t</italic> test: <italic>t</italic> = −1.273, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.219). This reveals that nestmates do not show an increase in antifungal activity if pathogen transfer is excluded.</p>

        <p>Passive transfer of antimicrobials among the group members thus seems very unlikely as an explanation for social immunisation. However, such transferable substances might be upregulated in infected individuals and simply failed to elicit immunisation of nestmates in our experiment. We therefore also analysed both the fungus-exposed ant and its nestmates directly for the presence of potentially transferable antimicrobials 3 d after treatment. Although allogrooming rates among nestmates were low in both sham control and fungus-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and trophallaxis rates were completely independent of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), infected nestmates may be important in transferring antimicrobial substances, as their antifungal activity is higher than that of directly exposed ants, which suffer a much higher infection level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>We tested whether transferable substances of fungus-exposed individuals or their nestmates had higher antifungal activity than those of control-treated individuals and their respective nestmates. For externally transferable substances via allogrooming, we measured the antifungal activity of (a) the cuticle and (b) the thorax containing the metapleural gland content, which is known to have antimicrobial function and to be secreted onto the cuticle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Yek1">[36]</xref>. We also measured the antifungal activity of (c) the trophallactic droplet that is produced in the ant's body and is transferred via social feeding. We found that neither the cuticles nor the thoraxes containing the metapleural gland nor the trophallactic droplets of fungus-exposed individuals showed a different antifungal activity than the respective body parts of control-treated individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g005">Figure 5C</xref>; <italic>t</italic> tests; cuticle: <italic>t</italic> = 1.064, <italic>df</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.312; thorax: <italic>t</italic> = 0.224, <italic>df</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.828; trophallactic droplets: <italic>t</italic> = −0.594, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.560). The same was true for the nestmates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g005">Figure 5D</xref>; <italic>t</italic> tests; cuticle: <italic>t</italic> = 0.107, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.916; thorax: <italic>t</italic> = 0.894, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.383; trophallactic droplets: <italic>t</italic> = −0.717, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.482). This result was not an artifact caused by a potential effect of the control treatment, as the antifungal activity in these individuals was not different from completely untreated ants (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>Taken together, we found no evidence for (a) a potential protective effect of nestmates in the absence of pathogen transfer and (b) potential upregulation of socially transferable antimicrobials in exposed colonies. This contrasts observations that trophallactic droplets obtained from bacteria-exposed ants had higher antibacterial activity than that of controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>, making passive immunisation a likely mechanism involved in social immunisation of ant colonies after bacterial exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>, but not after fungal exposure. Instead, we documented that social interaction, most likely allogrooming, leads to pathogen transfer and sublethal low-level infections in the majority of nestmates of fungus-exposed individuals and that low-level infections are necessary and sufficient to induce an increased antifungal activity.</p>

        <title>Effects of Active Immunisation Via Low-Level Infections on Colony-Level Epidemiology</title>
        <p>We developed an epidemiological model to explore the adaptive value and colony-level long-term effects of social immunisation. We compared the effect of active versus passive immunisation in our ant-fungus system by extending classical SIS and SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered/Removed) models, which describe the progress of epidemics over time using the simplification that the diversity in the population can be reduced to a few states. Possible states in SIR models include individuals <italic>susceptible</italic> to the disease outbreak (<italic>S</italic>), <italic>infectious</italic> individuals (<italic>I</italic>), and <italic>recovered</italic> or <italic>dead</italic> individuals (<italic>R</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Bartlett1">[78]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Kermack1">[79]</xref>). We included an active or passive immunisation mechanism by constructing a SIRM (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed-iMmune) model, in which ants can take five different states. Healthy nestmates are defined as susceptible (<italic>S</italic>) individuals, pathogen-exposed individuals as infectious (<italic>I</italic>) ones, and individuals dying from the disease are removed (<italic>R</italic>) from the model. Successful immunisation (by active or passive immunisation) leads to <italic>initially immune</italic> (<italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic>) individuals that may persist to create <italic>late-stage immune</italic> individuals (<italic>M<sub>l</sub></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g008">Figure 8</xref>). We describe the mean number of ants in each state by ordinary differential equations (ODEs; for details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s002">Text S2</xref>). We have thereby chosen a simple approach focusing on the comparison of active versus passive immunisation, but not taking into account spatial effects on epidemiology in societies that have been modelled elsewhere by cellular automata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Feffermann1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Naug2">[80]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Pie1">[81]</xref> or pair-wise approximations models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Webb1">[82]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Ants can change their state by social interactions with each other and depending on their infection state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g008">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Allogrooming reduces the fungus load of infectious (<italic>I</italic>), changing them to susceptible (<italic>S</italic>), but at the same time can increase the fungus load of the susceptible individuals (<italic>S</italic>), changing them to infectious (<italic>I</italic>). Active immunisation can occur when individuals receive a low-level infection and actively build up immunity, changing from infectious (<italic>I</italic>) to immune (<italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic>) with a given active immunisation rate. Under passive immunisation, susceptible (<italic>S</italic>) individuals change directly to the immune state (<italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic>) with a passive immunisation rate when receiving antimicrobial substances from infectious (<italic>I</italic>) individuals. Under the active immunisation scenario, initially immune ants (<italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic>) may then either die (<italic>R</italic>) if infection levels are too high and lead to the disease or enter into the later stage of immunity (<italic>M<sub>l</sub></italic>). Under passive immunisation, all initially immunised individuals become late-stage immune. Late-stage immune ants (<italic>M<sub>l</sub></italic>) can then lose their immunisation and become susceptible individuals (<italic>S</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g008">Figure 8A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s002">Text S2</xref>). Each transition is governed by a transition rate, which in total were fixed to similar ranges in order to allow easy model comparison. The following qualitative results did not depend on the precise rate values, so that we report only representative outcomes of our simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g008">Figure 8C,D</xref>.</p>
        <p>We found that more individuals typically reach the immune state (<italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic>, and turn into <italic>M<sub>l</sub></italic>) after passive immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g008">Figure 8C</xref>), as a single infectious individual may immunise multiple susceptible nestmates, whereas actively immunised ants need to first be in the infectious state themselves. Yet we found that infections die out (<italic>I</italic> becomes 0) more quickly under active immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g008">Figure 8D</xref>), leaving only a very small reservoir for individuals to become immunised. Moreover, active immunisation leads to a lower number of dead individuals (<italic>R</italic>). This is despite the fact that contraction of disease through pathogen transfer can only occur in the active route (with a risk of dying similar to our experimental outcome). Increasing this risk leads to higher death rates and lower immunisation in a linear relationship (simulations not shown). Taken together, active immunisation via pathogen transfer seems beneficial, as it allows more rapid disease elimination and produces lower death rates in colonies, except if the pathogen requires only a very low exposure dose to establish lethal infections in its host.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>In this study, we identified active immunisation as the underlying mode of social group-level immunisation in ant societies after fungal exposure of single individuals. Social contact to a fungus-exposed individual led to low-level infections in the majority of previously naive nestmates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s003">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s005">S3</xref>) and to a higher capacity to inhibit fungal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We found that these low-level infections per se, even in the absence of social contact, are necessary and sufficient to explain the increased antifungal activity of nestmates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We found no evidence for visual or volatile chemical cues acting as additional trigger signals for the immune stimulation of the nestmates. Furthermore, neither ant behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g002">Figure 2</xref>) nor physiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>) gave an indication for passive nestmate immunisation via transfer of antimicrobials from either exposed ants or their nestmates to the other group members. Finally, experimental elimination of the active route resulted in the absence of protective antifungal activity in nestmates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>). The increased immune activity of nestmates of fungus-exposed individuals correlates with an increased expression of immune genes such as the antimicrobial peptide <italic>defensin</italic> and the enzyme, <italic>prophenoloxidase</italic> (<italic>PPO</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>), which both have known antifungal properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Mak1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Zhao1">[83]</xref>. <italic>Cathepsin L</italic>, a lysosomal protease rather involved in antibacterial and antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Nishikori1">[75]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Serbielle1">[76]</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s006">Figure S4</xref>), was not expressed at higher levels in nestmates of fungus-exposed compared to control-treated ants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

        <p>To our knowledge, our study provides the first mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of reduced susceptibility of nestmates after social contact to a fungus-exposed individual, that is, social immunisation, described for both ants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref> and termites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Traniello1">[17]</xref>. Whether group-level immunisation in termite societies follows the same principle as in <italic>Lasius</italic> ants remains to be shown. Interestingly, our study on fungal exposure contrasts with findings of the suggested mechanisms of social immunisation of ants after bacterial exposure, where transfer of antimicrobial substances from the exposed individual via social feeding seems to elicit protection of nestmates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>. We suggest that distinct infection modes of bacterial and fungal pathogens underlie these differences. Bacterial infections typically occur via oral uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-SchmidHempel1">[39]</xref>, so that bacteria-exposed individuals do not carry socially transferable spores on their cuticle, as is the case with entomopathogenic fungi. Moreover, the long delay between exposure and infection is not common in bacterial infections, allowing for faster production of immune effectors in the exposed individuals and an earlier potential onset of immunisation.</p>
        <p>Social immunisation may not be limited to the highly eusocial insect societies but could similarly occur in other societies or at the family level. If also detected in vertebrates, the underlying mechanisms may be very different, as vertebrates have the additional adaptive/acquired immune component and do not rely solely on the innate immune system that characterises invertebrate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Janeway1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Cremer1">[21]</xref>. Humans have used the intentional transfer of low-level infections—referred to as “variolation” or “inoculation”—in an attempt to fight smallpox and frequently succeeded in creating long-term protection against this otherwise often deadly disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Greenough1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Klebs1">[63]</xref>. In humans, the technique was later replaced by less risky immunisation with attenuated strains as soon as these became available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Brimnes1">[88]</xref>, but variolation is still used for, for example, poultry disease management <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Weber1">[64]</xref>. It is still unclear whether acquiring the protective low-level infections in ants is also an active strategy or, rather, an unintentional byproduct of social contact similar to “contact immunity” occurring in human societies, for example, after live strain polio or smallpox vaccination, where vaccinated individuals became spreaders and vaccinated their family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Hull1">[89]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Neff1">[90]</xref>. It is interesting that allogrooming by the ants is not restricted to single individuals, which would be a good strategy to avoid infecting the whole colony, but is rather performed by many colony members, all of which pick up a low-level infection. This may hint at social immunisation by low-level infections being an adaptive evolutionary strategy.</p>
        <p>Our epidemiological modeling indeed suggests that active immunisation is a beneficial strategy for ant colonies, as it allows for faster disease elimination and therefore leads to lower death rates than passive immunisation would. This is particularly true if exposure to low pathogen levels confers a low risk of mortality, as is the case with <italic>Metarhizium</italic> fungus, which requires relatively large doses to elicit a deadly course of disease. We therefore predict that social transfer of pathogens with higher infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Frank1">[91]</xref> would not be an advantageous strategy for societies. A comparative analysis of mechanisms employed by social insects against pathogen types differing in their virulence and transmission would thus be highly interesting. Moreover, it seems likely that active immune stimulation following low-level infections may induce individual immune priming and, thereby, a longer lasting protection of colony members than if they simply received immune effectors. The long-lived societies of social insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Wilson2">[43]</xref> are at especially high risk of re-encountering the same pathogens multiple times during their lifespans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Cremer1">[21]</xref>, and could greatly benefit from a persistent, rather than transient, social immunisation, particularly against common pathogens such as the fungus <italic>Metarhizium</italic>. To fully understand long-term epidemiological dynamics at the society level it will be indispensable to learn more about the mechanisms involved at the individual level—for example, to better understand if immune priming plays a role in social immunisation.</p>

        <title>Experimental Setup</title>
        <p>We grouped six workers (1 treated individual and 5 naive nestmates, to be distinguished by colour marking [Edding 780]) and three larvae of <italic>L. neglectus</italic> in a petri dish (Ø = 5.5 cm) with a dampened plaster floor and a piece of filter paper (1×1 cm) moistened with 10% sucrose solution as food supply. The treated individual received either a sham control or a fungus treatment as described above. Our experimental setup is equivalent to the experiment described in more detail in Ugelvig and Cremer (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref>, which either led to a social immunisation of nestmates (fungus treatment) or not (sham control) after 5 d of social contact. We used this setup for observations of ant-ant interactions, obtaining physiological immune measures and conidia transmission analysis, yet made some measurements already after 1, 2, or 3 d of social contact.</p>
        <p>We changed this general setup for two experiments. First, to determine if signal transfer alone may be sufficient to elicit social immunisation in nestmates, we prevented direct social contact between the treated ant (<italic>n</italic> = 10 for sham control and fungus treatment, respectively) and its nestmates. This was done by keeping the treated individual in a plastic tube (200 µl, Ø of opening = 0.7 cm, containing cotton wool moistened with 10% sucrose solution), attached to the main petri dish, but separated by a double-layered nylon mesh (mesh size 20 µm). The setup prevented direct physical contact yet allowed exchange of visual or volatile chemical signals. After 3 d, nestmates were frozen and subjected to the antifungal activity assay as described below. In a second setup, we excluded both signal and pathogen transfer from the exposed individual to its nestmates occurring in the first 2 experimental days, only allowing for potential later exchange of antimicrobial substances. To this end, we removed the exposed individual 2 d after fungal exposure from its “early nestmates” and placed it with “new nestmates” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), the latter being tested for their antifungal activity after 3 d with the treated individual (<italic>n</italic> = 10 replicates for sham control and fungus treatment, respectively). The new nestmates therefore only had contact to an exposed nestmate after conidia had firmly attached to the host's cuticle, and no longer could be transferred to nestmates (as experimentally confirmed by absence of colony forming units [CFUs] in the new nestmates, see below). When removing the treated individual, we added five new nestmates to the five early nestmates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) to test if early nestmates may transfer immunity to the new nestmates in the form of antimicrobial substances. New nestmates were frozen after 3 d of social contact to the early nestmates of either the control-treated or fungus-exposed individual, and their antifungal activity measured as described below.</p>

For each assay, we first determined the required ratio of pathogen, ant sample, and buffer to be in the linear range of the growth curve in which antimicrobial activity could be detected. We measured growth inhibition against blastospores of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> by using either complete ants (<italic>n</italic> = 10 replicate samples for each group), specific ant body parts (gaster cuticle and thorax; <italic>n</italic> = 6 replicate samples for each group), or the trophallactic droplet (<italic>n</italic> = 10 replicate samples for each group) of treated ants (sham control and fungus treatment) and their respective nestmates.

        <p>All individually kept, directly exposed ants (i.e., 10 per day) and two randomly chosen nestmates per experimental group (i.e., 14 per day) were surface-sterilised in ethanol and sodium hypochlorite (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001300-Ugelvig1">[18]</xref>) to destroy all fungal material on the cuticle prior to dissection under a stereomicroscope (Leica S6E).

        <p>For the behavioural observations, we first analysed all behaviours overall over the 5 experimental days. Due to the nature of the data (overdispersed count data), generalised linear models (GLM) with negative binomial errors and a log link function were employed using the following factors: <italic>treatment type</italic> (fungus treatment versus sham control), <italic>ant pairing</italic> (treated-nestmate versus nestmate-nestmate), and the interaction between them. As neither nests within populations nor populations behaved differently, they were not included in the final models. We give the likelihood ratio (LR) χ<sup>2</sup> to test if our overall model explains the data better than a model with only the intercept. As we detected significant differences for allogrooming, we performed a second test to analyse the effect of time in the interactions between treated individuals and their nestmates for the two treatment types separately (<italic>n</italic> = 240) using a GLM with repeated measures. Simple contrasts with day 1 as reference were employed to test the differences between day 1 and the succeeding days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>For statistical analysis of the antifungal and antibacterial activity, the absorbance values (optical density) of the different treatment groups were compared by one-way ANOVAs or <italic>t</italic> tests as data were normally distributed or could be transformed to obtain normality.

        <p>For analysis of pathogen load, we compared directly exposed and nestmate ants for (a) the proportion of individuals that were infected (i.e., showed at least a single CFU; Fisher exact test) and (b) the number of CFUs in the individuals that showed an infection (Mann Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

          <p>Determination of conidia on fungus-exposed ants and their nestmates by fluorescence microscopy. Occurrence of fluorescence-labelled (RFP) <italic>Metarhizium</italic> conidia on the cuticle of directly fungus-exposed individuals (A–C) and their nestmates (D–F) 2 d after exposure of the former. Conidia were found on the cuticle of all directly fungus-exposed individuals in high numbers (always 10+ conidia) and on 37% of the nestmates, usually in low amounts (1–10 conidia). In the directly exposed individuals, conidia were often located at sites that are probably difficult to reach via allogrooming and/or self-grooming like the antennal grooves (A), joints of the legs (B), or the back of the head (C), whereas, in nestmates, conidia were mostly found on exposed body parts that are likely to touch other nestmates during social interactions like the antennae (D) or legs (E,F).</p>

          <p>Confirmation of identity of fungal infections as <italic>Metarhizium</italic> by PCR. We used <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s001">Text S1</xref>) to genetically confirm whether colony forming units (CFUs) from dissected body contents of the ants (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001300.s005">Figure S3</xref>) were truly <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> or a contaminant fungus. Lanes 1 and 2 contain positive controls (PCR product of DNA extracted from <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic>). Lanes 3 to 5 represent PCR products obtained from DNA of CFUs grown from the body contents of nestmates of a fungus-treated individual. Lanes 6 and 7 are negative controls (PCR product from DNA extracted from <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>). The fact that our samples amplified bands of the same length as the positive controls, whereas our negative controls showed no amplification by the <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> specific primers, confirmed that the fungus growing on the selective medium agar plates was indeed <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>.</p>

On both days, nestmates showed lower numbers of CFUs than directly exposed ants. See main text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001300-g003">Figure 3</xref> for quantitative analysis.</p>
