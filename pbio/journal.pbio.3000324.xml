<abstract>
<p>The molecular mechanism controlling the zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mammals remains poorly understood. The 2-cell (2C)-like cells spontaneously emerging from cultures of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) share some key transcriptional and epigenetic programs with 2C-stage embryos. By studying the transition of ESCs into 2C-like cells, we identified developmental pluripotency associated 2 and 4 (Dppa2/4) as important regulators controlling zygotic transcriptional program through directly up-regulating the expression of double homeobox (Dux). In addition, we found that DPPA2 protein is sumoylated and its activity is negatively regulated by small ubiquitin-like modifier (Sumo) E3 ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4 (PIAS4). PIAS4 is down-regulated during ZGA process and during transitioning of ESCs into 2C-like cells. Depleting Pias4 or overexpressing Dppa2/4 is sufficient to activate 2C-like transcriptional program, whereas depleting Dppa2/4 or forced expression of Pias4 or Sumo2–Dppa2 inhibits 2C-like transcriptional program. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Pias4 or Sumo2–Dppa2 impairs early mouse embryo development. In summary, our study identifies key molecular rivals consisting of transcription factors and a Sumo2 E3 ligase that regulate zygotic transcriptional program upstream of Dux.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs predominantly at the 2-cell (2C) stage of mouse embryo and 4- to 8-cell stages in human embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref003">3</xref>], which is essential for the development control passed from maternal to newly synthesized RNA and proteins. Any wrongdoing during ZGA may lead to termination of embryo development or have severe and long-term consequences for the life of an organism. However, the molecular regulation of ZGA in mammal is poorly understood. Recently, a rare subset of cells called 2C-like cells were found in mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref005">5</xref>]. The 2C-like cells express high levels of ZGA transcripts including murine endogenous retrovirus (ERV)-L (MERVL) family of retroviruses and zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 4 (Zscan4) clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref007">7</xref>]. In addition, these cells share some key epigenetic characteristics with 2C-stage embryos, including increased chromatin accessibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref006">6</xref>], the absence of chromocenters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref008">8</xref>], and high histone mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref009">9</xref>]. Therefore, 2C-like cells serve as an ideal cell model system to study the regulation of ZGA transcriptional program.</p>
<p>Recently, the transcription factor double homeobox (DUX), expressed exclusively in the minor wave of ZGA, was reported to activate numerous downstream ZGA transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref012">12</xref>]. Deletion of Dux causes severe defects in preimplantation development. Consistently, ectopic expression of Dux is sufficient to promote the transition of ESCs to 2C-like cells in mouse. In addition, several studies show that the 2C-like transcriptional program can be activated by depleting microRNA 34a (miR-34a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref013">13</xref>], chromatin assembly factor (CAF-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref008">8</xref>], various epigenetic regulators including lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (Lsd1/Kdm1a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref005">5</xref>], components PRC1.6 complex and E1A binding protein p400 (EP400)–TIP60 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref007">7</xref>], and long interspersed nuclear element (LINE1)–Nucleolin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref014">14</xref>]. In particular, tripartite motif-containing 28 (Trim28), PRC1.6 complex, and LINE1–Nucleolin complex directly bind to Dux genomic loci to repress its expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref014">14</xref>]. These reported factors are generally repressors of Dux or ZGA transcripts. Furthermore, two recent studies found that transcription factors developmental pluripotency associated 2 (Dppa2) and Dppa4 are both necessary and sufficient for the activation of Dux and other 2C genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>A recent study identified small ubiquitin-like modifier 2 (SUMO2) as a potent inhibitor of provirus and ERVs including MERVL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref017">17</xref>], indicating a potential role of sumoylation in regulating 2C-like state and zygotic transcriptional program. Posttranslational modification by SUMO is an important regulatory mechanism to tune protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref019">19</xref>]. Numerous transcriptional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref021">21</xref>] and chromatin modifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref024">24</xref>] are shown to be regulated by sumoylation. Sumoylation also plays vital roles in the transcriptional response to various intrinsic or extrinsic stresses, including DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref026">26</xref>], oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref028">28</xref>], heat shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref029">29</xref>], and pathogen invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref030">30</xref>]. However, whether and how sumoylation regulates zygotic transcriptional program remains unknown. In this study, we set out to determine the function of sumoylation factors in regulating 2C-like state and zygotic transcriptional program. We identified a Sumo2 E3 ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4 (Pias4) and its substrate Dppa2 that play opposing roles in the regulation of 2C-like state and zygotic transcriptional program upstream of Dux. In addition, Dppa4 functions together with Dppa2 to activate the zygotic transcriptional program.</p>

<title>Sumo2 and Sumo E3 ligase Pias4 inhibit zygotic transcriptional program in mouse ESCs</title>
<p>To study how zygotic transcriptional program is regulated, we first generated a 2C::tandem dimeric Tomato (tdTomato) reporter ESC line with transgenic expression of red fluorescence protein tdTomato under the control of MERVL 5′UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref005">5</xref>]. As expected, around 0.5% 2C::tdTomato-positive cells were typically present in ESC cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Using this cell line, we confirmed that knocking down Sumo2, but not Sumo1, significantly increased the percentage of tdTomato-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Importantly, knocking down Sumo2 also up-regulated the expression of MERVL and other classic 2C-specific genes including Dux, Cml2, zinc finger protein 352 (Zfp352), and Zscan4d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s001">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To figure out which Sumo E3 ligase is responsible for the repression of 2C-like state and zygotic transcriptional program, we knocked down nine known Sumo E3 ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref031">31</xref>] individually with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in 2C::tdTomato ESCs. The flow cytometry results showed that only knocking down Pias4 significantly increased the fraction of 2C-like cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s001">S1C</xref>). Consistently, quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed that the expression of Dux and representative 2C-specific genes is up-regulated upon knocking down Pias4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To confirm that the down-regulation of Pias4 is sufficient to globally promote the activation of zygotic transcriptional program, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on ESCs transfected with siRNAs against Pias4. The results showed that knocking down Pias4 globally increases the expression of 2C-specific ZGA transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s009">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s010">S2</xref> Tables). Importantly, a large fraction of Dux-induced genes or MERVL–long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven genes were also up-regulated in Pias4-knockdown ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Consistently, Pias4 knocking down also up-regulated genes induced by miR-34a knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref013">13</xref>], G9a knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref005">5</xref>], or LINE1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref014">14</xref>] or CAF-1 (p150 and p60) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref008">8</xref>] knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s001">S1D Fig</xref>.), all of which have been shown to promote the generation of 2C-like cells. Previously, using single-cell RNA-seq, Deng and colleagues analyzed gene expression profiles during different stages of mouse preimplantation development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref032">32</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that genes induced upon knocking down Pias4 were also up-regulated in mouse embryos during the transitioning of zygote into the 2C stage, the time when ZGA occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). These results suggest that Pias4 inhibits zygotic transcriptional program in mouse ESCs.</p>

<p>To exclude potential off-target effects of siRNAs, we generated Pias4-knockout ESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s001">S1E Fig</xref>) using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) strategy and confirmed that knocking out Pias4 significantly increases the fraction of 2C-like cells as well as the expression of Dux and other 2C-specific genes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g001">1G and 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s001">S1F</xref>).

<title>PIAS4 protein is down-regulated in 2C-like cells and during ZGA</title>
<p>Since Pias4 is an inhibitor of 2C-like state and zygotic transcriptional program, we hypothesized that the expression of Pias4 is down-regulated in 2C-like cells and during ZGA. Unexpectedly, our single-cell qPCR results showed that Pias4 mRNA level was similar between 2C::tdTomato-positive and negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The qPCR results are also confirmed by previous RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that PIAS4 protein level is down-regulated in 2C-like cells. Indeed, immunofluorescence (IF) staining experiments showed that PIAS4 protein level is significantly lower in 2C::tdTomato-positive than negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Encouraged by these results, we further analyzed the Pias4 mRNA and protein level during early embryo development. Results from single-embryo quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that Pias4 mRNA was significantly decreased from zygote to the 2C embryo stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), coincident with the up-regulation of ZGA transcripts including Dux, MERVL, and Zscan4d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Consistent with qPCR results, IF staining showed that Pias4 protein was also significantly down-regulated during ZGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). These results show that PIAS4 protein is down-regulated in 2C-like cells and during ZGA, consistent with its inhibitory role in zygotic transcriptional program. However, whereas both RNA and protein level of Pias4 are down-regulated during ZGA, only protein level of Pias4 is down-regulated in 2C-like cells, indicating different control mechanisms for Pias4 between early development in vivo and ESCs cultured in vitro.</p>

<title>Overexpression of Pias4 inhibits the zygotic transcriptional program and impairs early embryo development</title>
<p>Next, we tested whether Pias4 is sufficient to repress the zygotic transcriptional program by overexpressing Pias4 in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). qPCR results showed that around 2-fold overexpression (OE) of Pias4 could effectively decrease the expression of Dux and other 2C-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Consistent with the repression of zygotic transcriptional program, the percentage of 2C-like cells was also significantly decreased upon Pias4 OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To test whether Pias4 plays a similar inhibitory role during ZGA, we ectopically expressed Pias4 in mouse zygotes. In agreement with findings in ESCs, injecting in vitro transcribed green fluorescent protein (GFP)–Pias4 but not GFP or GFP–Pias4 W356A into zygotes induced embryonic arrest at the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Importantly, single-embryo RT-qPCR results showed that the up-regulation of Dux, MERVL, and Zscan4d were significantly inhibited in embryos injected with GFP–Pias4 at the early phase of the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).

<title>Knocking down Pias4 decreases the sumoylated protein form of multiple activators and inhibitors of zygotic transcriptional program</title>
<p>To figure out how PIAS4 inhibits zygotic transcriptional program, we decided to identify downstream substrate proteins of PIAS4. To this end, we performed pull-down of Sumo2 modified proteins followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis in control or Pias4 siRNAs–transfected ESCs, based on an assumption that the abundance of Pias4 substrates in Sumo2 pull-down should decrease upon Pias4 knockdown. We identified 97 potential candidate substrate proteins whose sumoylated form was decreased ≥1.25-fold in Pias4-knockout ESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s003">S3A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s011">S3 Table</xref>). The decrease of sumoylated protein form might be caused by a decrease in sumoylation efficiency due to Pias4 knockout; alternatively, this could be due to the decrease of protein expression upon Pias4 knockout. These targets are significantly enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms like transcription or regulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), supporting the function of sumoylation mediated by Pias4 in regulating transcriptional program. To identify the downstream target(s) of PIAS4 in regulating zygotic transcriptional program, we performed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref034">34</xref>] screening in Zscan4::GFP reporter ESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref007">7</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Knocking down an inhibitor of 2C transcriptional program should lead to the increase of Zscan4::GFP-positive cells, whereas knocking down an activator of 2C transcriptional program should lead to the decrease of Zscan4::GFP-positive cells. Moreover, knocking down an activator downstream of Pias4 should diminish the effect of Pias4 siRNAs. Therefore, we also performed CRISPRi screening in the presence of Pias4 siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s003">S3C Fig</xref>), hoping to identify direct activators of 2C transcriptional program downstream of Pias4. The results from these experiments suggest that mitochondrial ribosomal protein L38 (Mrpl38), L-threonine dehydrogenase (Tdh), and Zfp131 are potential inhibitors, and Dppa2, Nop58, protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5 (Prmt5), and nucleus accumbens associated 1 (Nacc1) are potential activators of zygotic transcriptional program in ESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). As we were more interested in the activators of Dux and zygotic transcriptional program, we further verified the function of potential activators including Dppa2, Nop58, Prmt5, and Nacc1 in 2C::tdTomato reporter cells with siRNAs against selected targets. The results confirmed that Dppa2, Nop58, Prmt5, and Nacc1 are activators of zygotic transcriptional program in ESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). Among them, knocking down Dppa2 showed the strongest inhibition effect in the emergence of 2C-like cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). Together, these data suggest that PIAS4 might regulate the sumoylation (Sumo2) of multiple inhibitors and activators of zygotic transcriptional program.</p>

<title>Dppa2 and Dppa4 are essential for activating zygotic transcriptional program in mouse ESCs</title>
<p>Next, we focused our study on Dppa2, a transcription factor expressed in germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref035">35</xref>], whose dominant negative form arrests early mouse embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref036">36</xref>]. We transfected 2C::tdTomato reporter ESCs with siRNAs against Dppa2. The qPCR results showed that knocking down Dppa2 significantly decreased the expression of Dux and other 2C-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), consistent with the decrease in the percentage of 2C-like ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To confirm that Dppa2 is responsible for the up-regulation of zygotic transcriptional program upon Pias4 knockdown, we cotransfected siRNAs against Dppa2 and Pias4. The results show that knocking down Dppa2 can effectively prevent the up-regulation of Dux and other 2C-like ZGA genes upon Pias4 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Since Dppa4 has been shown to play similar roles as Dppa2 in the activation of Dux and ZGA program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref016">16</xref>], we also tested the effect of knocking down Dppa4 in ESCs. Indeed, qPCR results showed that knocking down Dppa4 decreased the expression of Dux and other 2C-specific genes at an extent similar to Dppa2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). In addition, double knockdown of Dppa2 and Dppa4 caused a similar degree of down-regulation for Dux and Cml2 and further down-regulation of Zscan4d and Zfp352 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). We further performed RNA-seq for ESCs with Dppa2 and Dppa4 knocked down individually or in combination. The results confirmed that both Dppa2 and Dppa4 are essential for the expression of ZGA transcripts (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g004">4C–4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s005">S5A–S5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s012">S4 Table</xref>). We found 50 2C-specific genes down-regulated ≥50% in double knockdown versus control. Among them, 31 genes were similarly down-regulated (differences within 20% range) in siDppa2, siDppa4, or siDppa2+siDppa4. Interestingly, six genes were further down-regulated ≥20% in double knockdown than any of the single knockdown. These results suggest that the function of Dppa2 and Dppa4 is largely cooperative in regulating the expression of 2C-specific genes, but another mode of action (e.g., redundant) likely exists. In addition, the overall profiles for knocking down Dppa2, Dppa4, or both were largely similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Intriguingly, Dppa2 and Dppa4 knockdown also down-regulated genes induced by other conditions that promoted a 2C-like state, including miR-34a knockout, G9a knockout, and LINE1 or CAF-1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Together, these experiments support that Dppa2 and Dppa4 are essential for activating zygotic transcriptional program in mouse ESCs.</p>

<title>The sumoylation of DPPA2 by PIAS4 depends on K31 and K108 sites</title>
<p>Next, we verified that PIAS4 can catalyze the sumoylation of DPPA2 in mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We overexpressed Flag–Dppa2 and hemagglutinin (HA)–Sumo2 in ESCs treated with siRNAs against negative control (siNCs) or Pias4. As expected, knocking down Pias4 decreased the fraction of sumoylated DPPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In addition, FLAG–DPPA2 and HA–SUMO2 were slightly but significantly increased in Pias4-knockdown ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), suggesting that the decrease in the fraction of sumoylated DPPA2 is due to the decrease in sumoylation activity but not the expression of DPPA2 or HA–SUMO2 proteins in Pias4-knockdown ESCs. Furthermore, overexpressing PIAS4 increased the fraction of sumoylated DPPA2 in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). To identify which lysine residues are important for the sumoylation of DPPA2 by PIAS4, we decided to map the potential sumoylation sites on DPPA2 protein. Using the in silico prediction programs SUMOplot (Abgent) and GPS-SUMO (The Cuckoo Workgroup), eight lysine residues (K31, K67, K108, K137, K159, K160, K226, and K291) were predicted as possible candidate sites for SUMO-conjugation in DPPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Mutant proteins for all predicted lysine residues were then generated, and their effects on sumoylation of DPPA2 were examined in HEK293T cells. K31R and K108R mutations led to a substantial reduction in the intensity of the higher-molecular-mass sumoylated DPPA2 bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). These results suggest that the sumoylation of DPPA2 by PIAS4 depends on K31 and K108 sites.</p>

<title>Sumo2–Dppa2 inhibits the expression of 2C-specific genes and impairs early embryo development</title>
<p>To figure out the impact of sumoylation by Pias4 on the protein level of DPPA2, we performed western analysis of DPPA2 protein in control siRNA or ESCs treated with Pias4 siRNA. The results showed that the DPPA2 protein was only slightly increased upon Pias4 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), indicating that Pias4 may regulate zygotic transcriptional program through regulating the sumoylation but not the protein level of DPPA2. In order to test the consequence of sumoylation of DPPA2 by PIAS4, a DPPA2 fused with SUMO2ΔGG at the N terminal was ectopically expressed in ESCs to mimic the sumoylated DPPA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref038">38</xref>]. To avoid artifacts due to high expression level, SUMO2ΔGG–DPPA2 was expressed at a significantly lower level than endogenous DPPA2 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, we found that expressing SUMO2ΔGG–DPPA2 at this level can significantly decrease the expression of 2C-specific genes as well as the fraction of 2C-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Moreover, SUMO2ΔGG-DPPA2 almost completely abolished the increase of the fraction of 2C-like cells and the up-regulation of Dux and other 2C-specific genes in Pias4-knockdown ESCs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g006">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s007">S7C</xref>), supporting the statement that sumoylated DPPA2 functions as an inhibitor of zygotic transcriptional program downstream of Pias4. Finally, overexpressing SUMO2ΔGG–DPPA2 at a much lower level still caused similar repression of Dux and other 2C-specific genes and similar decrease in the fraction of 2C-like cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s007">S7D–S7F Fig</xref>). Since sumoylated DPPA2 has an inhibitory role for the zygotic transcriptional program, we reasoned that sumoylated DPPA2 must decrease in 2C::tdTomato-positive cells. To test this, we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref039">39</xref>] using antibodies against SUMO2 and DPPA2. Indeed, the PLA assay results showed that the signal of colocalization of SUMO2 and DPPA2 is lower in 2C::tdTomato-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s007">S7G Fig</xref>). Meanwhile, the protein level of DPPA2 is significantly increased in 2C::tdTomato-positive cells with no apparent alteration of localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s007">S7H and S7I Fig</xref>). Finally, we tested the inhibitory role of sumoylated DPPA2 for zygotic transcriptional program in mouse embryos. Compared to GFP and GFP–T2A–DPPA2, the expression of GFP–T2A–SUMO2ΔGG–DPPA2 in zygote significantly impaired the early embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>), accompanied with insufficient up-regulation of 2C-specific genes at the early phase of the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). Therefore, sumoylated DPPA2 likely plays a dominant negative function to DPPA2. Taken together, these data showed that PIAS4 inhibits zygotic transcriptional program at least partially through sumoylation of DPPA2.</p>

<title>OE of Dppa2 activates zygotic transcriptional program</title>
<p>We then tested whether OE of Dppa2 is sufficient to activate zygotic transcriptional program. The flow cytometry analysis showed that around 4-fold OE of Dppa2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) significantly increased the fraction of 2C::tdTomato-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).

Importantly, qPCR results showed that Dppa2 significantly activated the expression of Dux (around 7-fold) and other 2C-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). To find out the global impact of Dppa2 OE on zygotic transcriptional program, we performed RNA-seq in Dppa2-overexpressing ESCs. The results showed that Dppa2 OE globally up-regulated the expression of 2C-specific ZGA transcripts as well as Dux-induced genes and MERVL–LTR-driven genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g007">Fig 7D–7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s014">S6 Table</xref>).

Moreover, genes induced by Dppa2 OE were also up-regulated in mouse embryos during the transitioning of zygote [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref032">32</xref>] into the 2C stage, when ZGA takes place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g007">Fig 7G</xref>).

To gather more evidence that Dppa2 OE and <italic>Pias4−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> ESCs have properties of 2C-like cells, we performed chimera formation by aggregating ESCs with 8-cell embryos.

However, the fraction of 2C-like cells was significantly increased in Dppa2/4-overexpressing versus Dppa2-overexpressing ESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000324.s008">S8E Fig</xref>). Together, these results support that OE of Dppa2 activates the zygotic transcriptional program and Dppa4 can enhance the function of Dppa2.</p>

<title>Dppa2 activates zygotic transcriptional program through directly activating Dux</title>
<p>To figure out how Dppa2 activates zygotic transcriptional program, we decided to identify the downstream targets of Dppa2. We searched through a previously published chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of Dppa2 in mouse ESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref040">40</xref>] and found no enrichment of Dppa2 binding on 2C genes globally. Interestingly, though, we found that the gene body of Dux was bound by Dppa2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), raising the possibility that Dppa2 regulates zygotic transcriptional program through directly activating Dux. We then confirmed the binding of Dppa2 to Dux gene body by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Consistently, Dppa2 OE significantly increased the expression of Dux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Moreover, knocking down Dux significantly inhibited the effects of Dppa2 OE in activating 2C-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g008">Fig 8C</xref>) and increasing the fraction of 2C-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Dppa2 activates zygotic transcriptional program through directly up-regulating Dux.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The transcription factor DUX resides at the top of a transcriptional hierarchy to activate zygotic transcriptional program during the 2C stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref012">12</xref>]. However, DUX itself is only beginning to be expressed at the early phase of ZGA; therefore, other transcriptional factors activating the transcription of Dux must exist. Here, we confirmed recent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref016">16</xref>] that two related transcription factors Dppa2 and Dppa4 activate zygotic transcription program through directly activating Dux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000324.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Both Dppa2 and Dppa4 are required for the activation of ZGA transcripts in 2C-like cells. Whereas Dppa2 OE sufficiently activates zygotic transcriptional program, Dppa4 OE is not sufficient and only enhances the function of Dppa2. In addition, we identified a Sumo2 E3 ligase Pias4, which inhibits the zygotic transcriptional program, likely through sumoylating multiple inhibitors and activators in regulating zygotic transcription. We further showed that the function of Pias4 is at least partially through sumoylating DPPA2, which turns DPPA2 from an activator to a potent inhibitor of zygotic transcriptional program. Consistent with its essential function as a brake for zygotic transcriptional program, the PIAS4 protein level was down-regulated at the early phase of ZGA and in 2C-like ESCs. However, the exact mechanism in regulating Pias4 expression is different between ZGA and 2C-like ESCs. Future investigation is needed to clarify this discrepancy. Furthermore, Pias4 OE or sumoylated DPPA2 inhibited the emergence of 2C-like cells and impaired early embryo development in mouse. Together, our study identifies key molecular rivals upstream of Dux in regulating the transition of ESCs into 2C-like cells and zygotic transcriptional program.</p>
<p>Sumo modification is involved in numerous cellular progresses, such as DNA damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref026">26</xref>], signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref041">41</xref>], and nuclear-cytosolic transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref044">44</xref>]. Increasing evidence shows that sumoylation functions in transcription regulation through modifying chromatin regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref024">24</xref>] and transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref021">21</xref>]. In particular, SUMO was reported to repress the expression of ERVs such as MERVL through modification of Trim28, which is essential for the assembly of inhibitory ZFP809/TRIM28/SET domain, bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref024">24</xref>]. A recent study found that sumoylation acts as "glue" to recruit many chromatin regulators and transcription factors to safeguard cell state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref045">45</xref>]. During the initial phase of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming, sumoylation acts on chromatin to prevent the inactivation of somatic enhancers by retaining somatic transcription factors. While in ESCs and iPSCs, sumoylation preserves the identity of stem cells by stabilizing repressors on heterochromatin dependent on trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3), including Dux locus, to inhibit zygotic transcriptional program. The specific function of sumoylation in different conditions is enforced by specific Sumo E3 ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref031">31</xref>]. However, which E3 ligase is responsible for regulating ESC identity was unknown. In our study, we identified Pias4 as the specific E3 ligase repressing the transition of ESCs into 2C-like cells. We noticed that Pias4 deletion leads to decreased viability perinatally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref047">47</xref>], consistent with its important function during embryogenesis. However, the survived <italic>Pias4−/−</italic> animals are largely normal and fertile. Therefore, alternative pathways may exist to repress zygotic transcriptional program. After fertilization, the maternal Pias4 mRNA is decreased at the early phase of the 2C stage. In contrast, during 2C-like state transition in ESCs, Pias4 mRNA level remains unchanged, but protein is dramatically down-regulated. The exact mechanisms underlying the regulation of Pias4 expression in these two different circumstances warrant future investigation.</p>
<p>Dppa2 and Dppa4 are closely linked genes tandemly locating on the same chromosome in both mouse and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref035">35</xref>]. They both contain a SAP domain that is known as DNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref048">48</xref>]. In addition, Dppa4 was reported to directly bind to chromatin, particularly transcriptionally active regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref049">49</xref>]. More recently, Dppa2 and Dppa4 were reported to be up-regulated during chemically induced reprogramming processes when 2C-like program is activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref050">50</xref>]. In another study, Dppa2 and Dppa4 were found as accelerators during reprogramming to pluripotency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref051">51</xref>]. Mechanistically, they work as a heterodimer bound to chromatin to initiate global chromatin decompaction, which also happens to be an important event during 2C-like cell transition in ESCs and ZGA at the 2C stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref052">52</xref>]. These studies suggest that besides activating Dux expression, Dppa2 and Dppa4 may also facilitate chromatin remodeling to promote zygotic transcriptional program. Dppa2 and Dppa4 are expressed throughout the preimplantation development and in ESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref053">53</xref>], but Dux is only activated at the 2C stage and in a minor population of ESCs. This controversy strongly suggests that additional factors must exist to restrain the activating function of Dppa2/4. Our study suggests that sumoylation might be one of these restraining factors, which is released in 2C stage and 2C-like cells because of the down-regulation of E3 ligase Pias4. In addition, other coactivators may be required for Dppa2/4, and the expression or activity of these factors is restrictive in the 2C stage and 2C-like cells. Furthermore, the accessible chromatin state of <italic>Dux</italic> gene may be a prerequisite for Dppa2/4 to function. It is worth noting that Dppa2 and Dppa4 single or double knockout did not affect early embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref055">55</xref>], possibly because of maternally deposited products. Dppa2- and Dppa4-knockout mice died early after birth, preventing further evaluation of fertility of these mice. Therefore, maternal knockout of Dppa2 and Dppa4 is required to provide definite evidence on their function in ZGA. However, injection of a Dppa2 lacking SAP domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000324.ref036">36</xref>] or a sumoylated Dppa2 (this study) impaired preimplantation development. The dominant negative effect of mutant Dppa2 suggests that even though the redundant factors exist, they must share a similar working mechanism with Dppa2. Elucidating these mechanisms or identifying additional factors will contribute to the complete understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying ZGA control and may potentially lead to efficient means to produce a large quantity of 2C-like cells for research and therapeutic applications.</p>

Sumoylated proteins were eluted from the beads using elution buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer [pH 6.8], 200 mM imidazole) for MS analysis. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For LC-MS/MS analysis, the eluted peptides were sprayed into a Velos Pro Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with a nano-ESI source. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode with a full MS scan in FT mode at a resolution of 120,000 followed by collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS scans on the 15 most abundant ions in the initial MS scan. To identify Pias4 substrate proteins, we compared the count of distinct sequences that have significant scores (prot_sequences_sig) for each protein in siNC versus si-Pias4 samples. Candidate proteins selected for further CRISPRi screening were chosen based on the following criteria: The candidate has to be detected in at least two of four siNC samples; the average #PSM for a candidate must be &gt;1 in siNC samples; the ratio of average #PSM of siPias4 versus siNC is ≥1.25-fold at the 48-hr or 72-hr time point. In total, 97 candidates passed these criteria.
