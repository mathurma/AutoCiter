<abstract>
<p>The repair of white matter damage is of paramount importance for functional recovery after brain injuries. Here, we report that interleukin-4 (IL-4) promotes oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination. IL-4 receptor expression was detected in a variety of glial cells after ischemic brain injury, including oligodendrocyte lineage cells. IL-4 deficiency in knockout mice resulted in greater deterioration of white matter over 14 d after stroke. Consistent with these findings, intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after stroke improved white matter integrity and attenuated long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits in wild-type mice, as revealed by histological immunostaining, electron microscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and electrophysiology. The selective effect of IL-4 on remyelination was verified in an ex vivo organotypic model of demyelination. By leveraging primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), microglia-depleted mice, and conditional OPC-specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) knockout mice, we discovered a direct salutary effect of IL-4 on oligodendrocyte differentiation that was mediated by the PPARγ axis. Our findings reveal a new regenerative role of IL-4 in the central nervous system (CNS), which lies beyond its known immunoregulatory functions on microglia/macrophages or peripheral lymphocytes. Therefore, intranasal IL-4 delivery may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve white matter integrity in stroke and other brain injuries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The primary focus of stroke research has traditionally been on neuronal damage within gray matter, but emerging evidence reveals a robust correlation between white matter injury and long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref001">1</xref>]. White matter accounts for approximately 60% of total brain volume in humans. It is composed mostly of bundled axons and glial cells, including myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Large axons in the brain are enwrapped by the insulating myelin sheath, which greatly accelerates neural transmission along nerve fibers. White matter damage after stroke involves multiple mechanisms, including demyelination, degeneration of axons, and neuroinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref004">4</xref>]. The vulnerability of oligodendrocytes to ischemic injury and the resultant demyelination have been reported in numerous publications using different stroke models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref008">8</xref>]. Remyelination is a process whereby new myelin sheaths are generated around demyelinated axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) after injuries. It is one of the critical regenerative mechanisms for white matter repair after brain injuries. The differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes plays a central role in remyelination. OPCs are present in the normal adult brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref009">9</xref>]. Both the proliferation and migration of OPCs appear to increase in the adult ischemic brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref010">10</xref>], suggestive of endogenous efforts at remyelination and white matter repair. Cellular fate mapping studies have demonstrated the differentiation of OPCs toward the oligodendrocyte lineage in the ischemic brain, but the majority of these cells fail to develop into mature, functional oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref013">13</xref>]. As a result of this failure, white matter integrity after stroke shows little improvement over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref010">10</xref>]. Aside from these roadblocks, the efficacy of oligodendrocyte regeneration and axon remyelination also declines with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref014">14</xref>]. Without proper remyelination, naked axons are degraded, thereby interrupting neuronal communication and leading to functional disabilities. Therefore, therapeutic interventions to promote the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes and enhance the remyelination of axons are promising strategies to achieve successful white matter repair and functional recovery after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of immune cells, but accumulating evidence indicates that IL-4 harbors functions beyond immune modulation in the CNS. For example, one early report suggested that IL-4 promoted learning and memory capacities in the normal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref015">15</xref>]. This conclusion, however, was challenged by more recent studies demonstrating equivalent baseline cognitive functions between wild-type (WT) and IL-4 knockout (KO) genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref017">17</xref>]. Instead, the IL-4 KO mice were shown to display anxiety-like behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref017">17</xref>]. Despite these discrepancies in studies of IL-4 KO mice, the importance of IL-4 in maintaining or restoring neurological functions under pathological conditions is widely accepted. For example, the reduction of IL-4 levels with advanced age is thought to contribute to the cognitive decline in aged populations and in Alzheimer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref018">18</xref>]. We previously documented increased expression of IL-4 and the IL-4 receptor (IL-4Rα) in the ischemic brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref016">16</xref>]. IL-4 may be released from injured neurons and peripheral immune cells that have infiltrated the brain after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref019">19</xref>]. IL-4 deficiency exacerbates brain injury and neurological deficits in acute timeframes after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref020">20</xref>], implicating IL-4 as an endogenous protective mechanism in the early stages after stroke. We also reported that IL-4 deficiency significantly impairs long-term sensorimotor and cognitive performance after ischemic injury, whereas IL-4 supplementation improves functional outcomes in two models of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref016">16</xref>]. Although IL-4 deficiency increased the loss of NeuN<sup>+</sup> brain tissue at acute phases of stroke, it did not influence neuronal tissue loss at late stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref016">16</xref>]. These results suggest that the long-term beneficial role of IL-4 on neurological functions after stroke might be attributed to its protection of nonneuronal cells, such as white matter components. However, the potential effects of IL-4 on white matter integrity after ischemic stroke remain elusive.</p>
<p>In the current study, we discovered that IL-4 is essential for white matter repair after stroke. Intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after stroke robustly promoted oligodendrogenesis, enhanced white matter integrity, and improved long-term functional recovery. Complementary studies in cell cultures and animals revealed that IL-4-mediated oligodendrogenesis was achievable even in the absence of microglia/macrophages in vitro or after microglia/macrophage significant depletion in vivo. Furthermore, IL-4 directly promoted OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-dependent manner. These collective findings suggest that activation of the IL-4/PPARγ signaling cascade may represent a novel recovery-enhancing strategy to promote long-term outcomes after ischemic stroke.</p>

<title>IL-4 deficiency impairs white matter integrity after ischemic brain injury</title>
<p>To explore the potential cellular targets for IL-4, we used flow cytometry to assess expression of IL-4Rα on various types of cells in the ischemic brain. Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref021">21</xref>], IL-4Rα was expressed on CD45<sup>−</sup>CD11b<sup>−</sup>GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, CD45<sup>−</sup>CD11b<sup>−</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons, CD45<sup>intermediate</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> microglia, CD45<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages, and other infiltrated immune cells (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>−</sup>) 3 d after 60-min MCAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Notably, IL-4Rα was also expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1A–1D</xref>). Different markers, including A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>5</sub>, O4, and O1/galactocerebroside (GalC), were used to identify oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages. IL-4Rα was detected in CD45<sup>−</sup>CD11b<sup>−</sup>O4<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1A–1D</xref>), which were identified as preoligodendrocytes and premyelinating oligodendrocytes, and CD45<sup>−</sup>CD11b<sup>−</sup>O1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>), which were identified as premyelinating oligodendrocytes or mature oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref022">22</xref>]. The percentages of IL-4Rα<sup>+</sup>O4<sup>+</sup> cells were higher in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>), suggesting a potential direct effect of IL-4 on white matter cells. ImageStream analyses confirmed that IL-4Rα was expressed on both A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>5</sub><sup>+</sup> OPCs and O4<sup>+</sup> preoligodendrocytes/premyelinating oligodendrocytes, as well as CD11b<sup>+</sup> microglia/macrophages in the ischemic hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s001">S1A–S1C Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>In light of these results, we evaluated whether IL-4 influenced white matter integrity after ischemic stroke. WT and IL-4 KO mice were subjected to transient focal ischemia induced by 60-min MCAO. Dual staining for myelin basic protein (MBP, a major myelin protein) and SMI32 (a marker of demyelinated axons) was performed to assess the lesion in white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1F–1H</xref>). The overall immunofluorescence intensity of MBP staining decreased in the infarct border along three white matter–rich brain regions (the external capsule [EC], the cortex, and the striatum) (see “total” values in panel of the right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) at 14 d after MCAO, indicating a significant loss of myelin protein after stroke. Additionally, the overall immunofluorescence of SMI32 increased in these three regions, resulting in a significant increase in the SMI32/MBP ratio in WT mice after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). IL-4-deficient mice displayed exacerbation of the loss in MBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) and a further increase in the SMI32/MBP ratio compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), suggesting that IL-4 is important in maintaining axonal myelination or promoting axonal remyelination after stroke.</p>
<p>Stroke impacts both gray and white matter. In order to confirm the effect of IL-4 in white matter, we explored the remyelination capacity of IL-4 in a model of lysophosphatidylcholine/lysolecithin (LPC)-mediated demyelination using ex vivo organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. This toxicant-based experimental model of demyelination, although not attempting to fully mimic a disease with complex etiology and pathogenesis, has proven extremely useful for understanding the biology of remyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref023">23</xref>]. Slices collected from WT and IL-4 KO mice exhibited comparable extents of demyelination, as revealed by the loss of MBP staining along neurofilament-heavy (NFH<sup>+</sup>) axonal fibers, at 3 d after LPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Partial remyelination was achieved by 7 d following LPC in WT brain slices, but IL-4 deficiency significantly delayed remyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>), as shown by lower MBP staining intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and less MBP<sup>+</sup> axonal coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). IL-4 supplementation significantly enhanced remyelination in WT brain slices and rescued remyelination capacities in IL-4 KO brain slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g002">Fig 2A, 2C and 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>Intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles promotes white matter integrity after stroke</title>
<p>IL-4 liposome nanoparticles were prepared to facilitate the penetration of IL-4 into the ischemic brain. The mean particle size of IL-4 protein-loaded liposome was 122.6 ± 2.4 nm with a polydispersity index of approximately 0.212 ± 0.004 and a zeta potential of 4.05 ± 1.35 mV, confirming high stability of the nanodispersion. The IL-4 nanoparticles were applied through the nasal route (50 μg/kg body weight), which has been increasingly utilized for CNS drug delivery because of its capacity to bypass the blood-brain barrier and avoid first-pass metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref024">24</xref>]. Intranasal administration of IL-4 nanoparticles effectively increased IL-4 protein levels in the corpus callosum (CC) and EC, cerebral cortex, and striatum 12 h after IL-4 application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>). IL-4 remained elevated in cortex and striatum until 24 h after delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 60-min MCAO and randomly assigned to receive IL-4 nanoparticle (50 μg/kg body weight) or control nanoparticle (vehicle) treatment. Nanomaterials were intranasally delivered at 6 h after MCAO and repeated at 1–7 d, 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d after MCAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on these animals was performed serially at 9.4 T on days 2, 14, 21, and 28 after MCAO. T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images showed no significant difference in the brain lesion volume of IL-4- versus vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>), indicating comparable gross tissue damage across treatment groups.

<p>Serial whole-brain in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were collected 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d after MCAO.

Longitudinal observation of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps and calculation of the ratio of FA(ipsilateral)/FA(contralateral) demonstrated progressive white matter injury (ratio &lt; 1) with a slow recovery in the EC of vehicle-treated stroke mice at 14–35 d after stroke, which was significantly improved by day 28 following stroke in IL-4-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This trend was observed until day 35 in the ex vivo FA values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

<title>IL-4 post-treatment improves the structural and functional integrity of myelinated fibers after stroke</title>
<p>To determine whether IL-4 can improve axonal myelination after stroke, myelin thickness was measured in the EC using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

Scatter plots of the <italic>g</italic>-ratio (the ratio of the inner axonal diameter to the total outer diameter of myelinated fiber) as a function of axon diameter in sham mice or stroke mice treated with vehicle or IL-4 revealed significant differences in myelin thickness (average <italic>g</italic>-ratio: sham = 0.72 [<italic>n</italic> = 183 axons from 3 animals]; MCAO + vehicle = 0.79 [<italic>n</italic> = 233 axons from 3 animals]; MCAO + IL-4 = 0.73 [<italic>n</italic> = 176 axons from 3 animals]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

<p>Saltatory conduction of action potentials along myelinated axons relies on normal organization of the nodes of Ranvier (NOR), which are rich in sodium and potassium ion channels. Double immunofluorescent analyses of Nav1.6 (a nodal sodium channel protein) and contactin-associated protein (Caspr, a paranodal cell adhesion protein) revealed the NOR in the EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Typical NOR are characterized by punctate Nav1.6 staining at nodes between the paranodal staining of Caspr. The total numbers of normal NOR decreased significantly after stroke in the ipsilateral EC compared to the contralateral EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), and this was accompanied by a decrease in the Caspr<sup>+</sup> paranode length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). IL-4 treatment significantly increased the number of NOR and the paranode length in the ischemic EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g005">Fig 5F and 5G</xref>), suggesting an improvement in NOR structure. The paranodal gap between pairs of Caspr staining remained unchanged between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g005">Fig 5H</xref>).</p>
<p>As IL-4 enhanced the structural integrity of white matter after MCAO, we further evaluated white matter function by measuring the transmission of action potentials in the CC and EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g005">Fig 5I</xref>).

<p>IL-4 is known to promote microglia M2 polarization, which in turn enhances OPC differentiation and remyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref028">28</xref>]. We observed in our model that IL-4 treatment robustly promoted microglia/macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype (CD206<sup>+</sup>Iba1<sup>+</sup>) at 7 and 14 d after stroke (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Microglia depletion through genetic targeting or pharmacological treatment is a widely used approach to evaluate the contribution of this population to various biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref029">29</xref>]. Therefore, we chose PLX5622, an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, to deplete microglia/macrophages and identify their role in IL-4-afforded oligodendrogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g007">Fig 7E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref030">30</xref>]. Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref030">30</xref>], PLX5622 achieved approximately 90% depletion efficacy within a short period. Dietary intake of PLX5622 for 7 d dramatically reduced the number of microglia in the normal brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Continuation on the PLX5622 diet maintained low numbers of microglia/macrophages in the brain 21 d after sham or MCAO surgery (28 d after initiation of PLX5622 diet) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s005">S5A–S5C and S5E Fig</xref>). The number of neurons remained statistically similar in microglia/macrophage-depleted mice and microglia/macrophage-competent mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s005">S5A, S5B, S5D and S5F Fig</xref>).

IL-4 treatment increased the numbers of BrdU<sup>+</sup>APC<sup>+</sup> cells or total BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells after stroke in mice fed with the control diet. IL-4 treatment exhibited a trend (<italic>p</italic> = 0.086) toward lower capacities to increase the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup>APC<sup>+</sup> newly generated oligodendrocytes in microglia-depleted mice versus microglia-competent mice, supporting a potential role of microglia in IL-4-afforded oligodendrogenesis. Importantly, IL-4 treatment still resulted in a significant enhancement of BrdU<sup>+</sup>APC<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte regeneration in microglia/macrophage-depleted stroke mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g007">Fig 7F and 7G</xref>).

Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clustering of samples in a treatment-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). In total, 996 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05; and fold change &gt; 2), out of which 495 were up-regulated and 501 were down-regulated in IL-4-treated OPCs relative to PBS-treated OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g008">Fig 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s011">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s012">S2</xref> Tables). The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was then performed using the Metascape analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref032">32</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://metascape.org" xlink:type="simple">http://metascape.org</ext-link>). The top 20 enriched GO terms in three categories (biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions) were identified in the up-regulated DEGs by IL-4 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). A network plot further captured the relationships between the main regulated biological processes, which were related to cell adhesion and motility, cytokine production, cell responses to external stimuli, cellular component organization, and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). The enriched GO terms among the down-regulated DEGs in IL-4-treated OPCs represent biological processes such as developmental growth, small molecule biosynthetic process, vessel development, and responses to nutrients and peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). These results indicated changes in cell mobilization, growth, differentiation, and defense in IL-4-treated OPCs. A Kyoto encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified eight enriched pathways for up-regulated DEGs, of which the PPAR signaling pathway was dramatically up-regulated in IL-4-treated OPCs compared to vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g008">Fig 8G</xref>). The PPAR transcription factor assay confirmed that PPARγ activity, but not PPARα or PPARδ activities, was up-regulated in OPCs upon IL-4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g008">Fig 8H</xref>); these effects were abolished when IL-4Rα was blocked with a neutralizing antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g008">Fig 8I</xref>). Furthermore, immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g008">Fig 8J and 8K</xref>) and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g008">Fig 8L–8N</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s009">S9 Fig</xref>) demonstrated that the PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 blocked IL-4-induced expression of mature oligodendrocyte markers (MBP or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein [MOG]), suggesting that PPARγ activation is essential for the OPC differentiation induced by IL-4.</p>
<p>Finally, OPC-specific PPARγ KO (PPARγ-OPC KO) mice were used to confirm the importance of PPARγ signaling in IL-4-enhanced oligodendrogenesis in an in vivo stroke model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). To confirm the KO of PPARγ specifically in OPCs, PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>−</sup> OPCs, GLAST<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>−</sup> astrocytes, CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells, and other CD45<sup>−</sup>GLAST<sup>−</sup>PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> CNS cells were sorted from the brains collected from PPARγ-OPC KO mice at 9 d after 4-hydroxytamoxifen injections. The DNA extracts were subjected to PCR using primers flanking the loxp site and primers detecting the Cre cDNA. The loxp band was abolished in OPCs because of the targeted deletion after Cre-induced recombination, while remaining intact in astrocytes, immune cells, and other CNS cells sorted from the same brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). The expression of Cre was detected in the OPCs of the PPARγ-OPC KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Deletion of PPARγ specifically in OPCs exerted no impact on IL-4R expression on O4<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000330.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Vehicle or IL-4 treatment in PPARγ-OPC KO mice resulted in similar neuronal tissue loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g009">Fig 9C and 9D</xref>) and white matter lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g009">Fig 9C, 9E and 9F</xref>) 35 d after stroke. The lack of PPARγ expression in OPCs did not significantly impair oligodendrocyte replacement after stroke, as shown by comparable numbers of BrdU<sup>+</sup>APC<sup>+</sup> cells in the ischemic brain from PPARγ-OPC KO mice and control mice at 35 d after MCAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g009">Fig 9G and 9H</xref>). However, the absence of PPARγ in OPCs reduced the capacity of IL-4 to increase the number of newly generated BrdU<sup>+</sup>APC<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g009">Fig 9G and 9H</xref>). Consistent with a reduced capacity to promote oligodendrogenesis, IL-4 failed to improve long-term sensorimotor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g009">Fig 9I and 9J</xref>) or cognitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000330.g009">Fig 9K–9M</xref>) deficits after stroke in the absence of PPARγ.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of preclinical and clinical studies have reported an association between IL-4 levels and stroke pathology. For example, IL-4 expression increases transiently at early time points in the ischemic brain, which is attributed, at least partly, to its release from injured neurons or from infiltrated immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref019">19</xref>]. Cerebral IL-4 levels then return to baseline within 1 wk after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref019">19</xref>]. In patients, serum levels of IL-4 are known to change following an acute stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref033">33</xref>]. Furthermore, IL-4 gene polymorphisms are related to susceptibility to ischemic stroke and subsequent functional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref035">35</xref>]. Finally, a recent study reported the expression of IL-4R surrounding axonal filaments in postmortem brain tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref031">31</xref>]. Although these clinical and experimental data are correlative, the present series of in vivo and in vitro studies firmly establish a causal link between IL-4 repletion and white matter integrity in preclinical stroke models. Deficiency of endogenous IL-4 exacerbated white matter disruption, whereas intranasal IL-4 treatment—even when delayed until 6 h post-stroke—improved the structural and functional integrity of white matter.</p>
<p>An improvement in white matter integrity might be achieved in two ways: preservation of preexisting white matter structures or enhancement of white matter repair. Our data favor the latter as the predominant mechanism of action for IL-4. First, longitudinal DTI revealed similar reductions in FA values shortly after stroke in vehicle or IL-4-treated mice, indicating comparable degrees of initial white matter injury during the early/acute phase. A significant improvement in white matter microstructure was only observed in IL-4-treated animals in later stages of recovery (28 and 35 d after stroke). These results strongly suggest a delayed effect of IL-4 on white matter repair, rather than preservation shortly after injury. Second, electron microscopy (EM) and histological studies revealed structural signs of remyelination in the ischemic brain, including thinner myelin segments than before stroke, and reduced paranode length with Caspr/Nav1.6 staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref036">36</xref>]. Each of these structural alterations were significantly improved by IL-4 treatment, indicating superior remyelination. Third, IL-4 treatment increased the number of new, mature oligodendrocytes (APC<sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup>) in the ischemic brain 35 d after stroke. Such improvements in oligodendrogenesis are critical for successful remyelination. Finally, the LPC model of demyelination–remyelination unequivocally confirmed the white matter–specific effects of IL-4 in remyelination. As expected, the IL-4-mediated reconstitution of myelin structure culminated in functional improvements in neural conduction and behavioral performance, despite no changes in the degree of gray matter loss. Although IL-4 is important for white matter repair after brain injury, the IL-4 KO mice do not display deficits in myelin coverage in organotypic brain slice cultures under physiological conditions. This observation is consistent with the view that different mechanisms control myelin sheath formation during normal development and remyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Although our T2 scanning did not show significant reductions in brain lesion size under conditions of IL-4 repletion, there was a trend toward lesion volume reduction at 14–35 d after stroke. As the IL-4 treatment was initiated 6 h after stroke, it remains possible that IL-4 may provide some degree of early protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref016">16</xref>]. It is also possible that some NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons remaining within the gray matter of mice without IL-4 might not be physiologically functional, although they are still histologically present, perhaps because their communication via white matter tracts is significantly impeded.</p>
<p>A previous study using mixed glial cultures demonstrated that the addition of IL-4 promotes the differentiation of OPCs into MBP-expressing oligodendrocytes in vitro, an effect mainly attributed to IL-4-mediated anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref037">37</xref>]. An additional conclusion emerging from our studies is that IL-4 enhances white matter repair at least partially independent of its well-established anti-inflammatory effects on microglia/macrophages. In IL-4-treated stroke mice, we observed an anti-inflammatory phenotypic change in microglia/macrophages, which is known to promote remyelination after CNS injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref028">28</xref>]. However, dramatic depletion of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic brain did not abolish the capacity of IL-4 to enhance oligodendrocyte replacement, supporting the involvement of microglia/macrophage-independent mechanisms. In vitro studies then confirmed that IL-4 can also directly target white matter components and promotes OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes in the absence of microglia/macrophages. Previous fate mapping studies revealed that OPCs are responsible for generating new oligodendrocytes during remyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref039">39</xref>]. However, the differentiation of OPCs is frequently impaired in lesioned brains, mainly because of nonpermissive environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref042">42</xref>]. We found that IL-4 treatment may overcome these obstacles for OPC differentiation in the ischemic brain, both directly by promoting OPC differentiation and indirectly through immunomodulation. Notably, endogenous oligodendrocyte differentiation has been observed until as late as 3 mo after CNS injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref039">39</xref>], and this prolonged effort may provide a sufficiently wide therapeutic window that allows delayed IL-4 treatment to restore white matter and encourage long-term stroke recovery.</p>
<p>In the present study, we report a previously undefined mechanism of IL-4, namely that it directly induces OPC differentiation by activating PPARγ signaling. PPARγ is a master transcription factor known to promote OPC differentiation and maturation though manifold mechanisms involving enhanced myelin lipid synthesis, reduced oxidative stress, and promotion of mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref044">44</xref>]. Our previous work has shown that rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, enhanced OPC proliferation and increased the number of newly generated mature oligodendrocytes after MCAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref045">45</xref>]. In addition, PPARγ may interact with histone deacetylases to modulate cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref046">46</xref>]. We demonstrated here that PPARγ inhibition abolished the effect of IL-4 on OPC differentiation in vitro and that OPC-specific KO of PPARγ in vivo reduced IL-4-enhanced oligodendrocyte replacement in the ischemic brain. These collective results indicate that IL-4-induced oligodendrocyte differentiation/maturation relies at least partially on the activation of PPARγ activity in OPCs. Precisely how IL-4/IL-4R engages PPARγ activity is not yet known, but several studies suggest that IL-4 may activate PPARγ in macrophages and other cell types through signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref047">47</xref>]. Whether this pathway is also operational in OPCs lies beyond the scope of the present study but warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Aside from the cell-specific effects of IL-4 on OPCs, we note that IL-4R is widely distributed in many types of CNS cells as well as infiltrated immune cells. Several lines of evidence from our study support the capacity of IL-4 to target multiple types of cells in addition to oligodendrocytes. First, we did not observe significant differences in the density of BrdU<sup>+</sup>APC<sup>+</sup> cells between WT and PPARγ-OPC KO mice following MCAO, suggesting that endogenous IL-4 is able to promote white matter integrity by targeting other types of cells. Second, although PPARγ inhibition eliminated the effect of IL-4 on OPC differentiation in cultures, the absence of PPARγ in OPCs reduced, but did not abolish, the capacity of IL-4 to increase the number of newly generated oligodendrocytes in vivo. These results suggest that PPARγ expression in OPCs is an important but not exclusive mechanism for IL-4-induced oligodendrogenesis in preclinical stroke. Indeed, we observed that IL-4 treatment robustly promoted microglia/macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2phenotype, as mentioned above. IL-4-stimulated microglia have been shown to release IL-4 induced 1 (IL4I1), which in turn augments remyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref048">48</xref>]. Thus, direct and indirect effects on microglia/macrophages may contribute to the white matter repair afforded by IL-4. It has also been reported that the effects of IL-4 on adaptive immune responses contribute partially to recovery from neurotrauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref049">49</xref>]. In our hands, however, repeated intranasal IL-4 administration did not change T-lymphocyte subpopulations or B lymphocytes in blood and did not alter the composition of infiltrated lymphocytes. These data dispute the involvement of adaptive immune responses in IL-4-afforded neuroprotection in our stroke model.</p>
<p>Aside from its roles in immunoregulation, IL-4 can also directly target other types of CNS cells. For example, a recent study reported that the activation of IL-4R signaling in neurons may increase axonal outgrowth and ameliorate axonal pathology in a model of multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref031">31</xref>]. In this context, it is important to note that we did not observe improvements in the DTI measurement for axonal integrity (AD, λ<sub>||</sub>). In other disease models, multiple factors including inflammation, cellular infiltration, and gliosis may contribute to AD at chronic stages of disease. Therefore, the measurement of λ<sub>||</sub> appears to lack sufficient resolution to distinguish axonal damage/repair versus confounding cellular responses over the course of progressive demyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref050">50</xref>]. On the other hand, our EM data demonstrated an increase in axon diameter in IL-4-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated controls, supporting a beneficial role of IL-4 in maintaining axonal structure. These structural data were supported by our electrophysiological studies of axon conductance. Preservation of axonal structure and electrical function might provide an important feedback signal for OPC differentiation and guide remyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref052">52</xref>], preventing Wallerian degeneration of neurons after ischemia and enhancing white matter repair. In addition to these mechanisms, astrocytes are known to produce trophic factors in response to IL-4 stimulation, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), both of which are also critical for brain function and brain repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>A series of in vitro studies assessed the effective concentrations of IL-4 in various types of CNS cells. For example, IL-4 regulates microglia activity at concentrations of 1–20 ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref054">54</xref>]. IL-4 inhibits inflammatory responses and boosts trophic factor release in astrocytes at 5–10 ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref053">53</xref>]. IL-4 protects neurons against excitotoxicity and stimulates axonal outgrowth in vitro at 50 ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref031">31</xref>]. In the present study, IL-4 directly stimulated OPC differentiation within a concentration range of 5–100 ng/mL. These collective studies reveal similar effective IL-4 concentrations (in nanoscales) in glial and neuronal cells of the CNS. Indeed, it is precisely the multitargeting capacities of low-dose IL-4 that may render it an excellent therapy for CNS injuries characterized by a wide array of pathological mechanisms.</p>
<p>The ultimate implementation of preclinical research into clinical treatments requires extensive information on safety, optimal dose, route, and schedule of administration, among other variables. In the present study, IL-4 stimulated OPC differentiation in cultures at a concentration range of 5–100 ng/mL, and the optimal concentration was 10–20 ng/mL. Although there is neither a mathematical nor empirical method to accurately convert in vitro concentrations to in vivo intranasal dosage, these in vitro data support the capacity of IL-4 to directly target OPCs at low concentrations. Previous preclinical studies have similarly documented therapeutic effects of low doses of IL-4 in ischemic stroke and other neurological diseases. For example, subcutaneous IL-4 application at 2 μg/kg/d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref019">19</xref>] or intracerebroventricular application of IL-4 at 60 ng/d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref016">16</xref>] significantly improved long-term outcomes after stroke. Vogelaar and colleagues reported that intrathecal or intranasal (1 μg/d) IL-4 treatment ameliorated clinical signs and reversed disease progression in a model of multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref031">31</xref>]. Those studies, however, did not measure IL-4 concentrations in the brain after treatment. Here, we delivered IL-4 intranasally at a dose of 50 μg/kg/d (about 1.25 μg/d based on 0.025 kg average body weight), which significantly elevated IL-4 levels in key parts of the brain. This dose is similar to the effective intranasal dose for Vogelaar’s study and improved long-term functional recovery in our stroke model. Repeated dosing regimens or controlled continuous release was employed for all in vivo IL-4 treatment because of its rapid clearance and inactivation. The use of liposome-entrapped peptides has been reported to protect the cytokine and enhance its tissue delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref056">56</xref>]. Consistent with those findings, we demonstrated that IL-4 liposome nanoparticle delivery elevated IL-4 levels in the brain for at least 24 h. Further characterization of the optimal regimen of IL-4 treatment for stroke would accelerate its clinical translation.</p>
<p>Despite growing awareness of the importance of white matter restoration in poststroke rehabilitation, there is no effective therapy to preserve white matter function or to improve its repair in humans. Our study has uncovered a novel role of IL-4 in poststroke white matter recovery—a role that lies beyond its well-known immunoregulatory functions. Furthermore, we have shown that IL-4 promotes oligodendrogenesis and white matter repair in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Therefore, it seems reasonable to continue to test IL-4 as a therapeutic strategy for functional recovery after ischemic stroke. In particular, the intranasal route enables CNS IL-4 delivery, which is expected to significantly reduce the risk of peripheral side effects and expedite the eventual translation of IL-4 treatment for stroke victims.</p>

<title>Murine models of transient cerebral ischemia</title>
<p>Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 60 min, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref057">57</xref>]. Sham-operated animals underwent the same anesthesia and exposure of arteries without MCAO. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in a 30% O<sub>2</sub>/68.5% N<sub>2</sub>O mixture until they were unresponsive in the tail-pinch test. Mice were then fitted with a nose cone blowing 1.5% isoflurane in a 30% O<sub>2</sub>/68.5% N<sub>2</sub>O mixture under spontaneous breathing for anesthesia maintenance. An 8–0 monofilament with a silicon-coated tip was introduced into the common carotid artery, advanced to the origin of the MCA, and left in place to limit MCA blood flow for 60 min. Rectal temperature was controlled at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C using a temperature-regulated heating pad during surgery. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in all stroke animals using laser Doppler flowmetry. Animals that did not display at least 70% reduction in regional cerebral blood flow during MCAO compared to pre-ischemia levels were excluded from further experimentation. Surgeries and quantification were performed by investigators blinded to animal genotypes and experimental grouping. Animals were randomly assigned to sham or cerebral ischemia groups and received randomized treatments using a lottery drawing box. A grand total of 287 mice (64 sham-operated and 223 ischemic mice) were used in this study, including 26 mice that were excluded from further assessments, either because of death after ischemia or failure of ischemia induction. The mortality during MCAO surgery was 7.6% in WT male mice (12/158), 14.3% in IL-4 KO male mice (1/7), 11.1% in microglia/macrophage-depleted mice (3/27), and 12.5% in PPARγ-OPC KO mice (3/24).

<title>Intranasal IL-4 nanoparticle preparation and administration</title>
<p>Lecithin (150 mg) and cholesterol (15 mg) were dissolved in 5 mL of a chloroform–methanol mixed solution (3:1, volume:volume). A lipid layer was formed after evaporating the mixed solvent under vacuum distillation. Recombinant IL-4 protein (1 mg, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) was dissolved in 5 mL of water and then added to the lipid layer for hydration for about 30 min. The mixture was homogenized by ultrasonic probes for 15 min in an ice bath and then filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. The free IL-4 protein was removed by ultrafiltration with centrifugal filter units (100-KDa cutoff). The particle size and zeta potential of IL-4 protein-loaded liposomes were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The concentration of IL-4 protein was determined by the bicinchoninic protein determination kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).</p>
<p>Animals were randomly assigned to receive vehicle or IL-4 (50 μg/kg body weight, intranasal) nanoparticle treatment starting 6 h after MCAO and repeated at 1–7 d, 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d post-surgery. Briefly, under isoflurane anesthesia, five 2-μL drops (total 10 μL) of IL-4 nanoparticles were applied alternately into each nostril with a 2-min interval between drops. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle control using the same anesthesia and delivery regimen.</p>

<p>Cognitive function was analyzed with the Morris water maze test 23–28 d after MCAO, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000330.ref016">16</xref>]. In the learning test, a square platform (11 × 11 cm<sup>2</sup>) was submerged 2 cm beneath the water surface in a circular pool (diameter = 109 cm) of opaque water. Mice were placed into the pool from one of the four locations and allowed to locate the hidden platform for 60 s. Each mouse was trained on 3 trials (with randomly assigned starting positions) per day to locate the platform for three consecutive days before MCAO. At the end of each trial, the mouse was placed on the platform or allowed to stay on the platform for 30 s with prominent spatial cues displayed around the room. The time spent to reach the platform (learning phase) was recorded. Three trials were performed on each day. The memory test was performed on day 28.

<title>Immunohistochemistry and image analysis</title>
<p>Coronal brain sections were subjected to immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, floating brain sections were blocked with 5% donkey serum in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C. After three washes in 0.3% PBST, sections were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The process was repeated once for double staining.

For immunostaining using the mouse primary antibody, the M.O.M kit (BMK-2202, Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA, USA) was applied before primary antibodies to block nonspecific signals, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primary antibodies included goat anti-Iba1 (ab5076, Abcam, 1:500, Cambridge, MA, USA), mouse anti-CD206 (565250, 1:500, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA), rat anti-CD16 (553142, 1:500, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), rat anti-BrdU (ab6326, 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit anti-NG2 (AB5320, 1:400, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), mouse anti-APC (OP80, 1:500, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), mouse anti-Neurofilament H (NF-H) nonphosphorylated antibody (SMI32; 801701, 1:500, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), mouse anti-Caspr antibody (MABN69, 1:300, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and rabbit anti-Nav1.6 antibody (1:300, ASC-009 Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel). The following secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; West Grove, PA, USA) were applied: anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 (115-165-146), anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 (711-165-152), anti-rat secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 (712-165-153), anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 488 (711-545-152), anti-rat secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 488 (712-545-153), anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 488 (705-545-147), and anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 488 (715-545-151). All the secondary antibodies were diluted 1:1,000. Confocal microscopy (FluoView FV1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture images.</p>
<p>Image analyses were performed on one or two randomly selected microscopic fields in the peri-infarct areas of the EC, two in the cortex, and two in the striatum of each section; two sections covering the infarct area were assessed for each mouse brain. The recorded images were loaded onto Image J (NIH) and were manually quantified by 2 observers blinded to grouping. Positively stained cells were electronically labeled with the software to avoid duplicated counting. The infarct area was identified as the region in which the majority of DAPI-stained nuclei were shrunken. The border of the infarct was determined by the loss of NeuN staining and the accumulation of Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia/macrophage or BrdU<sup>+</sup>APC<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes on adjacent sections. We defined the peri-infarct area as the tissue that covers a radial distance of 200–300 μm from the border of the infarct.</p>

Coronal slices (350 μm thick) were prepared −1.06 mm from bregma and transferred to an incubation chamber containing pregassed (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 126 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 mmol/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.3 mmol/L MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mol/L glucose [pH 7.4]) for 30 min at 34 °C and then for 1 h at room temperature (25 °C). Brain slices were then perfused with aCSF at a constant rate (3–4 mL/min) at 25 °C. For recording, a bipolar stimulating electrode (intertip distance, 100 μm) was placed across the CC at about 0.9 mm lateral to the midline. A glass extracellular recording pipette (5–8 MΩ tip resistance when filled with aCSF) was placed in the EC, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mm lateral from the stimulating electrode. The recording at 0.75 mm from the stimulating electrode was reported. The CAP signal was digitized (Digidata 1500B plus humsilencer; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA), amplified (×1 K), and recorded by the Axoclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The signal was then analyzed by pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The input–output curves were generated by increasing the stimulating intensity by 0.25-mA intervals from baseline, up to 2 mA. The amplitude of the N1 component of the CAP (representing myelinated fibers) was calculated as the variance from the first peak to the first trough.</p>
