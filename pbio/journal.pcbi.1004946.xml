<abstract>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent form of arrhythmia occurring in the industrialized world. Because of its complex nature, each identified form of AF requires specialized treatment. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the bases of these arrhythmias is essential for therapeutic development. A variety of experimental studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of AF are performed using primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes (NRAMs). Previously, we have shown that the distinct advantage of NRAM cultures is that they allow standardized, systematic, robust re-entry induction in the presence of a constitutively-active acetylcholine-mediated K<sup>+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub>). Experimental studies dedicated to mechanistic explorations of AF, using these cultures, often use computer models for detailed electrophysiological investigations. However, currently, no mathematical model for NRAMs is available. Therefore, in the present study we propose the first model for the action potential (AP) of a NRAM with constitutively-active acetylcholine-mediated K<sup>+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub>). The descriptions of the ionic currents were based on patch-clamp data obtained from neonatal rats. Our monolayer model closely mimics the action potential duration (APD) restitution and conduction velocity (CV) restitution curves presented in our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. In addition, the model reproduces the experimentally observed dynamics of spiral wave rotation, in the absence and in the presence of drug interventions, and in the presence of localized myofibroblast heterogeneities.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A fundamentally important element in cardiac <italic>in silico</italic> research is a model for the cardiac cell. It provides a link between measurable characteristics at the subcellular level and biological processes at the whole cell level, thereby allowing the researcher to study mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias from a molecular cell biological perspective. Such studies are of vast importance for the advancement of understanding of living systems from cells to patient populations. This paper is a joint <italic>in silico</italic>-experimental study in which we propose the first model for the action potential of an NRAM. To develop this model, we fitted patch-clamp data from recent literature, while additionally performing specific measurements of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> in NRAMs. <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> is an important factor in atrial arrhythmogenesis and a promising target for pharmacological AF-management. The model reproduces <italic>in vitro</italic> results such as standard characteristics of AP morphology, restitution, and spiral wave dynamics in monolayers, with effects of a subsequent drug-intervention and in the presence of localized myofibroblast heterogeneities. Thus it can be used as a tool to provide computational support to a variety of systematic experimental studies that investigate the mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation (AF) in NRAM cultures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent form of arrhythmia occurring in patients with or without the risk for heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref008">8</xref>]. Each identified form of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or chronic) requires specialized treatment. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms is required for optimal management in the treatment of such arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Chronic AF is known to induce functional tissue remodeling through changes in ion channel expression and activity in the cardiomyocyte membranes. Of the various ion channels that have been identified in atrial cardiomyocytes, one family of particular interest is the Kir3.x. These channels produce an inwardly-rectifying K<sup>+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub>) that is normally controlled by vagal nerve activity through its transmitter acetylcholine (ACh). There is growing consensus that during chronic AF, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> becomes constitutively active (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>] and hyperpolarizes the cell membrane. This leads to abbreviation of the action potential duration (APD), and stabilization of reentrant electrical circuits that characterize AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref001">1</xref>]. However, despite decades of research on a variety of mammalian hearts, the role of ion-channel remodeling in AF, remains incompletely understood.</p>
<p>Development of a better biophysical understanding of ion channel remodeling in AF requires thorough <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations in the human heart. However, a more practical approach involves studying AF in cell cultures <italic>in vitro</italic>, prior to <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> trials. Primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes (NRAMs) have been used by researchers interested in cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref013">13</xref>]. Recently, we have demonstrated that NRAMs can generate <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub>, in primary cultures, thereby making them attractive sources for arrhythmogenic substrates that can be used to study chronic AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Although <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have often provided significant insights into the mechanisms underlying reentry initiation in both healthy and diseased cardiac tissue, they have a few limitations. One cannot easily address complex questions related to electrophysiology, that would involve challenging techniques like patch- clamp in parallel with optical mapping measurements, or sub-surface measurements of electrical signals in intact cardiac tissues. Furthermore, independent experimental interventions involving gradual modifications of cell properties, such as gap junctional conductance, coupling between different cells types, localized changes in conductivities of specific ionic channels etc. are very difficult to obtain in an experiment. This is where computer models find wide-scale applicability, from basic science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref023">23</xref>] to direct clinical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>The basis for any computational study in cardiac tissue is a model for the cardiac cell. However, a model for the NRAM is still lacking. Development of this model is important, because it would allow researchers to perform specific <italic>in silico</italic> studies next to <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, thereby increasing the possibilities for the development of biological insight into arrhythmias like AF.</p>
<p>In this study, we formulate the first complex ionic model for NRAM monolayers, based on patch-clamp data from recent literature. To remain consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we incorporate natural cellular heterogeneity, and a baseline 15–20% randomly distributed myofibroblasts into these monolayers. We then generate spiral waves in these monolayers by burst pacing (BP) and reproduce spiral wave dynamics as seen in experiments, both under normal conditions and under pharmacological inhibition. In particular, we simulate the effect of the atrial-specific drug tertiapin-Q, a blocker of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub>, on BP-induced arrhythmias, as reported by Bingen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>] In addition, we reproduce spiral wave dynamics in a monolayer with localized myofibroblast heterogeneity.</p>

<p>The mathematical model of the native NRAMs was developed from an electrical circuit of the cell membrane. It consists of a membrane capacitance, in parallel with voltage-dependent conductance branches that include batteries, and with pumps and exchangers. Thus, the electrophysiological behavior of a single cardiomyocyte can be described using the following ordinary differential equation,

<p>Here <italic>m</italic> represents the activation gate, <italic>h</italic>, the fast inactivation gate, and <italic>j</italic>, the slow inactivation gate. The formulation for the channel kinetics was based on experimental data from Ramos-Mondragόn et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref035">35</xref>] and Voitychuk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref036">36</xref>] We used the normalized activation (control) data from Fig 4D of Ramos-Mondragόn et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref035">35</xref>] to construct the steady-state activation curve (m<sub>∞</sub>) of our model. For steady-state inactivation, we used the (control) data from Fig 5D of Voitychuk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref036">36</xref>] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g002">Fig 2A</xref> shows the steady-state activation and inactivation curves generated using our model, compared with the activation and inactivation kinetics from Ramos-Mondragόn et al.

The time constants for the activation and slow inactivation gates are taken from the Luo-Rudy guinea-pig ventricular cell model, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref037">37</xref>] and scaled appropriately for room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref038">38</xref>]. We retain these values for the time constants until more experimental evidence is available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). The time constant for fast inactivation was modeled on the basis of data derived from Fig 5E of Voitychuk et al., (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref036">36</xref>].

<p>It consists of a voltage-dependent activation gate <italic>d</italic>, a voltage-dependent inactivation gate <italic>f</italic>, and an intracellular calcium-dependent inactivation gate <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>Ca</italic></sub>. The driving force was modeled with a Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz equation, ignoring the permeability for the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions. The steady-state activation and inactivation curves for the voltage-dependent gates (i.e., <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>∞</italic></sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>∞</italic></sub>) were obtained by fitting the patch-clamp (control) data from the experiments of Avila et al, on NRAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref039">39</xref>]. Unfortunately, no literature was available for the activation and inactivation times of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>CaL</italic></sub> in NRAMs. Thus in our model, we retained the activation and inactivation time constants from the neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocyte (NRVM) model by Korhonen et al.

Korhonen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref041">41</xref>] obtained the value for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent inactivation from the experimental records of Pignier et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref042">42</xref>] who used NRVMs for their measurements.

<p>The current consists of a [K]<sub>o</sub>-dependent part, a voltage-dependent inward rectification factor, and a linear leakage (last term).

<p>Near-overlap of the <italic>I-V</italic> curves in the physiological range of voltages indicates that in single cells <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> is present, but not prominently active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). To verify this finding we performed additional current-clamp experiments. In particular, we evoked APs from 4 different NRAMs, in 4 independent control experiments, followed by subsequent treatment with 2 μM carbachol (the nonselective muscarinic receptor agonist). With this concentration of carbachol, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> is expected to be fully activated, thereby leading to abbreviation of APs in NRAMs. AP recordings, during carbachol-treatment, showed an average ~35% decrease in APD<sub>50</sub> and an approximate ~40% decrease in APD<sub>80</sub>, confirming that <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> was being abundantly activated in NRAMs by carbachol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g007">Fig 7E</xref>, red line). Further treatment of these cell with 100 nM tertiapin-Q caused the original AP characteristics to be restored and lengthened of APD<sub>80</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g007">Fig 7E</xref>, gray line). This finding suggests that isolated NRAMs expressed potentially active Kir3.x channels, which contribute to <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub>. However, this current is dormant on single NRAMs to produce substantial amounts of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>In monolayers, however, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> is found to be constitutively active and has been established to play a key role in the development of a proarrhythmic tissue substrate, because block of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> drastically increases APD, whereas further opening with 2 μM carbachol does not have any substantial effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g007">Fig 7F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref055">55</xref>]. Previously, we showed that complete block of the Kir3.x channels could lead to drastic changes in the overall electrophysiological behavior of the NRAM monolayer, such as near-tripling of APD<sub>80</sub>, reduction in APD<sub>80</sub> dispersion, and consequent termination of burst pacing-induced arrhythmias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, we modified our formulation for the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> in higher dimensional models to make it constitutively active (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). However, measurement of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> at physiological voltages in the presence of Carbachol requires an extracellular environment that contains abnormally high concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>, which would cause us to study a condition that will not reflect the actual situation in monolayers, which we aim to model and study <italic>in silico</italic>.

The AP shows the characteristic sharp upstroke, followed by a decay (repolarization phase), with complete absence of a notch and a dome. In the absence of a holding current, the model generated a resting membrane potential (RMP) of -72.0 mV, which was in consonance with the value -73.0 ± 2.5 mV, derived from the patch-clamp measurements of Voitychuk et al.

<title>Modeling cardiac monolayers</title>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> monolayers were cultured on circular coverslips in standard 24-well plates which have a basal diameter of 15.6 mm. These cultures showed an average 15–20% randomly-distributed myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref060">60</xref>]. Therefore, to simulate cardiac monolayers that closely resembled our <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, a circular simulation domain of physical diameter 15.6 mm was used. The myofibroblasts were modeled according to the formulation of MacCannell et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref061">61</xref>] which treats them as passive circuit elements that are electrically coupled to cardiomyocytes. Simulated cardiomyocytes, together with 15–20% simulated MacCannell-type myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref061">61</xref>] were embedded on a rectangular grid, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref022">22</xref>]. Natural intercellular variability was incorporated within the monolayer as described in <bold>Methods</bold>. The cells on the grid were then coupled diffusively (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004946.e016">Eq 11</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref> show a comparison of APs measured at 1Hz electrical pacing using optical mapping, with corresponding voltage traces generated from <italic>in silico</italic> monolayers.

<title>Wave propagation in 2D</title>
<p>In monolayer control experiments, NRAMs exhibited a planar conduction velocity (CV) of ~20–25 cm/s. We found that, to obtain such velocity, a diffusion coefficient of 0.00012 cm<sup>2</sup>/ms was required, which resulted in a CV of 22.2 cm/s. Optimal time and space steps for our model were δx = 0.00625 cm, δt = 0.02 ms, which resulted in an error of about 4% for the velocity of wave propagation and was well within tolerable limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref021">21</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g011">Fig 11A</xref> shows baseline electrical propagation in an <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiac monolayer at 1Hz electrical pacing.

<title>Spiral wave dynamics in the model and experiments</title>
<p>Next, we studied spiral wave dynamics in our model. The spiral waves were initiated by two independent protocols: (<italic>i</italic>) the standard S1-S2 cross-field protocol and (<italic>ii</italic>) by burst-pacing. For measurements of the average period of the spiral, the size of the core, and the trajectory traced by the spiral-wave tip, the spiral was generated in a completely homogeneous, square simulation domain, by the S1-S2 cross-field protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g012">Fig 12A</xref>). The tip of the spiral wave exhibited complex meandering, resulting in a rounded Z-shaped trajectory with a core-size of 5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g012">Fig 12A</xref>, black trace). In monolayers with 17% randomly-distributed myofibroblasts and natural cellular heterogeneity, the tip trajectory retained its shape with local irregularities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g012">Fig 12B</xref>). The average period of the spiral wave (as estimated from the dominant frequency of the voltage signal) was found to be 80 ± 4.8 ms (model), which is comparable to 81.3±11.3 ms (experiment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>]. The average APD<sub>80</sub> during reentry was observed to be 40±4.4 ms (model), which is also comparable to 38.8±7.9 ms (experiment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>]. Wavelength of the spiral-wave, as calculated from the model (CV * APD<sub>80</sub> during reentry), was found to be 0.88±0.9 cm, similar to the experimental recording of 0.8±0.2 cm (average value read off Fig 5C of Bingen et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>] corresponding to pacing cycle lengths 75–85 ms, which is the range for reentry). In experiments, the tip of the spiral waves were generally non-stationary. They exhibited drift and possibly meander. However, we could not resolve the patterns traced by the tips of the spirals in order to compare with trajectories generated by the model. Therefore, we chose to try and reproduce an experimental situation where the tip of the spiral got anchored to a clump of heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g012">Fig 12C</xref>). Our monolayer simulations with an identical pattern of myofibroblast heterogeneity also showed anchoring of the spiral wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g012">Fig 12D</xref>). The corresponding wave pattern closely resembled the experimental situation.</p>

<p>To validate the usability of our model in predicting the outcome of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we burst-paced <italic>in silico</italic> monolayers at cycle lengths as low as 80 ms and successfully induced reentry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g012">Fig 12E and 12F</xref> show <italic>in vitro</italic> phase maps and representative snapshots of the corresponding <italic>in silico</italic> voltage maps, respectively, of reentry initiation upon burst-pacing.</p>
<p>To check whether the specific level of introduced intercellular variability, or the presence of electrotonic coupling with myofibroblasts had any influence on the induction of reentry in our monolayers, we performed 2 separate sets of simulations. In the first set, we used 2 different levels of intercellular variability, namely, 75–125%, and 90–110%, alongside the more commonly used 50–150%. At each variability level, we burst-paced 4 configuration-wise different monolayers and observed 100% stable reentry-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g013">Fig 13A</xref>). In the second set of experiments, we retained 50–150% intercellular variability but removed the electrotonic coupling between cardiomyocytes and myofibroblasts. This ensured that the myofibroblasts acted like inexcitable obstacles. Burst pacing of these monolayers also led to stable reentry induction in 5 out of 5 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g013">Fig 13B</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, to validate the usability of the model in predicting results from in vitro experiments, we used our monolayer model to reproduce our experimental previous results from Bingen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>] Previously, we showed that burst pacing of neonatal rat atrial control monolayers led to robust induction of reentrant arrhythmias. Subsequent block of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> in these monolayers not only led to the removal of existing spirals, but also prevented spiral-formation by burst pacing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>]. Burst-pacing of our monolayer model also showed arrhythmia induction in 10 out of 10 independent cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g014">Fig 14A</xref>). Once an arrhythmia had been induced, we blocked <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> completely in our <italic>in silico</italic> monolayers. Complete block of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> resulted in a substantial increase in wavelength through an acute increase in APD. Under the influence of reduced repolarizing currents, the core of the spiral expanded, wavelength increased and the spiral was no longer stable within the confined space of the simulation domain, causing it to disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g014">Fig 14B</xref>). Finally, burst pacing of the monolayers with completely blocked <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> showed that wavebreaks no longer occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g014">Fig 14C</xref>). The minimum pacing cycle length allowing 1:1 capture of the applied electrical signal shifted to 125 ms, which is in line with the findings of Bingen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>] Therefore, the effect of tertiapin-Q on <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> could also be reproduced with our monolayer model, at different (75–125% and 90–110%) levels of intercellular variability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we introduced a mathematical model of neonatal rat atrial tissue, based on available experimental electrophysiological data from NRAMs, and our additional patch-clamp data of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub> in these cells. If data from NRAMs was unavailable, we used parameters suited to NRVMs. We demonstrated the feasibility of our model to successfully reproduce AP characteristics such as dV/dt<sub>max</sub>, AP amplitude, APD<sub>50</sub>, APD<sub>80</sub> and RMP.</p>
<p>Using our model, we successfully reproduced the APDR and CVR curves generated using optical mapping experiments on monolayers of neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes. These curves are essential determinants of stability of arrhythmias in cardiac tissue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of simulations in spatially extended media with our monolayer model by successfully initiating spiral waves by burst pacing. In agreement with the experiments by Bingen et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>] our model demonstrated the possibility of removing reentrant circuits upon inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> by a specific blocker tertiapin-Q. In addition, our model showed a meandering spiral wave with similar average period (80 ± 4.8 ms, versus 81.3 ± 11.3 ms in experiments), and a rounded Z-shaped core of size 5 mm. Using our monolayer model, we also reproduced spiral wave dynamics from our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, in the presence of myofibroblast heterogeneity, thus establishing the robustness of the model, for use alongside experiments.</p>
<p>However, in spite of our best efforts to design a state-of-the-art mathematical model, certain inherent flaws remain. A model is only as good as the data that is used to build it. Since the formulations of most of our currents were derived from patch-clamp data from available literature, we faced the problem of dealing with yet incomplete data extracted using different cell-isolation, cell-culture conditions and the patch-clamp protocols and procedures for obtaining these crucial data. Regardless of the variability, these factors may influence the experimental outcome to a great extent. Therefore, instead of relying on absolute numbers for the maximal currents from the <italic>I-V</italic> curves, we used normalized currents to preserve the trend, while compromising in some cases on the absolute values of the currents produced by the cell.</p>
<p>Discrepancies between results obtained from literature and those derived using our model show up in a few important areas. A major limitation of the model is the lack of evidence on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in atrial cardiomyocytes. For simplicity, we adapted the dynamics for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ventricular model with modifications as described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004946.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> of the supplementary material. However, this lack of key information about Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in atrial cardiomyocytes can also perhaps account for the slight alteration in model AP morphology. Such difference may impinge on modeling phenomena where accurate representation of the depolarized state is critical.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our experimental records of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub>-behavior in single cell versus monolayers raises a fundamental question, that of compatibility between single cell and tissue properties. In this respect, it is important to clarify that being 'constitutively active' is not the same as being 'maximally active'. Even a small, but stimulant-independent activity of a current can be regarded as constitutive activity. In our single cell patch-clamp experiments, we observed a high-conductance stimulant-independent current at hyperpolarizing potentials, which gave way to a low-conductance current at physiological depolarized voltages. However, monolayers constructed using the same cells showed a pronounced response to antagonist tertiapin-Q, which translated into 2-fold prolongation of the action potential, indicating the activity of a high-conductance current in monolayers. In 2006, Cha et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref062">62</xref>] performed dedicated studies to measure <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> in single and multicellular preparations of canine atrial cardiomyocytes and observed similar anomaly in the behavior of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> (see Figs 1C, 1D, 2 and 3 of Cha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref062">62</xref>]) Our findings are in line with these observations, i.e., modest versus pronounced effect of tertiapin-Q on APD in single and multicellular level, respectively. One approach to quantify <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> involves performing patch-clamp studies on neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes in the presence of agonist Carbachol. This technique has been used before for that purpose by other researchers such as Dobrev et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref009">9</xref>] However, addition of Carbachol to observe substantial difference between the IV curves for basal current and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> would require (i) an extracellular environment for the cell that contains abnormally high levels of K<sup>+</sup>, resulting in (ii) a condition that will not reflect the actual situation in monolayers, which we aim to model and study <italic>in silico</italic>. To this day, this apparent discrepancy between the behavior of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> at single vs multi-cell level remains unresolved. In fact, this matter may not only involve this one particular current, but is likely to concern a more fundamental aspect of single cell vs tissue vs whole organ behavior regarding ion channel dynamics. Therefore, in this manuscript, we employ a reverse-engineering approach in which we use our single cell patch-clamp data for <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub> to build a basal formulation for the <italic>I-V</italic> characteristic curve in our single cell model. When this model is extended to simulate tissue, we combine the concept of Fig 1A from Dobrev et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref009">9</xref>] about split-<italic>I-V</italic> curves at physiologically relevant depolarized voltages and further adjust this formulation on the basis of control and tertiapin-Q-treated APD restitution curves from monolayer studies, to include the strength of the current at varying pacing cycle lengths. Nevertheless, the translation from a single to multi-cell level in terms of ion channel dynamics certainly warrants further investigation. Until new insights become available, we believe, however, that our study introduces a new and valuable model that is robust enough to facilitate simulation studies into key aspects of atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p>A principal limitation of our model is that an experimentally-validated, detailed Q<sub>10</sub>-compensation was not factored in for usability of this model at all temperatures. Because of the limited availability of experimental data on NRAMs, we used a Q<sub>10</sub> compensation similar to Hou et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref051">51</xref>] with certain other adjustments based on the idea that temperature affects channel kinetics of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents as well as their maximal conductances, though to a lesser degree. Because no information was available regarding any of the time constants for the gating variables that controlled the different ionic currents, except fast Na<sup>+</sup> activation, all the time constants were either taken from the neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocyte model by Korhonen et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref041">41</xref>] or adapted to suit the AP characteristic and APDR data fromNRAMs.</p>
<p>Inactivation kinetics of the fast Na<sup>+</sup> channel is an important determinant of cardiac tissue excitability. In our model, we fitted the steady-state inactivation curve with data derived from Voitychuk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref036">36</xref>] The V<sub>½</sub> for this data was ~15 mV more positive than in the steady-state inactivation data of Ramos-Mondragón et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref035">35</xref>] However, we chose to use the data derived from Voitychuk et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref036">36</xref>] instead of the data derived from Ramos-Mondragón et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref035">35</xref>] because for a fixed <italic>dV/dt</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> the kinetics from Ramos-Mondragón et al, did not allow wave propagation in a monolayer, as opposed to the kinetics from Voitychuk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref036">36</xref>]</p>
<p>Taken together, we present in this paper, a quantitatively-robust, computationally-efficient, experimentally-validated mathematical model of the NRAM expressing the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh-c</italic></sub>. We use this model to build simulation domains that mimic cardiac monolayers <italic>in vitro</italic> and successfully demonstrate the usability of the monolayer model to study initiation, maintenance and termination of spiral wave arrhythmias by reproducing key results from our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p>

<p>NRAMs were isolated from hearts of 2-day-old Wistar rat pups as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref063">63</xref>]. Isolated cells were plated on round glass coverslips (15-mm diameter) coated with fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 24-well plates (Corning Life Sciences, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Depending on the assay, cell densities of 0.1–8 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well were used and culture as described in our commonly used neonatal rat cardiac myocyte preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref058">58</xref>].</p>

<title>Patch-clamp electrophysiology</title>
<p>NRAMs were patch-clamped using the whole-cell technique at 20–23°C on day 2–4 of culture. The patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outer diameter and 1.17 mm inner diameter; Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK) with a vertical puller (P-30; Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA, USA). Pipettes had typical electrical resistances of 2–3 MΩ in the extracellular solution when filled with the internal solution (for composition, see later). Solitary beating cells were selected under an inverted microscope Zeiss Axiovert 35 (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) for the measurements by a MultiClamp 700B amplifier connected to a Digidata 1440A A/D converter (Axon CNS, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). After reaching the giga-ohm seal, the holding potential was set to -50 mV, and the patch membrane was ruptured by gentle suction through the pipette. Whole-cell capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) was calculated from capacitive transient currents evoked during 5 mV steps from a holding potential of -50 mV. The capacitance transients were cancelled with the amplifier. To minimize voltage error and improve the adequacy of the voltage-clamp, pipette series resistance was routinely electrically compensated by &gt;75%. The voltage and current command pulses were applied to the amplifier through its external command input from the A/D converter connected to a personal computer. The instruments were controlled and driven by commercially available MultiClamp 700B Commander and Clampex V10.3 softwares (Molecular Devices) for Windows. Throughout experiments, the current and voltage outputs of amplifier were continuously sampled at intervals of 100 μs and recorded onto the personal computer after low-pass filtering at 2–4 kHz with a four-pole Bessel filter.</p>

<title>Data analysis and statistics</title>
<p>For off-line analysis, the data stored on the personal computer were analyzed by pClamp V10.3 (Molecular Devices) and GraphPad Prism software version 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). All data are expressed as means ± standard error of mean (SEM) for a specified number (n) of observations. Significant differences were determined at the P &lt;0.05 level, unless specified. Unpaired Student’s t test or the one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s test were used for comparing different experimental groups. Statistical significance was expressed as follows: *: P&lt;0.05, **: P&lt;0.01, ***: P&lt;0.001 NS: not significant.</p>

<title>Construction of virtual monolayers</title>
<p>Virtual monolayers were constructed by allocating cells on a circular selection in a simulation domain containing 256 x 256 grid points. In order to achieve a random distribution of myofibroblasts within the monolayers, N specific sites were selected from within the array, by a random-number generator. For consistency with experiments, N was chosen such that the myofibroblasts constituted 15–20% of the total number of cells comprising the monolayers. The myofibroblasts were coupled to the cardiomyocytes via a gap junctional conductance G<sub>gap</sub> = 0.5 nS/pF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004946.ref059">59</xref>]. This coupling is ~6 times smaller than myocyte-myocyte coupling. Whole-cell patch-clamp measurements of APs from different samples of NRAMs showed a slight variation in AP characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004946.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). When cardiomyocytes as heterogeneous as these are coupled together to form a monolayer, it would therefore be reasonable to expect a certain degree of natural intercellular variability within the monolayer, although most of the heterogeneity in electrophysiological properties would be compensated by electrotonic coupling. Please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004946.g007">Fig 7D</xref> for proof of variability in the conductance values of currents <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>KACh</italic></sub>. It is possible to adopt a very basic approach to accomplish the same in computer models. To incorporate X<sub>1</sub>-X<sub>2</sub>% intercellular variability within the monolayers the following protocol was used: (<italic>i</italic>) A random-number generator was used to generate 19 numbers from within the range 0.01 x (X<sub>1</sub>-X<sub>2</sub>), for each cardiomyocyte occupying a site on the cellular grid. (<italic>ii</italic>) At each cell site, the maximal conductance, associated with an ionic current/flux, was multiplied by one of these 19 random numbers (one random number for each individual ionic current/flux). This ensured a spatially-random distribution between the electrophysiological properties of the individual uncoupled cells. Next, these heterogeneous cells were coupled electrotonically. Electrotonic coupling averages out the electrophysiological properties so that the culture exhibits uniform APD distributions. Simulated monolayers were discarded if the APD<sub>80</sub> maps showed non-uniform distribution of APD or APD dispersion larger than 20 ms. Finally, APD<sub>80</sub> maps from our <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures were compared with those from the simulated monolayers with varying levels of intercellular heterogeneity. Because the APD<sub>80</sub> maps at 50–150% intercellular variability showed closest resemblance with <italic>in vitro</italic> data in terms of mean value and spatial distribution, we chose to use this range for our numerical experiments.</p>
