<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As an important safeguard against autoimmunity, T cells bearing autoreactive T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) are eliminated during their development in the thymus, a process known as negative selection. Although much is known about the molecular events involved in negative selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Starr1">[1]</xref>, surprisingly little is known about the dynamic aspects of the process. For example, what is the sequence of events from the first encounter with a negative selecting ligand until the death of the thymocyte? How long does the process take? Does a single encounter with self-peptide lead to migratory arrest, or do thymocytes remain motile and continue to sample the tissue for negative selecting ligands? What is the temporal relationship between the death of the thymocyte and its clearance by phagocytes?</p>
<p>Pioneering studies carried out in the 1980s documented the absence of thymocyte populations bearing self-reactive TCRs in mice expressing the relevant self antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Kappler1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Pircher1">[4]</xref>. However, these studies could not address the timing and mechanism of negative selection since self-antigens were present continuously and dying thymocytes were not detected. In subsequent experiments, rearranged TCR transgenes were expressed in mice without the relevant self-antigen, and then antigenic peptides were administered <italic>in vivo</italic> to induce negative selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Murphy1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Zhan1">[8]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> co-cultures of transgenic thymocytes with cognate peptide-loaded antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have also been used to examine the process of negative selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Vasquez1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Mcgargill1">[11]</xref>. These approaches have revealed extensive thymocyte death accompanied by nuclear condensation and other classic signs of programmed cell death, or apoptosis. However, the analyses were typically performed at a single time point, often a day or more after peptide addition, and thus it was unclear when the process of negative selection began and ended. In addition, the impact of systemic cytokines produced by mature T cell stimulation in the periphery was a confounding factor in many of the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Martin1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Brewer1">[13]</xref>. A recent study examining negative selection to endogenous self-antigen <italic>in vivo</italic>, reported a decrease in the number of autoreactive thymocytes becoming apparent 24–48 hours after the first signs of TCR triggering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-McCaughtry1">[14]</xref>. These delayed and asynchronous kinetics were attributed to the variable time for a thymocyte to encounter a thymic APC capable of providing a negative selecting signal. Thus, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the timing of thymocyte death during negative selection.</p>
<p>Another outstanding question is the relationship between thymocyte death and clearance by macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies of cultured cells undergoing apoptosis indicate that mitochondrial damage and caspase activation are followed by dismantling of cellular components accompanied by nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, and exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer face of the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Green1">[15]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, PS exposure is thought to serve as an “eat-me” signal to phagocytes, promoting the removal of membrane blebs and apoptotic cells and preventing the release of cellular contents into extracellular space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Ravichandran1">[16]</xref>. In the thymus, very few dying cells are observed at steady state, and apoptotic cells are found inside phagocytes, indicating efficient clearance mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Surh1">[17]</xref>. However, it is unclear whether thymocytes first undergo apoptosis and then are rapidly engulfed, or whether the engulfment by macrophages precedes thymocyte death. Determining whether apoptosis precedes phagocytosis or vice versa is important, both for understanding the mechanistic link between these events <italic>in vivo</italic>, and because the occurrence of cell death before phagocytosis may lead to greater potential inflammation due to the release of cellular contents.</p>
<p>Studies of negative selection <italic>in vivo</italic> have largely focused on the end result of thymocyte self-reactivity, and we know little about the initial encounters between autoreactive thymocytes and thymic APCs presenting negative selecting ligands. For mature T cells in lymph nodes, the initial encounters with peptide–MHC-bearing dendritic cells can occur as transient, serial interactions prior to migratory arrest and stable conjugate formation, particularly under conditions of suboptimal stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Bousso1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Mempel1">[20]</xref>. An indication that autoreactive thymocytes may also engage in serial contacts with APC during negative selection comes from a steady-state model in which thymocytes undergo negative selection to a tissue-restricted antigen expressed in the medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-LeBorgne1">[21]</xref>. In this system a large number of autoreactive thymocytes persisted and remained motile in the thymic medulla, exhibiting a confined migration pattern that allowed for serial contact with multiple dendritic cells. However, because antigen was present continuously, it was unclear whether confined migration occurred during the initial contact with antigen, or reflected an adaptation of thymocytes to antigen exposure over time. Moreover, this model is based on a specialized form of negative selection in which medullary thymic epithelial cells exhibit stochastic and low-level expression of proteins that are otherwise restricted to peripheral tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Klein1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Mathis1">[23]</xref>. Much of the negative selection in the thymus is driven by ubiquitous, rather than tissue-restricted, self antigens, and these different forms of negative selection likely differ in terms of the abundance and spatial distribution of antigens, types of peptide-presenting cells, and molecular requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-McCaughtry1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Klein1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Suen1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we examine a cohort of thymocytes undergoing negative selection to a ubiquitous antigen within three-dimensional living thymic tissue. The initial encounter with negative selecting ligands leads to a rapid rise in intracellular calcium and migratory arrest over a broad range of peptide concentrations. Thymocytes with active caspase 3 are detectable starting at 2 hours after peptide addition, while other indicators of cell death, including changes in chromatin structure and membrane permeability, first become apparent at 3 h. In spite of the synchronous early response to negative selecting ligand, individual thymocytes undergo delayed and asynchronous entry into the death program from 2–12 hours after peptide addition. Time-lapse two-photon imaging revealed that thymocyte death and phagocytosis invariably occur together, with many thymocytes already engulfed by a macrophage before the changes in chromatin and membrane permeability are evident. These data provide a timeline of the major events during negative selection, and suggest close coupling between the thymocyte death and clearance by macrophages.</p>

<title>Comparison of Thymocyte Activation and Cell Death during Negative Selection <italic>In Situ</italic> versus <italic>In Vitro</italic></title>
<p>The majority of the studies of negative selection have utilized <italic>in vitro</italic> models that do not support thymocytes' normal motility, nor their dynamic interactions with cells in the three-dimensional tissue environment. To examine the impact of these factors on negative selection, we first compared the activation and death of thymocytes in response to negative selection signals in intact three-dimensional versus dissociated tissue. We incubated thymic slices containing F5 TCR transgenic thymocytes for 30 minutes with specific peptide (NP<sub>366–374</sub> derived from influenza nucleoprotein) to mimic negative selection to a ubiquitous antigen and then continued the incubation for 10 hours either as an intact slice “<italic>in situ</italic>” or after dissociation of the tissue “<italic>in vitro</italic>” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We then analyzed thymocytes by flow cytometry for up-regulation of the activation marker CD69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and induction of active caspase 3, an early marker of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). We focused our analysis on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive (DP) thymocytes, since this population can be a target of deletion to ubiquitous self-antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-McCaughtry1">[14]</xref>. Because of the down-regulation of CD4 and CD8 following TCR stimulation, a phenomenon known as DP “dulling”, we adjusted the DP gate to include the CD4<sup>low</sup>CD8<sup>low</sup> population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Mcgargill1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Kersh1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> F5 thymocytes from intact slices showed greater CD69 up-regulation in response to specific peptide relative to dissociated slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, F5 thymocytes from intact thymic slices incubated with control peptide showed a lower level of non-specific cell death compared to thymocytes cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results demonstrate that intact thymic slices are superior to dissociated thymic tissue for detection of specific cell death during negative selection, due to both more efficient responses to negative selecting ligands and lower levels of non-specific cell death.</p>

<title>Rapid and Synchronous Activation of Antigen-Specific Thymocytes in Thymic Slices</title>
<p>To establish a timeline of cell activation, apoptosis, and clearance during negative selection, we initiated a wave of negative selection by overlaying thymic slices containing F5 TCR transgenic thymocytes with specific peptide. The thymic slices were prepared from lethally-irradiated mice reconstituted with mixtures of wild type (WT) and F5 TCR transgenic bone marrow (BM), allowing us to compare the response of polyclonal thymocytes as an internal control. Up-regulation of CD69 was first detected on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> F5 thymocytes one hour after specific peptide addition (data not shown) and peaked between 2 to 4 hours, corresponding with the down-regulation of TCRβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Another activation marker, CD44 was also up-regulated in the experimental group, but with slightly delayed kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Finally, the down-regulation of CD4 and CD8, a phenomenon known as DP “dulling” that is indicative of TCR signaling, could be detected starting 4 hours after specific peptide stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Mcgargill1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Kersh1">[25]</xref>. No changes in these activation markers were observed on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> F5 thymocytes from slices treated with a control peptide or on WT cells alongside activated F5 thymocytes, confirming that the changes were due to direct TCR engagement on F5 thymocytes rather than cytokine-driven bystander effects or non-specific signals. Altogether, these data show that F5 thymocytes are synchronously and specifically activated by the cognate peptide addition to thymic slices, leading to rapid changes in gene expression.</p>

<title>Antigen-Specific Thymocytes Undergo Rapid Migratory Arrest after Encounter with Cognate Ligand</title>
<p>To visualize the earliest response of thymocytes to their negative selecting ligand, we modified our system to accommodate time-lapse imaging. We used thymic slices from mixed BM chimeric mice in which a small proportion of the thymocytes express the F5 TCR and green fluorescent protein (GFP). WT (polyclonal TCR) thymocytes labeled with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) served as an internal control. Cortex and medulla were distinguished based on the proximity of the imaging volume to the capsule of the thymus and the characteristically lower position of the medulla (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We then performed two-photon microscopy of thymocytes within cortical regions (corresponding to CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes) and midway though the imaging run, we added specific peptide to the perfusion medium. TCR transgenic thymocytes arrested their migration within minutes of peptide addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s002">Video S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g003">Fig. 3A and 3B</xref>). The WT thymocytes in the same imaging volume did not alter their migration pattern confirming that the stopping was induced directly by TCR triggering, rather than by alterations in the tissue microenvironment. The F5 thymocytes maintained low speed for hours after the encounter with their cognate pMHC ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Migratory arrest was also observed when the experiment was performed with CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> F5 thymocytes purified by depletion of CD8SP and CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> populations and overlaid onto thymic slices with OT I thymocytes serving as controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s003">Video S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Bhakta1">[26]</xref>.</p>

<p>Thymus slices from BM chimeras containing GFP-expressing F5 thymocytes and CFP-expressing WT thymocytes were imaged by two-photon microscopy and peptide was added during the imaging run. (A) The trajectories of WT and F5 cells within the same imaging volume are represented as tracks that are color-coded blue (before the addition of the specific peptide) and red (after the addition of the specific peptide).

<p>To examine the relationship between thymocyte behavior and TCR signaling, we adapted the experimental system to allow for measurement of TCR induced calcium flux using the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye Indo-1 LR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). We isolated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes from F5 TCR transgenic mice, loaded them with Indo-1 LR, and overlaid them onto thymic slices. Labeled thymocytes were found in both the cortex and medulla of thymic slices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). This likely reflects the physiological trafficking of post-selection thymocytes in our samples, which are in the process of becoming CD8<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup> single positive (CD8SP) and are beginning to express homing molecules, such as CCR7, that give them access to the medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Campbell1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Yin1">[28]</xref>. In contrast, “pre-selection” CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>, isolated from non-selecting backgrounds localize overwhelmingly to the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Ehrlich1">[29]</xref> (our unpublished observations) consistent with their less mature phenotype. We performed all subsequent imaging studies in the medullary region due to the higher cell densities and superior image quality compared to the cortex.</p>
<p>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes exhibited a relatively low intracellular calcium concentration and high motility in thymic slices prior to peptide addition, whereas addition of cognate peptide triggered a sharp increase in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and a sudden drop in thymocyte motility.

<title>Rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> Flux and Migratory Arrest Occur over a Wide Range of Peptide Concentrations</title>
<p>The rapid migratory arrest observed for thymocytes encountering a negative selecting ligand resembles the behavior of mature T cells upon encountering an antigen-bearing dendritic cell (DC) under conditions of optimal priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Bousso1">[18]</xref>. On the other hand, less intense stimuli, including low peptide concentration, can lead to an initial phase of transient interactions of mature T cells with DC before forming stable contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Henrickson1">[19]</xref>. To determine whether limiting peptide concentration could also lead to transient interactions of thymocytes during negative selection, we first determined the minimal peptide concentrations that induce efficient negative selection in our system. We incubated thymic slices with different concentrations of NP peptide for 10 hours, and examined CD69 and active caspase 3 on F5 thymocytes by flow cytometry. Addition of 1 µM NP peptide induced strong CD69 and active caspase 3<sup>+</sup> up-regulation, whereas 1 nM led to weaker but significant up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g004">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). Addition of 100 pM NP led to only slightly increased activation and apoptosis induction compared to control peptide, a difference that did not reach statistical significance.</p>

<p>We then tested this range of peptide concentrations for their ability to induce calcium flux and migratory arrest of F5 thymocytes. Interestingly, all peptide concentrations tested induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and migratory arrest in the vast majority of thymocytes within 20 minutes of peptide addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g004">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s005">Video S4</xref>). Limiting peptide concentration affected the time required for the majority of thymocytes to respond: within a minute for the highest concentration tested (1 µM), 3–4 min with 1 nM and 15–20 min with 100 pM. In spite of this delay at the population level, individual thymocytes exposed to low peptide concentrations converted rapidly from non-signaling to signaling behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s005">Video S4</xref>), suggesting that the delay in response at the population level was due to the lower probability of encountering APCs displaying sufficient number of pMHC to trigger a response. To confirm this, we aligned individual cell tracks based on the time point at which elevated calcium was first detected, and calculated the average calcium ratio and interval speed relative to the onset of signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). This analysis confirmed that low peptide concentrations induced an all-or-nothing response in thymocytes, with calcium influx and stopping occurring together, and reaching a maximum over a period of less than 30 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

<p>Because dying thymocytes are efficiently cleared by phagocytes, the number of active caspase 3<sup>+</sup> thymocytes detectable at any given time point provides only a snapshot of negative selection. The cumulative loss of viable thymocytes should provide a more accurate read-out of the extent of negative selection over time, however this measurement is complicated by the variation in the number of thymocytes per slice and seeding of slices by F5 thymocytes. To get around these problems, we included a population of thymocytes bearing an irrelevant TCR (OT I) to serve as internal reference. We overlaid marked OT I and F5 thymocytes on WT thymic slices at a ratio of approximately 1∶1, and determined the number of viable thymocyes of each donor type using flow cytometry at various times after peptide addition. We then used the ratio of F5 to OT I CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes as a measurement of cell loss due to negative selection. With this approach, we were able to detect loss of viable cells as early as 3 hours after the addition of the specific peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>), lagging 1 hour after the first appearance of active caspase 3<sup>+</sup> Aqua<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). By 12 hours the number of non-apoptotic F5 thymocytes had decreased by ∼70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). A similar time course was observed when total (Aqua<sup>+</sup> and Aqua<sup>−</sup> cells after exclusion of debris and doublets) CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). PS exposure, which serves as an “eat-me” signal to phagocytes, could be detected above background by 2 hours after peptide addition, corresponding to the first appearance of active caspase 3<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). Importantly, the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (zVAD) abolished both PS exposure and cell loss indicating that caspases are essential for both processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g005">Fig. 5D, 5E, and 5F</xref>). Together these data imply that thymocytes undergo caspase-dependent cell death asynchronously between 3 and 12 hours following synchronous encounter with negative selecting peptide.</p>

<title>Visualization of the Cell Death and Clearance during Acute Negative Selection</title>
<p>Having established a time window for negative selection in our system, we next set out to directly visualize thymocyte apoptosis and relate it to phagocyte clearance. To visualize cell death, we adapted a method in which cells are double-labeled with a cytosolic dye (SNARF) to detect the loss of membrane integrity and the nuclear dye Hoechst to detect apoptosis-induced changes in the chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Mempel2">[30]</xref>. Purified CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> F5 thymocytes were labeled with SNARF and Hoechst, seeded on thymic slices that were subsequently incubated with specific peptide, and analyzed by time-lapse two-photon microscopy in the medulla. Cell death could be detected by a sudden increase in the ratio of fluorescence in the blue to red channels due to a drop in SNARF and an increase in Hoechst signal (blue to red or B/R ratio) in individual thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, white arrow and green line) while the B/R ratio of neighboring thymocytes remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, brown line). While very few examples of cell death were seen during the first 3 hours, numerous examples were seen starting at 4 hours after addition of specific peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s006">Video S5</xref>). Very little cell death was observed with control peptide or in the presence of the caspase inhibitor zVAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Cell death could be readily detected up to 12 hours after addition of specific peptide, the limit for maintaining adequate tissue viability under these conditions. These data are in good agreement with the time course for cell loss detected by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>) and confirm that there is considerable variation in the time to death of individual thymocytes following synchronous encounter with a negative selecting ligand.</p>

<p>To relate thymocyte death to phagocytosis by macrophages, we seeded SNARF and Hoechst labeled CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> F5 thymocytes onto thymic slices from LysM-GFP reporter mice, in which GFP is expressed by phagocytes that are predominantly located in the medulla (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Faust1">[31]</xref>. In all cases, peptide-induced cell death occurred while the thymocyte was in intimate contact or enclosed by a LysM-GFP<sup>+</sup> cell (31 out of 31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g006">Fig. 6C and 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s006">Video S5</xref>). In contrast, only 54% of viable thymocytes from these same runs were in contact with phagocytes, and only 7% appeared to be in intimate contact or engulfed (n = 1,461). The time between the initial contact with the phagocyte and death varied considerably (2–56 min), however many thymocytes remained tightly associated with phagocytes for the duration of the imaging run (&gt;30 min) while remaining viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>The initial contact between the thymocyte and phagocyte could be observed in ∼45% of all phagocytosis examples (14 out of 31). Surprisingly, in all cases (14 out of 14), it was the slowly moving thymocyte that approached the phagocyte and not the other way around (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001566-g006">Fig. 6D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001566.s007">Video S6</xref>). The majority of LysM-GFP<sup>+</sup> phagocytes were stationary despite the abundance of dying cells around them, suggesting that, at least in this system, “find-me” signals and directed migration of phagocytes to apoptotic cells are not the prevalent clearance mechanism.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While many of the individual events during thymocyte negative selection have been identified, the relationship between them is unclear, in part because we lack information about the temporal sequence of events as they occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we address this gap in our knowledge by following a synchronized cohort of thymocytes undergoing negative selection from their initial encounter with negative selecting ligands, to their eventual death and phagocytic clearance. We used two-photon time-lapse microscopy to directly visualize thymocyte cell death and phagocytosis, and observed that engulfment by macrophages precedes the permeabilization of the plasma membrane and chromatin condensation. Our work establishes the chronological sequence of events during negative selection, and reveals a surprising close coupling between apoptosis and phagocytosis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Our experimental setup allowed us to visualize the initial encounter between thymocytes and their negative selecting ligands <italic>in situ</italic>, revealing rapid migratory arrest accompanied by calcium flux. In contrast, autoreactive thymocytes in a steady-state, AIRE-dependent model of negative selection migrated relatively rapidly within confinement zones and no stopping phase was discerned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-LeBorgne1">[21]</xref>. While AIRE-dependent antigens are thought to be present at relatively low abundance in the thymus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Derbinski1">[32]</xref>, it seems unlikely that peptide abundance alone could account for the difference in stopping behavior in the two systems, since we show here that even very low peptide concentrations can induce an all or nothing stopping response in thymocytes. Moreover, a recent report of CD4<sup>+</sup> SP thymocytes in the presence of an AIRE-dependent negative selecting antigen revealed examples of migratory arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Ueda1">[33]</xref>. TCR signals and migration are interrelated, with signaling inducing migratory arrest, and migratory arrest in turn prolonging contact with a single APC and thus promoting sustained signaling. Thus, thymocytes may tune TCR signaling and migratory arrest to balance between sensitive antigen detection and efficient scanning of multiple thymic APCs. Altogether, these data are consistent with the view that thymocytes undergo calcium signaling and migratory arrest upon initial encounter with a negative selecting ligand, but the subsequent response depends on the intensity of the signal received. Encounter with a high abundance peptide and/or presentation by a more stimulatory APC would lead to continued migratory arrest and cell death within a few hours. On the other hand, in response to encounter with a low abundance peptide and/or presentation by a less stimulatory APC, a thymocyte may recover its motility and continue to sample the thymic environment for some time before either undergoing delayed negative selection, agonist selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Stritesky1">[34]</xref>, or export from the medulla as a mature conventional T cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-McCaughtry2">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Enouz1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>In many cases phagocytes migrate toward “find-me” signals released by dying cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Ravichandran2">[37]</xref>. On the other hand, a recent report in a zebra fish model revealed dying neurons actively migrating to regions of the brain containing phagocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-vanHam1">[38]</xref>. Here we observe that phagocytes are relatively abundant in the vicinity of dying thymocytes and approximately half of thymocytes are in contact with a phagocyte even in the absence of antigenic peptide. However, in the handful of examples in which we were able to observe the initial encounter between a dying thymocyte and the phagocyte prior to death and engulfment, it was the thymocyte that approached a sessile phagocyte. These observations suggest that a “find-your-phagocyte” model might operate in multiple <italic>in vivo</italic> settings.</p>
<p>Through the use of time-lapse imaging and pharmacological interventions, we were able to elucidate the timing and sequence of events during the executionary phase of apoptosis resulting from negative selection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Caspase activation is the first marker of death induction that appears around 2 hours after pMHC stimulation. Phagocytosis of dying cells is dependent on caspases' enzymatic activity and follows within an hour, possibly mediated by the “eat-me” signal PS. Perhaps the most surprising result from our study is the observation that phagocytosis precedes typical features of apoptosis. The standard morphological description of apoptosis includes nuclear (chromatin) condensation and fragmentation, while the plasma membrane is still intact and cell disaggregation into apoptotic bodies or blebs that are ultimately engulfed by phagocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Taatjes1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Galluzzi1">[40]</xref>. Our <italic>in situ</italic> data suggest that the internal antigens of dying cells are guarded even more strictly than previously appreciated and the phagocytes may engulf the entire cell at the onset of apoptosis before blebbing or nuclear condensation has occurred. Moreover, the observation that chromatin changes are coincident with plasma membrane permeabilization is consistent with the possibility that phagocyte's lysosomal DNases could play a role in the nuclear breakdown. This raises the intriguing possibility that phagocytes may not be merely “undertakers” serving to remove corpses, but may also serve as “executioners” helping to deliver the final deathblow to the autoreactive thymocyte.</p>
<p>A further intriguing possibility is that phagocytes could also serve as antigen presenting cells for negative selection. F4/80<sup>+</sup> phagocytes can induce negative selection in thymic organ culture, although CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells appear to do so more efficiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Volkmann1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Guerri1">[42]</xref>. Moreover, in situ localization of thymocytes undergoing negative selection to a ubiquitous antigen in the cortex revealed a close association with CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs, but not with F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-McCaughtry1">[14]</xref>. The LysM-GFP reporter that we use in this study to identify phagocytes, shows partial overlap with many of the markers used to identify macrophages and DCs, including CD11c (data not shown). The notion that the same cell may participate in both the initiation and the clean up of negative selection awaits further experimental testing.</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that negative selection requires new gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Vasquez1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-MacDonald1">[43]</xref> and, specifically induction of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-CantBarrett1">[44]</xref>. Thus, the lag period between peptide addition and thymocyte death that we observe could reflect the need to accumulate Bim to levels sufficient to neutralize anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, and thereby trigger mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome C release, and caspase 3 activation. Interestingly, in spite of the fact that all thymocytes responded within minutes to peptide addition, the entry of cells into the death program occurred asynchronously over a period of several hours. Asynchronous cell death has also been reported for cultured cell lines after treatment with a uniform death inducing stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Goldstein1">[45]</xref>, a phenomenon attributed to stochastic variation in expression of pro and anti-apoptotic proteins by individual cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Spencer1">[46]</xref>. TCR signaling in thymocytes can induce both pro-apoptotic factors such as Bim, as well as pro-survival factors such as Schnurri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Staton1">[47]</xref>. Moreover, non-TCR mediated factors such as cytokines may also provide survival signals to autoreactive thymocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, it seems likely that autoreactive thymocytes assess the relative levels of various pro and anti-apoptotic factors in choosing when and if to die. Given emerging evidence that some autoreactive thymocytes may escape negative selection and give rise to agonist-selected or conventional peripheral T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Stritesky1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001566-Enouz1">[36]</xref>, it is tempting to speculate that the prolonged waiting period after encounter with self antigen may allow autoreactive thymocytes to choose between these alternative fates.</p>

CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> F5 thymocytes were depleted of non T cells and mature CD8 SP cells with anti-Biotin MicroBeads and LS columns (Miltenyi Biotech) following incubation with the following biotinylated antibody cocktail – CD11b, CD11c, CD19, CD25, MHC II, DX5, Ter-119, β7-integrin (all from eBioscience or BioLegend). For labeling, 10<sup>7</sup> thymocytes were incubated with 2 µM Indo-1 LR (Teflabs) at 3.3×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml for 90 min in cRPMI at 37°C. In other cases 2×10<sup>7</sup> thymocytes were labeled with 3 µM SNARF (Invitrogen) at 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml for 15 min in pre-warmed PBS at 37°C, washed with cRPMI and further labeled with 5 µM Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) at 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml for 15 min in pre-warmed cRPMI at 37°C. For overlaying on thymic slices, the cell suspensions were adjusted to 10<sup>6</sup> cells/20 µl, and 10–20 µl were gently overlaid on slices in Cell Culture Inserts. The cells were left to migrate into the slice for 2 h at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> and then the cells that had failed to enter the slice were removed by gently washing with PBS.</p>

<title>Flow Cytometry</title>
<p>Single cell thymocyte suspensions were blocked with 24G2 supernatant for 10 min in ice and 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells were stained with antibodies for surface markers (CD4, CD8, CD44, CD45.1, CD45.2, CD69, TCRβ in Pacific Blue, FITC, PerCP/cy5.5. PE/cy7, APC, and APC/eFluor780, all from eBioscience or BioLegend) in 0.5% BSA in PBS (FACS buffer). For PS exposure, the cells were washed with DPBS and stained with Annexin V-AlexaFluor 647 (Invitrogen) in binding buffer for 15 min at room temperature in the dark followed immediately by fixation. For Live/Dead fixable Aqua (Invitrogen) staining (or the equivalent fixable viability dye eFluor 506 from eBioscience) the cells were washed with PBS and stained in 100 µl PBS with 1∶500 dilution from the dyes for 30 min in ice. The cells were washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry or fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscope Sciences) in PBS for 20 min in ice. For active caspase 3 intracellular staining, the fixed cells were permeabilized/blocked in 0.1% Saponin (Sigma) in FACS buffer+5% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch)+10% 24G2 supernatant for 20 min in ice. Anti-active caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling) was applied for 40 min at 1∶400 and was detected with anti-rabbit PE (Jackson Immunoresearch). Flow cytometry was performed on LSR II or Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and data analysis was carried out with FlowJo (TreeStar).</p>

<title>Two-Photon Microscopy</title>
<p>Thymic slices or intact thymic lobes were glued on coverslips and imaged by two-photon laser scanning microscopy with a custom-built up-right microscope or Zeiss 7 MP (Zeiss), while being perfused with warmed (37°C), oxygenated phenol-free DMEM medium (GIBCO) at a rate 1 ml/min. Mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser Mai-Tai (Spectra-Physics) or Chameleon (Coherent) was tuned to 900 nm for CFP+GFP and Hoechst+SNARF excitation or 720 nm for Indo-1 LR excitation with appropriate filter sets. Imaging volumes of various sizes were scanned every 30 sec for 20–60 min and assigned to cortex or medulla based on distance from the capsule (detected by second harmonic signal), density of LysM-GFP cells (greater in the medulla) and the characteristic lower position of the medullary region. Most of the imaging was done in the medulla, except where stated otherwise, because of the superior image quality. Perfusion with peptides was achieved by switching the perfusion medium to phenol-free DMEM containing various amounts of specific or control peptides. Due to the dead volume of the tubing it took 2–3 min for the peptide to reach the sample.</p>

<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p>Imaris 7.3 (Bitplane) was used to determine cell positions over time and tracking. The x, y, and z coordinates as well as the mean fluorescence intensities of the tracking spots for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound Indo-1 LR, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Indo-1 LR, Hoechst and SNARF were exported. Motility parameters were calculated in MATLAB (Mathworks) with a custom code that is available upon request. Interval speed is calculated by dividing displacement over time and the time interval is denoted. For example, when adjacent time points were used for the speed calculation it was denoted as “Interval speed (30 sec)” or when it was calculated over five time points it was denoted as “Interval speed (150 sec)”. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ratio was calculated as a surrogate for Ca<sup>2+</sup> intracellular concentration by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound Indo-1 LR by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Indo-1 LR with great care taken to avoid saturation of pixels. All the values were normalized so that the average Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ratio before peptide addition was zero (corrected Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ratio). Blue/Red fluorescence (B/R) ratio as a measurement for the cell viability was calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity of Hoechst (blue) by SNARF (red).</p>
</sec><sec id="s4h">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Prism 5.0 (GraphPad) was used for graphing and statistical analysis. Unpaired two-tailed t-test was used to determine significance when comparing between two groups, and one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test was applied when more than two groups were compared.</p>
