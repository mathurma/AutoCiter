<p>The Robo3 receptor controls midline crossing by axons. Deleting Robo3 in specific commissural neurons with a conditional knockout reveals their contribution to sensory and motor integration, and models human neurological conditions.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>In Bilateria, many axons cross the midline of the central nervous system, forming well-defined commissures. Whereas in mammals the functions of commissures in the forebrain and in the visual system are well established, functions at other axial levels are less clearly understood. Here, we have dissected the function of several hindbrain commissures using genetic methods. By taking advantage of multiple Cre transgenic lines, we have induced site-specific deletions of the Robo3 receptor. These lines developed with the disruption of specific commissures in the sensory, motor, and sensorimotor systems, resulting in severe and permanent functional deficits. We show that mice with severely reduced commissures in rhombomeres 5 and 3 have abnormal lateral eye movements and auditory brainstem responses, respectively, whereas mice with a primarily uncrossed climbing fiber/Purkinje cell projection are strongly ataxic. Surprisingly, although rerouted axons remain ipsilateral, they still project to their appropriate neuronal targets. Moreover, some <italic>Cre;Robo3</italic> lines represent potential models that can be used to study human syndromes, including horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS). To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to link defects in commissural axon guidance with specific cellular and behavioral phenotypes.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Coordination of the left and right sides of the body requires the action of neurons whose axons cross the nervous system midline. The precise contributions of “commissural” neurons to sensory and motor functions remain poorly understood. To probe these crossing circuits, we took advantage of the recent finding that the Robo3 axon guidance receptor is required for midline crossing by axons at most axial levels. A Robo3 conditional knockout mouse line was generated, allowing Robo3 to be deleted in selective neuronal populations. This led to disruption of specific commissures in the sensory, motor, and sensorimotor systems, and resulted in severe but specific functional deficits. Surprisingly, although rerouted axons do not cross the midline, they still project to their appropriate neuronal targets, suggesting that midline crossing is not required to complete the axonal guidance program of those neurons. Moreover, some of the mouse lines represent good models for human syndromes, including horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS), which is characterized by deficits in coordinated eye movements. This study links defects in commissural axon guidance with specific and dramatic behavioral phenotypes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At all levels of vertebrate nervous systems, axons cross the midline to form commissural projections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Lindwall1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Williams1">[2]</xref>. In the visual system and the corpus callosum in the neocortex, the physiological importance of brain commissures is well established in large part due to the “split-brain” studies of Roger Sperry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Sperry1">[3]</xref> and others. However, the function of commissural projections in the hindbrain and spinal cord has been more difficult to assess. Surgically ablating specific commissures in the hindbrain has proved to be difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Buchwald1">[4]</xref>. In addition, so far, no mutant has been created in which these connections are disrupted in a region-specific manner. Therefore, the function of specific commissures in a variety of hindbrain systems remains uncertain.</p>
<p>By contrast, considerable progress has been made over the past two decades in understanding how commissures form during embryonic development. Genetic screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and mice, as well as biochemical approaches in rodents, have shown that the molecular mechanisms regulating commissure development are highly conserved in evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Goodman1">[5]</xref> and involve axon guidance molecules, including Netrins, Slits, Semaphorins, Ephrins, Morphogens, and IgCAMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Dickson1">[6]</xref>. Their functions are tightly regulated by ECM molecules, cytosolic second messengers, receptor dimerization, and protein degradation in addition to transcriptional and posttranslational modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Dickson1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Yang1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>To broaden our understanding of the function of hindbrain commissures, we undertook to genetically rewire the hindbrain by forcing select commissural tracts to remain ipsilateral, and then examined the cellular and behavioral consequence of these manipulations. We focused on Robo3, a vertebrate roundabout receptor involved in the formation of hindbrain and spinal cord commissures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Marillat1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Sabatier1">[9]</xref>. Robo3, also called <italic>Rig-1</italic> (retinoblastoma inhibiting gene 1), was isolated as the product of a gene up-regulated in retinoblastoma-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Yuan1">[10]</xref>. In humans, mutations in <italic>ROBO3</italic> cause a rare syndrome called horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Bosley1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Jen1">[12]</xref>. HGPPS patients have both an uncrossed pyramidal tract and dorsal column-medial lemniscus as well as severe scoliosis. Despite defects in conjugate horizontal eye movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Haller1">[13]</xref>, they are reasonably coordinated and do not present other obvious neurological deficits. The cause of horizontal gaze palsy, one of two signature traits of HGPPS syndrome, is still uncertain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Bosley1">[11]</xref>. In addition, a subset of HGPPS patients show an unexplained asymmetry of brainstem auditory evoked potentials and activation of their auditory cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Haller1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Amoiridis1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Studies in mice show that in hindbrain and spinal cord, Robo3 is required for commissural axons to cross the midline and that commissural neurons, deficient in Robo3, extend their axons ipsilaterally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Marillat1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Sabatier1">[9]</xref>. The genetic manipulation of Robo3 could thus provide effective means to characterize roles for hindbrain commissures and lead to understanding the etiology of the HGPPS syndrome. Because existing Robo3 knockout mice die perinatally, precluding behavioral analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Sabatier1">[9]</xref>, we have undertaken the construction of a conditional allele of Robo3 and show that viable animals lacking specific commissures can be obtained.</p>

<title>A Reduced Internuclear Commissure in <italic>Robo3</italic>-Deficient Mice Induces Abnormal Horizontal Compensatory Eye Movements</title>
<p>In vertebrates, lateral eye movements are controlled by two pairs of cranial motor nuclei, the abducens (VI) and the oculomotor (III) nuclei, which project ipsilaterally to the lateral and medial rectus muscles, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Engle1">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Conjugate lateral eye movement requires bilateral coordination of those muscles, which relies in part on abducens interneurons that project to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus, forming the abducens-oculomotor (III) internuclear commissural projection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Furthermore, in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of HGPPS patients, nucleus VI is hypoplastic, whereas cranial nerves III and VI are present bilaterally, suggesting that this palsy may result from defects in commissural systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Bosley1">[11]</xref>. We, therefore, analyzed the oculomotor system in the existing <italic>Robo3</italic>-null mice (<italic>Robo3<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Sabatier1">[9]</xref> as well as in a <italic>Robo3</italic>-conditional mouse that lacked <italic>Robo3</italic> in rhombomere 5 (r5), the rhombomere from which abducens neurons are derived. The latter mice (<italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic>) were generated by creating <italic>Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and crossing them with <italic>Krox20::cre</italic> knock-in mice that express Cre recombinase in r3 and r5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Voiculescu1">[16]</xref>. Upon Cre-mediated excision of exons 12–14, a truncated Robo3 protein is produced, which lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, thereby disabling it as a receptor. R3-r5–specific <italic>Robo3</italic> inactivation was confirmed by performing whole-mount labeling with a <italic>Robo3</italic> exon-specific probe and Robo3 antibody on embryonic day (E)12 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g001">Figure 1</xref>). As expected, severe reduction of commissural projections in r3 and r5 was observed in whole-mount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 2/2) and coronal sections of <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> E11–E12 embryos labeled with anti-neurofilament and anti-Robo3 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g002">Figure 2</xref> <italic>n</italic> = 3/3). By contrast, many commissural axons were still observed in adjacent rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A few Robo3-positive axons still crossed the midline at the r3 and r5 level in <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> embryos. These fibers most likely originate in commissural neurons located outside of r3 and r5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Clarke1">[17]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). In <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> embryos, the expression of the known floor plate–derived axon guidance molecules, <italic>Netrin1</italic>, <italic>Sonic Hedgehog</italic> (<italic>Shh</italic>), <italic>Slit1</italic>, <italic>Slit2</italic>, and <italic>Slit3</italic> was not perturbed in r3 and r5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s003">Figure S3</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 2/2).</p>

<p>Unlike <italic>Robo3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> null mice, which die at birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Sabatier1">[9]</xref>, <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice are viable (<italic>n</italic> = 29/29) and do not show any obvious behavioral defects compared to <italic>Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> or wild-type controls. To find out whether Robo3 is expressed in the abducens nuclei, we performed in situ hybridization and analyzed GFP immunostaining in <italic>Robo3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> heterozygous embryos in which GFP was knocked-in to the <italic>Robo3</italic> locus (<italic>n</italic> = 3/3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Sabatier1">[9]</xref>. We found that from E12 to E14, <italic>Robo3</italic> is expressed by a subset of neurons in the abducens nucleus, but not in other cranial motor nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). Accordingly, in <italic>Robo3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> embryos, GFP was expressed by Hb9 and BEN/SC1 immunopositive motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 2/2). However, it was also detected in Hb9-negative neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), most likely corresponding to commissural interneurons projecting to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus. To discern abducens axons from other oculomotor axons and follow their trajectory, we next crossed <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice to <italic>Hb9::GFP</italic> transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Wilson1">[18]</xref>, which, in the hindbrain, selectively express GFP in the VI and hypoglossus (XII) somatic motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Analysis of Hb9::GFP labeling and immunostaining or in situ hybridization with motor neuron markers (Hb9, BEN/SC1, Islet-1, ChAT, CGRP) revealed that, from E12, the shape and mediolateral position of the abducens motor nuclei were slightly altered in <italic>Robo3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 16/16) and <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<italic>n</italic> = 9/9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g003">Figure 3F–3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s004">Figure S4</xref>). However, abducens motor axons still selectively projected to the lateral rectus muscle (<italic>n</italic> = 3/3 in <italic>Robo3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>n</italic> = 2/2 <italic>in Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g003">Figure 3J–3L</xref>). GFP-positive abducens axons were never found to cross the midline, suggesting that, as in controls, the projection remains ipsilateral. In addition, the numbers of Hb9-positive VI neurons were similar in <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> and control mice (211±28 and 205±19 neurons per nucleus, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.8, n = 4 animals for each genotype; Student <italic>t</italic>-test with Mann-Whitney hypothesis, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>

In control newborns (<italic>n</italic> = 6/6), this injection resulted in retrograde labeling of many neurons at the level of the contralateral abducens nucleus and of their axons crossing the floor plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

Together, these results indicate that deletion of Robo3 either globally or specifically in r5 neurons results in loss of the abducens-oculomotor (III) internuclear commissural projection without markedly affecting the pathfinding of abducens motor axons.</p>

<p>To analyze the functional consequence of the lack of the VI-III internuclear commissure we studied compensatory eye movements in adult <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice. The animals were provided with a pedestal and subjected to optokinetic and/or vestibular stimulation in both the horizontal and vertical plane (for <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Stahl1">[19]</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s013">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s010">Table S1</xref> for statistics). All three reflexes in the horizontal plane, including the horizontal optokinetic reflex (OKR), the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) as well as the horizontal visual VOR (VVOR), showed striking changes in the mutants (<italic>n</italic> = 6) compared with control (<italic>n</italic> = 4) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g005">Figure 5A–5D</xref>). Conversely, all eye movement reflexes in the vertical plane were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g005">Figure 5E–5G</xref>). During OKR, the impairments in the <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice appeared to occur predominantly in the low-frequency range, whereas during VOR, they were most prominent at higher frequencies. These frequency-specific deficits reflect the potential role of internuclear commissural connections in high-amplitude eye movements, because OKR and VOR evoke high gain values at the lower and higher frequencies, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-vanAlphen1">[20]</xref>. This view is further supported by the fact that the gain of eye movements in the <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice decreased in a virtually linear manner with respect to stimulus amplitude at higher amplitude values (e.g., for OKR, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g005">Figure 5D</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 versus control mice curve; ANOVA for repeated measurements). As a consequence, the amplitude of the horizontal VVOR, which is high over the entire frequency range because of its combined OKR and VOR nature, was significantly affected in mutants at both the lower and higher frequency ranges. The finding that all horizontal reflexes, but no vertical reflexes, were disrupted suggests that the abducens-oculomotor internuclear commissure was selectively affected.</p>

<p>Genetic fate-mapping has shown that aVCN neurons are generated in the rhombic lip at the r2–r3 level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Farago1">[23]</xref>.

As previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Hsieh1">[24]</xref>, DiI injections in the aVCN of P12 control mice labeled aVCN axons projecting to the contralateral MNTB (<italic>n</italic> = 4/4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g006">Figure 6D and 6E</xref>), where they form characteristic giant synapses called “calices of Held.” By contrast, in <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mutants, this projection was exclusively ipsilateral, although typical calices of Held still formed on MNTB neurons (<italic>n</italic> = 4/4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g006">Figure 6F and 6G</xref>). The numbers of labeled calices were not significantly different between controls and mutants (468±33 and 480±35 calices per side per animal, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.7; <italic>n</italic> = 4 animals for each genotype; Student <italic>t</italic>-test with Mann-Whitney hypothesis). The aVCN ipsilateral projection to the superior olive appeared normal, and the olivocochlear bundle still crossed the midline (unpublished data). These results also incidentally show that globular bushy cells originate exclusively from r3 and that the <italic>Robo3lox</italic> mice can be used for genetic fate-mapping of hindbrain commissural neurons.</p>
<p>We next examined the consequence of the absence of a crossed aVCN/MNTB projection on auditory brainstem responses (ABR; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Delmaghani1">[25]</xref>. The detection thresholds of ABR did not significantly differ in <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> versus control mice and remained in the normal range from 5–40 kHz (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s006">Figure S6</xref>). In all animals, all waves were detected once the stimulus level was set above ABR threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). This indicates that neither auditory sensitivity nor gross neural conduction were affected. In control mice, the ABRs exhibited the four classical waves (I–IV) ipsilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g006">Figure 6H</xref>; for wave interpretation, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s013">Text S1</xref>). Only two waves (IIIc and IVc) were recorded contralaterally, and their detection occurred with enough delay to be ascribed to contralateral excitation. The shape of mutant ABR waves was markedly different from controls. First, only three waves were present ipsilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). At 60 dB sound pressure level (SPL), the latencies and amplitudes of waves I and II exhibited no significant difference relative to controls, which was not surprising, because the mutation targeted neural pathways beyond the cochlear nucleus. In contrast, in mutants, the next visible wave (III) had a longer latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g006">Figure 6H</xref>) than in controls. Moreover, in mutants, the IIIrd wave was not followed by any identifiable waves. Secondly, the contralateral wave IVc still occurred, but with a 0.42-ms average delay compared to the normal IVc. Its magnitude tended to be reduced although not significantly (<italic>n</italic> = 12 wild type versus <italic>n</italic> = 8 mutants; <italic>p</italic> = 0.06). In both mutants and controls, a similar dependency of wave latency on stimulus level was observed (unpublished data). These results show that in <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mutants, the ipsilateral projection of globular bushy cells to MNTB neurons results in abnormal ABRs both ipsilaterally and contralaterally.</p>

<title>An Impaired Interolivary Commissure Affects Locomotion</title>
<p>Inferior olivary (IO) neurons are the source of climbing fiber input on cerebellar Purkinje cells. During development, IO neurons migrate tangentially from the rhombic lip towards the floor plate. Upon reaching the floor plate, IO neuron cell bodies stop and only their axons cross it. We showed previously that IO axons are unable to cross the midline in <italic>Robo3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryos and, as a result, project to the ipsilateral cerebellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Marillat1">[8]</xref>. However, the functional consequence of this ipsilateral rerouting of IO axons is unknown. To attempt to generate mice lacking the interolivary commissure, we crossed <italic>Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> conditional knockout with mice in which Cre recombinase was knocked into the <italic>Ptf1a</italic> (<italic>Ptf1-p48</italic>) locus (<italic>Ptf1a::cre</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Kawaguchi1">[26]</xref>, which encodes a bHLH transcription factor expressed by a majority of IO neuron progenitors. The resulting <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice were viable, until at least 7 mo, but from postnatal day (P)10 onwards, they exhibited profound locomotor deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s014">Video S1</xref>) including an ataxic gait (35/35 cases) that persisted into adulthood. When locomotion was tested on the Rotarod, <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice showed a significant deficit in motor performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>); the <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice fell off the Rotarod at highly significant shorter latencies than controls (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, <italic>n</italic> = 7 mutants versus 9 controls). These motor performance deficits in the <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice were so severe that it appeared as if their ataxia was worse than that of mice that have no cerebellar output at all. We therefore compared their performance to that of <italic>Lurcher</italic> mice, which are characterized by a degeneration of their Purkinje cells and therefore by a virtual absence of the output from their cerebellar cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Cendelin1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Wilson2">[28]</xref>. Although not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.2; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test), the impaired locomotion in the <italic>Lurcher</italic> mice on the Rotarod was indeed milder than in the <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). On the more discriminative Erasmus Ladder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-VanDerGiessen1">[29]</xref>, the difference in motor performance between <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Lurcher</italic> mice was fully apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>); both the step time and the overall walking pattern (percentage of successful walking trials) were highly significantly more affected in <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice than in <italic>Lurcher</italic> mice (<italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> versus <italic>Lurcher</italic> mice for step time in all sessions: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, multiple comparisons; for walking pattern in all sessions: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s011">Table S2</xref>). These findings indicate that the level of cerebellar ataxia induced by rewiring the climbing fiber projection is more severe than that caused by a functional loss of the cerebellar cortex, suggesting a pathological dominant-negative effect in the <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice.

<p>When DiI was injected unilaterally in the cerebellum of newborn controls, it retrogradely labeled IO neurons exclusively on the side opposite to the injection in control mice (4 out of 4 cases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g007">Figure 7K</xref>). In contrast, following injections in <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (8/8 cases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g007">Figure 7L</xref>) about 67% of the DiI-labeled IO neurons were situated on the side of the injection, whereas 33% of the olivary axons projected contralaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g007">Figure 7L</xref>). Immunolabeling of E13 <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> embryos (<italic>n</italic> = 4) with antibodies to Brn3.2, a marker of a large subset of IO neurons, showed that, as previously described in <italic>Robo3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, the ipsilateral IO projection did not result from a migration of IO cell bodies across the midline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s008">Figure S8</xref>). The use of multiple IO neuron markers (Brn3.2, CaBP, BEN/SC1, CGRP) revealed that the lamellar organization of the IO was perturbed in <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<italic>n</italic> = 4; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s008">Figure S8</xref>), whereas the mossy fiber inputs and their neuronal sources developed normally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that the ataxic behavior of <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice can be primarily attributed to the ipsilateral rerouting of a majority of olivocerebellar axons, we crossed these mice to a <italic>Tau-lox-Stop-lox-mGFP-IRES-nls-lacZ</italic> knock-in line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Hippenmeyer1">[30]</xref> (here, called <italic>Tau<sup>mGFP</sup></italic>). Upon Cre recombination in neurons, the Stop cassette is excised, leading to the permanent expression of a myristoylated GFP in axons and of β-galactosidase (βgal) in nuclei. This strategy made it possible to identify the neurons that expressed Cre recombinase in the <italic>Robo3lox</italic> background. In the inferior olive of <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> E16 embryos (<italic>n</italic> = 3), we found that 87±2% of Brn3.2-positive neurons also expressed βgal, whereas the remaining Brn3.2-positive neurons were completely negative for βgal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). This suggests that Cre is not expressed by all IO neurons in the <italic>Ptf1a::cre</italic> line, and could explain the maintenance of a contralateral contingent of IO axons in <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> animals (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). To find out whether Cre was expressed by spinal cord commissural neurons during midline crossing, we studied βgal and GFP expression in thoracic cross-sections of the spinal cord of E11–E13 <italic>Tau<sup>mGFP</sup></italic> embryos at the level of the forelimbs (<italic>n</italic> = 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g008">Figure 8C–8L</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show that a <italic>Robo3</italic>-conditional allele can be used to genetically disrupt distinct commissural projections and force axons to project ipsilaterally. In all three systems studied here, commissure rewiring induces severe and permanent dysfunction of specific neuronal networks. Unlike surgical ablation of a given commissure, this strategy ends up rewiring commissural neurons on the ipsilateral side, but does not interrupt the activity of the targeted circuit. We show that for the systems studied here, ipsilaterally rerouted axons still connect to their proper targets. Moreover, the fact that human HGPPS patients do not exhibit major motor or cognitive impairments also suggests that the ipsilateral axons are fully functional. However, it is difficult to link the observed behavioral phenotypes exclusively to the loss of contralateral connectivity as there is also a rerouting in the targeting of these neurons that potentially could cause novel and perturbed neuronal signals leading to a defect, which is not caused by the lack of commissural connections per se but rather by the new wiring.</p>
<p>Our results and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Marillat1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Sabatier1">[9]</xref> suggest that Robo3 expression is required for most, if not all, commissural axons to cross the floor plate throughout spinal cord and hindbrain. The persistence of commissural axons that continue to cross the floor plate in domains expected to express cre recombinase in the <italic>Robo3</italic> conditional lines presented here may be explained in a number of ways. In <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> embryos, the few axons crossing at r3 and r5 level may originate from neurons located in adjacent rhombomeres as it is well known that many commissural axons extend rostrally and caudally before crossing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Clarke1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Goulding1">[32]</xref>, and that during development, mixing of neurons from adjacent rhombomeres does occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Birgbauer1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Cambronero1">[34]</xref> (one example is provided by facial branchiomotor neurons that migrate from r4 to r6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Song1">[35]</xref>). Another reason for incomplete rerouting of commissural axons is that Cre recombinase may not be expressed by all r3/r5 neurons, as is the case for IO neurons in <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> knockout. Finally, cre might be expressed too late, after these commissural axons have crossed, an hypothesis we favor to explain the persistence of the ventral subset of commissural axons in the spinal cord of <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> embryos.</p>
<p>Although Robo3 is required for commissures to form in the hindbrain and spinal cord, this receptor is not sufficient for crossing as it is also expressed by many noncommissural neurons in the forebrain and hindbrain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Barber1">[36]</xref>, such as the abducens motor neurons that project ipsilaterally. This opposite behavior of some Robo3-expressing axons could be attributed to a differential expression in commissural/noncommissural axons of Robo3 partners, possibly Robo1 and Robo2, or of a different Robo3 isoform. A recent study has shown that two Robo3 splice variants that differ in their cytoplasmic tail have distinct activities (pro-crossing and anti-crossing) in axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Chen1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>We found that deletion of <italic>Robo3</italic> selectively in two hindbrain rhombomeres, including that comprising the abducens nucleus, yields mice that display selective horizontal eye movement defects reminiscent of those in the human HGPPS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Jen1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Engle1">[15]</xref>. Likewise, zebrafish <italic>Robo3</italic> mutants exhibit oculomotor defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Burgess1">[38]</xref>. Since there is, to the best of our knowledge, no oculomotor center originating from r3, our results in mice indicate that commissural projections from r5, most likely internuclear oculomotor connections, serve to facilitate large amplitude, compensatory eye movements in the horizontal plane. Our results also suggest that the absence of this commissure is one of the primary causes of the eye movement defects in HGPPS patients, who also suffer from a mutation in the <italic>Robo3</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Bosley1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Jen1">[12]</xref>. Accordingly, abducens motor axons project normally in <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>Iox/lox</sup></italic> mice. Moreover, we found that horizontal eye movements are not perturbed in <italic>Islet1::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice, which lack Robo3 in abducens motor neurons (unpublished data). These results do not exclude the possibility that oculomotor defects in HGPPS patients may also involve other supranuclear centers such as the pons and cerebellum, which could henceforth be studied in transgenic mice by deleting Robo3 in appropriate regions using the conditional allele.</p>
<p>We show that in mice, in the absence of Robo3, the aVCN-MNTB projection is entirely uncrossed and that this results in strong defects in ABR. The most striking feature of ABRs in <italic>Krox20::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice is the presence on the ipsilateral side of a much-delayed wave III not followed by any later wave. This abnormal wave III could involve wrongly rewired neurons, and its long delay suggests that the corresponding pathway does not function in a strictly normal manner. Contralaterally, the persistence of waves identifiable as IIIc and IVc may be attributed to crossing pathways originating outside of r3–r5. Although there are species differences in the organization of auditory circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Irving1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Melcher1">[40]</xref>, our results suggest that the trapezoid body could be uncrossed in HGPPS patients, at least partially. It will be of interest to determine whether sound localization is perturbed in HGPPS patients, some of whom also seem to have abnormal ABR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Haller1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Amoiridis1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, HGPPS patients have a hypoplastic pons, an uncrossed corticospinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Jen1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Haller1">[13]</xref>, and most likely uncrossed spinal cord and interolivary commissures. Yet these patients are still coordinated and not ataxic. This contrasts with the severe ataxic gait of <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice. In this mouse line, spinal cord commissures and the corticospinal tract (unpublished data) do not seem to be affected, and among embryonic precerebellar neurons, cre recombinase is only expressed by IO neurons and not by mossy fiber projection neurons. Possibly, a selective reduction of the interolivary commissure results in a more dramatic locomotion impairment than a nonselective rewiring of multiple parts of the motor system in which, presumably, the different parts of the nervous system are ultimately still connected to the correct sides of the other relevant parts. Moreover, the selective reduction of the interolivary commissure in the <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice also results in a stronger locomotion impairment than mice without any cerebellar output (i.e., the <italic>Lurcher</italic> mice). This phenotype of the <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice on the Erasmus Ladder can be explained by the fact that the olivocerebellar system may operate in a push–pull fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-DeZeeuw1">[41]</xref>, because converting the “pull” into a “push” by reversing the modulation of climbing fiber activities should indeed result in a phenotype that is more severe than having no output of the cerebellar cortex at all. Thus, taken together, our results suggest that having only one component of a commissural circuit misrouted and uncrossed may be functionally worse than having all of its components affected or having no output at all.</p>
<p>Many studies have shown that upon entering and crossing the floor plate, commissural axons receive signals that induce major and long-term modification of their behavior and prevent them from re-entering the midline. This is associated with a loss of attraction for netrin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Shirasaki1">[42]</xref> involving DCC silencing and DCC/Robo dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Stein1">[43]</xref>, and an activation of Slit- and Semaphorin-mediated repulsion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Zou1">[44]</xref>. Moreover, there is also evidence that the translation of some axon guidance receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Brittis1">[45]</xref> or their splicing is modulated by floor plate crossing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Chen1">[37]</xref>. However, it was not known if all these molecular changes were required for crossed axons to recognize and follow their correct pathway on the contralateral side and, more importantly, to reach their final target cells. Our results suggest that even in the absence of midline crossing, both olivocerebellar axons and aVCN axons still contact their appropriate target neurons (Purkinje cells and MNTB, respectively), but on the ipsilateral rather than on the contralateral side. These findings raise the possibility that midline crossing in general may not have a major function in axon guidance after crossing, and that its major importance is only to allow, at a physiological level, the integration of inputs coming from both sides of the nervous system. Future studies will have to confirm this at other axial levels and in other phyla like Protostomia.</p>

<title>Mouse Lines</title>
<p>C57BL/6 mice (Janvier) were used for expression studies. Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane (Abbott). The day of vaginal plug is embryonic day 0 (E0), and the day of birth corresponds to postnatal day 0 (P0).</p>
<p>The <italic>Robo3</italic> conditional knockout mouse line was established at the MCI/ICS (Mouse Clinical Institute–Institut Clinique de la Souris, Illkirch, France; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-mci.u-strasbg.fr" xlink:type="simple">http://www-mci.u-strasbg.fr</ext-link>). To generate the <italic>Robo3</italic> conditional knockout, the targeting vector was constructed as follows. Three fragments of 5.1, 1.1, and 3.7 kb (respectively, the 5′, floxed, and 3′ arms) were amplified by PCR using 129S2/SvPas DNA as template and sequentially subcloned in an MCI proprietary vector. This MCI vector has a floxed neomycin resistance cassette. The linearized construct was electroporated in 129S2/SvPas mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. After selection, targeted clones were identified by PCR using external primers and further confirmed by Southern blot with 5′ and 3′ external probes. Two positive ES clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, and derived male chimaeras gave germline transmission. The <italic>Robo3</italic>-null knockout line was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Sabatier1">[9]</xref>. Briefly, it consists on a knock-in of the <italic>GFP</italic> gene into the first exon of <italic>Robo3</italic>, leading to the expression of the GFP by Robo3-expressing cells. However, the GFP signal is too weak to be seen without the use of an anti-GFP antibody. The <italic>Hb9::GFP</italic> mice have a transgene containing a 9-kb-long region of the Hb9 promoter that drives eGFP expression in all postmitotic somatic motor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Wilson1">[18]</xref>. The GFP signal is bright enough to be seen directly. The <italic>Ptf1a::cre</italic> and <italic>Krox20::cre</italic> knock-in lines were previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Voiculescu1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000325-Kawaguchi1">[26]</xref>. Homozygous <italic>Krox20<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> are embryonic lethal and were therefore maintained as heterozygous for Cre.

Unless otherwise mentioned, controls were <italic>Robo3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> animals or double heterozygotes that were always found to be undistinguishable from wild-type mice.

<title>Quantifications</title>
<p>The number of abducens motor neurons was quantified on 20-µm coronal sections of adult hindbrain double labeled with anti-ChAT and anti-Hb9. Neurons were counted on alternating sections and counts multiplied by two to better reflect the total number of neurons in each abducens nucleus.</p>
<p>Di-labeled IO neurons were counted as follows: on every section containing the inferior olive, four confocal optic planes were acquired (two on the contralateral side and two on the ipsilateral side), and only the cells showing circle-shaped DiI labeling were counted as positive (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s008">Figure S8</xref>). The percentage of ipsilateral and contralateral neurons represents the number of ipsilateral- or contralateral-labeled neurons divided by the total number of traced neurons on both sides.</p>
<p>The percentage of (βgal−; Brn3.2+) olivary neurons was calculated as the ratio of (βgal−; Brn3.2+) on (βgal+; Brn3.2+) neurons. Immunolabeled nuclei were counted on 20-µm sections of E16 inferior olives (one section out of five was considered from three embryos).</p>
<p>The number of DiI-labeled calyces of Held were counted from stacked confocal planes (step size: 1.16 µm) encompassing 50 µm of 100-µm vibratome sections, on all the sections containing the MNTB.

In order to test motor performance <italic>Ptf1a::cre;Robo3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and their littermates (<italic>n</italic> = 4) were placed in one of the shelters. After a randomized delay of 9–12 s, the light was turned on in the box, automatically followed after 3 s by an air puff from the pressurized air outlet, encouraging the mice to leave the shelter and walk across the ladder to the shelter on the other side, where the procedure was repeated. The paw placement and overall step time (the time needed to transfer the paw from one sensor to the other) was recorded for each trial in real time using the pressure sensors. One trial was defined as a crossing from one shelter to another. A trial was regarded successful if the mice walked with a consistent pattern, touching the pressure sensors with all paws, and with no disruptions such as rearing, twisting, or turning around. One session consisted of at least 20 trails.</p>

<title>Recordings of Auditory Brainstem-Evoked Responses</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and levomepromazine. ABRs were collected between subcutaneous needle electrodes inserted at the vertex and mastoids on both sides, with the ground electrode in the back (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000325.s013">Text S1</xref>). Sound stimuli were short broadband clicks and frequency-specific tone-bursts (two-period rise–fall, 20-period plateau, frequency 5, 10, 15, 20, 32, and 40 kHz) presented at a repetition rate of 17 per second, the sound level varying in 5-dB steps from 10 to 90 dB SPL (with 0 dB SPL = 2.10<sup>−5</sup> N.m<sup>−2</sup>). The responses from the electrodes were amplified (×100,000), filtered (10–3,000 Hz), digitally converted and averaged (×500) by a computerized data-acquisition system. On the ipsilateral side, wave I reflects the activity of spiral ganglion cells. Later waves II, III, and IV are ascribed to the sequential activation of more and more central neural generators. On the contralateral side, a short latency wave was observed similar to ipsilateral wave I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000325-g006">Figure 6H</xref>), which precluded its being due to the activation of neural pathways contralateral to the stimulus and was thus likely due to remote detection of responses from the ipsilateral spiral ganglion through electrically conductive neck tissues. The total absence of any deflection in the contralateral ABRs at the latency corresponding to ipsilateral wave II indicates that the artifact affecting this short latency contralateral wave did not come into play for later waves.</p>
