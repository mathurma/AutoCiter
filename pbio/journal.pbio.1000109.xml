</abstract><abstract>
<p>Subcutaneous immunization delivers antigen (Ag) to local Ag-presenting cells that subsequently migrate into draining lymph nodes (LNs). There, they initiate the activation and expansion of lymphocytes specific for their cognate Ag. In mammals, the structural environment of secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) is considered essential for the initiation of adaptive immunity. Nevertheless, cold-blooded vertebrates can initiate potent systemic immune responses even though they lack conventional SLTs. The emergence of lymph nodes provided mammals with drastically improved affinity maturation of B cells. Here, we combine the use of different strains of alymphoplastic mice and T cell migration mutants with an experimental paradigm in which the site of Ag delivery is distant from the site of priming and inflammation. We demonstrate that in mammals, SLTs serve primarily B cell priming and affinity maturation, whereas the induction of T cell-driven immune responses can occur outside of SLTs. We found that mice lacking conventional SLTs generate productive systemic CD4- as well as CD8-mediated responses, even under conditions in which draining LNs are considered compulsory for the initiation of adaptive immunity. We describe an alternative pathway for the induction of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), in which Ag-presenting cells sample Ag and migrate into the liver where they induce neo-lymphoid aggregates. These structures are insufficient to support  antibody affinity maturation and class switching, but provide a novel surrogate environment for the initiation of CMI.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Lymph nodes (LNs) are believed to be the most important tissues initiating immune responses by facilitating the activation of T and B lymphocytes. Mice lacking such LNs (called alymphoplastic) are severely immune compromised and resistant to immunizations. We discovered that the immune-deficiency of such alymphoplastic mice is actually not caused by the loss of LNs, but rather by the underlying genetic lesion. Surprisingly, mice lacking all lymph nodes can still mount potent T cell-mediated immune responses. We also discovered that T and B cells have completely different structural requirements for their activation/maturation. Whereas B cells rely on LNs to become efficient antibody-producing cells, T cells can be activated successfully outside of such dedicated tissues. So—in the absence of LNs—antigens delivered by immunization are actively transported into the liver where cellular immunity is initiated. The mammalian fetal liver is responsible for the early formation of blood and immune cells, and we propose that the adult liver can still provide a niche for T cell–antigen encounters. During evolution, T and B cells emerged simultaneously, allowing cold-blooded vertebrates (which lack LNs) to launch adaptive immune responses. The development of LNs in mammals coincided with a drastic improvement in antibody affinity maturation, whereas T cells remain LN-independent to this day.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) are highly organized structures with defined compartments consisting of B and T cell areas. These distinct locations support the rapid circulation and concentration of Ag and the interaction of Ag-presenting cells (APCs) with lymphocytes. Prevailing dogma dictates that only if competent APCs transport Ag into SLTs, an adaptive immune response is initiated; otherwise, the Ag is ignored by the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Zinkernagel1">[1]</xref>. For the initiation of humoral antibody (Ab)-mediated immunity in mammals, the formation of B cell follicles and germinal centers (GCs) appears to be a prerequisite. The dynamic nature of such GCs, including the interaction of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) with B cells and Ag, was recently elegantly demonstrated by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Schwickert1">[2]</xref>. However, in contrast to the B cell-dominated cortex, T cell areas, where T cells encounter mature APCs and their cognate Ag, are structurally ill defined. Whereas intravital confocal microscopy has provided compelling evidence for the capacity of SLTs to host T cell priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Beltman1">[3]</xref>, definitive data supporting their absolute requirement for the initiation of T cell-mediated immunity (CMI) do not exist. In addition, cold-blooded vertebrates lacking conventional SLTs generate potent immune responses upon immunization. However, in the mammalian system, the apparent immunodeficiency of mice that lack SLTs strongly supports the notion that the initiation of effective immune responses requires the dedicated structures provided by SLTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Ochsenbein1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Matsumoto1">[8]</xref>. <italic>Alymphoplasia</italic> (<italic>aly/aly</italic>) mice are characterized by a complete lack of lymph nodes (LNs) and Peyer's patches, and structural alterations of the spleen and thymus due to a point mutation in the NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Shinkura1">[9]</xref>. NIK is vital for the initiation of the noncanonical NFκB cascade, which appears to play a discrete role, for instance, in the function of CD40 and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) signaling in some cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Senftleben1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Yin1">[12]</xref>. <italic>Aly/aly</italic> mice display impaired Ab responses and loss of CMI, demonstrated by their inability to reject allogeneic grafts or tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Ochsenbein1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Shinkura2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Lakkis1">[14]</xref>. The developmental deficits in <italic>aly/aly</italic> mutants are readily explained by the requirement of NIK in LTβR signaling. LTβR is vital for the development of SLTs, and LTβR<sup>−/−</sup> mice display similar developmental defects as do <italic>aly/aly</italic> mice or NIK<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Yin1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Futterer1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we describe that the immunodeficiency of <italic>aly</italic>/<italic>aly</italic> mice is not due to the absence of SLTs, but due to the impact of the underlying genetic defect on cellular immunity. Using different strains of alymphoplastic mice and T cell migration mutants in an experimental paradigm in which the site of Ag-delivery is distant from the site of priming and again distant from the site of inflammation, we can detect both T<sub>H</sub> cell-driven autoimmune disease as well as systemic CTL-mediated antitumor immunity initiated through classical subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization/vaccination independent of SLTs. APCs present at the site of immunization migrate to and select the liver as a natural extra-lymphoid tissue for the initiation of CMI, which we propose to be an evolutionary hard-wired pathway already found in cold-blooded vertebrates. This alternative pathway, undescribed to this day, can potently drive CMI but fails to elicit B cell immunity, indicating that the immunization-induced T cell accumulation within conventional lymphoid organs mainly serves humoral immunity but that CMI can be initiated elsewhere.</p>

<title>Autoimmunity Cannot Be Initiated in <italic>Aly/Aly</italic> Mice</title>
<p>We first sought to determine whether LNs are an absolute requirement for the induction of a complex T<sub>H</sub> cell-driven autoimmune response initiated by the s.c. delivery of auto-Ag. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a B cell-independent, T<sub>H</sub> cell-mediated demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and serves as the animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS). The conversion of T<sub>H</sub> cells from the naive to effector state is vitally dependent on the structures provided by LNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Karrer1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Rennert1">[6]</xref>. Cervical LNs are widely held to constitute the predominant intrinsic priming site for encephalitogenic T cells, based on the observation that these LNs support the expansion of PLP-TcR transgenic (Tg) T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-deVos1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Zhang1">[17]</xref>. However, draining inguinal LNs drive the polyclonal, endogenous T cell population after s.c. immunization with encephalitogenic peptides. To assess the role of SLTs in the transition of T<sub>H</sub> cells from a naive to effector state (T cell priming), we induced EAE in <italic>aly/aly</italic> or <italic>aly/+</italic> mice by s.c. immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide and complete Freud adjuvant (MOG<sub>35–55</sub>/CFA). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows that <italic>aly/aly</italic> mice are completely resistant to EAE compared to <italic>aly/+</italic> control mice (the latter developing normal SLTs as NIK is haplosufficient). To verify the notion that pathogenic T cells cannot be raised in <italic>aly/aly</italic> mice, they were immunized s.c. with MOG<sub>35–55</sub>.

<p>To assess the capacity of LN-less mice to initiate T cell expansion in response to s.c.-delivered Ag, CFSE-labeled TcR Tg T cells (2D2) specific for the encephalitogenic MOG<sub>35–55</sub> peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Bettelli1">[18]</xref> were adoptively transferred into either <italic>aly/aly</italic> or <italic>aly/+</italic> mice prior to immunization with their cognate Ag.

<title>Induction of Productive T Cell Immunity in the Absence of SLTs</title>
<p>The fact that <italic>aly/aly</italic> mice do not develop T cell-driven autoimmune disease could be explained by their inability to prime self-reactive T cells (a) due to the lack of dedicated draining LNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Karrer1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Rennert1">[6]</xref>, or (b) due to a direct impact of the NIK mutation on immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Ishimaru1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Matsumoto2">[20]</xref>. In order to define whether their EAE resistance is due to the lack of LNs or an intrinsic defect of <italic>aly/aly</italic> mice to prime T cells, we generated a series of bone marrow (BM)-chimeric mice. To restrict the NIK mutation to the hematopoietic system, lethally irradiated <italic>aly/+</italic> mice were injected with BM cells from <italic>aly/aly</italic> donor mice <italic>(aly/aly</italic>→<italic>aly/+)</italic>. Conversely, to conserve the developmental structural defects, without the NIK lesion of the hematopoietic compartment, <italic>aly/aly</italic> mice were reconstituted with BM cells of normal <italic>aly/+</italic> donors (<italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/aly)</italic>. As previously reported, spontaneous development of lymphoid tissues in <italic>aly/aly</italic> recipients upon reconstitution was expectedly not detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Karrer2">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we discovered that <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/aly</italic> BM-chimeras were fully susceptible to EAE after s.c. immunization with MOG<sub>35–55</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), clearly demonstrating that s.c. immunization can mount a productive T cell-driven autoimmune response even in the absence of draining LNs. Using the reciprocal approach, by generating <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/+</italic> (WT-NIK immune system and normal SLTs) as well as <italic>aly/aly</italic>→<italic>aly/+</italic> BM-chimeras (NIK-deficient immune system and normal SLTs), we found that the NIK mutation lead to EAE resistance, even when the lymphoreticular compartment is unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This finding clearly demonstrates that the reported immunodeficiency of <italic>aly/aly</italic> mice can largely be explained by the requirement of NIK for the initiation of immunity rather than the lack of LNs. In support of this, we found that unmanipulated LTβR<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which also lack all LNs but have normal NIK function, are also fully susceptible to EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast to T cell activation, we found that B cell activation requires the structural environment provided by SLTs. To investigate the impact of immunization on T versus B cell responses, we used Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as a model of foreign Ag to elicit delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. <italic>Aly/aly</italic> as well as <italic>aly/+</italic> mice were immunized with KLH, and 11 dpi, they were challenged by intradermal injection with KLH into the ear. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, both groups were able to mount a solid DTH reaction measured by ear swelling, which was only marginally lower in <italic>aly/aly</italic> than in <italic>aly/+</italic> mice. However, in contrast to ear swelling, which is indicative of CMI, <italic>aly/aly</italic> mice did not mount Abs against KLH when compared to <italic>aly/+</italic> mice, demonstrating that the development of a humoral immune response is ablated in the absence of lymphoreticular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). We could reproduce functional DTH responses using other Ags including OVA and MOG<sub>35–55</sub> (unpublished data). Similarly, in our EAE paradigm using BM-chimeras, whereas control mice (<italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/+</italic> and <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/+</italic><sup>spl</sup>) elicit high Ab titers, anti-MOG Abs are virtually absent in mice without LNs (either <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/aly</italic> or <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/aly</italic><sup>spl</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>Taken together, and in agreement with the notion that SLTs are vital for B cell activation, highly organized SLTs are obligatory for the generation of high-affinity Igs and class switching, whereas potent cellular immunity can be induced successfully upon s.c. immunization even in the absence of SLTs.</p>

<title>In the Absence of SLTs, Subcutaneously Delivered Ag Is Transported into the Liver</title>
<p>Since the loss of SLTs in <italic>aly</italic> BM-chimeric mice does not hinder the development of T cell immunity, we wanted to determine at which alternative site T cell priming could take place and to which organ the Ag travels from the site of immunization (s.c.). Therefore, <italic>aly</italic> BM-chimeras were injected s.c. with yellow green (YG) carboxylate microspheres emulsified in CFA. At 7 dpi, various organs were isolated and analyzed for the presence of fluorescent cells by flow cytometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows that in control mice (<italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/+</italic>), fluorescently labeled APCs were exclusively detected in LNs upon s.c. immunization. It was previously shown that the BM has the capacity to drive an enriched population of high-affinity TcR Tg T cells in response to blood-borne Ag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Feuerer1">[25]</xref>. As expected, upon intravenous (i.v.) delivery of Ag, the vast majority of it accumulates in the spleen, BM, and liver, regardless of the presence of SLTs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000109.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, after (s.c.) immunization of <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/aly</italic><sup>spl</sup> BM-chimeras lacking SLTs, APCs carrying fluorescent microspheres migrate primarily to the liver and not the other organs analyzed (thymus, CNS, and gut; unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Only a small amount of Ag reaches the liver when draining SLTs are present. Next, we wanted to determine the means of the Ag transport from the s.c. reservoir to the liver. To determine whether the Ag diffuses to the liver or is actively transported by APCs, <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/+</italic> and <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/aly</italic><sup>spl</sup> chimeric mice were separated into two groups. One received YG microspheres/CFA in the left flank and polychromatic red (PR) microspheres/CFA in the right flank. The other group received a mixture of YG- and PR-coupled beads in both flanks (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). After 7 d, mice were sacrificed, perfused, and a single-cell suspension of livers, LNs, and spleens was generated for cytofluorometric analysis. We found that the mixture of PR/YG-coupled beads generated a large proportion of dual-labeled CD11b as well as CD11c-positive APCs. Conversely, the injection of either PR- or YG-coupled microspheres into each flank revealed merely single-labeled APCs in the liver. The presence of single-labeled cells within the liver strongly suggests that the Ag is delivered to the liver by the migration of APCs initially present at the site of immunization. Passive diffusion of the Ag from the site of immunization via the bloodstream to the liver cannot be fully excluded, but is evidently not the dominant means of Ag delivery. In addition, only a negligible amount of Ag reaches the liver when dedicated SLTs are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We could also confirm these findings by using soluble FITC painted on shaved flanks (without the adjuvant CFA). Twenty-four hours after FITC skin painting, we found FITC<sup>+</sup> APCs primarily in the liver, again supporting the notion that the liver can serve as an alternative Ag-presenting site when draining LNs are not available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Extra-Lymphoid Aggregates in the Liver Host T Cell/APC Encounters</title>

<p>In order to demonstrate that the observed lymphocyte accumulations in the liver can support cell expansion, we injected naive (CD62L<sup>+</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from 2D2 Tg mice into <italic>aly</italic> BM-chimeras and subsequently immunized them with MOG<sub>35–55</sub>/CFA.

However, in the absence of SLTs, the livers of <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/aly</italic><sup>spl</sup> BM-chimeric mice are sufficient to propagate Ag-driven T cell expansion and accumulation. In order to confirm that Ag-specific T cell proliferation occurs in situ in the liver, we administered BrdU intraperitoneally (i.p.) into <italic>aly</italic> BM-chimeras 7 dpi with MOG<sub>35–55</sub>/CFA. Thirty minutes after BrdU injections, the mice were sacrificed, and livers were analyzed for proliferating (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by flow cytometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g006">Figure 6D and 6E</xref> reveal the presence of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the livers of both <italic>aly/+→aly/+</italic> and <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/aly</italic><sup>spl</sup> BM-chimeras. The number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> T cells in the liver is increased in <italic>aly/+</italic>→<italic>aly/aly</italic><sup>spl</sup> BM-chimeras compared to the controls. The fact that we found such a rapid (30 min) emergence of proliferating T cells even in normal mice in which SLTs are present, indicates that some degree of liver-initiated CMI occurs simultaneously to the priming within draining LNs.</p>

<title>The Adult Liver Can Support T Cell, But Not B Cell Priming</title>
<p>In contrast to our findings, which show that mice lacking SLTs do not generate high-affinity Ab-responses, intranasal influenza infection of splenectomized LTα<sup>−/−</sup> mice reconstituted with wild-type (wt) stem cells, for instance, can initiate the formation of extra-lymphoid follicles within the lung, which support some degree of B cell maturation and Ab secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-MoyronQuiroz1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-MoyronQuiroz2">[26]</xref>. One possible explanation for these contrasting observations regarding Ab production is that in our case, stroma cells such as FDCs cannot signal through LTβR due to the mutation within NIK and that this could be the reason for our inability to observe GC formation and Ab secretion, whereas Moyron-Quiroz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-MoyronQuiroz1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-MoyronQuiroz2">[26]</xref> used mice in which the stroma compartment can be engaged by LTα/β.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>S.c. immunization instigates a situation in which draining LNs are widely held to be absolutely obligatory for the initiation of adaptive immunity. In the absence of such draining LNs, we found however, that APCs take up the Ag at the site of immunization and subsequently select the liver as an extra-lymphoid environment for the initiation of CMI. These findings are consistent with the propensity of alymphoplastic mice (NIK<sup>−/−</sup>, LTα<sup>−/−</sup>, and LTβR<italic><sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup>) to develop abnormal lymphocytic infiltrates primarily in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Futterer1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Banks1">[29]</xref>. The lymphocyte accumulation seen in the liver of naive alymphoplastic mice does not coincide with any overt tissue damage, nor do they develop any secondary sign of hepatic injury (M. Heikenwaelder, Zurich, Switzerland, personal correspondence). Such surrogate structures are evidently not as sophisticated as true SLTs and fail to support B cell priming, but are clearly sufficient to support CMI. Such neo-lymphoid structures in the liver are not restricted to alymphoplastic mouse strains, but can be reproduced in mice in which T cells do not migrate into the LNs (<italic>plt/plt</italic>). The fact that we observe the rapid emergence of immunization-induced T cell expansion in the liver of normal mice supports the notion that the adult liver provides an efficient niche for the initiation of CMI. Moyron-Quiroz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-MoyronQuiroz2">[26]</xref> elegantly demonstrated that the lymphoid tissue in the lung (BALT) is sufficient to generate immunity against an infectious agent attacking the lung. In their experimental paradigm, peripheral SLTs are not compulsory for the initiation of protective immunity, and they could even observe some degree of B cell maturation. In our report, however, after s.c. immunization, the local APCs must sample the Ag and then actively migrate to and select the liver as a site for T cell priming, which then is even capable of driving autoimmune responses within the CNS. In our experimental paradigm, the site of Ag deposition, priming, and inflammation are distinct. The liver is thus not like the BALT or the NALT, a site where local immune responses can be initiated, but represents a niche for systemic T cell priming under conditions in which the draining LNs are widely held to be absolutely compulsory. The fact that Ag-laden APCs migrate from the site of immunization to the periportal areas in the liver could be explained by the presence of chemoattractive factors in the liver aggregates observed in SLT mutants. Alternatively, the extensive lymphatic network of the liver makes it an ideal niche for the accumulation of leukocytes as a reservoir when regular SLTs are inaccessible.</p>
<p>Although the induction of CMI is not a function traditionally attributed to the adult liver, the fetal liver is a primary lymphoid organ hosting early hematopoiesis. Our findings suggest that the liver has the potential to “remember” its lymphoid function. The phenomenon, that, for instance, food allergies can be transferred by the transplantation of livers from an allergic donor to a previously nonallergic recipient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Legendre1">[30]</xref>, can be explained by our findings. Such transplant-acquired food allergy has only been described for the liver and not for other transplanted organs of the same donor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Legendre1">[30]</xref>. It has been hypothesized that this occurrence is due to donor-derived allergen-specific lymphocytes residing in the liver. In support of this, Klein and Crispe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Klein1">[31]</xref> reported recently that after liver transplantation in a mouse in which Ag presentation was restricted to resident cells of the liver grafts, efficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming can be induced locally in the transplanted liver.</p>
<p>The situation also is reminiscent of the effect of immunizations on some cold-blooded vertebrates that are much more primitive than mammals in their SLT organization (i.e., lacking GCs and showing only minimal affinity maturation). Frog tadpoles (<italic>Alytes obstetricans</italic>) immunized with rabbit serum in CFA developed a large accumulation of lymphocytes in the liver visible 2–3 wk after injection (L. Dupasquier, Basel, Switzerland, personal correspondence). Interestingly, during evolution, the emergence of RAG was permissive for the development of adaptive immunity in jawed fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Flajnik1">[32]</xref>. RAG mediates somatic recombination and is required for the formation of both B and T cell receptors, which appear to have emerged simultaneously during evolution. However, whereas the adaptive immune system is well developed in the oldest jawed vertebrates (cartilaginous fish, e.g., sharks), potent affinity maturation, Ig-class switching, and GC formation are lacking. Class switching only appeared at the time of the divergence of amphibians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Stavnezer1">[33]</xref>. The fact that CMI evolved earlier than modern humoral immune responses corroborates our discovery that T cells can function outside of dedicated lymphoreticular structures.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate that the structural requirements for the initiation of B and T cell responses differ significantly. We found that B cells are dependent on the topography of dedicated lymphoid tissues, whereas CD4<sup>+</sup> as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes retain the capacity to recognize Ag in a structure-independent fashion. This finding has obvious implications for our understanding of adaptive immunity and vaccination. As for the development of autoimmune diseases, our findings show that self-reactive T cells may not need to be primed in tissue-draining LNs, but could occur at the inflammatory site or even in organs distant to the target tissue.</p>
