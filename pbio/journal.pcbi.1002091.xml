        <p>When living systems detect changes in their external environment their response must be measured to balance the need to react appropriately with the need to remain stable, ignoring insignificant signals. Because this is a fundamental challenge of all biological systems that execute programs in response to stimuli, we developed a generalized time-frequency analysis (TFA) framework to systematically explore the dynamical properties of biomolecular networks. Using TFA, we focused on two well-characterized yeast gene regulatory networks responsive to carbon-source shifts and a mammalian innate immune regulatory network responsive to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The networks are comprised of two different basic architectures. Dual positive and negative feedback loops make up the yeast galactose network; whereas overlapping positive and negative feed-forward loops are common to the yeast fatty-acid response network and the LPS-induced network of macrophages. TFA revealed remarkably distinct network behaviors in terms of trade-offs in responsiveness and noise suppression that are appropriately tuned to each biological response. The wild type galactose network was found to be highly responsive while the oleate network has greater noise suppression ability. The LPS network appeared more balanced, exhibiting less bias toward noise suppression or responsiveness. Exploration of the network parameter space exposed dramatic differences in system behaviors for each network. These studies highlight fundamental structural and dynamical principles that underlie each network, reveal constrained parameters of positive and negative feedback and feed-forward strengths that tune the networks appropriately for their respective biological roles, and demonstrate the general utility of the TFA approach for systems and synthetic biology.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Biological systems constantly balance noise suppression with responsiveness. In a fluctuating environment, some changes are insignificant to living cells while others represent cues to which they must respond. These stimuli are interpreted by molecular circuits that enable the cell to strike an appropriate balance between responsiveness and noise suppression. This trade-off is governed by the structure and kinetic parameters of molecular networks, which have been tuned by evolutionary selection for different stimuli and responses. We consider three regulatory circuits (two from yeast and one from mammalian cells), which respond to different environments and involve very different physiological processes. To investigate the responses to a time varying signal, we developed a generalized time-frequency analysis framework for studying such trade-offs using mathematical models of regulatory circuits and explore how the structure and parameters of the circuit affect the trade-offs between noise suppression and responsiveness. The generalized TFA approach represents an effective tool for exploring and analyzing different systems-level dynamical properties. Making use of such properties can facilitate prediction and network control for systems- and synthetic biology applications.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The living cell may be viewed as an information processing system that uses the information in its environment to make decisions and mount appropriate responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Bennett1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Hersen1">[3]</xref>. In this context, cellular systems must strike a balance between being highly responsive to the environment, preserving the necessary details of the signals that they process, while simultaneously exhibiting stability so as to suppress environmental noise that would otherwise confound the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Perkins1">[4]</xref>. Indeed, the trade-off between noise suppression and detail preservation is a fundamental one even in engineered signal processing systems. An optimal system must extract the information from a signal in the presence of noise in order to make the most reliable estimate of some quantity of interest. Similarly, the cell must estimate the state of the extracellular environment from noisy input stimuli. For example, <italic>E. coli</italic> estimate the time derivative of a signal along which they chemotax <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Berg1">[5]</xref>. This estimation is realized by a chemotactic network that essentially implements the Kalman filter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Kalman1">[6]</xref>, which optimally estimates the internal state of a linear dynamical system from a series of noisy measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Andrews1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To discover evolutionarily conserved principles underlying cellular decision making, it is necessary to develop a general understanding of how biomolecular networks implement such trade-offs in terms of information processing, rather than in terms of specific biochemical details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Perkins1">[4]</xref>. Mathematical models of molecular networks make it possible to quantitatively express these trade-offs in terms of input-output characteristics of the network and, in turn, to examine the effects of network topology (i.e., wiring) and parameters governing the interactions within the system.</p>
      <p>The ability of a system to filter out fluctuations or to respond to temporal details in a signal can be captured quantitatively by analyzing the input and output signals in terms of their time and frequency characteristics. For instance, a system that performs smoothing of an input signal acts as a low-pass filter by attenuating high-frequency fluctuations. While frequency selective behavior of linear time-invariant systems is well understood and can be determined completely by knowing the response of the system to a single impulse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Oppenheim1">[8]</xref>, the nonlinear character of biological systems and the highly nonstationary nature of the input stimuli make it generally impossible to decouple system responses from their input signals. Indeed, the ability to quantitatively describe a response of a nonlinear biomolecular network to a transient stimulus, particularly in the context of varying strengths of combinatorial and synergistic regulatory interactions, typified by biological networks, remains a significant challenge.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to explore how different network topologies confer particular system properties such as responsiveness and noise suppression, we developed a generalized time-frequency analysis (TFA) framework for investigating the responses of nonlinear biomolecular networks. The approach entails systematically comparing time-frequency characteristics of inputs (stimuli) and outputs (responses) while varying system parameters. This methodology allows for the exploration and quantitative comparisons of system-level behaviors relative to these parameters.</p>

        <p>We initially examined two yeast systems, the oleate (<italic>OLE</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Smith1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Ratushny1">[10]</xref> and the galactose (<italic>GAL</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Acar1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Ramsey1">[12]</xref> core transcriptional networks in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which both respond to carbon source switching, but do so with very different network topologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The analysis of the spectral response of these systems to time varying inputs of simulated oleate and galactose concentrations makes it possible to study how the circuit structure and parameters in these two systems affect their ability to balance noise suppression with responsiveness. To this end, the time-frequency characteristics of the network input and output signals were extracted from their spectrograms, which are calculated using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Northrop1">[13]</xref>.

The dotted oval arrow denotes activation of galactose transport. (B) Workflow of the generalized TFA. Noisy, time varying stimuli are used as inputs to a model of the network and the response is determined. Input and output signals are transformed into component frequencies by the STFT.

        <p>Characteristics of the signal and the network response can be quantified by integration across all frequency bands. Two characteristics of the networks, <italic>noise suppression</italic> (low-pass filtering) and <italic>responsiveness</italic> (detail preservation), can be inferred from the spectrograms. First, as a measure of circuit noise suppression, the spectrogram coefficients for each frequency band were summed over time and the mean frequency of the signal (μ) was calculated. The noise suppression characteristic (ξ) is defined as a ratio of mean frequencies of the stimulus and the system response (ξ = μ<sup>in</sup>/μ<sup>out</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s001">Figure S1</xref>). A greater ξ corresponds to a system with a greater ability to filter high-frequency input fluctuations. Second, in each frequency band, the relationship between the total variation of the signal power at the output and input of the system serves as a measure of responsiveness. Specifically, the total variation of the spectrogram coefficients within each frequency band (<italic>V<sub>i</sub></italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s001">Figure S1I</xref>) was calculated and the system responsiveness (ρ) is defined as the inverse divergence between distributions of normalized input (<italic>V<sub>i</sub></italic><sup>in*</sup>) and output (<italic>V<sub>i</sub></italic><sup>out*</sup>) variations across all frequency bands. A greater ρ corresponds to a more responsive system.</p>
        <p>To investigate the different features of the <italic>GAL</italic> and <italic>OLE</italic> networks, their noise suppression (ξ) and responsiveness (ρ) characteristics were calculated based on their model-predicted responses to simulated random, noisy time-varying stimuli. The TFA analysis revealed that the two networks have distinct noise suppression and responsiveness properties. The <italic>OLE</italic> network effectively filters high-frequency fluctuations of the stimulus, thus acting as a low-pass filter. At the same time, it is relatively unresponsive to transient stimulus variations. By comparison, the <italic>GAL</italic> network is highly responsive but does not filter high frequency fluctuations as effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, each system exhibits a different noise suppression-responsiveness trade-off, suggesting that these properties have selective advantages in different contexts.</p>

        <p>The shift from glucose to oleate involves a substantial commitment to build and maintain new organelles (peroxisomes) that are responsible for metabolizing the new carbon source (fatty acids) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Platta1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Smith2">[15]</xref>, a switch from fermentative to non-fermentative metabolism (requiring mitochondrial respiration), as well as the coordination of additional responses to the stress associated with exposure to fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Smith1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Koerkamp1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Lockshon1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, the nature of the oleate response demands that the system be capable of filtering high frequency fluctuations of the environmental stimulus, which may otherwise inappropriately commit the cell to significant morphological and metabolic reorganization. By contrast, the switch from glucose to galactose requires relatively few enzymes and transporters to convert galactose into glucose-1P for glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Ren1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Hwang1">[21]</xref>. Thus, while the ability of the cell to be highly responsive to galactose appears to come at the expense of noise suppression, such noise suppression can be sacrificed to a greater extent than during the oleate response.</p>
        <p>A major difference between these networks lies in their topologies. The <italic>GAL</italic> network is comprised of dual positive and negative feedback loops (FBLs) whereas the <italic>OLE</italic> network is comprised of a positive FBL and two (positive and negative) feed-forward loops (FFLs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). By removing coherent positive and negative FFLs (Adr1p and Oaf3p nodes) and leaving only the positive FBL (on <italic>PIP2</italic>), the ensemble of the calculated TFA statistics resembles that of the <italic>GAL</italic> network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To investigate how topology of the <italic>OLE</italic> network contributes to noise suppression and responsiveness of the system, different configurations of the <italic>OLE</italic> network were explored. Density distributions of the ξ and ρ for <italic>adr1</italic>Δ-, <italic>oaf3</italic>Δ-, “no positive feedback”-, “no positive feedback”-<italic>adr1</italic>Δ- and “no positive feedback”-<italic>oaf3</italic>Δ- <italic>OLE</italic> networks were calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s004">Figures S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s007">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s017">Table S4</xref>). The “no positive feedback”-<italic>OLE</italic> model represents the <italic>OLE</italic> network where Pip2p does not upregulate its own gene <italic>PIP2</italic> but upregulates only its target genes.</p>
        <p>The distributions of the TFA characteristics for the <italic>adr1</italic>Δ- and <italic>oaf3</italic>Δ-<italic>OLE</italic> models reveal that both Adr1p and Oaf3p individually increase the noise suppression and decrease the responsiveness of the <italic>OLE</italic> network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s006">Figures S6D, S6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s007">S7D and S7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s017">Table S4</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>oaf3</italic>Δ-<italic>OLE</italic> model has an even more narrowed noise suppression distribution with a lower mean ξ value than the <italic>adr1</italic>Δ<italic>oaf3</italic>Δ-<italic>OLE</italic> model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s017">Table S4</xref>). The distributions of the ξ and ρ for the “no positive feedback”-<italic>OLE</italic> show that the Pip2p positive feedback decreases noise suppression and increases responsiveness of the <italic>OLE</italic> network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s006">Figures S6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s007">S7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s017">Table S4</xref>). The responsiveness/noise suppression “TFA clouds” for the “no positive feedback”-<italic>adr1</italic>Δ-<italic>OLE</italic> and “no positive feedback”-<italic>oaf3</italic>Δ-<italic>OLE</italic> models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s004">Figures S4G and H</xref>) are similar to the “TFA clouds” for the <italic>adr1</italic>Δ- and <italic>oaf3</italic>Δ-<italic>OLE</italic> models. This demonstrates that Adr1p and Oaf3p have more dominant contributions to the noise suppression and responsiveness characteristics than the Pip2p positive feedback. Overall these results reflect the nonlinear relationships between regulators in this regulatory network and suggest that the positive and negative FFLs of the <italic>OLE</italic> network serve to filter high frequency environmental fluctuations.</p>
        <p>To examine how the noise suppression and responsiveness TFA characteristics depend on the type of random time-varying stimuli, the distributions of the ξ and ρ were calculated separately for each of the stimulus types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s005">Figures S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s006">S6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s007">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s017">Table S4</xref>). The distribution of the noise suppression characteristic for the random sinusoidal stimuli is shifted toward higher values of ξ compared to the random “block” and “saw” stimuli regardless of the network type. This suggests that all of the biomolecular systems investigated here have a greater ability to suppress the noise of smoothed (random “sinusoidal”) rather than more abrupt (random “block” or “saw”) stimuli. The distribution of the responsiveness characteristic for the random sinusoidal stimuli is shifted toward lower values of ρ for the WT-, “no positive feedback”-<italic>OLE</italic> models and higher for WT-<italic>GAL</italic> and <italic>oaf3</italic>Δ-, “no positive feedback”-<italic>oaf3</italic>Δ- and <italic>adr1</italic>Δ<italic>oaf3</italic>Δ-<italic>OLE</italic> models compared to the random “block” and “saw” signals. The results indicate that the time-frequency characteristics of a biomolecular network does indeed depend on the nature of the stimulus, further supporting the approach of exploring the network responses to a large ensemble of random time-varying stimuli.</p>
        <p>To understand the responsiveness and noise suppression properties of networks, typified by the interlinked positive and negative FBLs of the <italic>GAL</italic> network and the interlinked negative and positive FFLs of the <italic>OLE</italic> network, the parameters corresponding to the strengths of the FFLs and FBLs were systematically altered. The strength of each loop was independently varied (2,642 parameter sets in total) and each parameter set was explored with 100 randomized model inputs. The noise suppression and responsiveness characteristics of the networks as a function of network parameters were determined by TFA and displayed as heat maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The resulting “portraits” expose fundamental differences inherent to each of the networks and demonstrate how network dynamics can be predicted for these and evolutionarily conserved networks.</p>

        <p>For the <italic>OLE</italic> network, TFA revealed that network behavior is characterized by appropriately tuned opposing positive and negative FFLs. The network is maximally stable along the arc-like front shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. Increasing the strengths of the positive and/or negative FFLs above this front results in non-physiological responses, characterized by a reversed directionality of the output relative to the input signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Decreasing the strengths of these FFLs below the front results in lowered noise suppression at the expense of increased system responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g003">Figure 3</xref>). As might be expected for a nonlinear system, an increase in noise suppression may not be reflected by a corresponding decrease in responsiveness of the same magnitude and vice versa. While the arc-shaped front represents the range of parameters where the noise suppression and responsiveness characteristics are similar to the wild-type (WT) state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s010">Figures S10A and S10B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s018">Table S5</xref>), there are other trade-offs as parameters vary along this arc; for example, the amplitude of the response changes as a function of the strengths of the positive and negative FFLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>
        <p>By contrast, the dual negative and positive FBL in the <italic>GAL</italic> network is highly responsive over a broad range of parameters extending along the diagonal from the left bottom corner of the heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The strengths of positive and negative FBLs can be varied over an extensive parameter range, while maintaining near WT responsiveness and noise suppression, indicating a remarkable level of robustness of the system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s010">Figures S10C and S10D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s018">Table S5</xref>). Indeed, while the <italic>GAL</italic> network does have the capacity to act as a low-pass filter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Bennett1">[1]</xref>, a significant deviation from WT parameters would be required for this system to reach the effectiveness of the <italic>OLE</italic> network in terms of low-pass filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Based on these simulations, decreasing the strength of the negative FBL with the fixed strength of the positive FBL, would increase the noise suppression of the network and decrease its responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate how the TFA portraits depend on the type of random time-varying stimuli, the heat maps presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g003">Figure 3</xref> were split into three separate heat maps, each of which represents an averaged ξ/ρ over 33/34/33 random “block”/sinusoidal/“saw” stimuli. The separated heat maps for the <italic>OLE</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s011">Figure S11</xref>) and the <italic>GAL</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s012">Figure S12</xref>) models show similar patterns within each model for different types of stimuli; however, the ranges of ξ and ρ values (as the strengths of FFLs and FBLs are changed) differ depending on type of stimulus. For example, the difference between maximum and minimum ξ and ρ values of the “sinusoidal” heat maps is greater compared to the “block” or “saw” stimuli regardless of the network. This analysis highlights that TFA portraits (in this case, the projection onto the plane of positive and negative FFL/FBL strengths) tend to be robust to changes in stimulus type in terms of the patterns of ξ and ρ changes in the parameter space (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s011">Figures S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s012">S12</xref>).</p>

        <title>The LPS-induced regulatory network in macrophages</title>
        <p>To investigate the extent to which overall network architecture (versus biochemical parameters) defines the dynamical properties of a system, we examined the LPS and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-induced regulatory circuit from mouse macrophages by TFA, which, like the <italic>OLE</italic> network, is characterized by overlapping positive and negative coherent FFLs. In this regulatory network NF-κB, ATF3 and C/EBPδ transcription factors coordinate the expression of cytokine encoding target genes in response to LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Litvak1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The network is also interesting because it must be tightly regulated to respond vigorously to the presence of a pathogen, but at the same time must remain in check to avoid uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Analogously to the <italic>OLE</italic> and <italic>GAL</italic> models, the behavior of the LPS-induced network model was initially investigated in the wild-type state in the presence of 3000 random and noisy stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s004">Figures S4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s006">S6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s007">S7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s017">Table S4</xref>).

The network is comprised of overlapping positive and negative (coherent type 1 and type 2) feed-forward loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Mangan1">[24]</xref> in which LPS indirectly activates core transcription factors (NF-κB and ATF3) which regulate combinatorially target genes, such as the transcription factor C/EBPδ, interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 6 (TNFAIP6), Ccl3 chemokine and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Litvak1">[22]</xref>.

Each point on the heat maps represents the averaged ξ and ρ, respectively, over 100 random and noisy stimuli (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s013">Figure S13</xref>).

        </fig>
        <p>Similarly to the <italic>OLE</italic> model, the strength of each FFL of the LPS-induced network was independently varied and each parameter set was explored with 100 randomized model inputs. The heat maps of the TFA characteristics resulting from this simulation were significantly different from those of the <italic>OLE</italic> network emphasizing that the network architecture itself is not sufficient to define the dynamical characteristics of the system. Indeed, while the <italic>OLE</italic> network appears tuned toward greater noise suppression, the LPS network appears to be tuned to lie at the boundary of responsiveness and noise suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g004">Figures 4B, 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s010">S10E, S10F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002091.s013">S13</xref>). This is perhaps not surprising considering that macrophages must be finely tuned to respond to the presence of a foreign substance, yet if cellular responses vary dramatically with the character of the signal, variations in cytokine release has the potential to lead to inappropriate inflammatory responses.</p>
        <p>The ability to be poised at the boundary of responsiveness and stability is a hallmark of systems operating in a critical regime between order and disorder. A recent study of mouse macrophages stimulated with a variety of pathogen associated molecular patterns provided evidence that macrophages gene expression dynamics are indeed critical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002091-Nykter1">[23]</xref>, supporting the conclusions drawn from the TFA analysis.</p>
        <p>Deviation from the parameters that define the wild-type network has a dramatic effect on the network behavior. Increasing the strength of LPS/TLR4/NFkB activation from the WT state increases the noise suppression of the network, but at the cost of reducing responsiveness. Similarly, decreasing the strength of the activating arm increases responsiveness, but at the cost of reducing noise suppression. Changing the strength of ATF3 repression leads to an opposite pattern with less dramatic changes in network behavior. Thus, altering the strength of either the positive or negative FFLs leads to networks that are predicted to change the finely tuned balance between noise suppression and responsiveness that is critical to a controlled inflammatory response.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>While experimental tools of systems biology allow us to discern molecular network structures, it is evident that the parameters governing the interactions within the system are essential for understanding its dynamics. However, in most cases, one has only partial knowledge of the parameter values in the system, with many parameters being either entirely undetermined or known only imprecisely. The generalized TFA framework is particularly useful in such scenarios as it can reveal various aspects of dynamical system behavior such as noise suppression, responsiveness, and their trade-offs, relative to the parameter space of the system. Moreover, other dynamical properties of a network can be investigated in the same manner by extracting appropriate features from the time-frequency representations or other metrics for features such as noise suppression and responsiveness can readily be incorporated and compared in the TFA framework. Additionally, the generalized TFA framework is not constrained by the STFT; wavelets or other multiresolution or multiscale analysis approaches can also be used for time-frequency representations. The noise suppression and responsiveness portraits of the <italic>OLE</italic>, the <italic>GAL</italic> and the LPS-induced networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002091-g004">4B and 4C</xref>) reveal radically different behaviors and biological roles for these circuits. Such portraits can also suggest new avenues for experimental research in synthetic biology aimed at modulating the biochemical properties of the interactions to affect systems-level trade-offs, while maintaining physiologically viable responses.</p>
