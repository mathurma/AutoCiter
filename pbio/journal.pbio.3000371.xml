<abstract>
<p>Inhibitory glycinergic transmission in adult spinal cord is primarily mediated by glycine receptors (GlyRs) containing the α1 subunit. Here, we found that α1<sup>ins</sup>, a longer α1 variant with 8 amino acids inserted into the intracellular large loop (IL) between transmembrane (TM)3 and TM4 domains, was expressed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, distributed at inhibitory synapses, and engaged in negative control over nociceptive signal transduction. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) specifically suppressed α1<sup>ins</sup>-mediated glycinergic transmission and evoked pain sensitization. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was critical for mGluR5 to inhibit α1<sup>ins</sup>. By binding to a D-docking site created by the 8-amino–acid insert within the TM3–TM4 loop of α1<sup>ins</sup>, the active ERK catalyzed α1<sup>ins</sup> phosphorylation at Ser380, which favored α1<sup>ins</sup> ubiquitination at Lys379 and led to α1<sup>ins</sup> endocytosis. Disruption of ERK interaction with α1<sup>ins</sup> blocked Ser380 phosphorylation, potentiated glycinergic synaptic currents, and alleviated inflammatory and neuropathic pain. These data thus unraveled a novel, to our knowledge, mechanism for the activity-dependent regulation of glycinergic neurotransmission.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord, retina, brain stem, and other brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref002">2</xref>]. Glycinergic inhibition plays an important role in the modification of motor and sensory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref003">3</xref>]. Four α subunits (α1–α4) and one β subunit have, to date, been identified to form pentameric GlyRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref004">4</xref>]. These subunits display spatiotemporal distribution and assign distinct biological properties to GlyRs. The protein level of the α2 subunit in the spinal cord declines rapidly after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref004">4</xref>]. In adulthood, the vast majority of glycinergic transmission is generated by those GlyRs containing the α1 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref005">5</xref>]. The GlyR α3 subunit also contributes to spinal glycinergic transmission, albeit to a lesser extent than α1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref005">5</xref>]. Alternative splicing can generate two variants for each α subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref002">2</xref>]. α1<sup>ins</sup> is a longer variant of the α1 subunit with 8 amino acids inserted into the intracellular large loop (IL) between transmembrane (TM)3 and TM4 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref006">6</xref>]. α1<sup>ins</sup> is expressed in the adult spinal cord and brain stem and is estimated to account for more than 30% of total α1 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref006">6</xref>]. However, the functional significance of this splice variant remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Glycinergic transmission in the spinal cord dorsal horn negatively controls the excitability and responsiveness of nociceptive neurons. The reduced glycinergic inhibition is widely considered as a key contributor to central sensitization of nociceptive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref007">7</xref>]. The activity-dependent regulation of GlyRs number on plasma membrane and postsynaptic sites represents an important way to modulate inhibitory synaptic strength and plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref008">8</xref>]. The intracellular trafficking process of GlyRs is precisely controlled by posttranslational modifications. Protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate GlyRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref011">11</xref>], which either depresses or boosts glycinergic currents through mechanisms involving the altered receptor endocytosis, exocytosis, and lateral diffusion on plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition to phosphorylation, ubiquitination has also been implicated in the modification of endocytosis and surface expression of GlyRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are Gq/11-protein–coupled receptors that include two subtypes, mGluR1 and mGluR5. Activation of Group I mGluRs triggers multiple intracellular signaling cascades and causes long-lasting changes of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in several brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref014">14</xref>]. mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity correlates with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and pathological pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref014">14</xref>]. Here, we found that brief stimulation of mGluR5 in spinal cord dorsal horn suppressed glycinergic transmission through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the GlyR α1<sup>ins</sup> variant. We provided evidence that the removal of α1<sup>ins</sup>-mediated glycinergic inhibition contributed to inflammatory pain.</p>

<title>Activation of mGluR5 attenuated glycinergic transmission through ERK signaling</title>
<p>The inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) mediated by GlyRs were recorded in lamina II neurons within the spinal cord slices of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref015">15</xref>]. Extracellular application of a selective Group I mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (10 μM) for 3 min induced a rapid reduction of GlyR-IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This synaptic depression was specific to glycinergic responses because the same DHPG treatment generated no changes in the amplitudes of γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>)-receptor–mediated IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Group I mGluRs consist of two subtypes: mGluR1 and mGluR5. To determine which subtype was responsible for DHPG action, we pretreated the slices with selective mGluR1 antagonist CPCCOEt or mGluR5 antagonist 6-Methyl-2-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP) before DHPG application. CPCCOEt (100 μM) did not block the inhibitory effect of DHPG on glycinergic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In the presence of mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (10 μM), however, DHPG lost the ability to suppress the synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To confirm the role of mGluR5, we extracellularly applied a selective mGluR5 agonist α-amino-2-chloro-5-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid (CHPG) (100 μM), finding that CHPG perfusion for 3 min mimicked the action of DHPG by causing a significant reduction of GlyR-IPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>mGluR5 typically relays the signaling from Gq protein to Protein Kinase C (PKC). When G protein was inhibited by intracellular loading of nonhydrolyzable GDP analog Guanosine 5′-O-(2-Thiodiphosphate) (GDP-β-S) (500 μM) through recording pipettes, CHPG still depressed glycinergic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (10 μM) or 2-{8-[(Dimethylamino)methyl]-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrido[1,2-a]indol-3-yl}-3-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)maleimide (Ro-32-0432) (3 μM) also failed to block the inhibitory effect of CHPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Since mGluR5 can stimulate ERK signaling in a manner independent of Gq protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref017">17</xref>], we tested the potential role of ERK by intracellular introduction of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U-0126 (5 μM) or 2ʹ-Amino-3ʹ-methoxyflavone (PD98059) (20 μM). Our data showed that both U-0126 and PD98059 blocked CHPG from inhibiting GlyR-IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), suggesting that the reduction of glycinergic currents by mGluR5 was attributed to ERK activation.</p>
<p>The regulated synaptic transmission might result from the decrease of presynaptic glycine release or hypofunction of postsynaptic receptors. Previous studies have implicated that prolonged activation (&gt;10 min) of mGluR1/5 by DHPG can stimulate spinal excitatory interneurons to produce endocannabinoids, which act as retrograde messengers to stimulate Type-1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors expressed at inhibitory nerve terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref018">18</xref>]. CB1 receptor activation reduces presynaptic glycine release and inhibits GlyR-IPSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref018">18</xref>]. Here, we found that pretreatment with CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (5 μM) for 30 min did not block the reduction of GlyR-IPSCs caused by brief DHPG application (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s002">S1 Fig</xref>), suggesting that short DHPG treatment was not sufficient to produce endocannabinoids. Rather, our data showed that postsynaptic loading of U-0126 or PD98059 eliminated the inhibitory effect of mGluR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), implicating a postsynaptic origin. To verify this result, we elicited the whole-cell glycinergic currents by a brief puff (5 s) of exogenous glycine (1 mM) onto the recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Extracellular application of DHPG for 3 min noticeably decreased the amplitudes of GlyR currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), which were blocked by intracellularly loaded U-0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Comparison of paired-pulse ratios of GlyR-IPSCs revealed no significant changes before and after DHPG exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g001">Fig 1H</xref>), suggesting that mGluR5/ERK signaling suppressed the function or number of GlyRs on postsynaptic membrane.</p>

<title>GlyR α1<sup>ins</sup> subunit was the specific target for mGluR5 regulation</title>

Puffer application of glycine (1 mM, 10 ms) evoked robust membrane currents in cells expressing either α1 or α1<sup>ins</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Activation of mGluR5a by DHPG did not affect the peak currents mediated by α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). However, α1<sup>ins</sup> currents were potently inhibited by DHPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). As was seen in spinal slices, intracellular loading of MEK inhibitor U-0126 (5 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) or PD98059 (20 μM; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s003">S2 Fig</xref>) blocked DHPG from depressing α1<sup>ins</sup> currents.

We also investigated the effect of DHPG on GlyR α3L subunit, a longer α3 variant involved in pain modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref019">19</xref>], and found no reduction of α3L currents after DHPG exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<title>Role of α1<sup>ins</sup> in spinal nociceptive processing</title>
<p>To date, little is known about the biological properties of α1<sup>ins</sup>. To address this issue, we developed a rabbit antibody against α1<sup>ins</sup> (anti-α1<sup>ins</sup>).

<p>Next, we designed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against mouse α1<sup>ins</sup> (shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup>) to reveal α1<sup>ins</sup> function. In transfected HEK293T cells, shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> specifically reduced the protein level of α1<sup>ins</sup> without any influence on that of α1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s005">S4A Fig</xref>). We injected the adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> in the dorsal horn of mice and recorded GlyR-mediated miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) in acute slices after 28 days. GFP fluorescence was restricted to the injected side and spread rostrocaudally for about 0.5 mm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s005">S4B Fig</xref>). Compared to negative control shRNA (NC), selective knockdown of α1<sup>ins</sup> in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s005">S4C Fig</xref>) decreased the amplitudes of GlyR-mIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The frequencies of GlyR-mIPSCs displayed no significant difference between shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup>– and NC-injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), suggesting a functional involvement of postsynaptic α1<sup>ins</sup> in basal glycinergic transmission. Behavioral tests demonstrated that the mice developed mechanical pain hypersensitivity at days 7–28 after shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). A similar sensitization was observed for heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) and cold stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) after α1<sup>ins</sup> knockdown. shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> did not cause motor impairment, as evidenced by the similar performance of NC- and shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup>–injected mice on an accelerating rotarod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g003">Fig 3G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref003">3</xref>]. We then examined the expression of c-fos, a marker of neuronal activation. Compared to NC, shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> significantly increased the number of c-fos–positive soma at day 28 post-viral injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g003">Fig 3H</xref>), suggesting that the synaptic inhibition generated by α1<sup>ins</sup> was constitutively active in the negative control over neuronal excitability.</p>
<p>To examine whether mGluR5 inhibited glycinergic transmission by specific down-regulation of α1<sup>ins</sup> function ex vivo, we recorded GlyRs-IPSCs in neurons expressing shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup>. Knockdown of α1<sup>ins</sup> blocked DHPG from reducing the amplitudes of GlyRs-IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g003">Fig 3I</xref>), while NC had no effect on the synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). To confirm the specificity of DHPG in the inhibition of α1<sup>ins</sup>, we designed shRNA to knock down α3 subunit (shRNA-α3). Viral expression of shRNA-α3 reduced the protein level of α3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s006">S5A Fig</xref>), with that of α1 or α1<sup>ins</sup> unaltered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s006">S5A Fig</xref>).

<title>ERK interacted with α1<sup>ins</sup></title>
<p>For many kinases, the full access to substrates has been deemed a key step to achieve their specificity in biological regulation. Since mGluR5 inhibited glycinergic responses through ERK, we tested whether this kinase physically interacted with α1<sup>ins</sup>. From lysates of transfected HEK293T cells, anti-ERK antibody precipitated α1<sup>ins</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) rather than α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting the specificity of ERK binding to α1<sup>ins</sup>. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments from spinal cord dorsal horn illustrated that ERK antibody pulled down GlyRs α1<sup>ins</sup> and β subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), while α3 was undetectable in ERK precipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) fusion of IL of α1<sup>ins</sup> (GST-α1<sup>ins</sup>-IL) also precipitated ERK from lysates of spinal cord slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). By comparison, GST-fused IL of α1 (GST-α1-IL) did not interact with ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). DHPG (10 μM) treatment of slices for 3 min enabled GST-α1<sup>ins</sup>-IL to precipitate more ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). This increased binding was not due to altered ERK expression because there was no change of total ERK protein level after DHPG application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Since DHPG increased ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), we examined whether α1<sup>ins</sup> associated with the active ERK.

GST-α1<sup>ins</sup>-IL exhibited a high affinity for His-<italic>p</italic>ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Such an interaction was not observed when GST or GST-α1-IL was incubated with His-<italic>p</italic>ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). His-<italic>p</italic>ERK2 also failed to interact with GST-α3L-IL and GST-β-IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), which harbored the ILs of the α3L and β subunits, respectively. By using nonphosphorylated His-ERK2, we found that none of the GlyR subunits bound to the inactive ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>The α1<sup>ins</sup> subunit differed from α1 only by the spliced insert of 8 amino acids in the IL. The specific α1<sup>ins</sup>/ERK interaction implicated that the spliced insert might be essential for ERK binding. Many proteins have been shown to interact with ERK through a consensus D-docking site (R/K-X<sub>2-6</sub>-Φ-X-Φ, in which Φ represents a hydrophobic amino acid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref021">21</xref>]. By analyzing the amino-acid sequence of α1<sup>ins</sup>, we found that the insertion of 8 amino acids (SPMLNLFQ) created a putative D-docking site. We therefore tested whether a synthetic peptide (FRRKRRHHKSPMLNLFQE), which encompassed the putative D-docking site, competed with α1<sup>ins</sup> for ERK binding. This α1<sup>ins</sup>-derived peptide (pep-α1<sup>ins</sup>) was made cell permeable by addition of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 TAT sequence (referred to as TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup>). In the absence of TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup>, GST-α1<sup>ins</sup>-IL effectively pulled down His-ERK2 from lysates of HEK293T cells coexpressing constitutively active MEK1(S218D/S222D) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Incubation with TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> dose-dependently reduced the content of His-ERK2 pulled down by GST-α1<sup>ins</sup>-IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). A TAT-fused scrambled peptide (referred to as TAT-Scram) had no effect even at the high dose of 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). These data suggested that the D-docking site of α1<sup>ins</sup> mediated the binding to ERK. To consolidate this result, we performed coimmunoprecipitation ex vivo. Spinal DHPG (10 nmol, 10 min) application enhanced ERK interaction with α1<sup>ins</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). Pretreatment with TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> (200 pmol) for 30 min disturbed α1<sup>ins</sup>/ERK interaction, whereas TAT-Scram had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether ERK binding resulted in α1<sup>ins</sup> inhibition, we introduced TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> (5 μM) into HEK293T cells that expressed α1<sup>ins</sup> and mGluR5a. TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> blocked DHPG from suppressing α1<sup>ins</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). In contrast, TAT-Scram (5 μM) did not affect DHPG-induced α1<sup>ins</sup> inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). In spinal slices, postsynaptic loading of TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> also prevented DHPG from suppressing GlyR-IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). In the presence of TAT-Scram, however, a significant reduction of GlyRs-IPSCs was elicited by DHPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g004">Fig 4K</xref>). These data suggested that mGluR5 regulation of glycinergic currents relied on ERK/α1<sup>ins</sup> interaction.</p>

<title>ERK phosphorylated α1<sup>ins</sup> at Ser380</title>
<p>Because ERK associated with and inhibited α1<sup>ins</sup>, we hypothesized that this kinase might act to phosphorylate α1<sup>ins</sup>. In the cytoplasmic region of α1<sup>ins</sup>, there are only two serine–proline motifs, <sup>380</sup>SP and <sup>326</sup>SP, which served as the potential phosphorylation sites by proline-directed ERK kinase. To investigate whether these two serine residues regulated α1<sup>ins</sup> function, we constructed α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380A) and α1<sup>ins</sup>(S326A) mutants in which Ser380 and Ser326 were substituted with alanine, respectively. In HEK293T cells, these mutants responded to exogenously applied glycine with large membrane currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). DHPG stimulation of coexpressed mGluR5a reduced the peak amplitudes of α1<sup>ins</sup>(S326A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380A)-expressing cells, however, the inhibitory effect of DHPG was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), suggesting the importance of Ser380 in the regulation of α1<sup>ins</sup> currents.</p>

<p>To identify the exact phosphorylation site on α1<sup>ins</sup>, we incubated GST-α1<sup>ins</sup>-IL for 30 min with lysates of HEK293T cells coexpressing MEK1(S218D/S222D) and His-ERK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref022">22</xref>]. The GST protein was then isolated for mass spectrometry. This approach identified Ser380 as a novel, to our knowledge, phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We raised a rabbit phosphorylation-state–specific antibody against Ser380 on α1<sup>ins</sup> (referred to as pS380-Ab). When Myc-tagged α1<sup>ins</sup> was immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293T cells, the pS380-Ab detected a weak phosphorylation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). DHPG activation of co-transfected mGluR5a significantly enhanced the level of Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). When Ser380 was mutated to alanine, the pS380-Ab signal was totally abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether ERK was the kinase that catalyzed Ser380 phosphorylation, we conducted the kinase assays in vitro. In the absence of active ERK, pS380-Ab did not detect any phosphorylation signal on GST-α1<sup>ins</sup>-IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Incubation with purified His-<italic>p</italic>ERK2 noticeably elevated the phosphorylation level of GST-α1<sup>ins</sup>-IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). This phosphorylation was eliminated by Ser380 mutation to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The addition of TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> in the reaction buffer also inhibited GST-α1<sup>ins</sup>-IL phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), implying that Ser380 was the amino-acid residue that was directly phosphorylated by ERK. We then examined α1<sup>ins</sup> phosphorylation in spinal dorsal horn. The protein band recognized by pS380-Ab ex vivo predominantly migrated at 55 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). To confirm the specificity of pS380-Ab, we incubated the antibody with excess immunizing antigen before western blot or treating the immunoblots with alkaline phosphatase, finding that both of them erased pS380 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Intrathecal application of DHPG enhanced pS380-Ab signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5F</xref>) and meanwhile evoked spontaneous nociceptive behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Pretreatment with TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> not only inhibited Ser380 phosphorylation induced by DHPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5F</xref>) but also alleviated the nociceptive behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). We found that knockdown of α1<sup>ins</sup> by intraspinal injection of AAV encoding shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> mimicked DHPG by eliciting spontaneous pain behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). It was noteworthy that intrathecal application of DHPG at day 21 post-viral injection enhanced the nociceptive behaviors to a lesser degree in shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> mice than in NC-injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). The maximum nociceptive responses observed at 5 min post-DHPG were only 183.2 ± 35.2% of pre-DHPG values in shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> mice compared to 915.5 ± 301.2% in NC mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002 relative to shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> mice, Mann–Whitney U test, <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice/group), suggesting that the painful responses elicited by shRNA-α1<sup>ins</sup> partially occluded DHPG action. These results confirmed that down-regulation of α1<sup>ins</sup> function was one of the important ways for mGluR5 to sensitize the nociceptive behaviors.</p>

<title>Ser380 phosphorylation induced the ubiquitination and endocytosis of α1<sup>ins</sup></title>
<p>As mentioned above, the polypeptide detected by pS380-Ab migrated at 55 kDa in the spinal dorsal horn compared to 48 kDa of intact α1<sup>ins</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that GlyR α1 subunit can be ubiquitinated when expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref013">13</xref>], which causes about a 7-kDa upward mobility shift. Our data showed that spinal α1<sup>ins</sup> was also a ubiquitinated protein, with the apparent molecular size of 55 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Ubiquitin (Ubi) modification of α1<sup>ins</sup> was activity-dependent. Stimulation of mGluR5 significantly enhanced α1<sup>ins</sup> ubiquitination level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). When ERK was inhibited by U-0126, DHPG-induced α1<sup>ins</sup> ubiquitination was substantially repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). A similar inhibition was also observed when TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> was used to disturb ERK/α1<sup>ins</sup> interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). These data raised the possibility that Ser380 phosphorylation might favor α1<sup>ins</sup> ubiquitination. To test this, we expressed Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>, Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380A), or Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380D) in neurons along with GlyR β subunit. The nonphosphorylatable Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380A) inhibited, whereas phospho-mimicking Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380D) occluded, the stimulatory effect of DHPG on Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), suggesting that Ser380 phosphorylation facilitated the conjugation of Ubi to α1<sup>ins</sup>.</p>

<p>There are 10 potential ubiquitination sites (lysine residues) within the IL of α1<sup>ins</sup>. We used DHPG to treat neurons expressing Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>/β subunits and immunoprecipitated Myc protein for mass spectrometry. This method identified Lys379 as a ubiquitinated site on Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Mutation of Lys379 to arginine attenuated the basal ubiquitination of Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) and blocked DHPG from enhancing α1<sup>ins</sup> ubiquitination level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Lys379 mutation did not eliminate the Ubi signal completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), suggesting that Lys379 was the major but not the sole site for Ubi modification.</p>
<p>The ubiquitinated cargos on plasma membrane can be recognized by endocytic machinery, which is a critical step for the initiation of endocytic process. By performing coimmunoprecipitation in cultured neurons, we found a physical interaction of Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> with epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 (Eps15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), one of the key endocytic components that recruit the ubiquitinated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref023">23</xref>]. Importantly, the molecular interaction of Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> with Eps15 was regulated by Ser380 phosphorylation. Compared to Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>, Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380A) pulled down less Eps15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). In contrast, the Eps15 contents precipitated by Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380D) were higher than those by Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). When Lys379 was mutated to arginine, the interaction between Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380D) and Eps15 was attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Immunocytochemical analysis showed that shRNA knockdown of Eps15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s007">S6A Fig</xref>) prevented the decrease of surface Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> expression induced by DHPG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s007">S6B Fig</xref>). To directly examine whether Ser380 phosphorylation led to α1<sup>ins</sup> endocytosis, we transfected Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> or Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup>(S380A) along with GlyR β subunit in neurons. DHPG induced a marked increase of internalized Myc-α1<sup>ins</sup> immunoreactivity when compared to media control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g006">Fig 6F and 6H</xref>).

<title>Potentiation of glycinergic neurotransmission by TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> alleviated pathological pain</title>
<p>Glycinergic disinhibition following peripheral injury plays an important role in central sensitization of nociceptive behaviors. To examine the role of α1<sup>ins</sup> in inflammatory pain, we injected formalin into left hindpaws of mice. Our data showed that Ser380 phosphorylation was significantly enhanced in the dorsal horns ipsilateral to formalin injection relative to contralateral sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Coincident with Ser380 phosphorylation was a robust α1<sup>ins</sup> ubiquitination on the injured sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The α1<sup>ins</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) were inhibited when mGluR5 inhibitor MPEP (50 nmol) or ERK inhibitor U-0126 (2 nmol) was intrathecally applied for 30 min before formalin injection. Disruption of ERK/α1<sup>ins</sup> interaction by TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> (200 pmol) also blunted α1<sup>ins</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) in formalin mice. The same dose of TAT-Scram, however, had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). Formalin triggers biphasic spontaneous pain behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). We found that TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> dose-dependently ameliorated the second-phase painful behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7C and 7E</xref>).

These data suggested that mGluR5/ERK-signaling–dependent α1<sup>ins</sup> phosphorylation and ubiquitination closely correlated with inflammatory pain. We also tested the effect of TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> (200 pmol) on the neuropathic pain induced by spared nerve injury.

<p>To test whether disruption of ERK/α1<sup>ins</sup> interaction potentiated glycinergic transmission in inflamed mice, we recorded GlyR-IPSCs in spinal slices prepared at 90 min post-formalin injection. The results showed that bath application of TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup>, but not TAT-Scram, enhanced the amplitudes of GlyR-IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000371.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). If α1<sup>ins</sup> was virally knocked down before formalin injection, the synaptic potentiation by TAT-pep-α1<sup>ins</sup> was eliminated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000371.s009">S8A Fig</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GlyR α1 subunit is abundantly expressed in the adult spinal cord and brain stem and is responsible for the majority of glycinergic neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref005">5</xref>]. The importance of α1 in neuronal function is underlined by genetic studies showing that mutation or reduced expression of α1 in the spinal cord and brain stem incurs severe neurological disorders such as hyperekplexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref026">26</xref>]. The major finding in the current study was that α1<sup>ins</sup>, a longer α1 variant, was involved in spinal glycinergic transmission. The α1<sup>ins</sup> expression was restricted to the superficial dorsal horn of spinal cord, and knockdown of α1<sup>ins</sup> did not affect motor coordination but elicited pain hypersensitivity, suggesting that α1<sup>ins</sup> was required for spinal nociceptive processing. Activation of mGluR5 in the spinal cord dorsal horn has been shown to enhance nociceptive neuronal excitability, potentiate glutamatergic inputs, and play an important role in pathological pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref031">31</xref>]. We provided evidence that mGluR5 activation also attenuated glycinergic currents through ERK-dependent α1<sup>ins</sup> phosphorylation. This novel, to our knowledge, signaling pathway might act synergistically with the enhanced glutamatergic transmission and neuronal excitability to sensitize the nociceptive behaviors. In support of this notion, α1<sup>ins</sup> knockdown partially occluded DHPG action in inducing painful responses, and, more importantly, specific recovery of α1<sup>ins</sup>-mediated glycinergic inhibition attenuated pathological pain.</p>
<p>The IL between TM3–TM4 of GlyRs subunits is a unique domain that displays the highest degree of variability. These loops bind to intracellular scaffolds and signaling components that are essential for the activity-dependent modification of glycinergic efficacy. Great efforts have been made to distinguish the biological characteristics of two GlyR α3 subunits, α3K and the longer α3L that contains additional 15 amino acids in the TM3–TM4 loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref032">32</xref>]. These two α3 variants are distributed throughout the central nervous system. However, they differ significantly in terms of channel desensitization, membrane distribution, and synaptic localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref036">36</xref>]. The alternatively spliced insert in α3L has been proposed to stabilize the secondary structure of the TM3–TM4 loop and regulate the channel gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref034">34</xref>]. The current study demonstrated that one of the important functions of the α1<sup>ins</sup> insert was to constitute a D-docking site, a unique structure that allowed mGluR5/ERK signaling to decrease α1<sup>ins</sup>-mediated glycinergic inhibition and evoke nociceptive behavioral sensitization. The deficiency of the spliced insert and corresponding D-docking site explained why α1 subunit was refractory to mGluR5 regulation. As with mGluR5, the adenosine A1 receptor has also been shown to regulate glycinergic responses mediated by α1<sup>ins</sup> but not by α1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref015">15</xref>]. These data implied that α1 and α1<sup>ins</sup> might respond distinctly to some G-protein–coupled receptors despite their high similarities in electrophysiological and pharmacological properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Phosphorylation plays an important role in the dynamic modulation of ligand-gated ion channels. Most of the known phosphorylation sites on GlyRs have been mapped to the TM3–TM4 loop. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can suppress glycinergic transmission by phosphorylating α3L at Ser346, which is involved in the regulation of nociceptive behaviors and respiratory rhythm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref037">37</xref>]. Ser346 phosphorylation also enables allosteric modulators to interact with α3L and reverse inflammation-induced glycinergic disinhibition in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref038">38</xref>]. PKC phosphorylation of GlyR β subunit disturbs the binding of the postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin and decreases GlyR accumulation at inhibitory synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref011">11</xref>]. mGluR5 has been well known to regulate a wide range of cellular responses through PKC pathway. We tested the role of PKC in mGluR5 modification of GlyRs, finding that glycinergic responses were insensitive, at least in part, to PKC signaling initiated specifically by mGluR5. Previous studies have demonstrated that mGluR5 can stimulate a transient activation of ERK through protein phosphatase 2A and Homer1b/c pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref017">17</xref>]. Our data revealed that ERK was essential for mGluR5 to suppress glycinergic currents. Upon binding to the D-docking site of α1<sup>ins</sup>, ERK catalyzed the phosphorylation of Ser380 and led to the endocytosis of α1<sup>ins</sup>. The activity-dependent Ser380 phosphorylation of α1<sup>ins</sup> thus constituted a novel, to our knowledge, mechanism to modulate the efficacy of glycinergic transmission. We found that Ser380 phosphorylation was closely associated with inflammatory pain. Interference with ERK/α1<sup>ins</sup> interaction decreased Ser380 phosphorylation in inflamed mice, resumed glycinergic transmission, and attenuated pain sensitization. The spliced insert also introduced a serine–proline motif (<sup>326</sup>SP) in the TM3–TM4 loop of α1<sup>ins</sup>. However, this SP motif was found to be dispensable for mGluR5 inhibition of α1<sup>ins</sup> currents.</p>
<p>Our data showed that α1<sup>ins</sup> was a ubiquitinated protein, and Lys379 was identified as the major ubiquitination site. The ubiquitination decreased the band mobility of α1<sup>ins</sup> by about 7 kDa, suggesting that only one Ubi molecule was conjugated to one α1<sup>ins</sup> subunit. Monoubiquitination generally regulates protein–protein interaction and the endocytic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref039">39</xref>]. The Ubi moieties on α1<sup>ins</sup> were recognized by endocytic adaptor protein Eps15, which initiated α1<sup>ins</sup> endocytosis to remove glycinergic inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref039">39</xref>]. Importantly, activation of mGluR5/ERK signaling or Ser380 mutation to aspartic acid enhanced the ubiquitination level of α1<sup>ins</sup>, indicating that α1<sup>ins</sup> ubiquitination was regulated by Ser380 phosphorylation. Possibly, Ser380 phosphorylation facilitated the interaction of α1<sup>ins</sup> with unidentified ubiquitination machinery that catalyzed the Ubi transfer cascade. Alternatively, Ser380 phosphorylation caused the conformational change in the intracellular large loop of α1<sup>ins</sup> so that lysine residues became susceptible for Ubi conjugation reaction. Recently, HECT, UBA, WWE domain containing 1 (HUWE1) is identified as the E3 Ubi ligase that contributes to the ubiquitination and endocytosis of spinal GlyR α1 subunit during inflammatory pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref040">40</xref>]. HUWE1 knockdown enhances glycinergic transmission and generates an effective analgesic action against pain hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref040">40</xref>]. The E3 Ubi ligases that ubiquitinate α1<sup>ins</sup> subunit require further investigation.</p>
<p>Taken together, the current study demonstrated that GlyR α1<sup>ins</sup> subunit served as a specific target for mGluR5/ERK signaling to reduce glycinergic inhibition and evoke spinal sensitization. Given the gating control by glycinergic inhibition over nociceptive sensory input through the spinal cord dorsal horn to higher brain regions, these data shed new light on a potential for α1<sup>ins</sup> to treat pathological pain.</p>

<title>Behavioral tests</title>
<p>The animals were acclimatized to the testing environment for at least 1 h before intraplantar formalin or intrathecal DHPG injection. Immediately after the injection, we returned the animals to the chamber and observed the spontaneous pain behaviors for 0.5–1 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref048">48</xref>]. For the Von Frey test, a set of calibrated Von Frey monofilaments (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) were applied perpendicularly to the plantar surfaces of hindpaws. The pattern of positive and negative withdrawal responses was converted to 50% paw withdrawal thresholds by using the up–down method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref020">20</xref>]. The paw withdrawal latencies (PWLs) were measured by delivering a beam of light onto the plantar surfaces of hindpaws (with the cutoff of 10 s). The time between the onset of heat application and paw withdrawal was recorded automatically as PWL values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref020">20</xref>]. Cold stimulation was delivered by dabbing acetone onto the plantar surfaces of hindpaws. The first 10-second activities were excluded, and the time spent on flicking and licking the paws for 60 s afterwards was recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref049">49</xref>]. Motor function was tested on a rotarod that was accelerated from 0 to 40 RPM within 60 s.

<title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>The mice (6–8 weeks old) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, and the lumbar segment of spinal cord was isolated into ice-cold sucrose solution (in mM: 50.0 sucrose, 95.0 NaCl, 1.8 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7.0 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 15.0 D-glucose [pH 7.4], bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> + 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). A transverse slice (350-μm thickness) with an intact L4 or L5 dorsal root was cut on a vibratome stage and perfused (5 ml/min) with oxygenated ACSF (32 °C–33 °C) in the recording chamber for at least 1 h before recordings. The lamina II outer neurons were visually identified under an Olympus BX51WIF microscope fitted with a 40× water immersion objective under fluorescence and transmitted light illumination. We performed the recordings on lamina II outer neurons because these neurons receive the inputs from unmyelinated peptidergic C nociceptors and myelinated Aδ nociceptors as well as from spinal glycinergic inhibitory interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref052">52</xref>]. The reduced glycinergic inhibition contributes to the development of pathological pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref050">50</xref>]. The glass electrodes had the resistance of 3–5 MΩ when filled with the internal solution (in mM: 110.0 Cs<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 5.0 KCl, 2.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.0 HEPES, 5.0 EGTA, 5.0 Mg-ATP, and 0.5 Na-GTP [pH 7.25]; 295–300 mOsm). The neurons were voltage-clamped at 0 mV with an Axon 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). To evoke GlyR-IPSCs, focal stimulation (0.1 Hz) was delivered through a glass pipette that was positioned adjacent to the recorded neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref015">15</xref>]. The glycinergic component was pharmacologically isolated by adding bicuculline (10 μM), D-APV (50 μM), and CNQX (20 μM) in the external solution. The paired-pulse ratios were recorded and measured by delivering two successive electric stimuli at a 30-ms interval. For mIPSCs, tetrodotoxin (1 μM) was also included in the bath solution. The GABAergic IPSCs were isolated by strychnine (2 μM), D-APV, and CNQX. To record the dorsal-root–evoked EPSCs, the glass pipettes were filled with (in mM) 115 cesium methanesulfonate, 20 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 2.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4.0 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 0.6 EGTA, and 10 sodium phosphocreatine (pH 7.25; 295–300 mOsm). NMDAR-EPSCs were recorded at +40 mV in the presence of bicuculline, strychnine, and CNQX. The AMPAR-EPSCs were recorded at −70 mV in the presence of bicuculline and strychnine. The monosynaptic EPSCs were identified on the basis of the constant latency and absence of conduction failure in response to high-frequency electrical stimulation (20 Hz). To evoke the whole-cell glycinergic currents in spinal slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref015">15</xref>], glycine (1 mM, 5 s) was perfused onto the recorded neurons through an electrically controlled microperfusion system. HEK293T cells co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 and pEGFP-N1 vector (reporter plasmid) were perfused at room temperature with the external solution containing (mM) 145.0 NaCl, 5.0 KCl, 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10.0 HEPES, and 11.0 D-glucose (pH 7.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000371.ref019">19</xref>]. When filled with the internal solution (in mM: 140.0 CsCl, 1.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10.0 HEPES, 8.0 EGTA, 3.0 Na-ATP, and 0.1 Na-GTP [pH 7.2]; 295–300 mOsm), the recording pipettes had the resistance of 3–5 MΩ. The cells were voltage-clamped at −80 mV. To elicit the whole-cell glycinergic currents, glycine (1 mM, 10 ms) was dissolved in the external solution and rapidly applied onto the cells at an interval of 30 s. The series and input resistances were monitored online throughout each experiment. The recordings were collected for analysis unless the resistances changed by more than 15%. The current signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz.</p>

<p>We presented the data as mean ± SEM. The behavioral tests, GST pull-down, electrophysiological recordings, immunocytochemistry, and phosphorylation assay were conducted by the investigators unaware of the group allocation. The data were randomly collected and processed. The synaptic responses were electrically evoked at 0.1 Hz, the consecutive 6 responses every minute were averaged, and the peak amplitudes were analyzed by Clampfit 8.0 software. The mIPSC signals were analyzed by Mini-analysis software. Western blot data were quantified by NIH ImageJ software. For immunocytochemistry, one 30- to 50-μm dendritic segment was randomly selected from each neuron, and the Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software was used to analyze the immunofluorescence intensities. Two group comparisons were conducted by using paired Student <italic>t</italic> test or Mann–Whitney U test. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Bonferroni test was used for the data across multiple groups.
