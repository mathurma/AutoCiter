        <p>In the vertebrate retina, horizontal cells generate the inhibitory surround of bipolar cells, an essential step in contrast enhancement. For the last decades, the mechanism involved in this inhibitory synaptic pathway has been a major controversy in retinal research. One hypothesis suggests that connexin hemichannels mediate this negative feedback signal; another suggests that feedback is mediated by protons. Mutant zebrafish were generated that lack connexin 55.5 hemichannels in horizontal cells. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were made from isolated horizontal cells and cones in flat mount retinas. Light-induced feedback from horizontal cells to cones was reduced in mutants. A reduction of feedback was also found when horizontal cells were pharmacologically hyperpolarized but was absent when they were pharmacologically depolarized. Hemichannel currents in isolated horizontal cells showed a similar behavior. The hyperpolarization-induced hemichannel current was strongly reduced in the mutants while the depolarization-induced hemichannel current was not. Intracellular recordings were made from horizontal cells. Consistent with impaired feedback in the mutant, spectral opponent responses in horizontal cells were diminished in these animals. A behavioral assay revealed a lower contrast-sensitivity, illustrating the role of the horizontal cell to cone feedback pathway in contrast enhancement. Model simulations showed that the observed modifications of feedback can be accounted for by an ephaptic mechanism. A model for feedback, in which the number of connexin hemichannels is reduced to about 40%, fully predicts the specific asymmetric modification of feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first successful genetic interference in the feedback pathway from horizontal cells to cones. It provides direct evidence for an unconventional role of connexin hemichannels in the inhibitory synapse between horizontal cells and cones. This is an important step in resolving a long-standing debate about the unusual form of (ephaptic) synaptic transmission between horizontal cells and cones in the vertebrate retina.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Contrast enhancement is a fundamental feature of our visual system, initiated at the first synaptic connections in the retina. These are the synapses between photoreceptors (rods and cones) and their targets, horizontal cells and bipolar cells. Horizontal cells receive input from many cones and subsequently send a feedback signal to photoreceptors. Bipolar cells, however, receive direct input from only a few photoreceptors, but also receive indirect inhibitory input from surrounding cones via the horizontal cell feedback pathway. This organization induces the classic center/surround organization of bipolar cells and is considered the first step in contrast enhancement. Exactly how horizontal cells send feedback signals to photoreceptors has remained a mystery, however. One hypothesis posits that connexin hemichannels are involved. In this study, we tested this hypothesis using mutant zebrafish that lack connexin hemichannels specifically in horizontal cells. Our electrophysiology experiments showed that feedback is indeed reduced in these mutants, confirming that connexin hemichannels play an important role in feedback from horizontal cells to cones. In addition, we find that these mutant fish have decreased contrast sensitivity at a behavioral level, illustrating that functionally relevant contrast enhancement begins at the first synapse of the visual system.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In the vertebrate retina, photoreceptors project to horizontal cells and bipolar cells. Horizontal cells are mediating lateral inhibition in the outer retina, a process that is thought to be involved in contrast enhancement. Horizontal cells are electrically coupled by gap-junctions, thus integrating their input spatially. This integrated signal is fed back negatively to photoreceptors. The effect of this feedback signal is a modulation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current (<italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) of the cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Verweij1">[1]</xref> and rods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Thoreson1">[2]</xref>. Hyperpolarization of horizontal cells shifts <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> to more negative potentials, thus leading to an increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx and subsequently an increase in glutamate release by the cones. Although there is general agreement about this pathway, the underlying mechanism is a matter of debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Fahrenfort1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>For zebrafish, feedback from horizontal cells to cones has been suggested to depend on Cx55.5 hemichannels located at the tips of the horizontal cell dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Shields1">[7]</xref>. Current flowing through these hemichannels and the intersynaptic space induces a local voltage drop near the voltage dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels of the cones. This voltage drop depends on the horizontal cell membrane potential (V<sub>HC</sub>), thus making <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> and the glutamate release from the cones also dependent on V<sub>HC</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Byzov1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans2">[9]</xref>. This interaction, where modulation of the extracellular potential leads to cell-cell communication, is called an ephaptic interaction.</p>
      <p>The lack of specific pharmacology for connexins creates challenges for testing this hypothesis. Therefore, we generated a zebrafish that lacks Cx55.5 hemichannels and studied the negative feedback pathway from horizontal cells to cones. We found that Cx55.5 is mediating a major part of the feedback signal from horizontal cells to cones and that the lack of Cx55.5 hemichannels leads to reduced contrast sensitivity. This study is therefore the first study actually demonstrating the involvement of horizontal cells in contrast sensitivity at the behavioral level.</p>

        <title>Morphological Analysis of Cx55.5 (C54X) Mutant Zebrafish</title>
        <p>Connexins are proteins with four transmembrane domains, two highly conserved extracellular loops, one intracellular loop, and a long C-terminal end. To eliminate Cx55.5 function, we generated a zebrafish with a stop codon in the first extracellular loop of Cx55.5(C54X) using the TILLING technique (see Methods). The site of this mutation prevents the formation of a functional protein. The mutants develop normally. Body length (wild-type: 22±3 mm, <italic>n</italic> = 10; mutant: 22±1 mm, <italic>n</italic> = 10; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05) and eye size (wild-type: 2.1±0.2 mm, <italic>n</italic> = 40; mutant: 2.1±0.2 mm, <italic>n</italic> = 41; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05) did not differ significantly. Also the cell density in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.73), the inner nuclear layer (INL) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.80), and the ganglion cell layer (GCL) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.09) were equal. Finally, the localization of cell-specific markers was studied. The immunoreactivity of FRet43 (double cones), GluR2 (horizontal cell dendrites), GluR4 (OFF-bipolar cell dendrites), and TH (interplexiform cells) did not differ between wild-type and mutant and the ultrastructure of the cone synaptic terminal was normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

            <title>Localization of cellular markers in retinas from wild-type and mutant zebrafish.</title>
            <p>The organization of the outer retina was evaluated by the distribution of a number of cellular markers for double cones (A, FRet43) in red, horizontal cells (B, GluR2) in green, OFF-bipolar cells (C, GluR4) in red, and interplexiform cells (E, TH) in red. The blue stain is the nuclear marker DAPI. No difference in the distribution of these markers could be observed. In both preparations, GluR2 forms horseshoe-like structures in the OPL (B, D). Previous studies have shown that these structures are horizontal cell dendrites invaginating the cone terminal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Yazulla1">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Klooster1">[58]</xref>. GluR4 labeling is present as small puncta at the level of the OPL (C, D). These puncta were identified as the tips of the dendrites of OFF bipolar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Yazulla1">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Klooster1">[58]</xref>. (E) TH labels interplexiform cells and the synapses these cells make onto horizontal cells. The immunoreactivity pattern is similar in wild-type and mutant retinas. These results indicate that all major neuron types in the OPL have developed normally. (A to E): Scale bar = 10 µm. (F) Ultrastructure of the cone synaptic terminal in wild-type (left) and mutant (right) retinas. No differences were found in the ultrastructural organization of the cone synaptic terminal. In both animal models, the characteristic shape of the synaptic triad was easily identified. R, synaptic ribbon; Sp, spinules; HC, horizontal cell; * bipolar cell. Scale bar = 0.5 µm.</p>

        <p>Immunoreactivity of at least three connexins (Cx52.6, Cx52.9, and Cx55.5) could be detected in the zebrafish retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g003">3A</xref>, left). These connexins were located in large plaques in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and the upper part of the INL. Double labeling experiments confirmed that at least Cx52.9 co-localizes in gap-junctional plaques with both Cx55.5 and Cx52.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Co-localization of Cx55.5 and Cx52.6 was not studied due to the lack of appropriate antibodies. In the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, right), both Cx55.5-IR and Cx52.6-IR were absent, indicating that these two connexins are co-regulated. Cx52.9-IR appeared normal. Western blot analysis confirmed that Cx55.5 and Cx52.6 were absent in the mutant retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Gap-junctions between horizontal cells were present in both wild-type and mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Quantification of the gap-junctions showed a significant reduction in size (wild-type: 151±6.4 nm, <italic>n</italic> = 50; mutant: 104±4.8 nm, <italic>n</italic> = 50; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (see Material and Methods) and a significant increase in number (wild-type: 0.061±0.010 gap-junction/µm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 7; mutant: 0.094±0.011 gap-junction/µm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 7; <italic>p</italic> = 0.046). These numbers suggest that the reduction in gap-junction size is compensated by an increase in gap-junction number. Based on these numbers, estimates of the total gap-junction surface in wild-type and mutant were made by assuming circular gap-junctional plaques. The total-gap-junctional surface did not differ significantly between wild-type and mutant (wild-type: 2,166±380 µm<sup>2</sup>/µm<sup>3</sup>; mutant: 1,590±221 µm<sup>2</sup>/µm<sup>3</sup>), suggesting that the total coupling conductance between horizontal cells was equal. Connexin expression on the horizontal cell dendrites differed between wild-type and mutant. In wild-type zebrafish, Cx55.5 and some Cx52.6 was expressed at the tips of the horizontal cell dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Shields1">[7]</xref>, but this labeling was absent in the mutants. Cx52.9-IR on the horizontal cell dendrites in mutants remained present or might have increased slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This shift in connexin expression was also observed at the RNA level. RNA levels of Cx55.5 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.035) and Cx52.6 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) were significantly down regulated in the mutant, whereas the RNA level of Cx52.9 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.49) was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

        <p>Is horizontal cell function affected in the mutant? Horizontal cells in the isolated retina responded with a hyperpolarizing response to 500 ms full-field blue light stimuli. The V<sub>HC</sub> in the dark (wild-type: −30.4±2.2 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 35; mutant: −28.5±1.9 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 30; <italic>p</italic> = 0.53) and the response amplitude (wild-type: −2.2±0.4 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 35; mutant: −1.5±0.3 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 30; <italic>p</italic> = 0.21) did not differ between wild-type and mutants. Receptive field sizes of horizontal cells were estimated by stimulating the retina with a 200 µm spot and a full-field stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The spot/full-field ratio in the wild-type (0.34±0.09, <italic>n</italic> = 15) and mutants (0.33±0.10, <italic>n</italic> = 11) were equal (<italic>p</italic> = 0.91), indicating that the receptive field size had not changed. The overshoot response at light offset seemed to be larger in the mutant, but was not analyzed any further in the present paper.</p>
        <p>Next it was determined whether negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones was affected in the mutant. Overall, the roll-back responses of horizontal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g005">Figure 5Ci</xref>, arrow), an indirect measure of feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Wu1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans4">[21]</xref>, were highly variable and small in both wild-type and mutants. Many cells, even in wild-type, did not show any sign of a rollback response (see also Connaughton and Nelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Connaughton1">[22]</xref>). This is reflected in the average size of the rollback response, which did not differ significantly from zero for both the wild-type and the mutant (wild-type: 1.4±6.8%, <italic>n</italic> = 35; mutant: 6.2±5.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 30; <italic>p</italic> = 0.30; <italic>p</italic> = 0.78). Furthermore, they did not differ from each other (<italic>p</italic> = 0.60). Another measure of feedback is the spectral sensitivity of horizontal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans3">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Connaughton1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Stell2">[24]</xref>. Horizontal cells can be classified spectrally as monophasic horizontal cells (MHC) that hyperpolarize to all visible wavelengths, biphasic horizontal cells (BHC) that hyperpolarize to short and depolarize to long wavelength light, and triphasic horizontal cells (THC) that hyperpolarize to short and long wavelength light but depolarize to middle wavelength light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Connaughton1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-MacNichol1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Norton1">[28]</xref>. Tetraphasic horizontal cells have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Connaughton1">[22]</xref>, but are not included in this study. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g005">Figure 5D</xref> shows the distribution of horizontal cell types, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g005">Figure 5E</xref> shows horizontal cell responses to red, green, and blue full-field light stimuli, respectively. The distribution of horizontal cells in the mutant did not differ from wild-type (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05), indicating that the wiring of the horizontal cell types developed normally in the mutants. The depolarizing light responses are purely feedback-driven responses, while the hyperpolarizing responses to blue light are due to the direct light responses of the cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans3">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Connaughton1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Stell2">[24]</xref>. In zebrafish, some BHCs depolarize while others hyperpolarize in response to green light stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001107.s002">Figure S2</xref> and see Connaughton and Nelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Connaughton1">[22]</xref>). All the depolarizing responses in the BHCs were strongly reduced in the mutant. To quantify this, we used the ratio between the depolarizing responses to red light and the hyperpolarizing responses to blue light as an estimate of feedback. As shown above, the average response amplitude to blue light stimuli did not differ between wild-type and mutant. However, the ratio between red and blue light responses in the BHCs was significantly smaller in the mutant (wild-type: −0.38±0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 8; mutant: −0.08±0.03, <italic>n</italic> = 5; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g005">Figures 5Eii</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001107.s002">S2</xref>). In the MHCs no difference in the ratio between red and blue light responses was found (wild-type: 0.67±0.11, <italic>n</italic> = 25; mutant: 0.87±0.11, <italic>n</italic> = 24; <italic>p</italic> = 0.20). This shows that the depolarizing response of the BHCs to red light was reduced relative to the response to blue light, indicating that feedback in the mutant was reduced. The depolarizing responses of the THCs seemed to be smaller as well, but statistical analysis could not be performed due to the low number of THCs encountered.</p>

        <p>To obtain a more reliable measure of feedback, the membrane potential of horizontal cells was manipulated without directly affecting cones by applying 50 µM 6,7-Dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (DNQX), a glutamate antagonist, or 30 µM Kainate (KA), a glutamate agonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Fahrenfort2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Fahrenfort3">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Cadetti1">[30]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g006">Figure 6Bi</xref> (left) shows the cone <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in the control condition (green), in DNQX (red), and in KA (black).

        <title>Optokinetic Response of Larval Zebrafish</title>
        <p>How would vision be affected by this mutation? We have shown previously that feedback has two components: subtractive and multiplicative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-VanLeeuwen1">[31]</xref>. The subtractive component subtracts the global mean activity of the cone output and the multiplicative component amplifies the remaining signal, scaling it such that it fits the bandwidth of the bipolar cells. The result is that the information about objects deviating from the surround is transmitted with high fidelity to the brain. Such a mechanism also generates a form of color-constancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-VanLeeuwen2">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans5">[33]</xref>. Without feedback the amount of information transmitted from the cones to the second order neurons would be reduced, thus lowering their contrast sensitivity and color-constancy. To test the first prediction, we measured the optokinetic response (OKR) of 5-d-old zebrafish larvae as function of contrast. OKR responses were generated with an LED-based optokinetic stimulator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001107.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This stimulator allows the projection of (sine-wave) patterns of light of various contrasts and colors and rotates these patterns with various velocities. Eye movements are recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g009">Figure 9A</xref>) and the optokinetic gain is determined by dividing the eye movement velocity by the velocity of the stimulus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g009">Figure 9B</xref> shows that for all contrasts the optokinetic gain was significantly reduced in mutant zebrafish compared to wild-type (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Since Cx55.5 is exclusively expressed in retinal horizontal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Shields1">[7]</xref>, these experiments show that negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones is important for contrast sensitivity. Finally, in a separate set of experiments, the temporal frequency dependence of the optokinetic gain was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). The gain reduction found in the mutants was stronger for high than for low temporal frequencies (<italic>p</italic> = 0.017). This is consistent with the notion that a negative feedback pathway enhances the synaptic gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-VanLeeuwen1">[31]</xref> and acts as a band-pass filter. Removing negative feedback will reduce the gain and in addition convert the filter into a low pass filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). The result is that high frequencies will be affected more by the gain reduction than low temporal frequencies.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The synaptic mechanism via which retinal horizontal cells feed back to photoreceptors has been a matter of intense debate. In the present study, we show that feedback is impaired in mutant zebrafish lacking Cx55.5, a connexin which is expressed specifically in horizontal cells. Reduction of feedback was observed in both horizontal cells and cones. Furthermore, we show now on a behavioral level that feedback from horizontal cells to cones plays a prominent role in contrast enhancement. Taken together, our observations show that connexin hemichannels play an important role in synaptic communication between horizontal cells and cones.</p>

        <title>Spectral Opponent Coding of Horizontal Cells</title>
        <p>In this article, we show that feedback from horizontal cells to cones generates the spectral coding of horizontal cells; reduced feedback in the mutant zebrafish leads to a decreased depolarizing response to red light in BHCs. Fuortes and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Fuortes1">[34]</xref> and Stell and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Stell1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Stell2">[24]</xref> were the first to propose that the depolarizing responses in BHCs were due to negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones. More than 35 years later, we are now able to confirm this assumption by genetic means. The exact wiring between horizontal cells and cones still remains an issue of debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans3">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Connaughton1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Stell2">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Li1">[35]</xref>. However, with genetically modified animals, such as the one presented here, together with animals that express GFP in specific types of horizontal cells, this issue may be resolved in the near future.</p>

        <title>Feedback Is Reduced But Not Absent in Mutant Zebrafish</title>
        <p>In the mutant zebrafish lacking Cx55.5, feedback from horizontal cells to cones is significantly smaller, but not completely abolished. Our model simulations suggest that about 40% of the hemichannel conductance remains in the mutants. These hemichannels could be formed by other connexins such as Cx52.9, an ortholog of Cx55.5, or by Pannexin 1 (Panx1). Interestingly, Panx1 RNA was significantly up-regulated (2.33±0.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) in the mutant, and Panx1-IR found on the horizontal cell dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Prochnow1">[36]</xref> was also present in the mutant zebrafish (unpublished data). It is an intriguing possibility that the expression of another hemichannel forming protein, Panx1, might compensate for the lack of Cx55.5 hemichannels.</p>
        <p>In the mutant zebrafish, we observed a significant reduction in the shift of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in cones when horizontal cells were pharmacologically hyperpolarized, but only a small non-significant reduction when horizontal cells were depolarized. The model simulations show that a reduction in <italic>g<sub>hemi</sub></italic> in itself can account for this asymmetric reduction of feedback. How does this work? In wild-type horizontal cells, hyperpolarization leads to an increase of <italic>I<sub>hemi</sub></italic>. It has been proposed that this increased <italic>I<sub>hemi</sub></italic> induces the shift of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> via an ephaptic interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans1">[3]</xref>. In the mutant, the hemichannel conductance at negative potentials is strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The result is that with hyperpolarization of the horizontal cells, <italic>I<sub>hemi</sub></italic> does not increase but remains equal or even decreases. Due to this change, the ephaptic interaction will be absent or even reversed. Depolarization of horizontal cells leads to a reduction of the hemichannel current both in the wild-type and the mutant fish. Therefore, feedback due to horizontal cell depolarization might decrease slightly, but will never reverse in the mutant.</p>

        <title>Feedback and Horizontal Cell Coupling</title>
        <p>In an ephaptic feedback model, the current that enters the horizontal cell via the hemichannels at the tips of the horizontal cell dendrites has to leave the horizontal cell at another place. In principle there are two routes for this: The current leaves the horizontal cell via the potassium channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Fahrenfort1">[6]</xref> or the current leaves the horizontal cell via the gap-junctions to neighboring horizontal cells and leaves those neighboring horizontal cells via glutamate gated channels, hemichannels, and potassium channels. These two routes differ considerably. The main difference is that for homogenous stimuli, all horizontal cells will be polarized equally and thus prevent current flow through the gap-junctions. With hyperpolarization of the horizontal cells, the inward rectifying potassium current will activate and allows more current to leave the horizontal cells. The consequence is that for such stimuli the properties of the potassium channels also affect the properties of feedback. For small spots or edges, on the other hand, the second route might be the preferred route. For small spots horizontal cells do not hyperpolarize strongly, limiting the amount of current that can leave the horizontal cell via the potassium channels. Now a major part of the current will flow via the gap-junctions to neighboring horizontal cells. The properties of feedback are for a large part dependent on the properties of the gap-junctions. To prevent interference of this pathway in our experiments, we have used full-field stimuli or pharmacological polarization of horizontal cells to induce feedback responses.</p>

        <title>Alternative Models for Feedback from Horizontal Cells to Cones</title>
        <p>It has been shown that negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones is pH-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Hirasawa1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Davenport1">[5]</xref>. At first sight, these results seem to be contradicting the ephaptic feedback hypothesis. However, as we have shown previously, the pharmacological manipulations used in these studies lead to intracellular pH changes as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Fahrenfort1">[6]</xref>. Since connexin-hemichannels close with intracellular acidification, the findings supporting a pH-dependent mechanism are not in conflict with, but even support, the ephaptic feedback hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Fahrenfort1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Malchow1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-GonzalezNieto1">[40]</xref>. Nevertheless, although our data are well described by an ephaptic feedback mechanism, we cannot fully exclude that another process, independent of hemichannels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Hirasawa1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Davenport1">[5]</xref>, mediates the remaining feedback. Our data predict that such an alternative mechanism will be most prominently active at potentials more depolarized than V<sub>HC</sub> in the dark and can be blocked by gap-junction blockers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans1">[3]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In this article we show that in mutant zebrafish the roll-back responses of horizontal cells are not affected, whereas feedback is affected. In previous studies where the rollback response was used as measure for feedback, the size of the rollback response was compared within one cell in different pharmacological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Kamermans1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Shelley1">[41]</xref>. In this study, the mean of the rollback responses in different groups were compared. Due to the large variability in the size of the rollback response, the average rollback response was not significantly different from zero in both the wild-type and the mutant zebrafish. This indicates that the rollback response is not a very sensitive measure for feedback when comparing group means. Mouse horizontal cells express Cx57 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Shelley1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-JanssenBienhold1">[44]</xref>. Because the rollback response of horizontal cells did not differ in the Cx57<sup>−/−</sup> knock-out mouse, it was concluded that Cx57 is not involved in feedback from horizontal cells to cones. Our experiments show that more rigorous testing of the feedback pathway is needed before reaching such a conclusion, leaving the possibility that feedback is affected in the Cx57<sup>−/−</sup> mouse.</p>
        <p>To our knowledge, this study is the first non-pharmacological intervention specifically affecting the horizontal cell to cone feedback system and shows that Cx55.5 hemichannels are essential in this pathway. It highlights the unconventional nature of this synapse, demonstrating that feedback can be blocked in a highly asymmetric manner. An ephaptic model fully predicts this specific aspect of feedback. This study adds to the evidence for an ephaptic feedback mechanism in which connexin hemichannels and possibly pannexin channels have a physiological function.</p>

        <p>Mutant zebrafish were generated by target-selected inactivation (TILLING) at the Hubrecht Laboratory (Utrecht, The Netherlands) as a part of a European project (European Commission LSHG-CT-2003-503496) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Wienholds1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Wienholds2">[46]</xref>. In short: A library of ENU-mutagenized F1 zebrafish was generated and kept as a living stock. The DNA of these animals was screened for mutations in the Cx55.5 gene by use of CEL-I-mediated heteroduplex cleavage and subsequent resequencing. This process created a line of zebrafish with a cytosine to adenine mutation at nucleotide position 162 of the Cx55.5 coding sequence. This nucleotide substitution results in a premature stop codon at amino acid position 54, where a cysteine residue is present in wild-type zebrafish. Based on the predicted membrane topology, only one of the four transmembrane domains should be translated in the mutant. Zebrafish homozygous for this mutation, therefore, can be considered as Cx55.5 knock-outs. In order to remove unwanted ENU-induced mutations, the Cx55.5 mutant line was out-crossed to wild-type for at least four generations in order to remove unwanted ENU-induced mutations. Only homozygous mutants and closely related wild-type zebrafish were analyzed in this study.</p>

        <title>Quantification of Morphology</title>
        <p>Dapi staining was used to quantify the density of the nuclei in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and the ganglion cell layer (GCL) in wild-type and mutant retinas. Sections from at least five retinas of each group were analyzed. The surface of the layers and nuclei in ONL, INL, and GCL were segregated and counted using Image Pro (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Gap-junctions were visualized at the EM level with the gap-junction specific antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-JanssenBienhold1">[44]</xref>. The length of 50 labeled gap-junctions were measured in both wild-type and mutant retinas using Image Pro (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Serial sections (80–100 µm) were made from the wild-type and mutant retinas. Every second section was photographed. Seven series of sections from various wild-type retinas and seven series of sections from various mutant retinas were reconstructed. Only gap-junctions were counted that appeared first in the sections.</p>

        <p>The method and all reagents used have been described in detail previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Zoidl2">[49]</xref>. Upstream primers and reverse primers were designed using VectorNTI software (Life Technologies Corporation). Amplification reactions were performed in triplicate with each primer pair producing single amplification products of a calculated Tm which was verified by melting point analysis. Syber Green I reaction conditions were as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech Mountain View, CA, USA) using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, München, Germany). The threshold cycle (C<sub>t</sub>) was defined at the point where the fluorescence signal reached a value of 0.01 above background during the exponential phase of the reaction. The average Ct values were used to calculate the ratios using equation (1). Ratios (R) represented the relative expression of a target gene in a sample:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001107.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>Primer efficiencies (E) of the PCR reactions were determined directly from amplification curves using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 Real-Time PCR Detection System software. The Ct values for the reference gene, 16s rRNA, ß-actin, calbindin, PKCα, vGAT, and GRIAA, were used to normalize mRNA levels of the samples. The changes of the mutant mRNA expression levels were calculated as ratios relative to the mRNA levels found in wild-type fish. All experiments represented three independent sets of samples analyzed in triplicate. Intra-assay and inter-assay variabilities were less than 3%.

An eyecup was prepared under red light illumination by removing the cornea, lens, and as much vitreous humor as possible. The eyecup was bisected with a scalpel, and each half-retina was removed from the eyecup with a fine paint brush. Isolated half-retinas were mounted (ganglion cell layer down) to a small piece of kimwipe (Kimberley-Clark Corporation) or lens paper (Pelco lens paper, Catalog # 810, Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) and placed in a recording chamber. The ends of the lens paper/kimwipe were held securely in place under a harp or under two pieces of plastic or Sylgard (Dow Corning Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit) that were adhered to the bottom of the chamber with Dow Corning silicone vacuum grease (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Catalog #60705, Hatfield, PA).

The cone type was determined with 500 ms stimuli of different wavelengths (465 nm, 525 nm, and 624 nm). The cone was stimulated with a saturating spot of light (20 µm diameter) of the wavelength that yielded the largest response. Subsequently, a full-field stimulus of white light (1.0 or 1.5 s) was given of increasing intensities, while the cell was stepped to −30 mV. Amplitudes of feedback responses were measured at 200 ms after response onset. Cells, in which the Calcium-dependent Chloride current confounded the measurements, were discarded.</p>

Briefly, a simple conductive network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g007">Figure 7</xref>) was used to evaluate whether the physiology and morphology of the cone/horizontal cell synapse allows for physiologically relevant ephaptic interaction. The horizontal cell is modeled as three conductances with their associated reversal potentials; the hemichannel conductance (<italic>g<sub>hemi</sub></italic>), the glutamate gated conductance (<italic>g<sub>Glu</sub></italic>) and a non-linear potassium conductance (<italic>g<sub>k</sub></italic>) taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Dong1">[53]</xref>. <italic>g<sub>hemi</sub></italic> is located on the dendrites of horizontal cells, while <italic>g<sub>Glu</sub></italic> is located on both the dendrites and the soma of the horizontal cells. The reversal potentials for <italic>g<sub>hemi</sub></italic> and <italic>g<sub>Glu</sub></italic> are 0 mV and that for <italic>g<sub>K</sub></italic> is −82.7 mV (<italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic>). In the dark, the horizontal cell membrane potential (<italic>V<sub>HC</sub></italic>) is more positive than <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic>, and current will flow from <italic>g<sub>K</sub></italic> into <italic>g<sub>hemi</sub></italic> and <italic>g<sub>Glu</sub></italic> via an extracellular resistive pathway in the synaptic complex whose conductance is (<italic>g<sub>ext</sub></italic>). This current will generate a voltage drop over <italic>g<sub>ext</sub></italic>, making the potential deep in the synaptic cleft (<italic>V<sub>ext</sub></italic>) slightly negative. The light-induced closure of <italic>g<sub>Glu</sub></italic> causes the horizontal cell to hyperpolarize, resulting in a change in the current through <italic>g<sub>ext</sub></italic>, and a greater negativity in <italic>V<sub>ext</sub></italic>. The fall in <italic>V<sub>ext</sub></italic> serves to depolarize the cone membrane locally, modulate the cone Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current (<italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>), and increase the release of neurotransmitter. All parameters and equations of the model were kept equal to parameter set 2 in Fahrenfort et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Fahrenfort1">[6]</xref>. In order to compare the resulting changes of voltage in the synaptic cleft, the model was extended with a reduced cone model. The cone model consisted only of a voltage dependent Ca-current and glutamate release. <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> was modeled according to equation (2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Fahrenfort4">[54]</xref> with parameters that fitted best our measurements of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in DNQX in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, after shifting it over the value of <italic>V<sub>ext</sub></italic> that is given by horizontal cell model for <italic>g<sub>Glu</sub></italic> = 0 nS. This fit yields the following parameter values: <italic>K<sub>Ca</sub></italic> = −5.4 mV, <italic>E<sub>Ca</sub></italic> = 44.6 mV, <italic>n<sub>Ca</sub></italic> = −12 mV and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001107.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 36 (normalized units). The glutamate conductance in the horizontal cell (<italic>g<sub>Glu</sub></italic>) was adapted from a fixed parameter to a variable. The relation between the calcium current <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in the cone and the glutamate dependent conductance <italic>g<sub>Glu</sub></italic> in the horizontal cell is described by equation (3). This relation is based upon the finding that the glutamate release depends linearly on <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Schmitz1">[55]</xref> and that the dependence of <italic>g<sub>Glu</sub></italic> on the glutamate concentration can be described by a Hill function with coefficient 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-Schmitz1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001107-ODell1">[56]</xref>.

To determine how critical this value is for the model behavior, we varied <italic>K<sub>Glu</sub></italic> over a wide range and found that the model showed the same overall behavior for all values tested. The DNQX-induced feedback currents always reduced with reduction of <italic>g<sub>hemi</sub></italic> and finally reversed whereas the KA induced feedback current only reduced slightly with the reduction of <italic>g<sub>hemi</sub></italic> . Some differences between the model and the actual data exist especially at potentials more positive than 0 mV. These differences might be due to the absence of voltage or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated currents in the cone model. Overall the model fully captures the highly specific modification of feedback from horizontal cells to cones due to the reduction of <italic>I<sub>hemi</sub></italic>. Since this behavior is highly independent of the parameter values, it can be considered as a hall-mark of hemichannel mediated feedback.</p>

        <title>Optokinetic Response</title>
        <p>The optokinetic response (OKR) was measured at an age of 5 to 6 d post-fertilization (dpf). The OKR is a reflex which is triggered by objects moving across the visual field. The OKR consists out of slow smooth pursuit eye movements interrupted by fast saccadic movements that reset the eyes. The optokinetic stimulator is formed by 60 circularly placed plexiglass slides. Each slide is illuminated by 5 LEDs at the top and 5 LEDs at the bottom (one of 630 nm, two of 526 nm, and the two of 458 nm). The intensity of the LEDs can be updated every 4 ms. In that way moving stimuli were generated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001107.s003">Figure S3</xref>). A zebrafish larva was put, dorsal side upwards, into a Petri dish with a diameter of 1.35 cm in the center of the optokinetic drum. By immerging the larvae in 3% methylcellulose, all body movements except the eye movements were suppressed. The fish were illuminated with IR-light from below and eye movements were determined using labview software (kind gift of S. Neuhauss). The sine-wave stimulus used in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g009">Figure 9A and B</xref> had a spatial frequency of 0.028 cycles per degree, contrasts of 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.25%, mean intensity 16 lux, and a temporal frequency of 0.25 cycles per second. The sine-wave stimulus used in the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g009">Figure 9C</xref> had a spatial frequency of 0.014 cycles per degree, a contrast of 100%, and a temporal frequency of 0.25 and 1.0 cycles per second. To avoid habituation of the response, the stimulus first moves counterclockwise for 12 s, then holds still for 3 s before it moves clockwise for 12 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001107-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Contrast is defined by equation (4).<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001107.e010" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>The optokinetic gain is defined as the mean velocity of the slow pursuit movements of both eyes in both directions divided by velocity of the stimulus. A gain of 1.0 would mean that the image is stabilized onto the retina. The surface under the contrast/gain curves was determined for each individual fish. The means of these surfaces were compared for wild-type and mutant.</p>

          <p>Amplitudes of depolarizing responses in biphasic horizontal cells are strongly reduced in mutant zebrafish. Biphasic horizontal cells depolarize to red light stimuli and hyperpolarize to blue light stimuli. In zebrafish one can find biphasic horizontal cells that either hyperpolarize (left) or depolarize (right) in response to green light stimuli. In both types of BHCs, all depolarizing responses are smaller in the mutant.</p>
