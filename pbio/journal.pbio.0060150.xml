        <p>Mobile group II introns consist of a catalytic intron RNA and an intron-encoded protein with reverse transcriptase activity, which act together in a ribonucleoprotein particle to promote DNA integration during intron mobility.

          <p>Group II introns are bacterial mobile elements thought to be ancestors of introns—genetic material that is discarded from messenger RNA transcripts—and retroelements—genetic elements and viruses that replicate via reverse transcription—in higher organisms. They propagate by forming a complex consisting of the catalytically active intron RNA and an intron-encoded reverse transcriptase (which converts the RNA to DNA, which can then be reinserted in the host genome). The Ll.LtrB group II intron-encoded protein (LtrA) was found previously to localize to bacterial cellular poles, potentially accounting for the preferential insertion of Ll.LtrB in the replication origin (<italic>oriC</italic>) and terminus (<italic>ter</italic>) regions of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> chromosome, which are located near the poles during much of the cell cycle. Here, we identify <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> genes whose disruption leads both to more diffuse LtrA localization and a more uniform chromosomal distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites, proving that the location of the LtrA protein contributes to insertion-site preference. Surprisingly, we find that LtrA localization in the disruptants is affected by the accumulation of intracellular polyphosphate, which appears to bind basic proteins and delocalize them away from the cellular poles. Thus, polyphosphate, a ubiquitous but enigmatic molecule in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, can localize proteins to different sites of action, with potentially wide physiological consequences.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mobile group II introns, found in bacterial and organelle genomes, consist of a catalytic intron RNA and a multifunctional intron-encoded protein (IEP), which interact to promote RNA splicing and intron mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b002">2</xref>]. The IEP binds to the intron in unspliced precursor RNA, promotes its splicing by stabilizing the catalytically active RNA structure, and remains tightly bound to the excised intron lariat RNA in a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) that promotes intron mobility. Mobility occurs by a remarkable mechanism in which the intron RNA inserts (reverse splices) directly into a DNA strand and is reverse-transcribed by the IEP, with the primer being either the opposite DNA strand cleaved by the IEP or a nascent strand at a DNA replication fork (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b001">1</xref>]). By using this reverse splicing mechanism, mobile group II introns insert at high frequency into specific DNA target sites (“retrohoming”) and at low frequency into ectopic sites that resemble the normal homing site (“retrotransposition”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b001">1</xref>]. The latter process has led to the wide dispersal of mobile group II introns among bacterial species and also may have been used to invade eukaryotic nuclear genomes, where mobile group II introns are thought to have evolved into spliceosomal introns and non-long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b002">2</xref>]. Although their DNA integration mechanism has been elucidated, little is known about how mobile group II introns function in a cellular context or about how their mobility is influenced by other cellular processes.</p>
      <p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Lactococcus lactis</named-content> Ll.LtrB intron, which has been used as a model system, is highly mobile not only in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. lactis</named-content> but also in a variety of other bacteria including <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content>, where it has been studied extensively by using the facile genetic and biochemical methods available for that organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b003">3</xref>]. The broad host range of the Ll.LtrB intron reflects that RNPs containing only the IEP and intron RNA by themselves carry out the initial reverse splicing and reverse transcription reactions, while the subsequent cDNA integration steps use common host DNA repair functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b005">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Ll.LtrB and other mobile group II introns recognize their DNA target sequences by using both the IEP and the base pairing of the intron RNA, with the latter contributing most of the target specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b008">8</xref>]. For Ll.LtrB, these base-pairing interactions involve intron RNA sequences denoted EBS2, EBS1, and δ and complementary DNA target sequences denoted IBS2, IBS1, and δ', extending from position −12 to +2 from the intron-insertion site. (EBS and IBS denote exon- and intron-binding site, respectively.) Because the DNA target site is recognized largely by base pairing of the intron RNA, Ll.LtrB can be retargeted to insert (retrohome) into different chromosomal sites, enabling its development into a gene targeting vector (“targetron”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b009">9</xref>]. Further, an Ll.LtrB intron with randomized EBS2, EBS1, and δ sequences inserts at sites distributed throughout the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> genome, analogous to global transposon mutagenesis. Surprisingly, however, we found that although Ll.LtrB could be retargeted to insert efficiently into any region of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> genome, an Ll.LtrB intron with randomized EBS and δ sequences shows a strong proclivity to insert at sites clustered around the bidirectional replication origin (<italic>oriC</italic>), with 57% of the sites lying within 5% of the chromosome on either side of <italic>oriC</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b010">10</xref>]. Coros et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b011">11</xref>] studying retrotransposition of the wild-type Ll.LtrB intron into ectopic sites in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> observed a similar clustering of insertion sites in both the <italic>oriC</italic> and the <italic>ter</italic> regions.</p>
      <p>Previously, we hypothesized that the preferential insertion of the Ll.LtrB intron into the <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>ter</italic> regions of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> chromosome might reflect the intracellular localization of Ll.LtrB RNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b012">12</xref>]. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>, the <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>ter</italic> regions are localized near the cellular poles during much of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b014">14</xref>], and we found by using both LtrA fusions with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and immunofluorescence microscopy that LtrA expressed alone or with Ll.LtrB RNA to form RNPs localizes to the cellular poles in both <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. lactis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b012">12</xref>]. Further analysis in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> showed that the bipolar localization of LtrA occurs over a wide range of cellular growth rates and LtrA expression levels, is independent of <italic>oriC</italic> function, and occurs in anucleate cells, suggesting that LtrA simply is not forced to the poles by nucleoid occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b012">12</xref>]. We also found that LtrA expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> interferes with the polar localization of coexpressed <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Shigella flexneri</named-content> IcsA protein, suggesting competition for a common localization determinant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b012">12</xref>]. Beauregard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b015">15</xref>] found that the polar localization of LtrA is maintained in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> mutants with defects in nucleoid condensation, chromosome partitioning, and DNA replication, and as expected from its continued pole localization, Ll.LtrB retrotransposition sites remained clustered in the <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>ter</italic> regions in such mutants.</p>
      <p>While the above findings are consistent with the possibility that the bipolar localization of LtrA is responsible for the clustering of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites in the <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>ter</italic> regions of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> chromosome, to prove this connection, it is necessary to obtain mutations that change LtrA's intracellular localization and show that they correspondingly change the chromosomal distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites. However, mutations that affect the polar localization of proteins in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> have been difficult to find. Nilsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b016">16</xref>] manually screened ∼7,000 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> mutants for altered localization of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. flexneri</named-content> IcsA protein. The only mutant identified was in the <italic>mreB</italic> gene, which encodes a bacterial actin homologue required for maintenance of the cell's rod shape, and in this case, an IcsA/GFP fusion protein simply showed multiple foci in a portion of the spherical mutant cells instead of two foci at poles.</p>
      <p>Here, we used automated fluorescence microscopy of cell microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b017">17</xref>] to screen a transposon-insertion library for mutants with altered LtrA localization. We identified five <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> genes (<italic>gppA</italic>, <italic>uhpT</italic>, <italic>wcaK</italic>, <italic>ynbC</italic>, and <italic>zntR</italic>) whose disruption leads to both a more diffuse intracellular distribution of LtrA and a more uniform genomic distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites, indicating that group II intron protein localization is a major determinant of insertion-site preference. Surprisingly, we find that the common factor affecting LtrA localization in these disruptants is the accumulation of intracellular polyphosphate poly(P). We confirmed this connection by analyzing <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants, which lack the exopolyphosphatase that degrades poly(P), and found that disruptants that accumulate poly(P) also show delocalization of other pole-localized basic proteins (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Neurospora crassa</named-content> CYT-18 and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> XapR). Our findings show that poly(P), which accumulates in response to cell stress or entry into stationary phase, can localize proteins to different sites of action, with potentially wide physiological consequences.</p>

For screening, the library was transformed with intron-donor plasmid pACD2X-GFP/LtrA, which uses a <italic>T7lac</italic> promoter to express an Ll.LtrB-ΔORF intron with short flanking exons, plus a GFP/LtrA fusion protein downstream of the 3′ exon (E2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). This configuration gives high intron mobility frequencies and permits independent manipulation of the intron RNA and IEP. We showed previously that GFP/LtrA expressed from this plasmid is active in promoting both RNA splicing and intron mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b012">12</xref>].</p>

        <p>To characterize their GFP/LtrA localization patterns, the wild-type and disruptant strains were grown in liquid culture, and GFP/LtrA expression was induced overnight with 500 μM IPTG at 30 °C, one of the induction conditions used for screening the transposon-insertion library.

Such cells contain one or two small, discrete GFP/LtrA foci at their poles, with elongated cells, presumably those ready for division, typically showing a third focus in the middle. Only 2.8% of the wild-type cells showed diffuse GFP/LtrA localization patterns. In wild type as well as the disruptants, ∼20% of cells did not show GFP/LtrA fluorescence detectable above background.</p>

        <p>In comparison to the wild-type strain, each of the disruptants showed a substantially increased proportion of cells with more diffuse GFP/LtrA localization patterns (26.4–46.1%), which were classified into two types: completely diffuse (C), with GFP/LtrA uniformly distributed throughout the cell, or partially diffuse (P), with GFP/LtrA spread out from the poles but leaving a clear area in the middle of the cell (percentages of C and P are indicated in parentheses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060150-t001">Table 1</xref>). The <italic>gppA</italic> disruptant was the most strongly affected, with only 20.5% of the cells still showing polar GFP/LtrA localization, 39.5% showing partially or completely diffuse fluorescence, and 16.9% filamentous cells with multiple foci and/or irregular diffuse patches of GFP/LtrA fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060150-t001">Table 1</xref>, top). The <italic>wcaK</italic> disruptant also showed an increased proportion of filamentous cells (18.6%), while the remaining three disruptants showed few or no filamentous cells. The ratio of cells with completely or partially diffuse LtrA localization differed for each of the disruptants, being highest for the <italic>zntR</italic> disruptant and lowest for the <italic>uhpT</italic> disruptant. When Ll.LtrB intron expression was induced under the higher temperature conditions (overnight, 100 μM IPTG, 37 °C), we observed similar GFP/LtrA localization patterns, but the proportions of cells showing completely or partially diffuse fluorescence shifted in some cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060150-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Although their cellular phenotypes are heterogeneous, PCR using primers flanking the target gene showed that cultures of four of the disruptants (<italic>gppA</italic>, <italic>uhpT</italic>, <italic>wcaK</italic>, and <italic>ynbC</italic>) were homogenous for the disrupted allele, while the fifth (<italic>zntR</italic>) contained predominantly the disrupted allele but also showed a light band (star) comigrating with that for the wild-type allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060150-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). This light band was found by sequencing to contain a 4-bp insertion at the transposon-insertion site in the middle of the ORF and is presumably a null allele resulting from transposon excision. Thus, in all cases, the heterogeneous cellular phenotype is not due to persistence of the wild-type allele.</p>

        <title>Intron Mobility Frequencies in the Disruptants</title>
        <p>Next, we tested whether the disruptions affect intron mobility frequencies. For these experiments, we used an Ll.LtrB-ΔORF intron that had been retargeted by modification of its EBS and δ sequences to insert at a site within the <italic>E. coli lacZ</italic> gene (LacZ-1063a) so that the intron integration frequency could be scored simply by blue–white screening (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060150-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Intron-donor plasmid pACD2X expressing the retargeted intron was transformed into the wild-type and disruptant strains and induced with IPTG at 30 or 37 °C prior to plating the cells on Luria–Bertani (LB) medium containing X-Gal. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g003">Figure 3</xref>, at both temperatures, Ll.LtrB-ΔORF intron mobility frequencies in the disruptants were somewhat higher than those in the wild-type strain (68–96% compared to 47–51%). Immunoblots of proteins isolated from the induced cells showed slightly reduced levels of LtrA protein in all cases (69–78% wild type; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), indicating that the increased mobility frequencies simply are not due to higher protein expression levels.

        <p>Having demonstrated that the Ll.LtrB-ΔORF intron remains mobile in the disruptants, we next examined whether the changes in LtrA localization patterns are correlated with changes in the genomic distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites. As done previously to analyze insertion-site preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b010">10</xref>], we used a donor plasmid library that expresses Ll.LtrB-ΔORF introns with randomized target site recognition (EBS2, EBS1, and δ) sequences plus a Tp<sup>R</sup> retrotransposition-activated marker (RAM) to detect chromosome integrations. This marker consists of a small trimethoprim-resistance (<italic>Tp<sup>R</sup></italic>) gene inserted within the intron in the orientation opposite to intron transcription but interrupted by a small, self-splicing group I intron (the phage T4 <italic>td</italic> intron) in the forward orientation. During retrohoming via an RNA intermediate, the group I intron is spliced, reconstituting the marker and enabling the selection of cells containing integrated introns by trimethoprim resistance. The Tp<sup>R</sup> colonies were isolated and analyzed by TAIL PCR and sequencing to identify the intron-insertion sites.</p>

        <title>Clues from the <italic>gppA</italic> Disruptant: GFP/LtrA Localization Is Not Affected by Decreased Synthesis of Magic Spot, but Is Affected by Polyphosphate Accumulation</title>
        <p>Among the genes whose disruption results in altered GFP/LtrA localization, the best characterized is <italic>gppA</italic>, which encodes guanosine pentaphosphatase A (GPPA). This enzyme has two functions: it dephosphorylates pppGpp to produce ppGpp (“magic spot”), and it processively hydrolyzes intracellular poly(P), liberating orthophosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b018">18</xref>].</p>
        <p>To test whether the altered LtrA localization pattern in the <italic>gppA</italic> disruptant is due to impaired synthesis of magic spot, we examined LtrA localization in two other mutants that affect the synthesis of magic spot in different ways: a <italic>relA</italic> disruptant derived from wild-type HMS174(DE3) by targetron mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060150-sg005">Figure S5</xref>) and a previously isolated <italic>relA</italic>/<italic>spoT</italic>* double mutant obtained from GenoBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b024">24</xref>]. (Note that strains obtained from GenoBase were derivatized with λDE3 for intron expression and are denoted with an asterisk to indicate different genetic background.) Both the <italic>relA</italic> and the <italic>relA</italic>/<italic>spoT</italic>* mutants still showed predominantly polar localization of GFP/LtrA (72.2% and 69.2% of cells, respectively), with only small proportions of cells (4.2% and 6.3%, respectively) showing diffuse GFP/LtrA localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060150-t001">Table 1</xref>, bottom). Thus, impaired ability to produce ppGpp does not strongly affect LtrA localization. The mobility frequency of the Ll.LtrB-ΔORF intron assayed by targeted integration into the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene as above was increased in the <italic>relA</italic> disruptant and decreased in the <italic>relA</italic>/<italic>spoT</italic>* mutant compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). The lower intron mobility frequency in the <italic>relA</italic>/<italic>spoT</italic>* mutant could be due to the <italic>relA</italic>/<italic>spoT</italic> mutations, the different genetic background, or a combination of the two.</p>

        <p>The alternate possibility was that GFP/LtrA localization in the <italic>gppA</italic> disruptant might be due to the accumulation of intracellular poly(P). To test this possibility, we used targetron mutagenesis to disrupt the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> HMS174(DE3) <italic>ppk</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> genes, which encode polyphosphate kinase and exopolyphosphatase, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060150-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). The <italic>ppk</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> genes are expressed from the same operon, with <italic>ppk</italic> upstream of <italic>ppx</italic>. Thus, the disruption of <italic>ppk</italic> is expected to affect the expression of both genes and lead to decreased levels of intracellular poly(P), while the disruption of <italic>ppx</italic> should affect only the expression of that gene and lead to accumulation of poly(P) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b027">27</xref>].</p>
        <p>The <italic>ppx</italic> disruptant, which we confirmed below accumulates poly(P), did in fact show a substantially increased proportion of cells with more diffuse GFP/LtrA localization (27.4%), while the <italic>ppk</italic> disruptant, expected to have decreased levels of poly(P), showed predominantly the normal bipolar GFP/LtrA localization pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060150-t001">Table 1</xref>, bottom). Similar results were obtained with independently constructed <italic>ppx</italic> and <italic>ppk</italic> deletions from the Keio collection obtained from GenoBase (i.e., more diffuse GFP/LtrA localization in the <italic>ppx*</italic> deletion (18.7%) and predominantly bipolar GFP/LtrA localization in the <italic>ppk*</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060150-t001">Table 1</xref>, bottom)). In both the <italic>ppk</italic> and the <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants, the mobility frequency of the Ll.LtrB-ΔORF intron assayed by targeted integration into the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene was increased relative to the wild-type strain, with the increases more pronounced if normalized to the LtrA expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g005">5</xref>C). We conclude from these findings that the common feature correlated with the more diffuse LtrA localization in the <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants is the accumulation of intracellular poly(P).</p>

        <title>Intracellular Distribution of Poly(P) in Wild-Type and Disruptant Strains</title>
        <p>To investigate further the relationship between poly(P) accumulation and GFP/LtrA localization, we used fluorescence microcopy to examine the intracellular localization of poly(P) detected by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining in the wild-type strain and the <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants expressing GFP/LtrA. Under fluorescence microscopy with excitation at 360 nm, DAPI bound to poly(P) emits at 550 nm and appears yellow or orange, while DAPI bound to DNA emits at 490 nm and appears blue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b028">28</xref>].</p>
        <p>In wild-type HMS174(DE3) under standard GFP/LtrA induction conditions at 30 °C, 16.5% of the cells showed detectable poly(P) fluorescence localized in discrete foci, mainly at the cell poles (P), another 8.9% showed more diffuse poly(P) fluorescence (D), and the remainder (74.6%) showed no detectable poly(P) fluorescence (N), likely reflecting at least in part the sensitivity of the detection method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

        <p>By contrast, under the same conditions, both the <italic>gppA</italic> and the <italic>ppx</italic> disruptions, which lack enzymes involved in poly(P) degradation, showed substantially increased proportions of cells with detectable poly(P) fluorescence (55.9% and 61.1%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Further, in a high proportion of <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptant cells, poly(P) was no longer present in discrete foci but was instead dispersed throughout the cell (44.4% and 25.4%, respectively, excluding filamentous <italic>gppA</italic> cells). Conversely, the <italic>ppk</italic> disruptant, which lacks the major poly(P) biosynthetic enzyme, shows a reduced proportion of cells with detectable poly(P) fluorescence, which was localized again mainly at or near the cell poles (6.6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). The residual poly(P) in the <italic>ppk</italic> disruptant may be synthesized by an alternate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b032">32</xref>]. Similar differences in poly(P) localization between the wild-type and the disruptant strains were observed after IPTG induction in strains carrying the empty vector, indicating that poly(P) accumulation in the disruptants is not due to expression of GFP/LtrA (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>Importantly, although the <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants have heterogeneous cellular phenotypes, poly(P) accumulation and dispersed GFP/LtrA localization were correlated strongly in individual cells. Thus, for the <italic>gppA</italic> disruptant, 90% of the doubly fluorescent cells with diffuse poly(P) localization showed diffuse GFP/LtrA localization, and 96% with diffuse GFP/LtrA localization showed diffuse poly(P) fluorescence. Similarly, in the <italic>ppx</italic> disruptant, 89% of the doubly fluorescent cells with diffuse poly(P) localization showed diffuse GFP/LtrA localization, and 88% with diffuse GFP/LtrA localization showed diffuse poly(P) localization. Further, in a high proportion of the doubly fluorescent cells, the poly(P) and GFP/LtrA fluorescence were either overlapping (94.7% and 87.9% in the <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants, respectively) or completely colocalized (78.4% and 45.5% in the <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). This degree of colocalization supports the hypothesis that the altered GFP/LtrA localization is due to the binding of the basic LtrA protein to the negatively charged poly(P). Those cells in which both poly(P) and GFP/LtrA are dispersed but not completely colocalized could reflect that poly(P) associated with LtrA dissociates or is degraded after the protein is dispersed, that some poly(P) bound to LtrA is less than the concentration limit required for fluorescence detection with DAPI, or that the GFP tag is clipped, rendering some proportion of LtrA nonfluorescent.</p>
        <p>After the above findings, we also re-examined the wild-type strain, where 2.8% of the cells showed diffuse GFP/LtrA localization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060150-t001">Table 1</xref>, top). Strikingly, even in wild type, where only a small proportion of cells is affected, diffuse GFP/LtrA localization was correlated again with the accumulation and dispersal of poly(P) (88% of wild-type cells with diffuse GFP/LtrA showed dispersed poly(P), and 83% with dispersed poly(P) showed diffuse GFP/LtrA). The accumulation of poly(P) in a small proportion of wild-type cells is likely due to cell stress, which triggers poly(P) synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b033">33</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that the more diffuse intracellular localization of GFP/LtrA results from the accumulation of poly(P), which binds to LtrA and delocalizes it away from the cell poles.</p>

      <sec id="s2h">
        <title>All the Other Disruptants with Diffuse GFP/LtrA Localization Also Accumulate Poly(P)</title>
        <p>The remaining four disruptants (<italic>uhpT</italic>, <italic>wcaK</italic>, <italic>ynbC</italic>, and <italic>zntR</italic>) with more diffuse GFP/LtrA localization do not involve genes that are known to function in poly(P) metabolism. However, the above findings raised the possibility that they might also accumulate poly(P) as a result of cell stress caused by the disruptions. Fluorescence microscopy of DAPI-stained cells revealed that this is in fact the case, with all four of the above disruptants in the HMS174(DE3) genetic background showing an increased proportion of cells with higher and more dispersed poly(P) fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). By contrast, strains having deletions of the same four genes (<italic>uhpT*</italic>, <italic>wcaK*</italic>, <italic>ynbC*</italic>, and <italic>zntR*</italic>) in the Keio genetic background did not accumulate poly(P) and correspondingly did not exhibit altered GFP/LtrA localization patterns (unpublished data). The likely explanation is that their different genetic background makes the Keio strains less prone to cell stress caused by these mutations and/or less prone to accumulate poly(P) in response to cell stress than in the HMS174(DE3) background. In comparison to the <italic>ppx</italic> disruption in the HMS174(DE3) background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>), the <italic>ppx</italic>* deletion in the Keio genetic background also showed less detectable poly(P) accumulation (1.0% P, 6.0% D, 93.0% N) and correspondingly had a more muted effect on GFP/LtrA localization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060150-t001">Table 1</xref>, bottom). We conclude that poly(P) accumulation is the common factor correlated with altered GFP/LtrA localization in all of the strains analyzed here.</p>

        <title>Poly(P) Binds to LtrA and Inhibits Its Reverse Transcriptase Activity</title>
        <p>To test directly whether poly(P) binds to LtrA, we examined its effect on the electrophoretic mobility of the LtrA protein in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). In the absence of poly(P), the LtrA protein, which is highly positively charged (calculated pI = 9.6), could not migrate toward the positive pole and failed to enter the gel. By contrast, with increasing concentrations of poly(P), an increasing proportion of LtrA entered the gel and migrated toward the positive pole, indicating complex formation. Control lanes (right) show that the highest concentration of poly(P) tested had no effect on the electrophoretic mobility of an acidic protein, bovine serum albumin (pI = 4.6), run in the same gel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g007">Figure 7</xref>B extends these findings by showing that equimolar poly(P) completely inhibited the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity of LtrA. Poly(P) also inhibited the RT activity of Moloney murine leukemia virus and Superscript RTs, although these enzymes appeared somewhat less sensitive to poly(P) inhibition than LtrA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g007">7</xref>D). Together, the above findings show that poly(P) binds LtrA and inhibits its RT activity.

      <p>Here, by using high-throughput methods to screen a transposon-insertion library, we identified five <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> genes (<italic>gppA</italic>, <italic>uhpT</italic>, <italic>wcaK</italic>, <italic>ynbC</italic>, and <italic>zntR</italic>) whose disruption affects the polar localization of LtrA, a group II intron-encoded reverse transcriptase that functions with the intron RNA in RNPs to promote intron mobility. All of the above disruptants show both an increased proportion of cells with more diffuse GFP/LtrA localization and a more uniform genomic distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites, which in the wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> strain are strongly clustered in the <italic>oriC</italic> region. These findings indicate that the intracellular localization of LtrA is a major determinant of Ll.LtrB-insertion-site preference, to our knowledge the first such demonstration for any mobile genetic element. Further analysis showed that the common factor leading to more diffuse GFP/LtrA localization in these and other disruptants is the accumulation of intracellular poly(P) and that disruptants that accumulate poly(P) also show altered intracellular distributions of other basic proteins that are normally pole-localized (CYT-18 and XapR). The latter findings suggest that poly(P) accumulation may be part of a cellular mechanism that leads to relocalization of basic proteins in response to cell stress or entry into stationary phase. From a technical standpoint, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using bacterial cellular arrays for high-throughput screens to identify mutations affecting protein localization or morphology, and they suggest a method for obtaining more uniform group II intron-gene disruption libraries by using mutants that accumulate poly(P).</p>
      <p>The polar localization of LtrA in wild-type cells may facilitate group II intron mobility by increasing access of group II intron RNPs to exposed DNA segments in the <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>ter</italic> regions of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> chromosome. It also may provide favorable sites for interaction with DNA replication components and a means of coordinating group II intron mobility with DNA replication and/or cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b012">12</xref>]. Other mobile elements use a variety of mechanisms for coordinating transposition with DNA replication ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b037">37</xref>] and references therein). Such coordination may be particularly important for group II introns, which can use nascent strands at DNA replication forks to prime reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b039">39</xref>]. Indeed, Coros et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b011">11</xref>] found that in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> the frequency of Ll.LtrB retrotransposition events that use this priming mechanism is highest in the <italic>oriC</italic> domain and decreases in a gradient toward the <italic>ter</italic> domain, while retrotransposition events that utilize the DNA cleavage activity of the IEP to generate the primer for reverse transcription do not show such a gradient. The selection for polar localization may have originated with ancestral group II introns whose IEPs lacked DNA cleavage activity and relied entirely on nascent DNA strands as primers.</p>
      <p>In addition to changing the intracellular localization of LtrA, poly(P) also potentially could affect the genomic distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites by binding basic nucleoid-associated proteins, leading to nucleoid decondensation, as observed in a <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa ppk1</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b040">40</xref>]. Indeed, it has been speculated that such a mechanism contributes to global changes in gene expression accompanying poly(P) accumulation in response to cell stress or entry into stationary phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b041">41</xref>]. However, Beauregard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b015">15</xref>] found that neither LtrA localization nor the distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites is affected significantly by mutations in the nucleotide-associated proteins H-NS, StpA, or MukB, which lead to nucleoid decondensation in different ways. These findings indicate that nucleoid decondensation does not by itself lead to a more uniform distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites as long as LtrA remains pole-localized. It is possible, however, that nucleotide decondensation contributes to the more uniform distribution of insertion sites that we observe when LtrA has been delocalized by poly(P).</p>
      <p>Our results suggest that negatively charged poly(P) delocalizes LtrA and other basic proteins by binding to them directly. A direct binding mechanism is supported by: (i) the colocalization of GFP/LtrA and poly(P) in high proportions of <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>C); (ii) the finding that poly(P) accumulation affects the polar localization of three basic proteins (LtrA, CYT-18, and XapR) but not the polar localization of the acidic protein IcsA<sub>507–620</sub>/GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g008">Figure 8</xref>); and (iii) biochemical experiments showing that poly(P) can bind LtrA to inhibit its RT activity and cause it to migrate toward the opposite pole in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The binding of poly(P) to LtrA and other basic proteins is presumably nonspecific, but we cannot at this stage exclude a more specific binding component in some cases. In the cell, poly(P) may bind to LtrA and other basic proteins at the poles and relocalize them as it moves through the cell, and/or it may bind to the nascent proteins in other regions, preventing them from becoming pole-localized. The poly(P) that colocalizes with LtrA could be present in specific complexes, akin to volutin granules, which may be passively or actively localized or delocalized.</p>
      <p>In addition to affecting the intracellular localization of LtrA, the binding of poly(P) may directly affect LtrA's biochemical activities in RNA splicing and intron mobility. Precedents for such effects include the findings that poly(P) activates Lon protease degradation of ribosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b042">42</xref>], may play a role in activating mammalian TOR kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b043">43</xref>], and is required for the lytic growth of phages P1 and fd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b044">44</xref>]. Our finding that poly(P) inhibits LtrA's RT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g007">Figure 7</xref>B) may explain why the <italic>ppk</italic> mutant, which has decreased levels of poly(P), shows increased Ll.LtrB mobility frequencies in a chromosomal <italic>lacZ</italic> gene integration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). However, we also find that Ll.LtrB mobility frequencies are increased moderately in <italic>gppA</italic>, <italic>ppx</italic>, and other mutants that accumulate poly(P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g005">5</xref>B). The latter findings indicate that inhibition of LtrA's RT activity by poly(P) in vivo must be either mild or transient, perhaps due to dissociation or degradation of the bound poly(P) after the protein has been delocalized. A factor that may contribute to the moderately increased Ll.LtrB mobility frequencies in mutants that accumulate poly(P) is that their more uniform intracellular distribution of LtrA makes it easier to target the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene, which is located outside the <italic>oriC</italic> or <italic>ter</italic> chromosomal regions.</p>
      <p>The disruptants that we identified with altered GFP/LtrA localization patterns accumulate poly(P) for different reasons. The <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptions inhibit poly(P) degradation, while the <italic>uhpT</italic>, <italic>wcaK</italic>, <italic>ynbC</italic>, and <italic>zntR</italic> disruptants presumably accumulate poly(P) as a result of cellular stress caused by the disruptions. All of disruptants, including the <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants, have heterogeneous cellular phenotypes, with an increased proportion of cells showing both poly(P) accumulation and altered GFP/LtrA localization, and the remainder having wild-type localization patterns. This heterogeneity may reflect that only some cells in the population are under sufficient stress to trigger poly(P) accumulation. The wild-type strain shows similar heterogeneity but with only a small proportion of cells showing poly(P) accumulation and altered GFP/LtrA localization. Thus, the disruptions appear to increase the normal propensity for stress-induced poly(P) accumulation, either by increasing the degree of stress or by decreasing the degradation rate of poly(P), making it easier to achieve elevated poly(P) concentrations. We note that the <italic>gppA</italic> disruption causes a more extreme accumulation and dispersal of poly(P) than does the <italic>ppx</italic> disruptant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>), possibly reflecting that the <italic>gppA</italic> disruptant not only lacks GPPA, which contributes to poly(P) degradation, but also accumulates pppGpp, which inhibits the remaining exopolyphosphatase PPX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b042">42</xref>].</p>
      <p>Like a previous screen for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> localization factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b016">16</xref>], our cell array screen did not identify a pole-localized receptor protein whose absence leads to diffuse LtrA localization. It is possible that a specific polar receptor for LtrA does not exist and that LtrA is localized to the poles by default because it is not actively localized elsewhere. Alternatively, the receptor may require essential proteins or be redundant or nonspecific (e.g., acidic phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b045">45</xref>]). Additionally, the intriguing finding that in wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> poly(P) detected by DAPI staining is found frequently in discrete foci at the poles raises the possibility that poly(P) itself contributes as a receptor for the polar localization of basic proteins under nonstress conditions. The finding that GFP/LtrA and other basic proteins remain pole-localized in <italic>ppk</italic> mutants, which have ∼10-fold decreased poly(P) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b027">27</xref>], does not exclude this possibility because poly(P) may be present in excess in wild-type strains and the residual poly(P) in the mutant may be sufficient for protein localization.</p>
      <p>Finally, the finding that disruptants that accumulate poly(P) show altered distributions not only of LtrA but also of other pole-localized basic proteins suggests that poly(P) accumulation may be part of a mechanism that relocalizes proteins to different sites of action in response to cellular stress. One can imagine that reservoirs of certain enzymes, such as transcription factors or DNA repair enzymes, accumulate at the cellular poles and are mobilized to new sites of action by poly(P) during entry into stationary phase or under stress conditions, as shown here for LtrA. Such relocalization may be particularly advantageous when the cell's biosynthetic capacity is impaired as it is faster and more economical than synthesizing a specific receptor and transport system for each protein. Protein relocalization by binding to poly(P) may have wide physiological consequences, not only in prokaryotes but also in eukaryotes, where poly(P) also exists but has remained enigmatic.</p>

        <p>The LtrA protein was expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen) from the intein-based expression plasmid pImp-1P (see above) and purified, essentially as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b004">4</xref>]. The LtrA protein used for RT activity assays was purified through an additional heparin-Sepharose chromatography step. For nondenaturing PAGE, poly(P) (Type 65; Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated with purified LtrA protein or bovine serum albumin (Fraction V (Sigma-Aldrich), with 20% glycerol added to match LtrA) in 20 μl of 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH. 7.5, for 30 min at 30 °C. The samples were then run in a nondenaturing 5–15% polyacrylamide gradient gel in Tris-acetate, pH 6.5, buffer. The gel was silver-stained, and a parallel gel was used for immunoblotting with anti-LtrA antibody (see above). RT activity was assayed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b050">50</xref>] by polymerization of [<sup>32</sup>P]-dTTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer) with poly(rA)/oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub> as template in reaction medium containing 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were spotted onto DE-81 paper (Whatman), washed three times with 2× SSC (SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.15 M citric acid, pH 7.0.), and counted in a scintillation counter.</p>

The PCR products were run in a 1% agarose gel, which was stained with ethidium bromide. M, 1-kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen). The prominent smaller band in the lane for the <italic>gppA</italic> disruptant contains primer dimers. The light band that comigrates with the wild-type band in the <italic>zntR</italic> disruptant (star) has a 4-bp insertion (ACAG) at the mariner transposon-insertion site (nucleotide position 171 counting from the A of the ATG initiation codon). This band presumably results from transposon excision and was found in multiple repeats with individual <italic>zntR</italic> disruptant colonies. Analogous bands due to transposon excision were not seen in the other disruptants.</p>

          <title>DNA Target Site Sequences and Base-Pairing Interactions for Targetrons Used for Gene Disruptions</title>
          <p>Retargeted Ll.LtrB-ΔORF introns (targetrons) are designated by a number that corresponds to the nucleotide position 5′ to the insertion site in the target gene's coding sequence, followed by “a” indicating the antisense strand. DNA target sequences are shown from positions −30 to +15 from the intron-insertion site, with nucleotide residues that match those in the wild-type Ll.LtrB intron target site highlighted in gray in the top strand. The intron-insertion site (IS) in the top strand and the IEP cleavage site (CS) in the bottom strand are indicated by arrowheads. Targetron LacZ-1063a was expressed from pACD2X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b051">51</xref>], and targetrons Ppk-1140a, Ppx-1051a, and RelA-733a were expressed from pACD-Kan<sup>R</sup>-RAM. The latter plasmid is a derivative of pACD2X in which the Ll.LtrB-ΔORF intron contains a modification of a previously constructed <italic>kan<sup>R</sup></italic> retrotransposition-indicator gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b052">52</xref>] inserted at the MluI site in intron domain IV. Targetrons were used for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> gene disruption as described ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b008">8</xref>], see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/Area_of_Interest/Life_Science/Functional_Genomics_and_RNAi/TargeTron.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/Area_of_Interest/Life_Science/Functional_Genomics_and_RNAi/TargeTron.html</ext-link>). Prior to analysis of the disruptants, the pACD-Kan<sup>R</sup>-RAM donor plasmid, which carries a <italic>cap<sup>R</sup></italic> marker on the vector backbone, was cured by transforming the strain with an incompatible Amp<sup>R</sup> plasmid pACYC177, followed by growth on LB medium containing ampicillin. Targetron disruptions were confirmed by PCR and sequencing across the targetron-integration junctions and by Southern hybridization to verify a single targetron integration at the desired site (unpublished data).</p>
