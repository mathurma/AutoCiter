<abstract>
<p>Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that linearly correlated sets of parameters (intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons) allow central pattern-generating networks to produce and maintain their rhythmic activity regardless of changing internal and external conditions. To determine the role of correlated conductances in the robust maintenance of functional bursting activity, we used our existing database of half-center oscillator (HCO) model instances of the leech heartbeat CPG. From the database, we identified functional activity groups of burster (isolated neuron) and half-center oscillator model instances and realistic subgroups of each that showed burst characteristics (principally period and spike frequency) similar to the animal. To find linear correlations among the conductance parameters maintaining functional leech bursting activity, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to each of these four groups. PCA identified a set of three maximal conductances (leak current, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>Leak</sub>; a persistent K current, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>K2</sub>; and of a persistent Na+ current, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>P</sub>) that correlate linearly for the two groups of burster instances but not for the HCO groups. Visualizations of HCO instances in a reduced space suggested that there might be non-linear relationships between these parameters for these instances. Experimental studies have shown that period is a key attribute influenced by modulatory inputs and temperature variations in heart interneurons. Thus, we explored the sensitivity of period to changes in maximal conductances of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>Leak</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>K2</sub>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>P</sub>, and we found that for our realistic bursters the effect of these parameters on period could not be assessed because when varied individually bursting activity was not maintained.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Central pattern-generating networks (CPGs) must be remarkably robust, maintaining functional rhythmic activity despite fluctuations in internal and external conditions. Recent experimental evidence suggests that this robustness is achieved by the coordinated regulation of many membrane and synaptic current parameters. Experimental and computational studies showed that linearly correlated sets of such parameters allow CPG neurons to produce and maintain their rhythmic activity. However, the mechanisms that allow multiple parameters to interact, thereby producing and maintaining rhythmic single cell and network activity, are not clear. Here, we use a half-center oscillator (HCO) model that replicates the electrical activity (rhythmic alternating bursting of mutually inhibitory interneurons) of the leech heartbeat CPG to investigate potential relationships between parameters that maintain functional bursting activity in the HCOs and the isolated component neurons (bursters). We found a linearly correlated set of three maximal conductances that maintains functional bursting activity similar to the animal in burster model instances, therefore increasing robustness of bursting activity. In addition, we found that bursting activity was very sensitive to individual variation of these parameters; only correlated changes could maintain the activity type.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vital adaptive rhythmic behaviors such as breathing and heartbeat in invertebrates are produced by central pattern-generating networks (CPGs). Beside their inherent importance in pacing rhythmic movements, CPGs represent fertile test beds for understanding neuronal network dynamics because of the robustness of their activity patterns even in reduced experimental preparations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Marder1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Calabrese1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Cymbalyuk1">[3]</xref>. The combination of the intrinsic electrical properties of the component neurons and their synaptic interactions within a CPG produces their rhythmic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Marder1">[1]</xref>. To maintain functional rhythmic activity, the CPG neurons and networks must be remarkably robust regardless of changing internal and external conditions. Recent experimental evidence suggests that animals show robust responses to modulation and environmental perturbations (e.g., large temperature changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Tang1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Tang2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Langen1">[6]</xref>). Modeling studies have begun to address the mechanisms underlying the robustness in activity type. For example, Goldman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Goldman1">[7]</xref> tested a model neuron over a wide range of parameters and found that activity type was robust to certain changes in parameters but very sensitive to other changes.</p>
<p>Bursting activity in CPGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Marder1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Cymbalyuk2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Gutierrez1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Selverston1">[10]</xref> is characterized by intervals of repetitive spiking separated by intervals of quiescence. Autonomously bursting neurons are common components of CPGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Cymbalyuk1">[3]</xref>. Half-center oscillators (HCOs), which consist of reciprocally inhibitory neurons (often autonomous bursters), are one of the most prevalent circuit building blocks of CPGs that are thought to assure robust alternating bursting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Cymbalyuk1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Selverston1">[10]</xref>. Studies of HCOs show that they can display a wide range of bursting activity when the parameters controlling intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic interactions of the neurons are varied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Marder1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Cymbalyuk2">[8]</xref>, . The analysis of this basic circuit building block has helped researchers understand how bursting activity is generated and how motor patterns are controlled by the nervous system. One CPG that is particularly well understood controls heartbeat in leeches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Calabrese1">[2]</xref>. The heartbeat period is regulated by a variety of environmental (e.g. changes in temperature) and physiologic (brought on by locomotor movements like swimming) inputs. When temperature increases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Arbas1">[14]</xref>, the burst period of the heartbeat CPG decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Masino1">[15]</xref>. Similarly, when the animals swim, the swim CPG is active and the heartbeat CPG burst period decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Arbas1">[14]</xref>. Therefore period is an important regulated characteristic of this CPG.</p>
<p>Recent experimental and modeling analyses of bursting activity indicate that the parameters (specifically the maximal conductances of specific ion channels) influencing bursting activity show 3–5 fold variation from animal to animal or model instance to model instance but that there are relationships (linear or non-linear) between parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Calabrese2">[16]</xref>. For example, electrophysiological and molecular studies in stomatogastric neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Schulz1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Schulz2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Khorkova1">[19]</xref> found pairwise and four-way linear correlations between the parameters. These studies suggest that the functional activity of a given neuron may reside in the set of parameter correlation rules it maintains rather than in the value of any particular parameter. In addition, such correlations were also found in model solution spaces obtained by parameter space exploration of biologically realistic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Taylor1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Hudson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Smolinski1">[22]</xref>. Many studies, both experimental <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Tobin1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Zhao1">[24]</xref> and computational <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Olypher1">[11]</xref>, have provided evidence that linearly correlated sets of parameters (intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons) allow CPG neurons to produce and maintain their rhythmic activity. To establish parameters relationships, some studies have used new visualizations (e.g., NDVis, parameterscape) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Langton1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Taylor2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Gutierrez1">[9]</xref>, while others have used mathematical methods (e.g., regression, discriminant analysis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Zhao2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-CalinJageman1">[28]</xref>. However, it is still unclear, how multiple parameters interact to produce and maintain the rhythmic single cell and network activity. Our study here focuses on how intrinsic membrane and synaptic parameters interact to maintain functional bursting activity in HCO and in burster model neurons from the leech heartbeat CPG.</p>
<p>For our study, we used the HCO computational model of Hill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Hill1">[29]</xref>, which was successfully developed to replicate the electrical activity (rhythmic alternating bursting of mutually inhibitory neurons) of the oscillator (HN) interneurons of the leech heartbeat CPG under a variety of experimental conditions. This HCO model consists of a two reciprocally inhibitory model HN interneurons, represented as single isopotential electrical compartments with Hodgkin and Huxley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Hodgkin1">[30]</xref> type intrinsic and synaptic membrane conductances. Each compartment contains 8 voltage-dependent currents, five inward currents I<sub>Na</sub> - a fast Na<sup>+</sup> current, I<sub>P</sub> - a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, I<sub>CaF</sub> - a rapidly inactivating low-threshold Ca current, I<sub>CaS</sub> - a slowly inactivating low-threshold Ca current, I<sub>h</sub> - a hyperpolarization-activated cation current) and three outward currents (I<sub>K1</sub> - a delayed rectifier-like K current, I<sub>K2</sub> - a persistent K current, I<sub>KA</sub> - a fast transient K current). The model has two types of inhibitory synaptic transmission between the two interneurons: graded transmission (I<sub>SynG</sub>) and spike-mediated transmission (I<sub>SynS</sub>). The maximal conductances (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of each of the membrane and synaptic currents and the leak reversal potential (E<sub>Leak</sub>) are free parameters in the model.</p>
<p>A comprehensive analysis of parameter relationships in the complete, canonical HCO neuron model presents a computational and theoretic challenge. To systematically explore the parameter space of the HCO and corresponding burster models, in our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-DolocMihu1">[31]</xref>, we simulated about 10.5 million model instances, whose characteristics we recorded into a database named HCO-db <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-DolocMihu1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-HCOdb1">[32]</xref>. The simulations were obtained by co-varying a carefully selected set of parameters that single parameter variation analyses showed were crucial in establishing bursting and controlling burst period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Hill1">[29]</xref>. These parameters comprise the maximal conductances <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynS</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynG</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>P</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>K2</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>h</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>CaS</sub> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>Leak</sub> (varied across of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, and 175% of their canonical values), and E<sub>Leak</sub> (varied across −70, −65, −60, −55, and −50 mV values) in all possible combinations. All simulated instances were classified into separate groups showing the same electrical activity. Our HCO-db is a very efficient tool for querying the simulated HCO model instances for finding potential parameter relationships.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused only on the four groups of instances from our HCO-db database showing functional leech bursting characteristics, HCOs, realistic HCOs, bursters, and realistic bursters. A HCO instance has two model interneurons each showing bursting activity with at least two bursts in a 40 s time interval, and has the following characteristics: each of its bursts has normal spikes (See Definitions), a small variation of period, a relative phase in the range of (0.45–0.55), and at least one synaptic component present (either <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynS</sub>≠0, or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynG</sub>≠0, or both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynS</sub>≠0 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynG</sub>≠0). A realistic HCO instance is a HCO that showed realistic bursting corresponding to that observed in leech oscillator heart interneurons (period between 5–15 s, average spike frequency between 8–25 Hz, and duty cycle between 50–70%). An isolated neuron instance (isolated neuron) has two identical interneurons (though started with different initial conditions, but otherwise identical), and no synaptic interaction (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynS</sub> = 0 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynG</sub> = 0). A burster instance is an isolated neuron instance for which both neurons had at least two bursts, each with normal spikes, and regular periods (as defined above for the HCOs). Note that burster instances can be thought of as being HCOs with no synaptic connections. A realistic burster instance is a burster instance that showed realistic bursting corresponding to isolated leech oscillator heart interneurons (period between 5–15 s, and average spike frequency between 8–25 Hz). Notice that realistic instances are a subgroup of either HCOs or bursters, and in our discussion here, unless specifically indicated, the HCO and burster groups include their subgroup of realistic instances.</p>
<p>We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to automatically find the potential existing linear correlations between the parameters maintaining functional activity. The results returned by PCA identified three maximal conductances (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>P</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>K2</sub>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>Leak</sub>) that correlate linearly for the bursters and the realistic bursters, and showed that for the HCOs and realistic HCOs there were no linear correlations between the parameters, but visualizations in a reduced space suggested that non-linear relationships between parameters might exists for these instances. In addition, we found that the bursting activity of the burster instances was very sensitive to variations in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>P</sub>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>Leak</sub> and to a lesser extent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>K2</sub>.</p>

<title>Sustaining realistic bursting in HCOs and bursters</title>
<p>In previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-DolocMihu1">[31]</xref>, our classification algorithm identified 1,202,139 (11.6%) HCO model instances as HCOs and 424 isolated neuron model instances as bursters (0.26% of the isolated neurons). To generate the <italic>realistic</italic> instance populations, we queried our database, HCO-db <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-HCOdb1">[32]</xref> with the criteria given in our definitions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) for the realistic HCO instances and realistic burster instances. We recorded the results of these queries into two separate views (MySQL Views) to facilitate and speed queries involving these groups in the future. We obtained 99,066 instances (8.2% of the HCOs) in the group of realistic HCOs, and 307 instances (72.4% of the bursters) in the group of realistic burster instances.</p>
<p>Out of 424 bursters, 263 produce realistic HCOs (1,055 instances) and 419 produce HCOs (21,303 instances) when coupled with inhibitory synapses. The number of HCO instances exceeds the number of burster instances because multiple values of synaptic conductance (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynS</sub> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynG</sub>) give rise to HCO instances for each burster instance. Of the 424 bursters, 307 are realistic bursters, and 238 of these produce 990 realistic HCOs (instances) when coupled with inhibitory synapses. That is, 25 bursters (out of 117 bursters that are not realistic) produced 65 realistic HCOs. All 307 realistic bursters produce HCOs when coupled with inhibitory synapses (16,805 HCO instances).</p>
<p>The vast majority of HCOs in the database are not composed of bursters isolated neurons but of spiking isolated neurons. For example, among 99,066 total realistic HCOs, only 1,055 (1.06%) were composed of bursters (263 instances) (including 990 realistic HCOs that were composed of realistic bursters (238 instances)) as stated above, but 94,487 (95.37%) were composed of spiking isolated neurons (12,443 instances) and 3,524 (3.56%) were composed of neurons classified as either bistable isolated neurons (3,096 HCOs from 820 isolated neuron instances), as irregular isolated neurons (368 HCOs from isolated neuron 55 instances), as silent isolated neurons (58 HCOs from 28 isolated neuron instances) or as plateau neurons (2 HCOs from 2 isolated neuron instances).Thus realistic HCOs could also consist of irregular (irregular bursters or irregular tonic firers), silent, or even bistable neurons. Previous work from our group shows that our burster instances have a high propensity for multistability and that mutual inhibition makes multistability much less prevalent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Marin1">[33]</xref>. Although we have not tested this idea systematically, we suspect that such multistability is present in the other classes of isolated neuron instances.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the activity of ten randomly selected instances from each of the four groups of interest, HCOs, realistic HCOs, bursters, and realistic bursters. The figure shows that the instances within each group display different combinations of parameter values despite having similar bursting activity. For example, the two instances shown in turquoise and orange from the realistic HCO group have the same period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and yet their parameters combinations are very different (colored connected lines <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates that the parameter values of the instances within each group have wide ranges for almost every parameter. Some patterns seem to emerge in the parameter ranges that support our four categories of bursting. For example, both HCO and realistic HCO instances are possible without h-current (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>h</sub> = 0), while both bursters and realistic bursters require at least 50% of the canonical level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>h</sub>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the intrinsic currents and synaptic conductances of two realistic instances randomly chosen from the ones presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g001">Figure 1</xref> (the realistic HCO shown in orange and the realistic burster shown in black). Both instances replicate (with respect to period and spike frequency, and for the realistic HCOs duty cycle) the oscillatory activity of leech HN interneurons, when coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). For the realistic HCO instance the leak reversal potential is E<sub>Leak</sub> = −55 mV (with <italic>minV<sub>m</sub></italic> = −59.5529<italic>mV</italic>), and for the realistic burster is E<sub>Leak</sub> = −65 mV (with <italic>minV<sub>m</sub></italic> = −55.4954<italic>mV</italic>). During the inhibited phase (interburst interval) of the burst cycle in the HCO, the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, I<sub>h</sub>, slowly activates, depolarizing the inhibited neuron toward a burst (escape). The persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, I<sub>P</sub>, also helps in depolarizing the inhibited neuron. The burst is formed by the rapid activation of slowly inactivating low threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> current, I<sub>CaS</sub> (I<sub>CaF</sub> is very small in most instances) and the inactivation of I<sub>CaS</sub> leads to its gradual decline leading to a reduced spike frequency and less inhibition of the opposite neuron (release). During the burst I<sub>P</sub> sustains depolarization and a baseline spike frequency, and the outward currents I<sub>K2</sub> and I<sub>Leak</sub> oppose; during the inhibited phase I<sub>P</sub> is opposed by the I<sub>Leak</sub> and the synaptic currents. The balance between I<sub>P</sub>, I<sub>Leak</sub>, and I<sub>K2</sub> appears crucial for maintaining the excitability of the system and setting the membrane potential about which the system oscillates (n.b. the −50 mV line). The spike currents I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>K2</sub> (I<sub>KA</sub> is small in most instances) do not directly participate in burst formation but simply provide a baseline of excitability against which the more persistent currents act. When the neurons are isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), done in the HCO model by setting the maximal conductances of both synapses to 0 (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynS</sub> = 0 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynG</sub> = 0), basically the same interactions apply except that only I<sub>Leak</sub> can oppose I<sub>P</sub> during the interburst interval and hyperpolarize the membrane potential sufficiently to activate I<sub>h</sub> (n.b. −50 mV line). The lack of inhibition leads to the apparent requirement for a relatively hyperpolarized E<sub>Leak</sub> in burster instances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Cymbalyuk1">[3]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g002">2</xref> illustrate the complex interactions of the membrane and synaptic currents and they also suggest potential interactions.

<p>To explore visually the relationships existing between two parameters and a group of instances, we plotted the number of instances within a group versus all the possible values for two parameters.

<title>Exploring linear relationships between parameters with PCA</title>
<p>To find interactions among the conductance parameters, we applied the Principal Component Analysis method (PCA) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) to each of our four groups of interest. For each group of interest, we plotted the percent of variability explained by each principal component (plots in panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g006">6</xref> for the realistic groups).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows the PCA results for the realistic HCOs group. The first six principal components accounted for 96.6% of the variance. There was not much difference between the variance values of the main principal components (the biggest difference of 4.6% was between PC 4 and PC 5), which indicates that all main principal components have similar importance for this group. For the first four PCs, the coefficients found for the realistic HCO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g005">Figure 5</xref>) differed from those of the HCO group (figure not shown). For PC 5 and PC 6, these coefficients were quite similar for the two groups of instances, meaning that these linear combinations of conductances have some similar small influence on both groups. However, since there is no major differences in the amount of variance accounted for by each component, we could not discriminate one or two of these sets of coefficients as being the most influential in the realistic group's activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that there are no linear relationships between any sets of parameters that characterize this group's activity (same situation for HCOs).</p>
<p>We also applied PCA analysis to the groups of bursters (figure not shown) and realistic bursters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g006">Figure 6</xref>). For both these groups the main principal components and their coefficients were remarkably similar. The first four (of the six total) components were main principal components that explained 96.88% and 97.32% respectively of the total variance. In both groups, there was a large difference between the amount of variance accounted for by the first and second components, which means the first component is the most important for these groups. The first component by itself explained 61.2% and 59.66% respectively, of the variance, which is very close to two-thirds of the total variance, so this component can be considered as sufficient to characterize the group or, for a more precise characterization, one can use the first three components, which together account for &gt;90.3% of the variance. The coefficients of conductances that generate each of the first four PCs for both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) have the same sign (positive or negative) and only small differences in their values.

<title>5D clickable view for exploring relationships between parameters</title>
<p>We developed a Matlab tool to visualize five characteristics of a data set at once: in the present case three parameters which form a 3D parameter space of the data, the number of instances projected onto each point in this space given by the size of each point, and a fourth parameter which becomes visible when a point in this space is clicked with the mouse button. Each point clicked unveils a pie chart of the 4th parameter showing all instances projected onto this point in the 3D space. The pie chart is split into slices according to the number of values possible for the 4<sup>th</sup> parameter: 5 slices if the 4<sup>th</sup> parameter is E<sub>Leak</sub> and in 8 slices each for the other parameters, with each slice having a different color. If there was no instance projected into the 3D space for a particular value of the 4<sup>th</sup> parameter, then its corresponding slice was not shown in the pie chart. For a better visualization of the points projected onto the 3D plot, their deepness (i.e., their z- axis parameter values) was color coded with a colormap starting from dark blue shades for closest points (at 0% values) to light blue shades for farthest points (at 175% values). Each projected point was depicted by a circle filled with the color according to this mapping.</p>
<p>We used this 5D clickable tool to visualize the characteristics of our groups of interest. For each main principal component (see previous section) of each group, we selected its three parameters with the biggest coefficients that have the same sign (either positive or negative) and then we selected the parameter with the biggest coefficient of the opposite sign. The first 3 parameters selected were the parameters of the 3D space used by our clickable tool, and the last one was used for plotting the pie chart of each point plotted.</p>

<p>We fitted a least square fit regression line to each group of points (3D Orthogonal Distance Regression (ODR) line). The 3D ODR line is least distant from all the points and contains the centroid of points, which is the 3D point that has the mean of the points on the three axes. The direction vector that defines the line is given by the coefficients for the first principal component (PC), i.e., the first column of the coefficients returned by the PCA (in our case Matlab's princomp function) when applied to the set of 3D points (see Supplemental Material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003678.s006">Text S1</xref> for detailed mathematics and the coefficients of each equation corresponding to the two ODR lines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g010">Figure 10</xref>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Orthogonal1">[34]</xref> for <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> explanation, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Example1">[35]</xref> for an example).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How does a given aspect of the electrical activity of neurons and networks change as the value of a parameter changes? Here, we focused on how intrinsic membrane and synaptic parameters interact to maintain functional bursting activity in an HCO model and in bursters from this HCO. Specifically, we asked how does the bursting activity of leech heart interneurons in isolation or in an HCO change by changing parameters in a defined parameter space? To systematically explore the parameter space of the HCO and corresponding burster models, in our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-DolocMihu1">[31]</xref>, we simulated about 10.5 million model instances, whose characteristics we recorded into a database named HCO-db <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-DolocMihu1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-HCOdb1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>We tried dimensional stacking and other techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Langton1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Taylor2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Hoffmann1">[37]</xref> to visualize globally the effect of parameter changes on activity type, but it was difficult to see the effects of all parameters. So we simplified by looking at the influence of only two parameters at a time (see Results, sub-section Visualizing interactions in pairwise parameter variations).</p>

I<sub>P</sub> is active throughout the burst cycle owing to it broad and shallow activation curve, and it provides the inward current that drives baseline spiking activity. I<sub>Leak</sub> is also active throughout the burst cycle and provides the outward current necessary for repolarization after the burst.

Each compartment contains 8 voltage-dependent currents, five inward currents I<sub>Na</sub> - a fast Na<sup>+</sup> current, I<sub>P</sub> - a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, I<sub>CaF</sub> - a rapidly inactivating low-threshold Ca current, I<sub>CaS</sub> - a slowly inactivating low-threshold Ca current, I<sub>h</sub> - a hyperpolarization-activated cation current) and three outward currents (I<sub>K1</sub> - a delayed rectifier-like K current, I<sub>K2</sub> - a persistent K current, I<sub>KA</sub> - a fast transient K current).

<p>In our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-DolocMihu1">[31]</xref>, we performed extensive simulations of this HCO model by systematically varying eight key parameters (a brute-force approach). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g002">Figures 2</xref> A and B show the intrinsic currents and the synaptic conductances of two randomly chosen simulated instances, one a realistic HCO and one a realistic burster.

After changing a parameter, we ran each model instance for 100 s to allow the system to establish stable activity, and then we ran it for another 100 s, from which we recorded the voltage traces of the electrical activity corresponding to its paired neurons and the corresponding spike times. The firing characteristics were analyzed and recorded into a database named HCO-db.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>Definitions</title>
<p>In voltage traces we recognized a <bold>spike</bold> only if the potential waveform crossed a threshold of −20 mV. We defined a <bold>burst</bold> as having at least three spikes and a minimum inter-burst interval of 1 second. We defined the <bold>cycle period</bold> as being the interval between the middle spikes of two consecutive bursts. <bold>Phase</bold> was calculated on a per cycle basis, as being the delay from the middle spike of a burst of neuron B to the middle spike of the preceding burst of neuron A divided by the interval from this middle spike of the next burst of neuron A to the middle spike of the preceding burst of neuron A. The <bold>duty cycle</bold> was defined as the percentage of the period occupied by a burst.</p>
<p>We defined a <bold>half-center oscillator</bold> instance (<bold>HCO</bold>) as having: two model interneurons each showing bursting activity with at least two bursts in a 40 s time interval, with each burst having normal spikes (coefficient of variation of the amplitudes of the spikes within any burst is less than 0.07); a small variation of period (coefficient of variation of period less than 0.05); relative phase in the range of (0.45–0.55); and at least one synaptic component present (either <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e442" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynS</sub>≠0, or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e443" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynG</sub>≠0, or both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e444" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynS</sub>≠0 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e445" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynG</sub>≠0). We considered a <bold>realistic HCO</bold> instance as being a HCO that showed realistic bursting corresponding to that observed in leech oscillator heart interneurons. Precisely, it was a HCO with period between 5–15 s, average spike frequency between 8–25 Hz, and duty cycle between 50–70%.</p>
<p>We defined an <bold>isolated neuron</bold> instance (<bold>isolated neuron</bold>) as having two identical interneurons (though started with different initial conditions, but otherwise identical), and no synaptic interaction (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e446" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynS</sub> = 0 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e447" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>SynG</sub> = 0). We defined a <bold>burster</bold> instance as being an isolated neuron instance for which both neurons had at least two bursts, each with normal spikes, and regular periods (as defined above for the HCOs). Note that burster instances can be thought of as being HCOs with no synaptic connections. We defined a <bold>realistic burster</bold> as being a burster that showed realistic bursting corresponding to isolated leech oscillator heart interneurons. Precisely, it was a burster with period between 5–15 s, and average spike frequency between 8–25 Hz. Note that realistic bursters can be thought of as being realistic HCOs with no synaptic connections. We define a <bold>family</bold> as being a sub-set (of a group) of instances that have all the same parameter values except one (e.g., all realistic bursters that vary only by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e448" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>P</sub> constitute a family).

<title>HCO database</title>
<p>In our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-DolocMihu1">[31]</xref>, we created a database of 10,485,760 HCO simulated model instances (HCO-db, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-HCOdb1">[32]</xref>) by systematically varying eight key parameters (a brute-force approach). The resulting parameter space includes 10,321,920 HCO instances which have at least one synaptic component present, and 163,840 isolated neuron instances which contain twin neurons without any synaptic interaction. By using our definitions above as criteria, we identified those simulated instances belonging to four groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-DolocMihu1">[31]</xref>: functional HCOs encompassing 1,202,139 HCO instances and their subset of realistic HCOs having 99,066 instances, and of bursters encompassing 424 instances, of and their subset of realistic bursters encompassing 307 instances out of the entire database. By querying the HCO-db, we efficiently explored the instances from these four groups to determine which and how intrinsic membrane and synaptic parameters affect their electrical activity. In particular, we were interested in defining the parameter values that can lead to functional output from this circuit that conforms to that observed in the living system. For this, we applied the following methods to our groups of HCO model instances.</p>

<title>Principal component analysis (PCA)</title>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool used in many fields for identifying potentially hidden patterns within a large multidimensional data set. PCA, proposed by Pearson in 1901 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Pearson1">[43]</xref>, is a mathematical method based on an orthogonal linear transformation that allows for dimensionality reduction of a multidimensional data set without too much loss of information. This transformation converts the original data set into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original variables. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. PCA allows for reducing the dimensionality of a data set by using only the first few principal components (considered the most important). The first principal component has the largest possible variance and each succeeding component in turn has the next highest variance possible and it is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the preceding components. Since all the principal components are orthogonal to each other, there is no redundant information.</p>
<p>We applied the principal component analysis (PCA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Pearson1">[43]</xref> to our four groups of interest. For this, we used the <italic>princomp</italic> function provided in the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-MATLAB1">[44]</xref> to obtain the principal components (PC) for each group. This function returns the coordinates of the original data in the new coordinate system defined by the principal components. We can visualize each group of instances within the 3D space defined by the first three principal components obtained for the respective group (plots not shown, see S3: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003678-g004">4</xref>). The <italic>princomp</italic> function also calculates the coefficients of the linear combinations of the original variables (our parameters) that generate the principal components. Each coefficient represents the importance of the respective parameter within the principal component (PC<sub>i</sub>  =  <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003678.e449" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where n is the number of the original parameters p<sub>j</sub>, and w<sub>i,j</sub> are the coefficients of these parameters for the principal component PC<sub>i</sub>). For each group of interest, we plotted the percent of variability explained by each principal component (see Results).</p>

<title>3D Orthogonal Regression Line</title>
<p>We used 3D Orthogonal Distance Regression (ODR) to assess the relationship between parameters identified in our PCA. Here we focus on the linear regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Linear1">[45]</xref>) and more precisely on the orthogonal linear regression method. The orthogonal linear regression method uses the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) method described above to fit a linear regression that minimizes the perpendicular distances from the data to the fitted model (least square fit is minimum). The method is also called Total Least Squares method or Principal Component Regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003678-Principal1">[46]</xref>). Basically, given a set of points in a 3D space, the ODR method uses the coefficients of the first PCA corresponding to the 3D points to find a line (called 3D ODR line) in this 3D space that is least distance from the points. Once found, this line shows the tendency or direction of the points within the 3D space with respect to the three axes of the space.</p>
