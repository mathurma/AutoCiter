Such approaches are increasingly being applied to genomics data, where functional linkages are used to connect genes or proteins. However, while microarray gene expression datasets are now abundant and of high quality, few approaches have been developed for analysis of such data in a network context. We present a novel approach for 3-D visualisation and analysis of transcriptional networks generated from microarray data. These networks consist of nodes representing transcripts connected by virtue of their expression profile similarity across multiple conditions. Analysing genome-wide gene transcription across 61 mouse tissues, we describe the unusual topography of the large and highly structured networks produced, and demonstrate how they can be used to visualise, cluster, and mine large datasets. This approach is fast, intuitive, and versatile, and allows the identification of biological relationships that may be missed by conventional analysis techniques.

Enormous amounts of data pertaining to the nature of genes and proteins and their interactions in the cell have now been generated by techniques including, but not limited to: gene coexpression analysis, yeast two-hybrid assays, mass spectrometry, and RNA interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b002">2</xref>]. Such functional genomics and proteomics approaches, when combined with computational biology and the emerging discipline of systems biology, finally allow us to begin comprehensive mapping of cellular and molecular networks and pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b004">4</xref>]. One of the main difficulties we currently face is how best to integrate these disparate data sources and use them to better understand biological systems in health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b005">5</xref>].</p><p>Visualisation and analysis of biological data as networks is becoming an increasingly important approach to explore a wide variety of biological relationships. Such approaches have already been used successfully in the study of sequence similarity, protein structure, protein interactions, and evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b008">8</xref>]. Shifting biological data into a graph/network paradigm allows one to use algorithms, techniques, ideas, and statistics previously developed in graph theory, engineering, computer science, and (more recently) computational systems biology. In classical graph theory, a graph or network consists of <italic>nodes</italic> connected by <italic>edges</italic>. For biological networks, nodes are usually genes, transcripts, or proteins, while edges tend to represent experimentally determined similarities or functional linkages between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b009">9</xref>].</p><p>Conventional analysis techniques are generally pairwise, where an individual relationship between two biological entities is studied without considering higher-order interactions with their neighbours. Graph and network analysis techniques allow the exploration of the position of a biological entity in the context of its local neighbourhood in the graph, and the network as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b007">7</xref>]. Another important advantage of such techniques is that for noisy datasets, spurious edges tend not to form structure (or cliques) in the resultant graph, but instead randomly link nodes; although this may not be the case for data generated by techniques with inherent technical biases. Because many network analysis techniques (e.g., graph clustering) exploit local structure in networks between biologically related nodes, they are far less troubled by inherent noise, which may confound conventional pairwise approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>One example of network analysis is the clustering of protein–protein similarity and interaction networks. These techniques illustrate that graph clustering (i.e., clustering genes/proteins with respect to their graph context, rather than iterative pairwise clustering) performs extremely well and allows the discovery of novel aspects of biological function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b007">7</xref>]. Such techniques can hence provide insight into both local features of networks (e.g., prediction of pathways or functional modules) and also global features of the network (e.g., small-world behaviour and centrality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b012">12</xref>]).</p><p>Although network analysis of biological data has shown great promise, little attention has been paid to microarray gene expression data. These data are now abundant, generally of high quality, and consist of the type of high-dimensional data for which such approaches are well-suited. In principle, transformation of gene expression data into a network graph holds few challenges. The similarity between individual expression profiles may be determined by one of a number of possible statistical techniques, e.g., the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b013">13</xref>]. Networks can be constructed by connecting transcripts (nodes) by edges that infer varying degrees of coexpression based on an arbitrary correlation threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b014">14</xref>]. Indeed, a number of groups have previously sought to apply the network paradigm to microarray data, establishing relationships between genes based on correlation of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b018">18</xref>]. While these studies have suggested the power of this approach, limitations in the functionality and visualisation capabilities of the tools supporting their attempts have severely limited their approaches for general application.</p><p>In this manuscript, we describe the development and application of a new network analysis tool, BioLayout <italic>Express</italic><sup>3D</sup>, that facilitates the construction, visualisation, clustering, and analysis of microarray gene expression data. Specifically, we chose to analyse the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) mouse tissue gene expression atlas to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b019">19</xref>]. The GNF data was generated so as to provide a genome-wide analysis of transcript abundance across a wide range of normal tissue and cell types. This dataset represents one of the most complete systematic studies of tissue-specific expression in the mammalian transcriptome to date. However, in common with other large datasets, analysis of these data presents significant challenges. Certain genes are known to only be expressed by a single cell type, at specific times during development, or in response to explicit stimuli. Others are thought to be expressed by all cells simultaneously at about the same level. Between these two extremes, there are many other genes that are expressed in most or a number of cell types, but whose transcription may be regulated to give a specific temporal and spatial pattern of expression. It is also known that genes that play distinct roles in a common pathway or biological process are often expressed in a similar manner; i.e., they are coexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b020">20</xref>]. Hence, when genes are found to have analogous expression profiles, this may indicate that the genes have linked functional activities. To better understand aspects of gene regulation and the functional role of the encoded proteins, we chose to explore the utility of network analysis to explore the innate structure of this dataset. We demonstrate that this approach can accurately locate clusters of genes sharing similar network connectivity (expression pattern), the relationships between these clusters, and statistical analysis of functional annotations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of Networks from Microarray Expression Data</title><p>Generation of network graphs from gene expression data uses the Pearson correlation coefficient as a measure of similarity between expression profiles. An expression profile is defined as the data derived from the range of samples analysed, originating from an individual probe (-set). Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for every probe-set on the array and correlation coefficients above a predefined threshold used to draw edges between genes (nodes) in the construction of network graphs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Without imposing a correlation threshold, every node would be connected to every other with a weighted edge (−1.0 ≥ <italic>p</italic> ≤ 1.0). Obviously, the resulting graphs would be overly large and dominated by uninformative edges. Hence, this initial thresholding is used to define a starting point for subsequent analysis, and nodes (probes) with no connections above the selected threshold are removed from the graph. The size of the graph produced is therefore dependent on the threshold level selected. At low Pearson correlation coefficient cutoffs (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.8), graphs are (too) large with many nodes and edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g001">1</xref>B). At higher thresholds, the networks consist of a smaller number of genes and tend to be more useful for most analyses. This relationship is illustrated using a “landscape” plot that we have developed, which provides a view of the innate structure within the GNF mouse atlas dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g001">1</xref>D). This representation is a uniquely determined transformation of a dendrogram to a histogram (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030206-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030206.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Relationship between Pearson Correlation Coefficient of Expression Profiles and Node Inclusion into Networks</title><p>As the Pearson threshold decreases, the number of (nonsingleton) nodes (A) and edges connecting these nodes (B) increases, resulting in larger networks. The red dotted lines show this relationship for MAS5 scaled data, and black dotted lines show gcRMA normalised data. “Landscape” plots (C–D) also demonstrate the inherent structure within the data and the effect of different normalisation methods. All probe-set pairs with a Pearson correlation coefficient ≥0.7 have been plotted, each probe-set joining the graph nearest to the probe-set(s) to which it shares this relationship. The resultant “landscape” shows a number of peaks corresponding to groups of genes sharing similar expression profiles. The data corresponding to individual probe-sets have been coloured according to the maximum signal across all samples: red denotes the top third of transcripts with the highest maximum expression; green, the middle third, and black, the lowest third. The dashed black line (C) denotes the Pearson threshold used for subsequent analyses.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030206.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>This representation is in many ways analogous to a dendrogram; however, here each bar in this plot represents a probe-set. The height of this bar corresponds to the Pearson correlation at which a probe first connects to another probe-set connected to network at a higher correlation coefficient. Hence, groups of genes that share high degrees of correlation in their expression appear as peaks within the landscape. A horizontal partitioning of the graph at a given Pearson threshold indicates those groups of genes that would form graphs above that threshold. Each disconnected peak above the Pearson threshold forms a separate graph.</p><p>These plots show that different normalisation strategies (gcRMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b022">22</xref>] and MAS5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b024">24</xref>]) markedly alter connectivity structures of the data and the characteristics of each network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It is interesting to observe that when the data corresponding to individual probe-sets are coloured according to the maximum signal across all samples, peaks are generally composed of genes that are highly expressed (red) in at least one sample. Indeed, almost all 16,104 probe-sets comprising the MAS5 landscape are drawn from data in the top two-thirds (red, green) of expressed data. In contrast, not only are there far more probe-sets included in the landscape of the gcRMA data (indicating a general increase in the connectivity of the data), but there is clearly more low-intensity data (black) being drawn into the graph. Quantile normalisation reduces the inherent randomness of low-intensity data, which increases its potential to form connections with other low-intensity data. Because of this and the fact that gcRMA assumes that all the data to be compared should have a similar distribution (which may well not be the case when comparing RNA from different tissues), we chose to concentrate on data normalised by MAS5 scaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Characteristics of the Derived Network</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g002">2</xref>B illustrate the relationship between the Pearson correlation threshold chosen and the number of nodes (probe-sets) and edges between them in the network graph(s) of the mouse transcriptome. Increasing the Pearson threshold removes edges and large networks fragment into multiple disconnected graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

Although many nodes have numerous connections (average degree = 165.5), the overall diameter of the network is large and the clustering coefficient is high (22 and 0.69, respectively; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). These metrics indicate a highly structured graph amenable to graph-based analysis and clustering. This effect is distinctly nonrandom, as randomised networks (with the same degree and size) exhibit a far lower diameter and clustering coefficient (5 and 0.34). These results compare favourably with other networks that have been generated previously (IntAct, Lehner-Fraser, and STRING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b037">37</xref>]). In fact, the gene expression graph has almost twice the diameter and clustering coefficient of these graphs. These results also hold when the GNF1M network is considered at 0.7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030206-t001">Table 1</xref>). It is this innate structure in the graph that is exploited by the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for clustering.</p><p>The highly structured nature of this network illustrates that local network topology is primarily driven by biological relationships between gene expression across tissues. An example of network connectivity is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) derived at <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.9. It is clear that a relatively large number of the nodes in the network have a high degree of connectivity. This is well above the number that might be expected if the network conformed to a linear power-law distribution. At lower Pearson thresholds, we may expect a large number of spurious edges. However, such edges tend to be added to the network in a random manner and are highly unlikely to form structured cliques in the derived network that could be mistakenly identified as biologically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Visualisation of the Network</title><p>The resulting graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g003">Figure 3</xref>) is a weighted nondirected graph consisting of probes connected by their coexpression values (<italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.7). Visual representation of such data is especially desirable, as it is far easier for humans to infer relationships and identify structural features from a visual standpoint. We use a highly optimised weighted Fruchterman-Rheingold layout algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b025">25</xref>] to quickly determine a reasonable layout of the network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Due to the size and complexity of the resulting graphs, we performed this layout in 3-D and used the OpenGL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b026">26</xref>] specification to allow us to render this complex 3-D graph interactively (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The resulting visualisation of the network allows for interactive analysis of very large networks (up to 10<sup>5</sup> nodes and 10<sup>6</sup> edges) using generally available hardware and accelerated graphics cards. This visualisation acts as a common interface for all of the subsequent analysis described below. Furthermore, the visualisation allows the user to quickly identify structures and features in the graph by eye that would not have been obvious previously. The approach also has the distinct advantage of using no prior assumptions as to the likely structure within the data (e.g., number of clusters) or questions to be addressed.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030206-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030206.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Untiled (Organic Layout) of GNF1M Network Graphs at Different Pearson Correlation Thresholds</title><p>Graphs show the mouse tissue transcription network graphs when the Pearson threshold is a set at (A) 0.98 (1,421 nodes, 69,334 edges), (B) 0.95 (2,860 nodes, 201,724 edges), and (C) 0.90 (5,410 nodes, 447,467 edges).

Graph-clustering techniques are ideal for partitioning structured graphs into node clusters based on local neighbourhood topology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b027">27</xref>]. Here we use the MCL algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b027">27</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). One distinct advantage of MCL is its ability to avoid incorrect clustering assignments in the presence of spurious edges (false positives). This is due to the fact that MCL discovers clusters by virtue of nodes sharing higher-order connectivity in their local neighbourhood and not merely pairwise linkages. Randomly placing edges in a graph may produce novel pairwise connections, but is unlikely to form ordered local structures (cliques) that would influence MCL clustering significantly.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we devised an experiment in which we took the GNF1M 0.9 Pearson network and randomly added Gaussian noise to edge weights. The modified network was clustered using both MCL and a conventional single-linkage clustering algorithm to compare distances from their original clusterings. This shows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030206-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) that even a small amount of noise (e.g., 0.01 standard deviation) produces a profound effect on single-linkage clustering (2%–4% deviation) but little effect on MCL clusters (0.1%–0.3%). Similarly, larger amounts of noise (e.g., 0.05) significantly disrupt (3%–13% deviation) single-linkage clusters with relatively little effect to MCL clusterings (0.3%–1.5% deviation). The MCL algorithm has also been shown to work exceptionally well for clustering structured graphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b028">28</xref>]. Below, we show that such expression graphs are indeed highly structured and, as such, are well-suited to MCL clustering. We believe these features further support the use of MCL clustering on transcription networks and represent an attractive alternative to conventional approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Structure of the Mouse Tissue Transcription Network and Biological Interpretation of Clusters</title><p>We explored the GNF1M expression data at a range of Pearson correlation thresholds and clustered at various MCL (v06–058) inflation values. We settled on a Pearson threshold of 0.9 and an MCL inflation value of 2.2 to fragment the data into biologically meaningful clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This was determined empirically based on maintaining a conservative balance between layout and clustering. Below this Pearson threshold, although new genes are added to the graph, they do not form any major new gene-dense network structures, instead being merely additions to, or forming bridges between, the structures already formed. A detailed view of a number of connected clusters is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) together with the expression data underlying their clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). To simplify this view across the whole network, it is possible to draw a cluster graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) in which all nodes within a cluster are condensed into a single node representing that cluster whose volume reflects the number of members within each cluster. This view allows one to see how individual clusters are connected by virtue of their constituent nodes sharing coexpression across clusters.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030206-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030206.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Tiled Graphs of the Network Formed from the GNF Mouse Tissue Data Using a 0.9 Pearson Correlation Threshold</title><p>(A) For simplicity, the network is shown as collapsed MCL clusters (inflation value 2.2).

Plotting the average signal of the major node-clusterings in this graph over the tissues in which they are predominately expressed, one can see how expression profiles of the underlying genes change from one cluster to the next (C). Cluster 6 genes (yellow) for instance show a marked specificity for the kidney expression, whereas cluster 4 (green) genes are predominantly liver-specific. In the middle of these two clusters lies cluster 5 (purple), whose genes are expressed in both organs. The closer genes sit in the network to clusters 4 or 6, the stronger their expression will be in one tissue relative to the other. A similar relationship is true for small intestine (cluster 3)– and large intestine (clusters 1 and 2)–specific genes, with certain intestinally expressed genes also being expressed in the liver and kidney, connecting the expression networks of these two organ systems.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030206.g004" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>All major tissues were found to have a certain number of genes expressed specifically within. It is interesting to note that by far the largest two clusters are associated with genes expressed predominately in the organs associated with gamete production (testis, 888 transcripts; and fertilised egg/oocyte, 753 transcripts; respectively). By contrast, the next largest cluster of liver-specific genes contains only 162 transcripts. Several major clusters appear to originate from genes expressed specifically, but across a number of tissues. These appear to originate from cell-specific genes expressed in cells performing a similar function in a number of tissues, e.g., keratins, myosins, etc. Indeed, it can be argued that all the genes present in this network represent cell-specific expression. However, when a number of genes are coexpressed specifically in the same tissue, it is impossible to know whether they are expressed in the same tissue-specific cell type.</p><p>The layout data in this manner has a number of distinct advantages. The position of each node (gene) within the network can be determined relative to its immediate neighbours; i.e., genes that are closest in expression (share edges) to that selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, the relationship between clusters can also be easily assessed. Indeed, adjoining clusters tend to share a degree of commonality in the expression of those genes that comprise them, but also have distinct differences. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030206-g004">4</xref>B show the network of expression formed between regions of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney. Genes are expressed in a continuum from tissue-specific to organ-specific.</p><p>Looking for evidence of biological relevance in these gene clusters, a number of features are immediately apparent. Clusters tend to encapsulate a large number of technical replicates (multiple probe-sets designed to the same gene), and multiple members of the same gene family are frequently observed in the same cluster; nodes representing these probe-sets frequently are directly linked to each other in the networks. Furthermore, analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b029">29</xref>] descriptions for the genes making up clusters consistently shows significant overrepresentation of gene functions that one would naturally associate with their observed pattern of expression. These associations are known to be coupled with coexpressed (cofunctional) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b020">20</xref>].</p><p>We have been interested previously in the relationship between the tissue specificity of gene expression and the evolutionary origin and function of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b031">31</xref>]. By dividing mouse “atlas” data up into a number of bins depending on the number of tissues in which they are expressed, we were able to demonstrate that tissue-specific genes, particularly those with signal transduction and transcription factor activity, tend to have evolved later and are more likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Our ability to explore these relationships further, however, was severely constrained at that time due to limitations of analysis packages available. We therefore sought to revisit this interesting phenomenon. As described previously, genes represented on the GNF1M chip were assigned as belonging to one of four phylogenetic groups depending on our ability to identify common ancestral proteins across species: universal, eukaryotic, metazoan, and mammalian. These data were filtered so as to remove redundant probe-sets detecting expression from the same genetic locus. Having first laid out the nonredundant data and clustered it (<italic>p</italic> = 0.9; MCL inflation 2.2), we were able to interrogate the clusters as to their representation of the phylogenetic age of the genes that composed them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030206-t002">Table 2</xref>). The set of genes featured in this network tend to be those that share a high degree of tissue specificity in their expression. As a whole, genes from all four phylogenetic classifications were represented in the graphs but without bias in any classification relative to all genes on the microarray. Calculation of classification biases was performed using an inbuilt Fisher's test of BioLayout <italic>Express</italic><sup>3D</sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), comparing class frequencies in clusters to the graph as a whole. At the tissue level, however, while some clusters of tissue/cell-specific genes showed no bias toward any phylogenetic grouping, others did. A number of the major clusters were clearly enriched with genes that have evolved at different times. Immunologically related gene clusters, particularly those associated with T cell and/or B cell–specific expression and placenta-specific genes, were found to be enriched for mammalian-specific genes. More surprising perhaps was the observation that genes expressed predominantly in the testis were also enriched for mammalian-specific genes. However, evaluation of the functional significance of this observation is limited, as few of these genes have yet to be assigned any functionality or description. In contrast, liver and/or kidney gene clusters showed a significant bias in favour of ancient (universal) genes, many of which appear to encode proteins performing basic metabolic processes that have over time become compartmentalised in the liver and kidney. As such, these data support the evolution of tissue-specific pathways and functions at different times. These observations also suggest that one of the dominant evolutionary pressures on patterns of gene expression is driven by the need to compartmentalise functions of the encoded proteins. The expression of old genes performing functions crucial to survival can become confined to one tissue, as in the case with many liver/kidney-specific proteins, presumably through evolution of new regulatory sequences or by continuing to play a housekeeping role in all cells. Clearly, more recently evolved genes can also evolve to be universally expressed. However, where they encode for proteins involved in functions not present in lower organisms, their expression is more likely to show a tissue-specific expression pattern, as their evolution is tied with the evolution and function of a cell or tissue type.</p><table-wrap content-type="2col" id="pcbi-0030206-t002" position="float"><object-id

Subsequently, a histogram is created on all the joining events corresponding with the pairs of subsequent genes in the ordered list. This number of events is one less than the number of genes. The height of a joining event is simply the Pearson threshold at which the two genes become part of the same component.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Visualisation engine.</title><p>The Java OpenGL (JOGL) library is significantly faster than native Java2D rendering. The network is rendered using optimised OpenGL display lists that make use of hardware acceleration available on most modern graphics cards. This results in an interactive 3-D representation of the network that is fast enough for very large graphs. The limiting step here is generally the memory storage requirements for large graphs and not the rendering itself. In the final 3-D representation, nodes are displayed as spheres or points connected by edges coloured according to their correlation. The user can interact with the representation by zooming, scaling, rotation, translation, and selection of the graph. A built-in annotation and expression viewer allows groups of selected nodes to be compared in terms of their coexpression and annotations. Using the annotation viewer, it is possible to colour the network according to annotation and hide/show nodes that possess specific annotation(s). Whilst improvements in the layout and visualisation capabilities of BioLayout <italic>Express</italic><sup>3D</sup> have been specifically tailored toward large expression graphs, analysis of networks derived from other data sources is also considerably enhanced.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Graph clustering.</title><p>We use the MCL algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b027">27</xref>] to cluster this network according to connectivity and local structure. The MCL algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b027">27</xref>] is designed specifically for the clustering of simple or weighted graphs. It has previously been used in many fields, including computational graph clustering, detection of protein families from similarity graphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b007">7</xref>], and the isolation of functional modules from protein–protein interaction graphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b028">28</xref>]. BioLayout <italic>Express</italic><sup>3D</sup> calls MCL, passes the current network and clustering parameters, and receives back from MCL a list of nodes and their cluster assignments. These cluster assignments are added to the network as annotation data and provide a basis for statistical analysis of annotation terms across clusters. MCL exploits the observation that the number of “higher-length” (longer) paths between two arbitrary nodes in a natural cluster is high. In particular, this number should be high, relative to node pairs lying in <italic>different</italic> natural clusters. The MCL algorithm finds cluster structure in graphs by a mathematical bootstrapping procedure. The process deterministically computes (the probabilities of) random walks through the graph, and uses two operators transforming one set of probabilities into another. It does so using the language of stochastic matrices (also called Markov matrices) that captures the mathematical concept of random walks on a graph.</p><p>The MCL algorithm simulates random walks within a graph by alternation of two operators called <italic>expansion</italic> and <italic>inflation</italic>. Expansion coincides with taking the power of a stochastic matrix using the normal matrix product (i.e., matrix squaring). Inflation corresponds with taking the Hadamard power of a matrix (taking powers entrywise), followed by a scaling step, such that the resulting matrix is stochastic again, i.e., the matrix elements (on each column) correspond to probability values.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Statistical analysis of clusters.</title><p>When annotated data is used to generate a clustered network, it is possible to locate annotations present within a cluster that occur more frequently than one would expect by chance. This has been shown to work extremely well for commonly used descriptive terms such as those provided by GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b029">29</xref>], pathway membership, although BioLayout <italic>Express</italic><sup>3D</sup> allows such analysis for any annotation terms assigned to nodes. Frequencies of annotation terms assigned to the original data are stored in memory and used as control frequencies. The frequency of terms within a cluster are then calculated, and overrepresentation is calculated as:

				</p><p>The significance of the observed overrepresentations is then examined by performing a large number (1,000) of random control experiments in which the same number of randomly selected genes are examined for overrepresentation.

				</p><p>GO terms were flattened to a specific level by first counting for each term how many steps were required (minimum) to get to the root of the tree for that term. A specific annotation term could then be flattened to lower levels by moving up the tree to the desired level. Annotation terms that were already below the desired level were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Fisher's test.</title><p>To get another estimate of the statistical significance of a term in a cluster, we also implemented the two-sided Fisher's exact test in a similar way to other methods (e.g., GoMiner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b038">38</xref>], a widely accepted and used tool for microarray functional analysis). The appropriateness of the Fisher's test in this context has been stated previously, with the proviso that it be used judiciously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030206-b038">38</xref>]. A Bonferroni correction is used to correct Fisher's <italic>p</italic>-values for multiple testing. For pragmatic reasons, we combined all three measures into an overall score using a simple function. Relative entropy is used as a direct proportional measure, whereas Fisher's <italic>p</italic>-values and the member count are combined in a discrete-valued function. This modulation function is a product of an empiric quality measure (1 is best, 0.01 is worst) for the Fisher's <italic>p</italic>-values and the member count, respectively. The final overall score is the product of relative entropy and the modulation value. The resulting scoring system can be used for ranking large annotation lists. The final decision is made by a human expert, but the system suggests and presents highly relevant terms</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Software availability.</title><p>BioLayout is written in Java and is available as an executable .jar file from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biolayout.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.biolayout.org</ext-link>.
