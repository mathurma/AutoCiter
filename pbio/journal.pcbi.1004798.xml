<abstract>
<p>For many animals, chemosensation is essential for guiding social behavior. However, because multiple factors can modulate levels of individual chemical cues, deriving information about other individuals via natural chemical stimuli involves considerable challenges. How social information is extracted despite these sources of variability is poorly understood. The vomeronasal system provides an excellent opportunity to study this topic due to its role in detecting socially relevant traits. Here, we focus on two such traits: a female mouse’s strain and reproductive state. In particular, we measure stimulus-induced neuronal activity in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) in response to various dilutions of urine, vaginal secretions, and saliva, from estrus and non-estrus female mice from two different strains. We first show that all tested secretions provide information about a female’s receptivity and genotype. Next, we investigate how these traits can be decoded from neuronal activity despite multiple sources of variability. We show that individual neurons are limited in their capacity to allow trait classification across multiple sources of variability. However, simple linear classifiers sampling neuronal activity from small neuronal ensembles can provide a substantial improvement over that attained with individual units. Furthermore, we show that some traits are more efficiently detected than others, and that particular secretions may be optimized for conveying information about specific traits. Across all tested stimulus sources, discrimination between strains is more accurate than discrimination of receptivity, and detection of receptivity is more accurate with vaginal secretions than with urine. Our findings highlight the challenges of chemosensory processing of natural stimuli, and suggest that downstream readout stages decode multiple behaviorally relevant traits by sampling information from distinct but overlapping populations of AOB neurons.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Across the animal kingdom, chemical senses play a central role in guiding social behaviors by conveying information about particular behaviorally relevant traits. However, decoding these traits from profiles of chemical cues is challenging since cue levels are modulated by multiple factors. Here, we investigate how the mouse vomeronasal system, a chemosensory system important for processing social information, detects behaviorally relevant traits from natural stimuli. We focus on detection of a female’s genetic background (a model for individuality) and estrus-state (a measure of sexual receptivity) by neurons in the first vomeronasal brain relay, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). We show that information about both genetic background and receptivity can be obtained from various stimulus sources: urine, vaginal secretions, and saliva. Importantly, while individual AOB neurons can only provide limited decoding ability of these traits, simple networks sampling AOB neuronal ensembles provide considerable improvement. Our analyses highlight an overlooked challenge associated with chemosensory processing and suggest how it can be overcome by downstream neurons that read information from multiple AOB neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social animals are extremely adept at extracting information about conspecifics and many species rely on chemosensory cues to achieve this goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref003">3</xref>]. Yet, deriving information about specific traits pertaining to other individuals can be complicated by several factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref004">4</xref>]. One factor is physical variability, for example due to stimulus source dilution. Namely, if a given trait is associated with a particular level of some compound, dilution or concentration of the stimulus source could confound correct trait detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref005">5</xref>]. Another factor is the influence of multiple ecologically relevant traits on the levels of any one type of molecule. For example, analysis of mouse urinary compound levels as a function of genetic background and reproductive state indicates that both factors modulate the levels of all tested compounds. In some cases, even the <italic>direction of change</italic> as a function of reproductive state varies with the genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref006">6</xref>]. A third factor involves the stimulus source identity. Many animals, including rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref008">8</xref>], investigate multiple body regions of conspecifics and thus inevitably sample different secretions. Compound concentrations likely differ across secretions and interpretation of their content must thus account for the secretion sampled. Given these sources of variability, reliable detection of any trait becomes a significant computational challenge.</p>
<p>Here, we explore the neural representation of genetic background (a model for identity) and female estrus-stage (a measure of receptivity), two traits that are critical for a male mouse to guide reproductive behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref010">10</xref>]. We study neuronal responses at the level of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), the first brain stage receiving vomeronasal inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref011">11</xref>]. The vomeronasal system (VNS) is ideal for this study as its role in the detection of both of these traits is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref016">16</xref>]. In particular, the two donor strains used here (BALB/c and C57BL/6), are clearly distinguishable by mice in the context of the vomeronasal-system mediated pregnancy block effect (The Bruce effect) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref018">18</xref>]. Furthermore, physiological recordings reveal that responses of vomeronasal sensory neurons, and of AOB neurons, are modulated by both the reproductive state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref022">22</xref>], and the strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>An important element in this study is the parallel investigation of multiple chemosensory stimulus sources: urine, saliva and vaginal secretions. While urine has been extensively studied as a chemosensory stimulus source in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref027">27</xref>], saliva and vaginal secretions have received much less attention. Here we show for the first time that neurons in the AOB respond to all these secretions in a strain and reproductive-state specific manner. However, we find a major difference between sensitivity to a certain trait and the ability to reliably detect it in the presence of multiple sources of variability. Thus, while many individual neurons can provide some information about these traits, any one neuron in isolation is generally insufficient to provide invariant information about them. We show, however, that integration of information across multiple neurons considerably improves trait detection, and that the detection does not rely on a small number of specialist neurons. Our study highlights the complexities of extracting socially relevant information from chemosensory cues, yet also suggests that relatively simple networks can overcome these challenges.</p>

<title>AOB responses to multiple stimulus sources reflect the donor’s strain and estrus state</title>
<p>We initially tested whether AOB responses to urine, saliva and vaginal secretions can convey the strain and the state of the stimulus donor. Recordings were performed in anesthetized BALB/c males (BC), using multi-electrode arrays. The electrodes were targeted to the AOB external cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) which contains the cell bodies of AOB projection neurons, known as AOB mitral/tufted cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref011">11</xref>]. Stimuli were collected from estrus and non-estrus adult BC and C57BL/6 (C57) female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows examples of twelve different units, each of which is modulated by the stimulus donor’s reproductive state (left), or its strain (right), for one of the three secretions.</p>

<title>Classification approach</title>
<p>While clearly selective to the females’ reproductive-state or strain, the examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g002">Fig 2</xref> are limited to a single pairwise comparison, in which only one trait is varied with all other factors remaining identical. To investigate how invariant representations of strain and state can be attained, we assume the position of a decoder with access to AOB neuronal activity. Unless specified otherwise, we use a simple linear classifier—a perceptron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref028">28</xref>]—whose goal is to discriminate among trait values. As inputs, the classifier accepts single-trial responses, defined as averaged firing rate changes calculated during the 40 s period following stimulus presentation. The rate change is defined with respect to the 30 s period preceding vomeronasal stimulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1D</xref> shows one such single trial (highlighted by the red rasters), used to derive a single value characterizing the neuron’s response (indicated by bar on right side). The broad 40 s time-window was chosen to account for the slow and temporally variable responses of AOB neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g002">Fig 2</xref>). A classifier generally receives inputs from multiple neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), with single-trial responses sampled independently from each of the neurons. For each classification, we train the classifier with one set of single-trial responses (training set, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Materials and Methods</xref>), obtaining a set of weights and a bias term. Following training, classifier performance is tested on a different set of single-trial responses (test set). We first train the classifier with all units in the dataset, and then sequentially remove the unit assigned with the smallest absolute weight. Unless indicated otherwise, classification results denote an average over 10 training cycles. Repeated training cycles were conducted to account for randomness in the training and testing steps.</p>

<title>Testing the effect of physical variability: Deriving reproductive state information from various dilutions of vaginal secretions</title>
<p>Vaginal secretions are likely to play an important chemosensory role during anogenital investigation of females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref029">29</xref>]. However, it is not known what type of behaviorally relevant information can be derived from this stimulus by the VNS. We thus first focused on decoding reproductive state from vaginal secretions. Our dataset includes 92 AOB units (38 single-units, 54 multi-units, 8 sites from 5 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1C</xref> set 1, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s001">S1 Table</xref>) that responded to at least one of the 12 stimuli at the 0.05 significance level. The mode, median and mean number of significant responses per unit is 1, 3, and 4.0, respectively (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s005">S2 Fig</xref>, which also shows that the fraction of responsive units increases with stimulus concentration). Recording site locations of the 92 responding units spanned the entire anterior-posterior aspect of the AOB, indicating that AOB neurons receiving both basal and apical vomeronasal sensory inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref030">30</xref>] were sampled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s004">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The normalized response profiles of all units included in this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. We began with the simplest discrimination, involving two reproductive states, while all other stimulus properties (dilution and strain) remain identical. In our dataset, with two strains and three dilutions, this amounts to six <italic>simple</italic> discriminations (indicated by the black lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The classification performance as a function of the number of units, averaged across all 6 pairwise comparisons, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3C</xref> (mean classifier, solid black lines). The traces reveal that even with individual units, all six discriminations can be made with a very high success rate.</p>

<p>We next asked if a classifier trained on one dilution performs well on stimuli at a different dilution. For example, how does a classifier trained to distinguish estrus from non-estrus C57 vaginal secretions at 3x dilution perform on a 1x dilution of the same stimuli? The gray double-headed arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3B</xref> indicate the twelve possible tests of generalization. The arrows are double-headed to indicate that two reciprocal tests of generalization can be made with each pair of dilutions. The resulting classifications, whose average is shown by the gray line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, reveal that generalization across dilutions is only slightly better than chance. In this context, it is interesting to note that different urine concentrations were shown to convey different signals, via activation of distinct populations of vomeronasal sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref022">22</xref>]. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s006">S3A–S3F Fig</xref>, for a more detailed description of classification results, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s007">S4 Fig</xref> for a detailed examination of generalization across specific dilutions.</p>
<p>Do these observation imply that a classifier cannot perform well across different dilutions of a stimulus? To answer this, we next trained a classifier to discriminate estrus state across <italic>all</italic> vaginal secretion dilutions (separately for each strain), as illustrated by the orange lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3D</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3E</xref> shows that robust classification is indeed possible with a simple linear classifier, even across a range of dilutions. Yet, multiple neurons are needed to achieve maximal performance. Using the neuron removal approach, we observe that roughly 10 units allow classification with a success rate of about 95%. These analyses indicate that classification across dilutions requires explicit training and that polling multiple units provides a substantial benefit.</p>

<title>Exploring the effect of intrinsic variability: Deriving reproductive state information from different strains</title>
<p>We next address the effect of changing one trait on the ability to discriminate another. Specifically, we test how the two dilution-invariant classifiers, each of which was trained on one strain, perform on stimuli from the other strain. These comparisons are indicated by the double-headed arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3D</xref>. The averaged classification performance is shown in gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3E</xref>. Regardless of the number of units used for classification, generalization across strains yields near chance performance, revealing that the effect of one trait on another is indeed significant. Finally, we trained a classifier to discriminate reproductive state across <italic>both</italic> dilutions and strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Although the classifier’s performance plateaued at a lower level, and required more units than the less general classifiers, it clearly yielded above-chance performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>The unit removal approach often underestimates the performance of the best individual unit. We therefore also include this value, for comparison, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3C, 3E and 3G</xref> as a broken line (when multiple classifiers are present, the line represents their average). The thick solid line in each of these panels shows the maximal perceptron performance. This value represents the best classification performance over the 10 repeated training and classification cycles, with all units considered. Thus, comparison of the thick solid line with the dotted line in each panel shows the benefit of decoding with multiple units over that possible with any individual unit. While this advantage is minor for the simple classifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), it is substantial for the more general classifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3E and 3G</xref>). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s014">S11 Fig</xref> for additional analyses showing the limited decoding capacity of individual units.</p>

<title>Different secretions are optimized to convey information about particular traits</title>
<p>Our analysis thus far was based on one stimulus source (vaginal secretions) and one type of discrimination (reproductive state). We next expand the analysis to another discrimination (strain) and to another secretion (urine). The comparison across discriminations and secretions reveals some general principles but also some notable differences.</p>
<p>The urine dataset comprises 51 units (25 single units, 26 multi-units) that responded to at least one of the 12 urine stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, set 2). Detailed descriptions of the number of units per session and recording site locations, spanning the entire anterior-posterior aspect of the AOB, are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s001">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s004">S1 Fig</xref>. For the 51 responding units, the mode, median and mean number of significant responses per unit was 1, 3, and 3.4, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s005">S2 Fig</xref>, which also shows that the number of responsive units increases with stimulus concentration).</p>
<p>Complete descriptions for VS and urine classifications are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s006">S3A–S3L Fig</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g004">Fig 4</xref> summarizes the classification performance to facilitate comparison across the various cases. To fairly compare the VS and urine datasets (the latter containing fewer units), we consider performance with 50 units. The similarities are highlighted by noting that for both secretions and for both traits, discriminations involving more sources of variability result in poorer performance (panels 4A-D). Comparison of the left-side panels (4A, C) and the right-side panels (4B, D), reveals that for both secretions, strain discriminations are more successful than state discriminations. Comparing the upper and lower panels, particularly for the more difficult, general classifications (red bars), shows that while strain discriminations are marginally better with urine stimuli (4C vs. 4A), state discriminations are considerably more successful with vaginal secretions (4B vs. 4D). Thus, in the context of vomeronasal chemosensation, different secretions seem optimized for conveying distinct socially relevant traits.</p>

<title>Generalization across stimulus sources</title>
<p>Many mammals, and mice in particular, investigate each other in a manner that inevitably samples multiple stimulus sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref007">7</xref>]. From a decoder’s perspective, the challenge is that levels of different cues, and their dependence on particular traits, could vary across secretions. This consideration is particularly relevant in the context of slow vomeronasal sampling, which can lead to mixing of stimuli from different sources within the vomeronasal organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>In the foregoing analyses, each classifier was trained and tested on a single stimulus source. To investigate how classification criteria based on one secretion apply to others, we recorded responses of AOB neurons to urine, vaginal secretions, and saliva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, set 3). The dataset contains 164 units (101 single-units, 63 multi-units) that responded to at least one of the 12 stimuli. Detailed descriptions of the number of units recorded per session and recording site locations, spanning the entire anterior-posterior aspect, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s001">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s004">S1 Fig</xref>. For the 164 responding units, the mode, median and mean number of significant responses across units was 1, 2, and 2.6, respectively (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). Note that in this stimulus set, due to the small volumes of salivary samples, stimuli from four to six females were pooled (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Materials and Methods</xref>). This has the potential effect of reducing variability and to some extent simplifying the classification problem.</p>
<p>We first trained classifiers for each secretion separately. We began with reproductive-state classifiers that generalize across strains, and strain classifiers that generalize across reproductive states (indicated by the orange lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g005">Fig 5A and 5C</xref>). In these experiments, each stimulus is presented at one dilution, and thus dilution variability does not play a factor. The results of these classifications, shown by the orange lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g005">Fig 5B and 5D</xref>, reveal that in addition to urine and vaginal secretions, salivary cues can also provide information about strain and reproductive-state. Complete classification results for this dataset are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s006">S3 Fig</xref>, panels M-R.</p>

<p>Next, we applied classifiers trained on one secretion to the other two (gray double-headed arrows in 5A, C). The analysis shows that application to other secretions results in chance level performance for state discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, gray traces) and slightly above-chance performance for strain discriminations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These results suggest that distinct chemical cues provide information about behaviorally relevant traits across the different stimulus sources. The modest above-chance generalization performance observed with strain classifications across different secretions indicates that some units do respond to strain dependent cues that are common across secretions.</p>
<p>Finally, we trained classifiers across secretions, to investigate whether a single classifier (red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g005">Fig 5A and 5C</xref>) can detect particular traits regardless of the stimulus source. Using the unit removal procedure, we observe that about 15 AOB units suffice for approximately 85% correct classification. Best performance with all units, or one unit, is 90% and 70%, respectively. Performance on strain discriminations is higher, with 10 units sufficient to classify strain with a ~95% success rate. Best performance with all units, or one unit, is 98% and 86%, respectively. As with the previous classifications, polling multiple units provides a considerable advantage over individual units. Notably, the ability of one individual unit to provide 86% correct strain discriminations suggests that some neurons are sensitive to strain dependent cues that are common to the three secretions.</p>

<title>Strain is represented more prominently than reproductive state across the AOB population</title>
<p>To gain insight about how social information is decoded from AOB population activity, we investigated the influence (classifier weights) assigned to each of the units. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref> show the vaginal secretion response dataset (data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) with the rows sorted according to the values assigned by the general reproductive-state and strain classifiers, respectively. As expected, this ordering shows that the linear classifier assigns more weight to units with response profiles that reflect the detected traits. Yet, while unit reordering highlights each of the two traits, it does not reveal if the observed patterns are represented more than expected by chance. To address this, we defined an index that quantifies the impact of the strain and state dimensions on the dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Materials and Methods</xref>). Comparison of the index to its bootstrapped distribution under the null hypothesis, reveals that while the strain dimension is significantly represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), the reproductive-state dimension is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The same is true for responses to urine (strain p-value = 0.0035, reproductive-state p-value = 0.55). This observation indicates why strain discriminations are achieved with higher success than state discriminations.</p>

<title>Generalized classifications are difficult because individual AOB neurons can be modulated by more than one factor</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref> show the units ordered according to the weights assigned by the reproductive-state classifiers, specifically for the BC and C57 strains (i.e. classifiers indicated by orange lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Inspection of the columns representing stimuli not used for training the classifier (i.e. the six rightmost columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6E</xref> and the six leftmost columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6F</xref>) reveals that reproductive state selective responses for one strain are not necessarily associated with similar selectivity for the other. Indeed, examination of matrices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref> indicates that even units assigned with the highest absolute weights are influenced by the strain and the dilution. This explains why generalization of reproductive state classifiers across strains is not efficient unless training is done <italic>explicitly</italic> with stimuli from both strains. The same observations apply with regard to urine stimuli and for strain discriminations across both states, yet the confounding effect of strain on reproductive state discrimination is more dominant than <italic>vice versa</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s007">S4 Fig</xref>, similar considerations apply to the difficulty of generalizing across concentrations. Generally, we find no systematic relationship between the number of units used and the ability of the classifier to generalize across other instances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). The ability of a classifier to generalize largely depends on the response profiles of the individual units that contribute to it. Specifically, generalization across particular dimensions will be successful if the influential units happen to display invariant responses along these dimensions. To ensure generalization along any given dimension, classifiers must be trained with stimuli that vary along that particular dimension.</p>

<title>Classifiers do not depend on a small number of highly informative units</title>
<p>Across all secretions and traits, our analysis has shown that consideration of multiple units provides better classification performance than is available with any one unit. This is expected, as the entire population of units also includes the “best” unit. This last consideration raises the possibility that the success of classifiers with many units heavily depends on a small number of key units. To address this possibility, we revisited the classification analysis, but instead of removing the unit with the <italic>least</italic> effect (i.e. smallest absolute weight) as done above we instead removed at each stage, the unit with the <italic>highest</italic> absolute weight. For each classifier, the process was repeated until the classifier’s performance decreased below that possible with the best individual unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The average number of units (across 10 repeated training cycles) that can be removed without impairing classification below the best one-unit performance are: 27.5 (VS state classification), 29.6 (VS strain), 17.1 (urine state), 15.7 (urine strain), 50.5 (across secretions, state) and 11.5 (across secretions, strain). In five out of six cases, about one third of <italic>the most influential</italic> units can be removed while still maintaining performance above that possible with the best individual unit.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s008">S5 Fig</xref> illustrates the results of classification with units that were simultaneously recorded in a single session. As expected, classifier performance is substantially reduced in comparison to that obtained with all units available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). Nevertheless, the main conclusions of our foregoing analyses are reproduced even in smaller samples collected in individual sessions.</p>

The analysis shows that while there are some prominent response patterns among the influential units, the responses of most unit pairs exhibit low correlations. Specifically, of all pairwise correlations among the top 20 units within each classifier, the large majority are smaller than 0.5. (% correlations below 0.5: VS state: 86.3%; VS strain: 83.7%; urine state: 89.5%; urine strain: 86.3%; across secretions state: 88.4%; across secretions strain: 93.7%). This analysis thus indicates that to achieve optimal performance, classifiers tend to sample units with a variety of response profiles.</p>
<p>Finally, application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to our dataset revealed only weak correlations between the dominant Principal Components and the dimensions analyzed here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s012">S9 Fig</xref>). This result is consistent with the idea that neurons in our sample do not represent a homogenous population with a one stereotypic response profile.</p>

<title>Non-linear classifiers yield better classification performance</title>
<p>Our choice of the perceptron model was motivated by its ability to indicate the contribution of individual units to the classification. Furthermore, in principle, it can be easily implemented by neurons receiving direct excitatory and (indirect) inhibitory input from AOB neurons. However, we are <italic>not</italic> suggesting that the actual downstream readout of AOB activity involves a perceptron-like classifier. Indeed, reliable trait detection may be improved by multiple processing stages realizing non-linear computations. To illustrate this, we also calculated the ability of a more powerful non-linear classifier, a support vector machine (SVM), to discriminate among traits. Each panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g007">Fig 7</xref> compares the best performance obtained with an SVM to that of the best perceptron classifier. The comparison clearly shows that SVMs provide significantly improved performance, particularly for the more challenging classifications. In one case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g007">Fig 7D</xref>), perceptron performance is slightly better. This appears surprising because an SVM classifier can implement any decision rule that a perceptron can. The explanation for the reduced performance observed in this case is that the SVM likely over-fits the training dataset.</p>
<p>Comparison of SVM and perceptron performance as a function of the number of units (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s013">S10 Fig</xref>) shows that the SVM advantage is more prominent when more neurons are used. For small ensembles, the differences between the two classifiers are marginal. Overall, this analysis highlights once more the advantage of polling multiple units, and shows that non-linear readout of neuronal activity can yield improved classification performance.</p>

<title>Individual units can participate in distinct classifications</title>
<p>The observation that individual neurons can be modulated by more than one trait implies that each could contribute to the detection of multiple traits. To test whether this is the case, we compared the weights assigned by the reproductive-state and the strain classifiers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6G</xref> shows that across the population of units, the weights for state and strain classifiers for the VS dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>) are clearly not correlated. More generally, over 10 classification cycles, the average correlation coefficient between weights for the two distinct classifiers is 0.02±0.03 (mean±SD). For comparison, the average correlation coefficient over all 10 repeated training cycles of the state classifier is 0.99±0.003. Similar results were observed with the other datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s002">S2 Table</xref>). These results suggest a model according to which individual units participate in multiple distinct and overlapping networks, each associated with classifying a particular trait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>

In principle, detection of any trait via chemosensation requires a reliable readout of chemical cues that are correlated with the trait. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g008">Fig 8A</xref> illustrates a very simple (hypothetical) scenario related to the traits addressed here, in which the level of one compound is indicative of estrus state. The example illustrates how factors such as dilution, other traits, or the stimulus source, could modulate compound levels in a manner that confounds discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref033">33</xref>]. Even under this simple scenario, trait detection is not a trivial challenge. While there are known cases in which individual molecules elicit well-defined behavioral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref037">37</xref>], encoding even a relatively robust trait such as sex, seems to involve more than a single molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref038">38</xref>]. More generally, behaviorally relevant information is conveyed by levels of multiple compounds and the relationships between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref025">25</xref>]. These non-trivial relationships between particular traits and levels of chemical cues imply that trait representation in the AOB can be complex.</p>
<p>In one scenario, akin to a labelled line model, the activity of one particular “expert” AOB neuron could provide an unambiguous report of the presence of a particular trait. Under the opposite scenario, the activity of many, potentially all, AOB neurons must be sampled. To provide a definitive answer to this question one would have to test responses of <italic>all</italic> neurons to an enormous set of chemosensory stimuli varying along multiple dimensions, including: various traits of the stimulus donor (e.g. genetic makeup, sex, age, physiological status), the stimulus source-secretion, and physical properties (e.g. dilution, freshness). In attempt to record many neurons with high temporal resolution and fidelity, we used multisite extracellular recording probes in the AOB. Because of technical limitations on practical dataset sizes, we could only explore a limited stimulus subspace in each single experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Specifically, we tested the responses to urine, saliva, and vaginal secretions of females from different strains and reproductive states. We have shown, for the first time, that AOB neurons have the capacity to respond to all these stimulus sources in a strain and reproductive-state specific manner. Furthermore, compared to urine, vaginal secretions are optimized to convey reproductive state information. Linking these results with behavioral analyses, we note that in hamsters, flank marks are used to detect individuality, whereas estrus state is sensed via vaginal secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref008">8</xref>]. Adding to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref040">40</xref>], our findings stress the importance of attending to diverse secretions in the context of mammalian chemosensory communication.</p>
<p>Based on the responses to these stimuli, we studied how information about a female mouse’s strain and reproductive state can be decoded from the activity of AOB neurons, despite these sources of variability. While some individual units do allow reliable trait discrimination within our (limited) stimulus set, most are significantly restricted in their ability to provide reliable information across multiple sources of variability. However, a significant gain in classification performance is obtained by considering multiple units. In this respect, our work is in good agreement with a recent study, which demonstrated that deriving sex and strain information from urine also requires consideration of multiple neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Our analyses indicate that generalized discriminations require explicit training with stimuli spanning multiple dimensions of variability. The challenge is similar to that of object recognition. For example, viewing an unfamiliar face once as a static image is generally not sufficient to allow identification across a range of contexts (e.g. different moods or ages of the person, as well as viewing angles and lighting conditions). The ability to reliably identify a face under those contexts requires accumulated exposure that provides sampling under diverse conditions. Here, we observed that strain discriminations generally required fewer units and were performed with higher success than reproductive-state discriminations. Indeed, our previous analysis has shown that in the AOB, sex is represented more prominently than strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref024">24</xref>]. Generally, prominently represented traits may be more immune to variability, explaining why the confounding effect of strain on state discrimination is larger than the reciprocal effect. Similarly, the confounding effect of stimulus dilution depends on its magnitude relative to that associated with different trait values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref004">4</xref>], suggesting why dilution had a minor confounding effect on sex and strain discriminations in the AOB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>One may argue that “expert” neurons for trait detection do exist for <italic>all</italic> behaviorally relevant discriminations, but that our limited sample simply failed to identify them. This possibility cannot be entirely ruled out. However, even if such “experts” were found for each discrimination considered here, there is no guarantee that they would also provide reliable classification across further sources of variability. Our present study suggests an alternative scenario, in which discrimination is achieved by polling a limited number of distinct units, none of which must be an “expert”. The various response profiles associated with AOB neurons provide a rich substrate to realize a large number of discriminations, including of traits not strongly represented by neuronal activity. This was exactly the case for reproductive state discriminations in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). More generally, when traits are strongly represented in the dataset, a small number of units may suffice to yield reliable discriminations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g008">Fig 8Bii</xref>), and complex decoding mechanisms might not be required. Thus, instead of a dichotomy between labelled lines and combinatorial codes, we suggest that decoding distinct traits may require different population sizes, depending in part on how prominently these traits are represented by individual neurons.</p>
<p>While the perceptron model provides a clear analogy to a downstream neuron, we do not claim that it actually represents the algorithm used by the brain. Indeed, more powerful non-linear classifiers provide better classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g007">Fig 7</xref>), especially when a larger neuronal population is considered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s013">S10 Fig</xref>). Note also that we quantified neuronal responses as the mean firing rate changes within a long time window, a choice motivated by the relatively long and variable response patterns of AOB units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref041">41</xref>]. A more refined examination of individual units’ rate modulations and spike timing relative to stimulus delivery might lead to improved decoding ability. In particular, temporal response profiles may play an important role during bouts of natural investigation, when the vomeronasal pump is likely activated repeatedly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref031">31</xref>]. The dynamics of active sensing could thus substantially affect summation of responses, and hence the ability to discriminate between, or to generalize across, stimuli. Finally, we note that examination of the relationships between individual units’ spike times, and of correlated rate modulations among different units could also lead to improved discriminations. With all these considerations in mind, understanding how AOB activity is indeed read by specific downstream stages remains an important question for future research.</p>

<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>For urine collection, mice were gently held over a plastic sheet until they urinated. The urine was transferred to a plastic tube with a micropipette and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored in -80°C. Vaginal secretions were collected by flushing the vaginal region with 30 μl of ringer’s solution. 20 μl were immediately frozen and stored at -80°C for stimulus presentation. The remaining volume was smeared on a glass slide for determination of estrus state. For saliva collection, isoproterenol hydrochloride (0.2mg/100g) and pilocarpine (0.05mg/100g) were injected I.P. to increase salivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref042">42</xref>]. Saliva was then collected from the oral cavity using a micropipette and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. All stimulus dilutions were made with ringer’s solution. Stimulus collection was performed 3–5 times per week, usually after 14:00 (non-reversed light cycle, light on: 7:00–19:00). The estrus stage was determined by examining vaginal secretions smeared on glass slides, dried, and stained with cresyl violet. Slides were examined under a light microscope and the estrus cycle stage determined by cellular morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref044">44</xref>]. Stages were classified as either estrus/proestrus (designated as estrus), or meta- or diestrus (designated as non-estrus). For the urine and vaginal secretion datasets (sets 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), stimuli for a given strain were obtained from one individual (with stimuli collected during different stages of the cycle). Dilutions used were 9x (L, low), 3x (M, medium), 1x (H, high) for vaginal secretions, and 300x (L), 100x (M) and 33x (H), for urine. For comparison of the three different secretions (set 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), stimuli comprised a mixture from 4–6 females. In most cases, stimuli for each session were collected from the same females. For comparison of different stimulus sources, we used undiluted samples, as they are thus sampled during natural investigation. With vaginal secretions, this was not possible since they were collected via flushing. Responses to undiluted urine were clearly stimulus specific, and thus did not represent non-specific activation due to urinary potassium <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s015">S12A–S12D Fig</xref>. Unlike in the MOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref045">45</xref>], where airflow alone can induce activity changes, in the VNS, delivery of ringer’s solution alone does not elicit a response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref046">46</xref>]. As examples, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s015">S12E and S12F Fig</xref> shows recordings of two units, demonstrating a null response to Ringers solution. Because the number of stimuli in our dataset was a limiting factor, we did not use an explicit negative control stimulus here.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Experimental procedures were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref024">24</xref>], and are reproduced briefly here, with the differences noted. Mice were anesthetized with 100mg/kg ketamine and 10mg/kg xylazine, a tracheotomy was performed with a polyethylene tube to allow breathing during flushing, and a cuff electrode was placed around the sympathetic nerve trunk with the carotid serving as a scaffold. Incisions were closed with Vetbond (3M) glue and the mouse was placed in a custom-built stereotaxic apparatus where anesthesia was maintained throughout the entire experiment with 0.5–1% isoflurane in oxygen. A craniotomy was made immediately rostral to the rhinal sinus, the dura was removed around the penetration site, and electrodes were advanced into the AOB at an angle of ~30° with an electronic micromanipulator (MP-285; Sutter instruments, Novato, CA). All recordings were made with 32 channel probes with 8 channels on each of 4 shanks (NeuroNexus Technologies, Ann Arbor, Michigan). Before recordings, electrodes were dipped in fluorescent dye (DiI, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to allow subsequent confirmation of electrode placement within the AOB external cell layer, which contains the mitral-tufted cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref011">11</xref>]. In each session, stimuli were typically presented 5 times in a pseudorandom order. In a minority of sessions, only 4 repeats were possible. Mean number of repeats across all experiments: 4.8. In each presentation, 2 μl of stimulus was applied directly into the nostril. After a delay of 20 s, a square-wave stimulation train (duration: 1.6 s, current: ±120 μA, frequency: 30 Hz), was delivered through the sympathetic nerve cuff electrode to induce VNO pumping and stimulus entry to the VNO lumen. Following a second delay of 40 s, the nasal cavity and VNO were flushed with 1–2 ml of ringer’s solution which flowed from the nostril, into the nasal cavity, and sucked out from the nasopalatine duct via a solenoid-controlled suction tube. The cleansing procedure was 50 s long and included sympathetic trunk stimulation to facilitate stimulus elimination from the VNO lumen. Neuronal data was sampled at 25 kHz using an RZ2 processor, PZ2 preamplifier, and two RA16CH head-stage amplifiers (TDT, Alachua, FL). Signals were band-pass filtered (300–5000 Hz) and custom MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) programs were used to extract spike waveforms. Spikes were sorted automatically according to their projections on two principal components on 8 channels of each shank using KlustaKwik [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref047">47</xref>] and then manually verified and adjusted using the Klusters program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref048">48</xref>]. Spike clusters were evaluated by consideration of their spike shapes, projections on principal component space (calculated for each session individually) and autocorrelation functions. A spike cluster was defined as a <italic>single unit</italic> if it had a distinct spike shape and was fully separated from both the origin (noise) and other clusters along at least one principal component projection, and if its inter-spike interval histogram demonstrated a clear trough around time 0 (of at least 10 ms). Clusters comprising more than one single unit were designated as multi-units. Thus, using the present definitions, multi-units could represent the activity of as few as 2 units, or more. Throughout this manuscript, we used both single and multi-unit activity with the aim of increasing the probability of finding individual units conveying robust information. Note that one of our key conclusions is that response profiles of individual units are not sufficiently general, and this cannot be a result of confounding multiple units together. Comparison of classifier weights assigned to single and multi-units (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g006">Fig 6G</xref>) revealed no systematic relationship between unit type and the magnitude of classifier weight.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All data analyses and visualizations were performed using either custom or standard MATLAB code. The response of a unit to a given stimulus was defined as the average firing rate change over a 40 s window following sympathetic nerve stimulation (change measured compared to the 30 s period preceding VNO activation). Response significance of a given unit to a given stimulus was determined by comparing its spiking rate distribution following all repeats to the baseline firing frequency distribution during the 10 s period prior to stimulus application. Response significance (of a particular unit to a given stimulus) was determined by a non-parametric ANOVA comparing the set of post-stimulation rates to the set of preceding baseline rates (preceding rates were pooled across all stimuli).</p>

Here, we used the <italic>perceptron</italic> function in MATLAB (neural networks toolbox, R2014a, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/nnet/ref/perceptron.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mathworks.com/help/nnet/ref/perceptron.html</ext-link>) to create a perceptron network. Default parameters were used except that the <italic>trainr</italic> function, which selects training samples randomly, was used. A maximum of 100 training epochs was applied.</p>
<p>All training and testing procedures were performed on single trial population vectors including all single and multi-units tested with a given stimulus set. Each response vector was generated by randomly selecting one single-trial response independently from each of the units. With a dataset of 50 units and 5 repeats, this represents an enormous number of distinct combinations. Classifiers were first trained on 100 samples (training set), and then tested on an independently generated test set of 100 trials (test set). The process of training modifies the weights and the threshold (bias) to maximize classification performance on the training dataset. For each discrimination, the performance of the classifier is quantified as a function of the population size by sequentially and repeatedly removing the least influential unit (i.e. the one with the lowest absolute weight) from the previous stage, and applying the training and testing procedures on the remaining units. Due to the slight non-deterministic nature of the training, each classification cycle (including training and subsequent testing) was performed 10 times. The performance of classification as a function of population size was obtained by averaging the mean performance over 10 repeats. This sequential unit removal approach does not always converge to the one unit that, considered alone, provides the best performance. Therefore, in all our classifications, we also show the best performance obtained across all individual units considered separately. For the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004798.g007">Fig 7</xref>, at each stage, the unit with the <italic>highest</italic> absolute weight was removed, and the procedure was repeated 3 times for each classifier. Support vector machine classifiers were created and trained with the MATLAB <italic>svmtrain</italic> function (statistics toolbox, R2014a) with a quadratic kernel function. See supporting information files (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004798.s003">S1 Data</xref>) for classifier codes and for the data arrays used for classification.</p>
<p>For significance analysis of trait representation we defined an index to characterize the extent to which different dimensions are represented in the response dataset. For example, to obtain the representation of the <italic>strain</italic> dimension for a unit <italic>i</italic>, we subtract the sum of the responses of that unit to all stimuli from one strain from the sum of the responses to all stimuli from the other strain. e.g.:

<p>Here, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>s</italic></sub> is the normalized response of neuron I to stimulus S, such that the maximal response has a value of 1 and the minimal response has a value of -1. If the magnitude of the responses is identical for both strains (on average), then the index will sum to zero. This value is calculated for each unit and then averaged across all units to obtain a measure of the representation of that trait across the population. The statistical significance of this index is obtained by comparing it to a bootstrapped distribution generated by shuffling the dataset 10,000 times and calculating this index for each shuffle. During shuffling, response magnitudes were randomly permuted for each unit across stimuli. This eliminates any dependency of response magnitudes on specific traits, while preserving the statistics of response magnitudes. Finally, the value of the averaged index of the non-shuffled data is compared to its distribution in the shuffled dataset, and the probability of obtaining by chance a value at least as large as that observed is noted. Similarly, the state specific index is derived by summing all responses to non-estrus stimuli and subtracting them from the sum of responses to all estrus stimuli.</p>

<title>Demonstration of response specificity to undiluted urine samples and to a control stimulus.</title>
<p><bold>A-D:</bold> Examples of four different units validating the use of undiluted (1 fold) urine as a stimulus. <bold>A, B</bold>: Examples of two units (raster displays and traces superimposed) that show selective responses to one 1x urine sample, but not to another. <bold>C.</bold> An example of a unit that does not show rate elevation to one urine concentration, but does show elevation to a 10F dilution of a different urine sample. <bold>D.</bold> A unit that responded to one 1F urine stimulus did not respond to delivery of a 50 mM potassium solution. We note that 50mM is considerably higher than reported values for potassium in mouse urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004798.ref049">49</xref>]. Note that even when a 1F dilution is delivered to the nostril, inevitably, the effective dilution that reaches vomeronasal sensory neurons is lower. Thus, non-specific activation of vomeronasal sensory neurons with undiluted urine does not occur in our experiments. <bold>E-F</bold>: Examples of AOB units (not included in the current dataset) that responded to female urine, but did not show firing rate modulations in response to ringer’s solution.</p>
