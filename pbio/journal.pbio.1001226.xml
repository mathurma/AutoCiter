        <p>Structure-function studies reveal that Rap proteins have distinct, nonoverlapping surfaces that interact with different cellular targets, and that for antiactivator RapF, one surface mimics DNA to bind a response regulator DNA binding domain, thereby sterically preventing the activity of this transcription transactivator.</p>

        <p>The complex interplay between the response regulator ComA, the anti-activator RapF, and the signaling peptide PhrF controls competence development in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. More specifically, ComA drives the expression of genetic competence genes, while RapF inhibits the interaction of ComA with its target promoters. The signaling peptide PhrF accumulates at high cell density and upregulates genetic competence by antagonizing the interaction of RapF and ComA. How RapF functions mechanistically to inhibit ComA activity and how PhrF in turn antagonizes the RapF-ComA interaction were unknown. Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of RapF in complex with the ComA DNA binding domain. Along with biochemical and genetic studies, the X-ray crystal structure reveals how RapF mechanistically regulates ComA function. Interestingly, we found that a RapF surface mimics DNA to block ComA binding to its target promoters. Furthermore, RapF is a monomer either alone or in complex with PhrF, and it undergoes a conformational change upon binding to PhrF, which likely causes the dissociation of ComA from the RapF-ComA complex. Finally, we compare the structure of RapF complexed with the ComA DNA binding domain and the structure of RapH complexed with Spo0F. This comparison reveals that RapF and RapH have strikingly similar overall structures, and that they have evolved different, non-overlapping surfaces to interact with diverse cellular targets. To our knowledge, the data presented here reveal the first atomic level insight into the inhibition of response regulator DNA binding by an anti-activator. Compounds that affect the interaction of Rap and Rap-like proteins with their target domains could serve to regulate medically and commercially important phenotypes in numerous <italic>Bacillus</italic> species, such as sporulation in <italic>B. anthracis</italic> and sporulation and the production of Cry protein endotoxin in <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Upon phosphorylation, bacterial proteins called response regulators bind to DNA promoters and activate or repress transcription. These response regulators are themselves regulated by anti-activator proteins, which can control response regulator activity without altering their phosphorylation state. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of the anti-activator RapF complexed with the DNA-binding domain of the response regulator ComA. Our structure-function studies show that RapF disrupts the binding of ComA to DNA using a two-pronged mechanism. First, a RapF surface mimics DNA, and this DNA-like surface binds to nearly all of the ComA DNA-binding residues, thus blocking ComA's interaction with DNA. Second, RapF inhibits ComA dimerization. RapF is also regulated by the PhrF peptide; we find that the RapF-ComA interaction surface is distant from the proposed PhrF binding site. Furthermore, we found that RapF undergoes a conformational change upon binding to PhrF, which likely causes its dissociation from ComA. From these observations, we conclude that PhrF binding to RapF allosterically triggers its dissociation from ComA. Finally, we compared the RapF/ComA DNA-binding domain complex structure with the structure of another response regulator, Spo0F, complexed with the phosphatase RapH. This reveals that while RapF and RapH are structurally similar, they have evolved distinct, non-overlapping surfaces to interact with their different cellular targets.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Two-component signaling systems, consisting of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator transcription factor, are the principal mechanism of signal transduction in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Gao1">[1]</xref>. Upon phosphorylation of their receiver (REC) domains, response regulators bind target DNA promoters and activate or repress transcription. A number of auxiliary factors have garnered significant attention because they function as anti-activators that inhibit response regulator function without affecting their phosphorylation state. These proteins inhibit the interaction of response regulators with their target promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Smits1">[5]</xref> or RNA polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Ansaldi1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Gora1">[7]</xref>. To our knowledge, the X-ray crystallographic, biochemical, and genetic results presented here show for the first time how an anti-activator structurally inhibits the binding of a response regulator to DNA.</p>
      <p>The Rap proteins are a family of auxiliary factors that have been most thoroughly studied in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, where they regulate two-component and phosphorelay signal transduction. Despite their relatively high sequence similarity, different Rap proteins exert their influence on these pathways via disparate activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Smits1">[5]</xref>. Rap proteins ultimately influence diverse <italic>B. subtilis</italic> developmental and cellular differentiation processes including sporulation, genetic competence, and biofilm formation, as well as the production of secreted enzymes and the movement of a conjugative transposon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Auchtung1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Lopez1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>B. subtilis</italic> encodes 11 Rap proteins on its chromosome and another five on plasmids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Gleave1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Meijer1">[12]</xref>. Rap proteins were named after the founding members of the family, which were shown to be <italic>r</italic>esponse regulator <italic>a</italic>spartate <italic>p</italic>hosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Perego1">[13]</xref>. Rap proteins including RapA, RapB, RapE, RapH, and RapJ are phosphatases that dephosphorylate the intermediate response regulator Spo0F, which consists solely of a REC domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Smits1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Perego1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Parashar1">[15]</xref>. In contrast, genetic and biochemical results show that a subset of Rap proteins, including RapC, RapF, and RapH, are anti-activators that bind to the response regulator transcription factor ComA, inhibiting its interaction with DNA promoters without affecting its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Core1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Smits1">[5]</xref>. Additional genetic results also suggest that RapD, RapG, and RapK may inhibit ComA as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Auchtung2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Ogura2">[18]</xref>. Similarly, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RapG inhibits the binding of the response regulator transcription factor DegU to its target promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Ogura1">[4]</xref>. Consistent with the inability of the Rap proteins to dephosphorylate ComA or DegU, it was previously shown that RapC, RapF, and RapH interact stably with the ComA helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA binding domain and not with its REC domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Smits1">[5]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Secreted signals called Phr peptides contribute to the complexity of Rap protein signaling. Phr peptides are imported into the cell, where they bind to Rap proteins and antagonize their activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Perego2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Pottathil1">[20]</xref>. Mature Phr peptides are generated from immature pro-Phr polypeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-LaniganGerdes1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Stephenson1">[22]</xref>. The genes encoding the pro-Phr polypeptides overlap with the 3′ end of the <italic>rap</italic> genes, forming <italic>rap-phr</italic> gene cassettes. Pro-Phr polypeptides are secreted from the cell and subsequently undergo proteolytic maturation. Mature Phr peptides are then imported into the cell, where each peptide inhibits its cognate Rap protein (e.g., PhrA inhibits RapA, and PhrC inhibits RapC) and in some cases a non-cognate Rap protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Lazazzera1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Perego4">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate how anti-activators such as the Rap proteins inhibit the binding of response regulators to target DNA promoters, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Rap protein, RapF, in complex with the DNA binding domain of the response regulator ComA (ComA<sub>C</sub>). As expected, comparison of the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> crystal structure with the previously determined structure of RapH-Spo0F <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Parashar1">[15]</xref> revealed that RapF and RapH are structurally similar; however, ComA<sub>C</sub> and Spo0F bind to RapF and RapH, respectively, at distinct, non-overlapping sites. Furthermore, we show that RapF is monomeric either alone or in complex with PhrF, and that RapF undergoes a conformational change upon binding PhrF that is likely the cause of ComA dissociation from RapF-ComA complexes. Finally, we propose a model that explains the long-standing observation that some Rap proteins dephosphorylate response regulator REC domains while others sequester response regulator HTH DNA binding domains.</p>

        <title>Overall Structure of the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> Complex</title>
        <p>To begin to determine how RapF inhibits response regulator binding to DNA without affecting its phosphorylation state, we solved its X-ray crystal structure in complex with ComA<sub>C</sub> to 2.30 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s006">Table S1</xref>). The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains one molecule of RapF bound to one molecule of ComA<sub>C</sub>. It is worth noting that the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> crystallization conditions are identical to conditions that yield crystals in our initial screens containing RapF and full-length ComA (ComA<sub>FL</sub>). However, RapF-ComA<sub>FL</sub> crystals diffracted anisotropically and to very low resolution. Presumably, the ComA N-terminal REC domain, which does not interact with RapF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>, is responsible for the disorder observed in the RapF-ComA<sub>FL</sub> crystals.</p>

        <title>RapF Structure</title>
        <p>RapF consists of two distinct domains, an N-terminal antiparallel 3-helix bundle (residues 7–72) and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (residues 92–381) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The RapF N-terminal 3-helix bundle consists of two similarly sized helices, α1 (residues 8–23) and α2 (residues 26–42), and a significantly longer third helix, α3 (residues 47–72). The 3-helix bundle and TPR domain are connected by an elaborate linker region (residues 73–91), containing a 3<sub>10</sub> helix (residues 75–77) joined by a short loop (residues 78–80) to helix α4 (residues 81–91). As discussed in detail below, the N-terminal 3-helix bundle and the linker region form the ComA<sub>C</sub> binding surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g002">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">3A, and 3B</xref>). The RapF C-terminal TPR domain contains seven helix-turn-helix (HTH) folds that assemble into a large superhelix. HTH folds 1–5 and 7 are bona fide TPR folds containing TPR signature sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Main1">[26]</xref>. The sixth HTH fold lacks the TPR signature motif but perpetuates the TPR superhelix. Therefore, we refer to the entire C-terminal region containing seven tandem HTH folds as the TPR domain.</p>

        <p>In sum, the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> interaction buries six of the seven ComA DNA binding residues. It is also notable that in addition to interacting with ComA DNA binding residues, RapF mediates extensive interactions with ComA<sub>C</sub> residues not directly involved in DNA binding. As described in detail below, we rigorously tested the functional importance of the crystallographically observed RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> interface both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

        <title>Functional Analysis of the RapF-ComA Interface In Vitro</title>
        <p>To begin to test the functional significance of the RapF-ComA interactions observed in the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> crystal structure, we generated RapF mutants containing individual alanine substitutions at RapF-ComA interfacial positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s001">S1</xref>), and native PAGE was used to examine the binding of the RapF mutants to wild-type full-length ComA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). RapF Asp28 hydrogen bonds to the ComA Arg157 and Thr155 side chains, and RapF Leu67 forms a hydrophobic interaction with ComA Tyr187 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Consistent with these observations, RapF-D28A and RapF-L67A exhibited a complete loss of ComA binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, RapF P27A forms a hydrophobic interaction with ComA Ile161 and Ser188, and RapF Gln78 hydrogen bonds with ComA Asn194 and with a water molecule at the RapF-ComA interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Compared to the interaction of wild-type RapF with ComA, the interaction of RapF-P27A and RapF-Q78A with ComA was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to the RapF mutants evaluated above, we analyzed the binding of RapF-F24A to wild-type ComA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). RapF Phe24 is located in the loop connecting RapF helices α1 and α2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Its main-chain carbonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the ComA Ser191 side-chain hydroxyl, and its carbonyl carbon atom mediates hydrophobic interactions with ComA Lys195 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Native gel analysis showed that the F24A mutation in RapF results in a complete loss of ComA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). While a portion of the RapF Phe24 side chain and main chain are buried in the ComA interface, the rest of its side chain is buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues in RapF helices α3 and α4. We propose that the interaction of the RapF Phe24 side chain with RapF helices α3 and α4 is essential for the RapF-ComA interaction because it (1) positions the RapF Phe24 main chain carbonyl for interaction with ComA and (2) mediates the packing of the RapF 3-helix bundle and linker, which both in turn interact with ComA. Also consistent with this hypothesis, Phe24 is conserved in the Rap proteins previously shown to bind ComA directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Core1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Smits1">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>One RapF mutant, RapF-E71A, exhibited a significant but subtler ComA-binding defect than the other RapF mutants tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and unpublished data). While RapF Glu71 mediates contacts with ComA<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s001">Figure S1</xref>), it is located at the periphery of the RapF-ComA interface where it is exposed to bulk solvent. Consistent with previous studies of protein-protein interfaces (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bogan1">[28]</xref>), interfacial residues such as RapF Glu71 that are exposed to bulk solvent routinely have little impact on the free energy of binding.</p>
        <p>In addition to the RapF mutants described above, we engineered full-length ComA mutants containing single alanine substitutions at the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g004">Figures 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s002">S2</xref>). The binding of the ComA mutants was then evaluated using native PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). ComA Arg183 forms a salt bridge with RapF Glu71 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s002">S2</xref>), and it also interacts intramolecularly with Tyr187, which is also in the RapF interface. ComA-R183A displayed a nearly complete loss of RapF binding, while numerous other ComA mutants, including ComA-Y187A, ComA-T190A, and ComA-N194A, displayed significantly reduced RapF binding activity compared to wild-type ComA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g004">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s002">S2</xref>). Only one mutant tested, ComA-R157A, appeared to bind RapF with a similar affinity to wild-type ComA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). As described above, ComA Arg157 and ComA Thr155 hydrogen bond to RapF Asp28 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s001">Figure S1</xref>). ComA-T155A was insoluble and therefore could not be studied in vitro, but it is likely that the interaction of ComA Thr155 and RapF Asp28 is primarily responsible for the complete loss-of-function displayed by RapF-D28A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, we estimate based on the results of the qualitative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g004">4D</xref>) and additional native PAGE binding studies employing a broad concentration range of RapF and a fixed quantity of ComA (unpublished data) that the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for RapF-ComA complex formation is in the 1–10 µM range.</p>

        <title>In Vivo Functional Analysis of the RapF-ComA Interface</title>
        <p>To confirm that the RapF-ComA interface observed in the crystal structure is important for the regulation of ComA activity in vivo, we overexpressed RapF mutants containing single alanine substitutions in RapF-ComA interfacial positions and evaluated their affects on ComA transcriptional activity in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). More specifically, we measured RapF activity as a function of ComA-driven <italic>srfA</italic> transcription using the <italic>Photinus pyralis</italic> luciferase gene fused to the <italic>srfA</italic> promoter. As previously described, <italic>P. pyralis</italic> luciferase activity corresponds closely with the rate of its transcription in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Parashar1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Mirouze1">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The P<italic>srfA</italic>-luc reporter bioassay shows that <italic>srfA</italic> expression is delayed in proportion to the amount of RapF induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). However, we questioned why <italic>srfA</italic> was expressed at all considering the fact that the cells overexpressed RapF, which inhibits ComA-driven <italic>srfA</italic> expression. We hypothesized that PhrF expressed from its endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s004">Figure S4</xref>) was antagonizing RapF activity. To confirm that this was the case, we overexpressed a RapF mutant, RapF-D194N, which contains a mutation previously shown to render RapA and RapC immune to the effects of their cognate Phr peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Core1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Perego1">[13]</xref>. Indeed, overexpressed RapF-D194N completely suppressed P<italic>srfA</italic>-luc expression throughout the course of the entire experiment (unpublished data). Moreover, when we added synthetic PhrF peptide to the P<italic>srfA-luc</italic> reporter strain overexpressing RapF, P<italic>srfA</italic>-luc expression was indistinguishable from the non-induced control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Together, these results show that overexpressed RapF is antagonized at least to some degree by PhrF expressed from its endogenous locus. Nonetheless, overexpressing RapF significantly delays <italic>srfA</italic>-luc expression. Consistent with these results and as described below, strains overexpressing RapF proteins containing mutations in the RapF-ComA interface should express <italic>srfA</italic>-luc at earlier time points than the wild-type RapF control.</p>
        <p>Mirroring the results of the RapF-ComA binding studies, RapF-D28A and RapF-L67A displayed a loss-of-function, and RapF-P27A and RapF-Q78A displayed intermediate phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Also consistent with the in vitro results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figures 3C</xref>), RapF-E71A displays a slight loss of function in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Western blotting confirmed that the RapF mutants were produced at levels comparable to wild-type RapF (unpublished data). Thus, the results of the RapF-ComA in vitro binding studies and the RapF-ComA luciferase bioassays show that the RapF-ComA interface identified in the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> crystal structure is functionally important in vitro and in vivo.</p>

        <title>RapF-ComA Stoichiometry</title>
        <p>RapF dimerizes around a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis in the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> crystals. To begin to determine whether RapF also dimerizes in solution, we analyzed RapF and RapF-ComA complexes by gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The results of these studies suggested that RapF alone and RapF in complex with ComA could be forming dimers in solution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001226-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, molecular weight determination using gel filtration becomes less reliable as the shape of the analyzed protein or protein complex deviates from that of a sphere, and RapF has an elongated structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In fact, RapF is approximately twice as long as it is wide, and its shape more closely resembles a rod than a sphere. Therefore, to determine unambiguously whether RapF dimerizes in solution, we studied RapF using sedimentation-equilibrium (SE) analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). The theoretical molecular weight of a RapF monomer is 46.3 kD, and its molecular weight as determined by SE AUC is 47 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001226-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that RapF is monomeric in solution.</p>

        <p>The RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> crystallographic asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) contains one molecule of RapF bound to one molecule of ComA<sub>C</sub>, suggesting that perhaps a monomer of RapF binds to a monomer of ComA in solution. However, ComA alone and ComA<sub>C</sub> alone homodimerize in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001226-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Hobbs1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Griffith1">[30]</xref>, and ComA dimers bind to DNA regulatory sites composed of three recognition elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Griffith1">[30]</xref>. Therefore, we examined whether RapF is binding a ComA monomer or dimer in solution using gel filtration in combination with total amino acid analysis and SE AUC.

The results of the total amino acid analysis (unpublished data) indicate that the stoichiometry of the RapF-ComA complex is 1∶1. Finally, SE AUC analysis of the identical RapF-ComA sample indicated the formation of a single species of approximately 74 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This is consistent with a complex composed of one molecule of RapF (45.7 kD) and one molecule of ComA (26.3 kD) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001226-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Together, the results of the SE AUC, gel filtration chromatography combined with total amino acid analysis, and X-ray crystallography suggest that a monomer of RapF binds to a monomer of ComA or ComA<sub>C</sub>, and that the stoichiometries of the RapF-ComA and RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> complexes are 1∶1. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, ComA<sub>C</sub> from the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> X-ray crystal structure is aligned with a molecule of ComA<sub>C</sub> from the dimeric ComA<sub>C</sub> NMR structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Hobbs1">[27]</xref>. While the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structure shows that RapF-bound ComA<sub>C</sub> undergoes conformational changes near the ComA<sub>C</sub> dimerization interface, we cannot rule out the possibility that these changes were influenced by lattice contacts involving ComA<sub>C</sub>. Nonetheless, consistent with the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> crystal structure, we find that RapF binds to a ComA monomer in solution. Furthermore, while RapF does not interact with ComA<sub>C</sub> dimerization interface residues, which are located in helix α8, α10, and the α7–α8 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), we hypothesize that the RapF-induced ComA<sub>C</sub> conformational change is transmitted to ComA α10 through contacts between RapF and ComA residues in the C-terminus of α9 (residues N194 and K195) and the α9–α10 loop (residues N197, V198, and G199) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). In fact, RapF Gln78 and RapF Phe24 contact ComA Asn194 and Lys195, respectively, and RapF-Q78A and RapF-F24A both exhibited severe ComA binding defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Despite the numerous contacts between RapF and ComA residues directly adjacent to the ComA<sub>C</sub> dimerization interface, because RapF does not interact with the surface of the ComA<sub>C</sub> dimerization interface, we conclude that RapF allosterically inhibits ComA<sub>C</sub> dimerization.</p>

        <title>RapF Undergoes a Conformational Change Upon Binding to PhrF</title>
        <p>The gel filtration analysis of RapF-ComA and RapF performed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) were repeated in the presence of PhrF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5C, 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001226-t001">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with previous native-PAGE studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>, we found that PhrF caused the dissociation of the RapF-ComA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001226-t001">Table 1</xref>). Also consistent with these native-PAGE studies where a faster migrating RapF band was observed in the presence of PhrF, we found that PhrF caused RapF to elute at a significantly higher volume than RapF alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5C, 5E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001226-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, in the previous native PAGE studies it was assumed that RapF was dimeric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>, and why a faster migrating band appeared in the presence of PhrF was unknown.</p>
        <p>As discussed above, SE AUC shows that RapF alone is monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001226-t001">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with this result, the molecular weight of RapF complexed with PhrF is 50 kD as determined by SE AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001226-t001">Table 1</xref>), and there is no change in RapF stoichiometry upon binding to PhrF. Therefore, we conclude that RapF migrates through the gel filtration matrix radically slower in the presence of PhrF than in its absence, and RapF migrates faster in the presence of PhrF when analyzed by native PAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>, because it undergoes a large conformational change upon binding to PhrF.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Response regulators are the primary mechanism for converting sensory perception into transcriptional output in bacteria. How auxiliary factors such as the Rap proteins function structurally to inhibit response regulator binding to DNA promoters was not known. The X-ray crystallographic, biochemical, and genetic results presented here reveal that RapF disrupts response regulator binding to DNA using a two-pronged mechanism. First, RapF buries ComA DNA binding residues in the RapF-ComA interface, sterically blocking the binding of ComA to its DNA recognition elements. Second, RapF binding allosterically weakens the ComA<sub>C</sub> dimerization interface, inhibiting the formation of transcriptionally active ComA dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In theory, each mechanism alone could effectively inhibit response regulator activity; however, RapF uses both.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, the data presented here reveal the first atomic level insight into the inhibition of response regulator DNA binding by an anti-activator. However, the structures or regulatory mechanisms of other anti-activators and anti-repressors that target transcription factors other than response regulators have been described, for example TraM, CarS, TrlR, AppA, and ExsD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s005">Figure S5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Leon1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Chen1">[35]</xref>. These proteins repress the activity of their targets by (1) directly blocking the interaction of DNA binding residues and DNA, (2) inhibiting their functionally required multimerization, or (3) causing allosteric rearrangements that preclude their binding to DNA. RapF does not share obvious structural similarities with these anti-activators and anti-repressors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s005">Figure S5</xref>); however, a comparison of the structural and functional data available for the different systems is informative.</p>
      <p>The TraR-TraM crystal structure showed that the anti-activator TraM interacts with the TraR N-terminal dimerization domain (NTD) in addition to its C-terminal DNA binding domain (CTD) and linker region connecting the NTD and CTD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s005">Figure S5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Chen1">[35]</xref>. In contrast to the interactions observed in the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structure, TraM does not contact the TraM DNA binding residues. Rather, TraM allosterically regulates TraR activity.</p>
      <p>CarS-CarA interactions were mapped using NMR chemical shift perturbation and site-directed mutagenesis studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Leon1">[31]</xref>. Interestingly, like RapF (discussed below), the anti-repressor CarS mimics DNA to interact with its target's DNA binding domain; however, the RapF and CarS folds are entirely different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s005">Figure S5</xref>). While RapF is entirely alpha helical, CarS resembles an SH3 domain and consists of an antiparallel beta sheet and a 3<sub>10</sub> helix.</p>
      <p>How TrlR, AppA, and ExsD function structurally to regulate their targets is not as well understood as it is for the systems discussed above. However, it was shown that TrlR is a truncated form of TraR that regulates TraM by forming inactive TrlR-TraR dimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Chai1">[32]</xref>, and that the flavin binding protein AppA inhibits PpsR repressor activity by reducing a disulphide bond in PpsR and forming inactive AppA-PpsR<sub>2</sub> complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Masuda1">[36]</xref>. Finally, how ExsD functions structurally to inhibit ExsA transcriptional activity is unknown, and different studies suggest that ExsD interacts stably with either the ExsA N-terminal oligomerization domain alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Brutinel1">[37]</xref> or only the intact full-length protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Thibault1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ComA is a member of the LuxR/FixJ/NarL family of transcriptional regulators whose HTH DNA-binding domains are tetra-helical bundles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Aravind1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Galperin1">[40]</xref>. Aligning ComA<sub>C</sub> of the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structure with a molecule of NarL<sub>C</sub> of the NarL<sub>C</sub>-DNA complex structure (1JE8) revealed that RapF's ComA-binding surface adopts a conformation reminiscent of a DNA major groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Maris1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Putnam1">[42]</xref>. Additionally, analogous to DNA, at the core of the RapF ComA<sub>C</sub>-binding surface, there is a large electronegative patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Baker1">[43]</xref>. Moreover, six of the seven previously identified ComA DNA binding residues are buried in the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> interface. For example, the sidechain of ComA Arg183 forms a salt bridge with the side chain of RapF Glu71, and the side chain of ComA Thr190 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of RapF Glu71 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001226.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These contacts appear to mimic the hydrogen bonds that the ComA residues make with the DNA major groove and phosphate backbone, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Hobbs1">[27]</xref>. Thus, the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> X-ray crystal structure reveals that ComA binds to a RapF surface that, at least in part, mimics DNA.</p>

      <p>HTH DNA binding domains are ubiquitous in all three superkingdoms of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Aravind1">[39]</xref>.

For example, ComA Tyr187 in helix α9 inserts into the DNA major groove and contacts the phosphate backbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Hobbs1">[27]</xref>, while no other <italic>B. subtilis</italic> response regulator encodes tyrosine at the equivalent position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Similarly, ComA Arg183 and Thr190 insert into the DNA major groove and contact the phosphate backbone, respectively. Only one other <italic>B. subtilis</italic> response regulator, YdfI, encodes identical residues at these positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). YdfI is in fact the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> protein containing a LuxR/FixJ/NarL-type HTH domain most highly homologous to ComA<sub>C</sub>, yet they bind to different DNA recognition elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Griffith1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Serizawa1">[47]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that purified RapF and YdfI did not stably interact (unpublished data). We propose that Rap protein interactions with the HTH DNA binding residues serve to sterically block the binding of response regulators with their DNA recognition elements. Contacts with these DNA binding residues may enable Rap proteins to preferentially recognize their response regulator targets, e.g. ComA or DegU, among the myriad <italic>B. subtilis</italic> HTH DNA binding domains.</p>
      <p>Some <italic>Bacillus</italic> Rap proteins are phosphatases that bind to and dephosphorylate Spo0F, a stand-alone REC domain, while others bind to the HTH DNA binding domain of the response regulator ComA rather than its REC domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Smits1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Parashar1">[15]</xref>. Structural alignment of RapF of the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structure with RapH of the RapH-Spo0F structure (3Q15) showed that their tertiary structures are essentially identical, and they align with a root mean-square deviation of 1.61 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g007">Figure 7A–C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Parashar1">[15]</xref>. Remarkably, this alignment also revealed that ComA<sub>C</sub> and Spo0F bind to non-overlapping Rap protein surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). ComA<sub>C</sub> interacts only with the RapF linker region and 3-helix bundle, while Spo0F interacts with the RapH TPR domain and 3-helix bundle at a site distant from the ComA<sub>C</sub> binding site on the RapF 3-helix bundle.</p>

This view was obtained by aligning RapH of the RapH-Spo0F complex with RapF of the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> complex as oriented in panel A and as described in (C). Dashed lines denote the RapH disordered region as described below. A comparison of panels A and B shows that ComA<sub>C</sub> and Spo0F bind to opposite faces of the RapF and RapH 3-helix bundles, respectively, and that Spo0F also interacts with the RapH TPR domain. (C) Side view of RapF of the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structure aligned with RapH of the RapH-Spo0F structure. The RapF and RapH Cα backbone atoms aligned with a root mean-square deviation of 1.61 Å. We previously observed insufficient electron density corresponding to RapH residues 69–76, and they were not included in the RapH-Spo0F model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Parashar1">[15]</xref>. These residues correspond to the C-terminus of RapF helix α3 and a portion of the RapF linker region including the 3<sub>10</sub> helix. This region appears to be ordered in the RapF structure resulting from extensive interactions with ComA. Structural alignment of RapF of the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structure with RapH of the RapH-Spo0F structure also revealed conformational differences in the regions surrounding the RapF and RapH α2–α3 loops. This area contains residues particularly important for Rap phosphatase activity, including a catalytic residue that inserts into the Spo0F active site. Thus, the conformational differences between RapF and RapH near the α2–α3 loop likely result from Spo0F binding to RapH.</p>

      <p>Rap proteins have not been observed to bind simultaneously to both the REC and HTH DNA binding domains of a single response regulator. However, it is possible that an ancestral Rap protein did in fact interact with both domains. The Spo0F (REC) and ComA<sub>C</sub> (HTH) binding sites do not overlap, and a Rap protein could theoretically bind to both a REC and HTH domain concurrently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Alternatively, there may not have been an ancestral Rap protein that could bind a REC and HTH DNA binding domain. In this case, the fact that Rap proteins commonly target one or the other of two domains found in response regulator transcription factors could be a coincidence resulting from independent evolution of Rap protein interactions with their targets.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we speculate that Rap proteins such as RapC, RapF, and RapH may have evolved to interact stably with the ComA HTH domain but not its REC domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Smits1">[5]</xref> because the short linker connecting them precludes their simultaneous interaction with the relevant Rap protein binding sites. Indeed, structural alignment of RapF of the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structure with RapH of the RapH-Spo0F structure shows that the C-terminus of Spo0F and the N-terminus of ComA<sub>C</sub> are separated by greater than 49 Å. Rap proteins could interact with the REC and HTH domain of a single response regulator simultaneously if the domains were connected by a long linker as found in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> uncharacterized protein YesN, or an additional domain common to the response regulators in the NtrC family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Galperin1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Ulrich1">[44]</xref>. However, the relatively short linker region connecting the ComA REC and HTH domains would prevent their simultaneous interaction with the identified Rap protein REC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Parashar1">[15]</xref> and HTH domain binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
      <p>Previous work suggests that Phr peptides may bind to the Rap protein TPR domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Core1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Perego1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Perego3">[24]</xref>, and it was hypothesized that response regulators may compete with Phr peptides for binding to a common site on the TPR domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Core1">[3]</xref>. However, the RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> X-ray crystal structure shows that the RapF TPR domain does not in fact contact ComA<sub>C</sub>. RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> contacts are mediated only by the RapF 3-helix bundle and linker region. Thus, it appears that PhrF may allosterically inhibit the RapF-ComA interaction, and the dissociation of RapF and ComA presumably results from the PhrF-induced conformational change in RapF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5C and 5E</xref>). The Rap protein conformational changes induced by Phr peptide binding are currently unknown, and it seems likely that crystal structures of Rap proteins in their Phr peptide bound conformations will be required to reveal these conformational changes as well as the mechanistic nature of the Rap-Phr interaction.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in regard to Rap protein stoichiometry, it is worth noting that RapH dimerizes around a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis similar to RapF, and both RapH and RapK migrate through gel filtration matrix in a manner consistent with that of a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Parashar1">[15]</xref> and unpublished data). However, SE AUC analysis of both RapH and RapK (unpublished data) show that they are in fact monomeric in solution like RapF. Additional SE AUC studies are required to determine whether other Rap proteins are monomeric similar to RapF, RapH, and RapK, or whether they are dimeric as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Ishikawa1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The results of our X-ray crystallographic studies, SE AUC, and gel filtration combined with total amino acid analysis suggest that a RapF monomer binds to a monomer of ComA or ComA<sub>C</sub>. However, the reported ComA<sub>C</sub> homodimerization interface residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Hobbs1">[27]</xref> are not buried in the RapF-ComA interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001226-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, it is theoretically possible that a molecule of ComA in a RapF-ComA complex could bind to another molecule of ComA using its ComA<sub>C</sub> homodimerization surface. Also, a molecule of ComA bound to RapF could bind to another molecule of ComA using its N-terminal receiver domain, which might be accessible because it does not interact stably with RapF. However, even if ComA can in fact homodimerize to some extent when bound to RapF, it is in all likelihood a non-functional ComA dimer. That is, if each molecule of ComA in a ComA dimer is required to interact with DNA at a target promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Griffith1">[30]</xref>, then RapF would disable the ComA dimer when it binds directly to and buries nearly all of the DNA binding residues belonging to one molecule of ComA.</p>
      <p>Rap proteins are proposed to be the most ancient member of the RNPP protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Declerck1">[49]</xref>. The RNPP proteins are related to the <italic>Bacillus R</italic>ap, <italic>N</italic>prR, and <italic>P</italic>lcR proteins, as well as the Enterococcal protein <italic>P</italic>rgX. These proteins are widespread in Firmicutes, and a <italic>rap-phr</italic> cassette was also recently identified outside of the Firmicute phylum encoded on a plasmid in a highly multidrug resistant strain of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Dublin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Han1">[50]</xref>. Structure-function analysis showed that PlcR and PrgX are transcription factors that contain N-terminal DNA binding domains and C-terminal TPR or TPR-like domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Declerck1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Shi1">[51]</xref>. There are no structural data and very limited functional data available describing the NprR proteins, which include a number of proteins in <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Clostridia</italic>. Like PlcR and PrgX, NprR proteins are transcription factors; however, sequence analysis suggests that NprR proteins are essentially Rap proteins containing a tetrahelical bundle HTH DNA binding domain fused to their N-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Pottathil1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We hypothesize that the NprR structure may closely resemble the structure of RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub>, except that in the case of NprR the HTH DNA binding domain is covalently attached to the N-terminus of the NprR 3-helix bundle. Similar to RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub>, DNA binding residues in the NprR HTH DNA binding domain may be buried in an interface with the NprR 3-helix bundle and linker region. Like the Rap proteins, NprR, PlcR, and PrgX activity is regulated by oligopeptides reminiscent of the Phr peptides (review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-RochaEstrada1">[52]</xref>). Peptide binding to NprR could disrupt the interaction of the NprR 3-helix bundle and its DNA binding domain, triggering NprR transcriptional activity. This mechanism is analogous to the PhrF-driven dissociation of the RapF 3-helix bundle and ComA.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we speculate that a protein containing only the Rap protein 3-helix bundle and linker region may be sufficient to inhibit the binding of HTH DNA binding domains to DNA. Engineering this relatively simple scaffold to bind HTH domains other than those belonging to ComA or DegU would create useful in vivo tools for studying bacterial signaling. Furthermore, Rap-Phr and NprR-Phr systems regulate medically and commercially important phenotypes in numerous <italic>Bacillus</italic> species, e.g. sporulation in <italic>B. anthracis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni2">[53]</xref> and sporulation and the production of Cry protein endotoxin in <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-RochaEstrada1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-AcevesDiez1">[54]</xref>, respectively. Therefore, compounds that regulate the activity of Rap and Rap-like proteins could serve as commercially important additives that modulate the overproduction of insecticidal endotoxins or as antibacterial drugs.</p>

        <p>RapF was overexpressed as an N-terminal fusion to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 grown in LB media supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were first grown at 37°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4 and then transferred to 25°C and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6. After growth for an additional 16 h at 25°C, cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 RPM, lysed in Buffer I (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT) supplemented with 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 µg/ml DNaseI, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and insoluble material pelleted at 22,000 RPM for 90 min. Cleared lysates were applied to Glutathione-Uniflow Resin (Clontech), equilibrated in Buffer I. The resin was then washed with Buffer I, resuspended in 4 bed volumes of Buffer I and 3.5 µg/ml thrombin, and incubated for 1.5 h at 25°C. This procedure resulted in complete cleavage of the N-terminal GST affinity tag as determined by SDS-PAGE. Following thrombin cleavage, RapF (residues 1–381) contained two heterologous residues (Gly-Ser) derived from the thrombin cleavage signal. RapF was eluted with Buffer I and diluted 2-fold with Buffer II (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM DTT), passed through a 0.22 µm filter, and loaded onto an anion exchange column (Source 15Q, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer II containing 75 mM NaCl. RapF was eluted in a 75–750 mM NaCl linear gradient of Buffer II. RapF-containing fractions were further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) 16/70 column equilibrated with Buffer II containing 150 mM NaCl. Again, RapF containing fractions were pooled and concentrated.</p>
        <p>ComA<sub>C</sub> protein (His-ComA<sub>C</sub>) was purified as described previously with the following modifications to the protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Bongiorni1">[2]</xref>. Following Ni-NTA affinity column chromatography, His-ComA<sub>C</sub> containing fractions were pooled, diluted 4-fold with Buffer III (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM DTT), passed through a 0.22 µm filter, and loaded onto an anion exchange column (Source 15Q; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer III containing 50 mM KCl. His-ComA<sub>C</sub> eluted from the anion exchange column in the flow through and was concentrated by ultrafiltration (MWCO: 3 kDa). For storage, His-ComA<sub>C</sub> was exchanged into Buffer IV (50 mM 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid (EPPS) pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT) using G-25-50 Sephadex (Sigma).</p>

The final model lacks only residues 1–5 corresponding to the N-terminus of RapF, and 146–152 and 211–214 corresponding to the N- and C-terminus of ComA<sub>C</sub>, respectively. The building of a single Mn<sup>2+</sup> atom into clear electron density during the final stages of refinement in PHENIX was justified based on its coordination to oxygen ligands, i.e. the carbonyl oxygens of RapF Leu40 and Met43, and the side chain oxygens in the RapF Glu45 side chain, the metal-oxygen ligand distances, the similarity of the Mn<sup>2+</sup> refined B-factor to those of its surrounding atoms, and the absence of calculated Fo-Fc difference density surrounding the Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion. Mn<sup>2+</sup> was not added to the RapF purification or crystallization buffers and may have been acquired through adventitious buffer contamination. Secondary structure assignments were calculated using PROMOTIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001226-Hutchinson1">[61]</xref>.
