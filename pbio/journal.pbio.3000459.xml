<abstract>
<p>Mutual gliding motility A (MglA), a small Ras-like GTPase; Mutual gliding motility B (MglB), its GTPase activating protein (GAP); and Required for Motility Response Regulator (RomR), a protein that contains a response regulator receiver domain, are major components of a GTPase-dependent biochemical oscillator that drives cell polarity reversals in the bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>. We report the crystal structure of a complex of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> MglA and MglB, which reveals that the C-terminal helix (Ct-helix) from one protomer of the dimeric MglB binds to a pocket distal to the active site of MglA. MglB increases the GTPase activity of MglA by reorientation of key catalytic residues of MglA (a GAP function) combined with allosteric regulation of nucleotide exchange by the Ct-helix (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor [GEF] function). The dual GAP-GEF activities of MglB accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis over multiple enzymatic cycles. Consistent with its GAP and GEF activities, MglB interacts with MglA bound to either GTP or GDP. The regulation is essential for cell polarity, because deletion of the Ct-helix causes bipolar localization of MglA, MglB, and RomR, thereby causing reversal defects in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic>. A bioinformatics analysis reveals the presence of Ct-helix in homologues of MglB in other bacterial phyla, suggestive of the prevalence of the allosteric mechanism among other prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Small Ras-like GTPases are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and perform varied functions, including cell signaling and motility. Recently, such GTPases have been identified in prokaryotes too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref002">2</xref>]. The soil bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> exhibits 2 types of motility—adventurous gliding motility and social motility, which are essential for its normal life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref003">3</xref>]. The localization of motility complexes, and thereby the direction of movement, is determined by an oscillatory system, which includes Mutual gliding motility A (MglA), a small Ras-like GTPase, and <underline>M</underline>utual <underline>gl</underline>iding motility B (MglB), its GTPase activating protein (GAP) as major components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref005">5</xref>]. Mutual gliding motility (<italic>mgl</italic>) was identified as a locus essential for both social and adventurous motilities in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic>, comprising the 2 genes <italic>mglA</italic> and <italic>mglB</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref003">3</xref>]. Studies on MglA and MglB showed that these proteins exhibit a mutually exclusive localization pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref007">7</xref>]. MglA localizes to the leading pole presumably in its GTP-bound state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref004">4</xref>], whereas MglB localizes at the lagging pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref007">7</xref>] established the role of the prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPase in cell polarity determination and motility, which are functions analogous to its eukaryotic counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

<p>Schematic showing the localization of MglA, MglB, and RomRX in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic>. MglA (GTP-bound state) localizes to the leading pole, whereas MglB and RomRX mainly localize at the lagging pole. A polarity reversal occurs when the proteins relocalize. A signaling cascade consisting of the Frz-signaling proteins drives the polarity reversals. MglA, MglB, and RomRX are represented as green, magenta, and orange spheres. The asymmetry in the size of orange spheres at the 2 poles denotes the asymmetric localization of RomR, with higher concentration at the lagging pole. FrzX<sup>P</sup> and FrzZ<sup>P</sup> denote phosphorylated states of FrzX and FrzZ, respectively. Frz, <italic>frizzy</italic>; Mgl, mutual gliding motility.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of <italic>Myxococcus</italic> motility is the frequent reversals in its cell polarity in response to environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref010">10</xref>]. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> changes its direction of movement by swapping the leading and lagging poles. The reversal frequency is regulated by the chemosensory-like frizzy (Frz) pathway, which relays environmental signals to the downstream MglA-MglB polarity control system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g001">Fig 1</xref>). High-resolution time-lapse experiments revealed that MglA and MglB relocalize sequentially during a reversal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref011">11</xref>]. Importantly, the Frz system does not establish polarity, but its activity is required for inversion of the polarity axis. Another protein involved in the polarity control module is RomR, a protein with a response regulator receiver-like domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref015">15</xref>]. It was recently shown that RomR and its interacting partner RomX are essential for recruiting MglA-GTP to the poles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref016">16</xref>]. Frz-signaling and RomR stimulates the pole-to-pole exchange of MglA and MglB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref015">15</xref>]. All together, these proteins form a so-called gated relaxation oscillator, which functions to drive the polarity reversals in response to environmental signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Regulated reversals are centrally controlled by the MglA GTPase cycle. Though it is established that MglB functions as a GAP for MglA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref007">7</xref>], proteins that function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref017">17</xref>] for MglA were not identified until very recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref016">16</xref>]. The complex of RomR and RomX has been recently demonstrated to function as a GEF for MglA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref016">16</xref>]. In vivo, the RomRX complex recruits MglA to the leading pole at the time of reversal. Between reversals, RomRX dissociates slowly and relocalizes to the lagging cell pole where RomR interacts with MglB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus, both GAP and GEF activities accumulate at the lagging cell pole, preparing the next reversal event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, at this stage, the cell will only reverse if signals from Frz are sufficiently strong. When this occurs, 2 response regulators FrzX<sup>P</sup> (phosphorylated FrzX) and FrzZ<sup>P</sup> (phosphorylated FrzZ) bind to opposite poles, which trigger the detachment of MglA from the leading cell pole and its relocalization to the lagging cell pole. MglB is subsequently detached and relocated to the opposite pole, completing the switch.</p>
<p>Many questions remain unaddressed concerning the exact sequence of events that take place at the poles. Specifically, the presence of antagonizing GAP and GEF activities at both cell poles requires that this balance be regulated. The accumulation of RomRX at the lagging pole is not sufficient to drag MglA to the lagging cell pole, most likely because the MglB GAP activity predominates. Accumulation of FrzX<sup>P</sup> at the lagging pole could switch this balance in favor of the GEF and provoke the switch. In this study, we show that MglB is in fact a bifunctional enzyme and that MglB regulation could be key for the control of this enzymatic balance at the pole.</p>
<p>Previously, biochemical and structural studies with homologous proteins from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> demonstrated that MglB is the GAP of MglA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref005">5</xref>]. MglA and MglB from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>thermophilus</italic> (TtMglA and TtMglB) share 62% and 29% sequence identities, respectively, with the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> counterparts. Unlike the majority of small Ras-like GTPases, both the active site residues of the GTPase were found within TtMglA itself (Arg53<sup>A</sup> and Gln82<sup>A</sup>; residue names with superscript “A” denote residues of MglA) instead of being contributed by the GAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref005">5</xref>]. A dimer of TtMglB interacts with a monomer of TtMglA. The structural studies revealed that β<sub>2</sub> strand of TtMglA undergoes a screw-type movement during the interaction between TtMglA and TtMglB in the presence of GTP analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref005">5</xref>]. The β-screw movement positions the active site residues favorably for GTP hydrolysis. In contrast to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>thermophilus</italic> is not known to switch polarity and appears to lack most of the other regulatory components (e.g., Frz proteins). Hence, it is imperative to study the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> proteins for a complete molecular characterization of the oscillatory system.</p>
<p>In this study, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> MglA and MglB (MxMglA and MxMglB). Our investigations led to the discovery of an allosteric pocket on the small Ras-like GTPase fold. Allosteric binding of the C-terminal helix (Ct-helix) of MxMglB on MxMglA facilitates nucleotide exchange. Thus, MxMglB plays a dual role in increasing the GTPase activity of MxMglA by orienting the catalytic residues (role of a GAP) and by facilitating exchange of GDP with GTP (role of a GEF). Furthermore, our study reveals that the Ct-helix plays an important role in regulating the mutually exclusive localization of MglA, MglB, and RomR. Accordingly, deletion of the helix in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> trapped MglA, MglB, and RomR at both poles of the cell and drastically affected motility. Importantly, the study reveals the integration of GAP and GEF activities into a single interacting partner of a prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPase. Our study highlights the mechanistic features of a GEF in a prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPase family.</p>

<title>Structure of MxMglAB–GTPγS complex revealed a binding site for MxMglB Ct-helix</title>
<p>Crystal structure of the complex of MxMglA and MxMglB in the presence of guanosine 5’-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTPγS) (MxMglAB–GTPγS), a substrate analogue, was determined at a resolution of 2.4 Å (PDB ID: 6IZW; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s008">S1 Table</xref>). In the structure, a monomer of MxMglA was bound to a dimer of MxMglB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). MxMglA interacts with the MxMglB dimer through an extensive hydrophobic interface involving β<sub>2</sub> strand of MxMglA and α<sub>2</sub> helices of MxMglB monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), an interface similar to that of TtMglAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>One of the novel features of the MxMglAB–GTPγS complex is the asymmetry between the 2 protomers of MxMglB (labeled MglB<sub>1</sub> and MglB<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). MglB<sub>1</sub> and MglB<sub>2</sub> were asymmetric at their N- and C-terminal residues in the MxMglAB–GTPγS complex. The core of MxMglB, ranging from residues 10 to 131, belongs to the Roadblock/LC7 (Rbl/LC7) domain fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref018">18</xref>]. In MglB<sub>1</sub>, the N-terminal amino acids (2–7) comprised a β-strand that formed hydrogen bonds with the β<sub>0</sub> strand of MxMglA, thus continuing the central β-sheet of the MxMglA fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). α<sub>1</sub> helix of the Rbl/LC7 fold started from Glu11<sup>B</sup> (residue names with superscript B denote residues of MglB) of MglB<sub>1</sub>. In contrast, in MglB<sub>2</sub>, residues 1 to 7 were disordered, and the α<sub>1</sub> helix comprised ordered residues starting from Tyr8<sup>B</sup>.</p>
<p>At the C terminus, density was absent for residues 131 to146. However, residues 147 to 157 of the MglB<sub>1</sub> protomer could be modeled into the electron density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s001">S1D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s001">S1E Fig</xref>), which adopted a helical conformation. Henceforth, this will be referred to as Ct-helix (C-terminal helix of MxMglB). In the MglB<sub>2</sub> protomer, electron density was absent for residues beyond 130. The Ct-helix of MglB<sub>1</sub> bound to a pocket in MxMglA distal from the nucleotide-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The binding pocket in MxMglA was formed by the residues of the α<sub>5</sub> helix, β<sub>2</sub> strand, and the loop connecting β<sub>2</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> strands (β<sub>2</sub>–β<sub>3</sub> loop) of MxMglA (interswitch region of small Ras-like GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref019">19</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The corresponding β<sub>2</sub> to β<sub>3</sub> loop was disordered in the TtMglAB structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref005">5</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s001">S1C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The conformational features described below are consistent with the previously determined structures of the corresponding complex from TtMglAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref005">5</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Some of the prominent features are the optimal orientation of the active site residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2F</xref>) and the β-screw movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2H</xref>), which were also observed in the TtMglAB structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref005">5</xref>]. The conformational changes between MxMglA–GDP and the MxMglA–GTPγS bound to MxMglB resulted in movements of switch 1 and switch 2 such that Arg53<sup>A</sup> and Gln82<sup>A</sup> of MxMglA are now oriented towards the catalytic water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Another interesting observation is the orientation of the residues Thr54<sup>A</sup> and Asp58<sup>A</sup> of MxMglA, which coordinate the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion bound to GTPγS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). The β-screw movement exposed hydrophobic residues of MxMglA toward the MxMglB interface and facilitated MxMglAB interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2H</xref>).</p>

<title>Ct-helix allosterically affected the GTPase activity</title>
<p>To elucidate the functional role of the MglB<sub>1</sub> Ct-helix, we compared features of GTPase stimulation and MxMglA interaction with full-length MxMglB (MglB) and a truncated version of MxMglB lacking the Ct-helix (MglB<sup>ΔCt</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s001">S1F Fig</xref>).

The reactions were carried out with excess GTP (substrate) and hence measured multiple turnovers of the GTPase. Both approaches for monitoring enzyme activity showed similar rates of hydrolysis. The GTPase activity of MxMglA on its own was negligibly low, whereas the activity increased in the presence of MxMglB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).

Control experiments were performed with only MxMglB (no MxMglA) and excess of MxMglB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).

<p>We found that the GTP hydrolysis rate was approximately 2-fold lower in the presence of MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> compared with MxMglB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The GTPase activity remained low despite using 5 times excess of MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), suggesting that the effect was not due to a reduced affinity of MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> to MxMglA. We compared the GTPase activities with that of the active site mutant MxMglA<sup>Q82L</sup> (referred to as MxMglA<sup>Q</sup>) in the presence of MxMglB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s002">S2B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s002">S2C Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The GTPase activity of MxMglAB<sup>ΔCt</sup> was, however, higher than that of MxMglA<sup>Q</sup>B.</p>
<p>Next, we proceeded to confirm that the interactions observed in the crystal structure between Ct-helix and the binding pocket of MxMglA are indeed relevant for the observed increase in GTPase activity. Analysis of the crystal structure of MxMglAB–GTPγS complex showed that Asp150<sup>B</sup>, Asp151<sup>B</sup>, and Asp152<sup>B</sup> on the MxMglB Ct-helix formed water-mediated as well as direct interactions with MxMglA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Lys181<sup>A</sup> and Lys185<sup>A</sup> of the α<sub>5</sub> helix of MxMglA interacted with Phe157<sup>B</sup> and Asp154<sup>B</sup> of the MxMglB Ct-helix, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Leu64<sup>A</sup> and Ile67<sup>A</sup> of MxMglA were on the β<sub>2</sub> to β<sub>3</sub> loop (interswitch region) and were within interacting distances from the MxMglB Ct-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). There was a reduction in GTPase activity in the presence of MxMglB<sup>3D</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), a mutant of MxMglB in which Asp150<sup>B</sup>, Asp151<sup>B</sup>, and Asp152<sup>B</sup> on the Ct-helix were replaced with alanine. Additionally, we studied the GTPase activities of the MxMglA mutants MxMglA<sup>K</sup> (a double mutant of K181A and K185A) and MxMglA<sup>L</sup> (a double mutant of L64A and I67A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s002">S2B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s002">S2D–S2F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>MxMglB-stimulated GTPase activity of the MxMglA mutants was less than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). The GTPase activity remained lower despite 5-fold increase in the concentration of MxMglB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). The above data demonstrated that mutation of residues in the helix-binding pocket affected rate of nucleotide hydrolysis, even though they were located away from the GTPase active site. This implied that MxMglB Ct-helix played an allosteric role in regulating the GTPase.</p>

<title>Ct-helix facilitated interaction between MxMglB and GDP-bound MxMglA</title>

The binding affinities (reported as <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> values) between MxMglB and <italic>m-</italic>GNP–and <italic>m-</italic>GDP–bound MxMglA (0.10 ± 0.04 μM and 0.12 ± 0.03 μM, respectively) were comparable to the binding affinity of 0.29 ± 0.08 μM between MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> and <italic>m-</italic>GNP-bound MxMglA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s009">S2A Table</xref>). <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> between MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> and <italic>m-</italic>GDP-bound MxMglA could not be estimated, because the binding was insignificant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s009">S2A Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the Ct-helix appears to be essential for stabilizing the interaction between MxMglB and GDP-bound MxMglA. In the previous study with TtMglB, the binding between TtMglB and TtMglA was observed only in the presence of GNP (or GTP analogues), a characteristic feature of a GAP. Our studies imply that nucleotide hydrolysis by MxMglA is not sufficient for disrupting the MxMglAB complex in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic>. Also, interaction with the GDP-bound state of a GTPase is a characteristic feature of a GEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref017">17</xref>]. Because we observed that MxMglA and MxMglB interact in the presence of GDP, we proceeded to check whether MxMglB could also perform a GEF function.</p>

<title>Ct-helix of MxMglB contributed toward nucleotide exchange</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the purified MxMglA contained GDP bound to the active site pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). To observe the loading of <italic>m</italic>-GDP to MxMglA, fluorescence intensity of <italic>m</italic>-GDP was monitored upon addition of MxMglA. An increase in fluorescence intensity indicated increased binding of <italic>m</italic>-GDP. Exchange was observed to occur spontaneously upon addition of MxMglA but was accelerated upon addition of a mix of MxMglA and MxMglB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, phase I). In contrast, the presence of MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> instead of MxMglB did not affect the exchange kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, phase I). The trend did not change despite addition of MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> in a 1:10 ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s002">S2G Fig</xref>). Next, we monitored the exchange kinetics by competing the bound <italic>m</italic>-GDP with excess of unlabeled GDP.

<p>We proceeded to carry out the same experiment by competing <italic>m</italic>-GDP with GTP, a relevant reaction for a GEF activity. MxMglB addition affected the rate of displacement of <italic>m</italic>-GDP in this experiment too (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4B</xref>; phase II). Loading with <italic>m</italic>-GNP and competition with unlabeled GTP provided further information on the exchange kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Lack of a major increase in fluorescence indicated that binding of <italic>m</italic>-GNP to MxMglA was very unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, phase I). This, presumably, is due to the presence of unlabeled GDP prebound to the MxMglA sample. However, addition of either MxMglB or MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> with MxMglA stabilized the binding of <italic>m</italic>-GNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, phase I). The rate of exchange of prebound GDP (from purification of MxMglA) with <italic>m-</italic>GNP (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, phase I) for MxMglA+MxMglB mix was 3 times faster than that of MxMglA+MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> mix. Subsequent competition of <italic>m</italic>-GNP with unlabeled GTP in the MxMglA+MxMglB mix and the MxMglA+MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> mix showed very slow or negligible exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, phase II).</p>
<p>These experiments suggested that MxMglA favored binding of GDP over GTP. However, in the presence of MxMglB, GTP bound better than GDP, as evidenced by a higher <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> and higher <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> for <italic>m</italic>-GDP and a higher <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> but a lower <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> for <italic>m</italic>-GNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In contrast, MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> did not affect the MxMglA–GDP complex (equal <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> for <italic>m</italic>-GDP for MxMglA and MxMglA+MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> mix; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, phase I). However, it stabilized the GTP-bound conformation of MxMglA (increased intensity for <italic>m</italic>-GNP exchange; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, phase I). This effect is consistent with our observations that MxMglB interacts with both MxMglA–GDP and MxMglA–GTP, whereas MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> interacts only with MxMglA–GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Thus, MxMglB functions not only by stabilizing GTP-bound MxMglA but also by destabilizing the bound GDP, whereas MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> contributes only toward stabilizing GTP-bound MxMglA.</p>
<p>Our assays measuring exchange kinetics with different combinations of labeled and unlabeled nucleotide pairs clearly implied that the Ct-helix played a role in nucleotide exchange. Consequently, we concluded that MxMglB accelerates MxMglA GTPase not only by appropriately orienting the catalytic residues but also by facilitating GDP release through an allosteric effect via the Ct-helix. This effect increased the overall hydrolysis rate in our GTPase assays, which are multiple turnover enzymatic reactions.</p>

<title><italic>mglB</italic><sup>ΔCt</sup> does not respond to frz signaling similar to Δ<italic>mglB</italic></title>
<p>To test whether the MxMglB Ct-helix is important for MxMglB activity in vivo, we expressed MxMglB and the MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> variant under the control of <italic>mglB</italic> promoter at the <italic>Mx8</italic> phage attachment site in an <italic>mglB</italic> deletion mutant of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> (Δ<italic>mglB</italic>). MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> was stably expressed, although its expression level appeared slightly decreased compared to MxMglB (it is also possible that this apparent decrease is because the Ct-helix is an important epitope for the MxMglB antibody; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s003">S3A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> must nevertheless carry biological activity because it induced a drastic motility phenotype and localized at the poles (see below). MglA was expressed to comparable levels in strains complemented by MxMglB or MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s003">S3A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). The level of MglA is slightly reduced in a Δ<italic>mglB</italic> mutant because of a weak polar effect but this reduction did not create detectable phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref007">7</xref>].

The motility phenotype was in fact more pronounced than for the Δ<italic>mglB</italic> mutant, suggesting that expression of MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> deeply perturbs the function of MglA. However, single cells were motile, and the defect could be linked, at least partially, to aberrant cell reversals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s003">S3C Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s003">S3D Fig</xref>).

<p>Earlier, it has been shown that MglA and MglB, which exist in almost all phyla of eubacteria, can be categorized into 5 phylogenetically related groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref025">25</xref>].

<p>Out of these 56 coupled sequences, the α<sub>5</sub> helix (which interacts with the Ct-helix) of 48 MglA sequences possessed positively charged residues (either lysines or arginines; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). These positively charged residues were not conserved in other MglA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This suggested that the Ct-helix of MglB and its binding pocket on MglA have coevolved. Interestingly, we found MglB having the D/E rich Ct-helix to be present in all the 5 phylogenetic groups of MglA-like proteins, including a variety of bacteria and also in the archaea <italic>Methanobacterium paludis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).

<title>MxMglB Ct-helix facilitates nucleotide exchange allosterically</title>
<p>Our results revealed that the Ct-helix is essential for MxMglB to interact with MxMglA in the GDP-bound state. Deletion of the helix resulted in the formation of MxMglAB complex in the presence of only GTP but not GDP. This prompted us to identify the structural features that enable MxMglB to bind MxMglA–GDP. The β-screw movement (flipping of MxMglA β<sub>2</sub> strand) appears to be essential for the interaction of MxMglB with MxMglA. This conformational change exposes residues that form a major part of MxMglAB interface.</p>
<p>An inspection of the MxMglAB–GTPγS structure revealed that the switch 1 loop and the binding pocket of the Ct-helix are at the N- and C-terminal ends of the β<sub>2</sub> strand of MxMglA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). Hence, we propose that the flipped state of the β<sub>2</sub> strand that favors MxMglB binding can be achieved in 2 ways—by interaction of either the γ phosphate of GTP with the switch 1 loop or the Ct-helix with the β<sub>2</sub> to β<sub>3</sub> loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). The flipped state achieved by the Ct-helix interaction and the consequent stabilization by the Rbl/LC7 fold of MxMglB results in the formation of a complex with MxMglA–GDP. As a consequence of the flipped state of the β<sub>2</sub> strand, MxMglA in the MxMglAB complex will potentially possess a nucleotide-binding pocket that favors binding of GTP over GDP, consistent with our observations from the nucleotide exchange assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Thus, the proposed model provides an explanation for MxMglAB–GDP complex formation and a mechanistic insight into the allosteric action of Ct-helix for facilitating nucleotide exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>

<p>Interestingly, like MglB, many eukaryotic GEFs such as DENN-1B domain, TRAPP-I, and Mon1-Ccz1, have the Rbl/LC7 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref026">26</xref>]. Furthermore, we found that the intersubunit orientation in MglAB is conserved in the GTPase-GEF complexes of Rab35 with DENN-1B domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref027">27</xref>], Rab Ypt1p with TRAPP-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref028">28</xref>], and Ypt7 with Mon1-Ccz1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref029">29</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). However, unlike in MglAB complex, the mechanism of GEF action in these eukaryotic systems is based on a glutamate or aspartate residue interacting directly with switch 1 or switch 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s006">S6A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). These residues are present in extensions from the Rbl/LC7 fold or are contributed by other interacting partners that form the GEF complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

<title>Mechanism of dual GAP and GEF action by MxMglB</title>
<p>We propose that MxMglB increases the rate of GTP hydrolysis by MxMglA through 2 complementary ways. Firstly, Rbl/LC7 domain of MxMglB stabilizes the flipped β<sub>2</sub> strand interface, which orients the MxMglA catalytic residues favorably. Secondly, its Ct-helix, a flexible extension from the main Rbl/LC7 fold, retains the flipped state of the β<sub>2</sub> strand post GTP hydrolysis and, consequently, stabilizes the MxMglAB–GDP complex. This interaction results in a nucleotide-binding pocket that accelerates release of GDP from the complex and favors GTP-binding. Thus, by facilitating GDP-to-GTP exchange MxMglB enhances the rate of GTP hydrolysis by MxMglA, increasing its potency as a GAP. Indeed, our in vitro results show that MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> exhibits reduced GAP activity, which we attribute to a defect in nucleotide exchange.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Role of Ct-helix and exchange activity of MxMglB in the polarity oscillation cycle</title>
<p>In vivo, we propose that the MxMglB Ct-helix is critical for the balance between GAP and GEF activities at the lagging pole. In absence of the Ct-helix, all 3 proteins—MglA, MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup>, and RomR—localize to both cell poles. Thus, the MxMglB Ct-helix is absolutely required to enable the cascade of interactions that establish polarity and permit its switch. Co-localization of both MxMglA and MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> suggest that MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> does not support its GAP function in vivo, despite exhibiting only a reduction in GAP activity in vitro. In between reversals in wild-type cells, MxMglB and RomRX stably co-localize at the lagging pole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref015">15</xref>]. MxMglA is efficiently excluded from the lagging pole, suggesting that the GAP activity of MxMglB predominates over the GEF activity of RomRX. Thus the MglB Ct-helix possibly overcomes the action of RomRX.</p>
<p>How could this function at the molecular level? Analysis of RomR revealed a stretch of negatively charged residues (Glu-rich) akin to that of MxMglB Ct-helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Thus, similar to MxMglB, the RomRX complex could facilitate GDP exchange from MxMglA by acting through the allosteric pocket on MxMglA. In this process, the C-terminal Glu-rich region of RomR might thus assist nucleotide exchange, whereas RomX could assist in stabilizing the flipped β<sub>2</sub> strand of MxMglA. We tested this hypothesis by replacing the Ct-helix of MxMglB with the Ct-helix from RomR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s007">S7A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s007">S7B Fig</xref>) and carrying out GTPase activity measurements in the presence of the chimeric MglB (MglB<sup>Rhelix</sup>). Indeed, we observed that the chimeric construct accelerated the GTPase activity of MglA similar to that of wild-type MxMglB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s007">S7C Fig</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the Ct-helix of RomR is capable of binding at the allosteric pocket of MxMglA. At the lagging pole, the MxMglB Ct-helix and the RomR Glu-rich helix might compete for binding at the MxMglA helix-binding pocket, which would displace RomRX from MxMglA. When the MglB Ct-helix is deleted, RomRX could therefore interact with MxMglA thus blocking MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> from exerting its GAP activity. This would allow RomRX to exert its GEF activity at the lagging pole too and stabilize the anchoring of MglA to both the poles.</p>
<p>Additional regulation of the Ct-helix must take place to determine the nucleotide specificity of MxMglB binding to MxMglA. Additional regulators in vivo will potentially determine the accessibility of the Ct-helix and thus the localization of MxMglA and MxMglB. At the pole, the exact molecular organization of the signaling complexes is not known. Other proteins that participate in the polarity switch and that are present at the lagging pole, for example, the MglB-like protein MglC, can potentially regulate the Ct-helix availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref030">30</xref>]. During the switch, action of FrzX<sup>P</sup> could, for example, block the inhibitory effect of MglB on RomRX and thus initiate the switch. This possibility could be explored in the future. Further characterization of other polarity determining components and their interactions with MxMglAB are therefore essential to discriminate the GAP and GEF-active phases of MxMglB during the polarity reversal cycle.</p>
<p>Insights gained from the prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPase MxMglA and its interacting partner MxMglB highlight the dual role of MxMglB both as a GAP and a GEF. The novel mechanism of GEF action is based on an allosteric interaction with the small Ras-like GTPase. Based on sequence analysis, it appears to be a conserved mechanism among prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPases. The study also opens up a new avenue for design of compounds or factors that can modulate the enzyme activity by targeting the newly discovered allosteric binding pocket of the universal Ras-like fold.</p>

<p>Binding of fluorescently-labeled nucleotides, <italic>mant</italic>-GDP (<italic>m</italic>-GDP) or <italic>mant</italic>-GppNHp (<italic>m</italic>-GNP) (Jena Bioscience) with the proteins were monitored by measuring the change in anisotropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref039">39</xref>]. The excitation and emission wavelengths used for monitoring the <italic>mant</italic>-labeled nucleotide fluorescence were 360 nm and 440 nm, respectively. The experiments were performed on Fluoromax-4 (Horiba), with a sample volume of 200 μl in a cuvette, and excitation and emission slit widths of 5 nm.</p>
<p>Nucleotide binding of MxMglA and its mutants were estimated by measuring the change in fluorescence anisotropy of the <italic>mant</italic>-nucleotide upon titration with increasing concentrations of the protein. Protein samples (MxMglA or its mutants) were titrated against a fixed concentration of <italic>mant</italic>-labeled nucleotide (100 nM). Each reading corresponds to 10 averaged single point anisotropy values. The initial value of anisotropy of the <italic>mant-</italic>labeled nucleotide was subtracted from all the values. GraphPad Prism was used to plot the values against the concentration of protein (concentration of MxMglA) and to fit the data to the binding equation for estimation of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub>. Because it is known that MxMglA has a single binding site for nucleotides, equation for one site-specific binding, as given below, was used to fit the data points. The equation is y = B<sub>max</sub> × x ÷ (K<sub>D</sub> + x), where y represents the bound fraction (fluorescence anisotropy based readout), B<sub>max</sub> is the maximum value obtained, x is the concentration of MxMglA, and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> is the binding constant.</p>
<p>The values were normalized by dividing each of them by the maximum value of anisotropy, B<sub>max</sub>. The normalized anisotropy values were plotted to obtain a binding curve.

<p>Similarly, anisotropy measurements for increasing amounts of MxMglB/MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> with nucleotide-bound MxMglA provided information about the binding affinity of MxMglB to nucleotide-bound MxMglA. A mix of 400 nM of <italic>mant</italic>-labeled nucleotide with 2 μM of MxMglA was titrated with increasing concentrations of MxMglB/MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup>.

<title>NADH coupled assay</title>
<p>GTPase activity measurements were made using a coupled enzyme based assay in which the conversion of NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> is coupled to the utilization of GDP produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref020">20</xref>]. The GTPase or ATPase hydrolyses the nucleotide while pyruvate kinase (PK) uses GDP (or ADP) and phosphoenol pyruvate to produce GTP (or ATP) and pyruvate. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) utilizes NADH and pyruvate to produce NAD<sup>+</sup> and lactate. Because the utilization of NADH is equivalent to the GDP produced by the GTPase reaction, the actual read out is decrease in absorbance of NADH, which in turn estimates the GDP produced by the GTPase. The amount of NADH utilized in the reaction was measured by monitoring the NADH absorbance at 340 nm using a multiplate reader, Varioskan Flash (Thermo Scientific). A master mix was prepared in Buffer A50 containing PEP (1mM; Sigma), GTP (1mM; Jena Bioscience), NADH (600 μm; Sigma), and PK/LDH mix (approximately 25 U/ml; Sigma). All the components of NADH reaction were mixed in a total reaction volume of 200 μl and added in a 96-well plate. The reaction was initiated by addition of MxMglA or MxMglAB mix and their relevant mutant constructs. MxMglA and its mutants were used at 10 μM and MxMglB and its mutants at concentrations 20 μM and 200 μM (in a molar ratio of 1:2 and 1:10 considering monomeric molecular weight of MxMglB).</p>
<p>Readings were recorded at the interval of 20 seconds for 2 hours. The absorbance value of buffer containing GTP was subtracted from all the values.

Readings from 0 to 7,200 seconds were fitted to a line using linear regression, and the slope of the fitted line was calculated to obtain the amount of GDP released (in μM) per unit time. <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> was calculated as the amount of GDP released per unit time per unit enzyme concentration. This value was used further to compare the enzyme activities among all the mutants.

All the enzyme activity assays were performed at 30°C. Readings were taken at different time points, i.e., 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 minutes. To stop the reaction, the sample was heated at 65°C and then malachite green reagent (prepared as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref021">21</xref>]) was added. The absorbance was recorded at 630 nm after 20 minutes of incubation, using a plate reader (Varioskan, Thermo Scientific).

<title>Cell tracking</title>
<p>Image analysis was performed with a newly developed MicrobeJ/FIJI-based tracking procedure. Cells were detected on MicrobeJ by thresholding the phase-contrast images after stabilization. Cells were tracked using MicrobeJ on a minimum of 20 frames by calculating all object distances between 2 consecutive frames and selecting the nearest objects. The computed trajectories were systematically verified manually, and, when errors were encountered, the trajectories were removed. Reversals were scored when cells switched their direction of movement with a distance of reversal at least 0.3 μm long and the angle between the segments was less than 60°. The reversal frequency was calculated by dividing the number of reversals by the duration of the track to generate a reversal frequency per hour. Trajectories with a “distance mean” less than 0.3 μm were removed from the data set. For each strain, 2 movies at least per biological replicate acquired on 2 different days were analyzed and plotted on box plots with MicrobeJ.</p>

A 200 ms exposure time was used for the strain expressing RomR-GFP. The fluorescent intensity profiles of the different strains were generated using MicrobeJ. Briefly, cells were straightened, and the pole of the cells with the strongest fluorescence signal was chosen to orient the cells. Cells with abnormal shapes, unusual fluorescence signals, or dividing were removed from the data set. For each strain, the fluorescence intensity profiles of hundreds of single cells were thus plotted on a same graph.</p>

<title>Comparison of MxMglB Ct-helix with RomR Glu-rich sequence.</title>
<p>(A) Sequence alignment of RomR Glu-rich C-terminal sequence with MxMglB Ct-helix sequence. Negatively charged residues are shown in blue, hydrophobic residues in red, and positively charged residues in pink. The conservation of amino acids is marked according to ClustalO format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref045">45</xref>]. “*,” “:,” and “.” denote identity, similarity, and conservation of polar residues. (B) Secondary structure prediction of C-terminal end of RomR highlighting that the C-terminal region has helical features (highlighted by pink cylinder). Only the helical region (residues 375 to 417) following a long unstructured stretch from 125 to 370 residues is shown. The figure was generated using PSIPRED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000459.ref048">48</xref>]. (C) GTPase activities of wild-type MxMglA only (green) and in the presence of MxMglB (dark purple; MglAB), MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> (magenta; MglAB<sup>ΔCt</sup>), and MxMglB<sup>Rhelix</sup> (orange; MglAB<sup>Rhelix</sup>). MxMglA and MxMglB variants were used in a ratio of 1:2 considering monomeric molecular weight of MxMglB. The release of GDP was estimated using NADH-based enzyme-coupled assay. The lines corresponding to MxMglAB and MxMglB<sup>Rhelix</sup> are shown with shaded zones depicting the error represent the average of at least 3 repeats, whereas MxMglB<sup>ΔCt</sup> and MxMglA are shown without highlighting error because the data in this figure panel represent only 2 repeats.
