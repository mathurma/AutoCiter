<abstract>
<p>Posttranscriptional modifications in transfer RNA (tRNA) are often critical for normal development because they adapt protein synthesis rates to a dynamically changing microenvironment. However, the precise cellular mechanisms linking the extrinsic stimulus to the intrinsic RNA modification pathways remain largely unclear. Here, we identified the cytosine-5 RNA methyltransferase NSUN2 as a sensor for external stress stimuli. Exposure to oxidative stress efficiently repressed NSUN2, causing a reduction of methylation at specific tRNA sites. Using metabolic profiling, we showed that loss of tRNA methylation captured cells in a distinct catabolic state. Mechanistically, loss of NSUN2 altered the biogenesis of tRNA-derived noncoding fragments (tRFs) in response to stress, leading to impaired regulation of protein synthesis. The intracellular accumulation of a specific subset of tRFs correlated with the dynamic repression of global protein synthesis. Finally, NSUN2-driven RNA methylation was functionally required to adapt cell cycle progression to the early stress response. In summary, we revealed that changes in tRNA methylation profiles were sufficient to specify cellular metabolic states and efficiently adapt protein synthesis rates to cell stress.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in diseases such as metabolic disorders and cancer remains a major challenge for targeted therapies. Phenotypic disease variation can be caused by cell type–specific modulation of gene products via both the transcription and translation machineries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref002">2</xref>]. Recently, the formation of a variety of chemical modifications in RNA emerged as an additional regulatory layer of gene expression programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Of the over 170 known RNA modifications, methylation is the most common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref004">4</xref>]. In RNA, 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) is often required for normal development, and its formation is mediated by at least eight highly conserved enzymes (NSUN1–7 and DNMT2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref005">5</xref>]. For instance, loss-of-function mutations in the human <italic>NSUN2</italic> and <italic>NSUN3</italic> genes cause neurodevelopmental and mitochondrial disorders, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref009">9</xref>]. NSUN2 methylates transfer RNAs (tRNAs) site-specifically at either the anticodon or variable loop (VL), thereby protecting tRNAs from endonucleolytic cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>]. This protection is important to prevent the accumulation of tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), which would otherwise inhibit protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Phenotypically, the loss of NSUN2 thus leads to an expansion of low translating stem and progenitor populations in skin and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref014">14</xref>]. Low protein synthesis in slowly cycling or quiescent stem cells saves energy and prevents premature exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref017">17</xref>] and is required to maintain a fully functional stem cell state by enhancing resilience towards differentiation cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The precise mechanisms linking external stresses to RNA modifications and protein synthesis have remained largely unknown in mammals. Here, we reveal that one such mechanism is the endogenous and dynamic methylation of RNA by NSUN2. Our data show that expression of NSUN2 is required to metabolically support high protein synthesis rates. By performing a time course that mapped endogenous, stress-induced tRNA methylation, we observed for the first time, to our knowledge, that loss of methylation occurs in a highly site-specific manner as early as 2 hours following an insult. Stress-induced loss of tRNA methylation altered both the fragmentation pattern among tRNAs and protein synthesis rates. Thus, our data reveal how RNA methylation is mechanistically integrated into metabolic homeostasis.</p>

<title>NSUN2 regulation of stem cell differentiation is not controlled via transcription</title>
<p>Disruption of the <italic>Nsun2</italic> gene in mice causes global hypomethylation of tRNAs and a developmental growth retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref005">5</xref>]. The abnormal development of tissues including brain and skin is the result of impaired stem cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref018">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). The expression of NSUN2 is highly dynamic within tissues. For instance, NSUN2 is absent in quiescent stem cells in hair follicle bulges (BGs), steadily increases in progenitor cells in the hair germ (HG), and is highest in the growing (anagen) hair bulb (HB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To dissect the underlying molecular pathways that decrease stem cell sensitivity towards differentiation stimuli in the absence of NSUN2, we transcriptionally profiled mouse stem and progenitor cell populations in the hair follicles, as well as hair follicles in the resting (telogen) or growing (anagen) state. Stem and progenitor cells were isolated by flow sorting using the cell surface marker integrin alpha-6 (ITGA6) and then further separated into quiescent stem cells (ITGA6<sup>high</sup>/CD34<sup>+</sup>) and activated, cycling progenitors (ITGA6<sup>low</sup>/P-cadherin [PCAD]<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s001">S1B–S1D Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref021">21</xref>]. In <italic>Nsun2</italic>−/− mouse skin, quiescent stem cells increase at the expense of activated progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref018">18</xref>]. Transcriptional comparison of stem and progenitor cells isolated from wild-type and <italic>Nsun2</italic>−/− mice revealed that this increase does not appear to be transcriptionally driven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Transcriptionally, these cell populations were highly similar, regardless of their expression of NSUN2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s008">S1 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, loss of NSUN2 in actively growing hair follicles (anagen) that highly express NSUN2 in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) resulted in the differential expression of just over 100 genes (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Metabolic genes were highly enriched in these few differentially expressed genes, suggesting that changes in metabolism might account for the insensitivity of stem cells to differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s001">S1E and S1F Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>NSUN2 regulates metabolism by promoting an anabolic cell state</title>
<p>NSUN2 methylates most tRNAs and a smaller number of noncoding and coding RNAs using S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s001">S1G Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref024">24</xref>]. SAM and its downstream metabolite, S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH), are integral to the one-carbon metabolism encompassing the folate and methionine cycles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s001">S1H Fig</xref>). The one-carbon metabolism supports multiple physiological processes, including nucleotide biosynthesis (purines and thymidine), amino acid homeostasis, and the redox defence system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref025">25</xref>]. Similar to NSUN2 deletion, dysregulation of the one-carbon metabolism impairs foetal growth and has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>We therefore asked whether NSUN2 controlled the one-carbon metabolic cycles that generate the methyl donor required for NSUN2 to modify RNA. We used mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to measure how metabolites were affected by loss of NSUN2. We compared wild-type and <italic>Nsun2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> mouse skin in anagen, as well as human dermal fibroblasts expressing (<italic>NSUN2</italic>+/+ and <italic>NSUN2</italic>+/<italic>−</italic>) or lacking NSUN2 (<italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s009">S2 Data</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref007">7</xref>]. Multivariate analysis of either the MS or NMR spectroscopic data clearly separated the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1F–1H</xref>). Therefore, loss of NSUN2 established a distinct cellular metabolic state.</p>
<p>Three major metabolic pathways were affected by deletion of NSUN2: (1) the methionine cycle, (2) amino acid synthetic pathways, and (3) the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1I–1K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s001">S1I–S1N Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s009">S2 Data</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s010">S3 Data</xref>). First, higher levels of metabolites of the methionine cycle strongly indicated that protein degradation was enhanced in the absence of NSUN2. Cellular metabolism up-regulated methionine and SAM, but not SAH, in response to loss of NSUN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). Such an alteration in the stochastic ratio of SAM to SAH can reshape the landscape of protein methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref028">28</xref>]. In particular, increased levels of free symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) can only be caused by enhanced protein degradation, because they are generated solely upon proteolysis of methylated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref029">29</xref>]. Second, we found substantial enhancement of free amino acid levels in the absence of NSUN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s001">S1J and S1M Fig</xref>), indicating a reduced rate of protein synthesis. Third, the changes we observed in the metabolites of the TCA cycle indicated that upon loss of NSUN2, metabolism rebalanced from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1K</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the metabolic changes we observed included increased protein degradation, suppressed protein synthesis, and enhanced glycolysis and together showed that cells lacking NSUN2 are maintained in a catabolic state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s001">S1O Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>NSUN2-expressing and -lacking mouse epidermal cell populations were metabolically different, but their transcriptomes were highly similar.

<p>One functional role of m<sup>5</sup>C in tRNAs is to protect from endonucleolytic cleavage by angiogenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>]. To measure the production of tRFs, we performed small RNA-seq in the rescued <italic>NSUN2</italic>−/− cells. Next, we identified all significantly different tRFs between K190M- and NSUN2-expressing cells (<italic>p</italic>adj &lt; 0.05) that were unaltered when K190M was compared to the empty vector control (<italic>p</italic>adj &gt; 0.75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g002">Fig 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s013">S6 Data</xref>). Overexpression of the wild-type but not the enzymatic dead NSUN2 protein rescued the formation of tRFs smaller than 46 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g002">Fig 2G and 2H</xref>), demonstrating that the biogenesis of distinct tRFs was driven by NSUN2-specific methylation.</p>
<p>Angiogenin-mediated tRNA cleavage inhibits global protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref031">31</xref>]. Therefore, we next asked how mRNA translation was affected by removal of NSUN2. Polysome profiling confirmed differences in the global abundance of polysomes following NSUN2-removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g002">Fig 2I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). To quantify de novo protein synthesis, we measured the incorporation of the reporter molecule O-propargyl-puromycin (OP-puro) into nascent polypeptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s002">S2G Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref032">32</xref>]. OP-puro forms covalent conjugates that can be imaged by microscopy and quantified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s002">S2H Fig</xref>). Treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), a potent inhibitor of mRNA translation, served as a positive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref033">33</xref>]. Deletion of NSUN2 repressed protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g002">Fig 2J</xref>), whereas inhibition of angiogenin was sufficient to up-regulate protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s002">S2I Fig</xref>). Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) using rapamycin down-regulated NSUN2 protein expression but reduced protein synthesis similarly in NSUN2-expressing and -lacking cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s002">S2J–S2L Fig</xref>). Thus, loss of NSUN2 led to decreased protein synthesis rate. Accordingly, reexpression of NSUN2 enhanced de novo protein synthesis, but this effect was independent of its methylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g002">Fig 2K</xref>). One explanation for why expression of K190M also led to the up-regulation of protein synthesis might be that its binding protected the unmethylated tRNAs from processing.</p>
<p>Finally, we asked whether restoring NSUN2-specific methylation sites also affected the one-carbon metabolism. Although reexpression of NSUN2 or K190M significantly altered the metabolic profile of <italic>NSUN2−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s002">S2M and S2N Fig</xref>), NSUN2 expression was not sufficient to reverse the catabolic cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g002">Fig 2L–2N</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s014">S7 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, NSUN2-dependent methylation protected tRNAs from processing into tRFs, and reexpression of NSUN2 in <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells enhanced protein synthesis in a methylation-independent manner. However, expression of NSUN2 was not sufficient to switch from a catabolic to anabolic cell state.</p>

<title>NSUN2 functions in the dynamic adaptation of protein synthesis in response to stress</title>
<p>One explanation for why up-regulation of NSUN2 was not sufficient to induce an anabolic cell state was that both tRNA methylation and metabolism normally function in response to external cues. Therefore, we next sought to determine the importance of NSUN2-mediated RNA methylation in response to a changing microenvironment. As a stimulus, we chose stress because NSUN2 is required for the proper cellular response upon stress signals in brain and skin in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The dynamic regulation of protein synthesis is an integral part of the cellular stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref034">34</xref>]. Global protein synthesis is repressed in response to oxidative stress, and translation of mRNAs that encode specific stress-related proteins is enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Therefore, we analysed how global protein synthesis changed over time in response to stress by measuring OP-puro incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In <italic>NSUN2</italic>+/+ cells, protein synthesis rates changed dynamically upon sodium arsenite (NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) treatment and recovered within 4 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g003">Fig 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).

<title>NSUN2 functions in the oxidative stress response by altering the cell cycle phases</title>
<p>To test for the functional relevance of NSUN2-regulated protein synthesis rates, we asked what impact NSUN2 deletion had on cell survival, as oxidative modifications to RNA can result in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref035">35</xref>].

<title>Cytosine-5 RNA methylation is a metabolic sensor of external stress</title>
<p>Since the dynamic regulation of protein synthesis was reduced when cells lacked NSUN2 and the down-regulation of global translation is integral to the cellular stress response, we next asked whether NSUN2 acted as a sensor of the external stress stimulus. We measured how endogenous NSUN2 expression was affected by oxidative stress induced by exposure to sodium arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). NSUN2 expression decreased sharply on RNA and protein levels between 1 and 2 hours of sodium arsenite treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>), which coincided with the formation of stress granules in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Similarly, one stimulus of UVB exposure was sufficient to rapidly reduce <italic>Nsun2</italic> RNA levels in human epidermal and dermal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), whereas vehicle control treatments did not affect NSUN2 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s004">S4C Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The nucleolus, where NSUN2 resides, can act as a stress sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref039">39</xref>]. Nucleophosmin (NPMI) is a marker for nucleolar stress, and we observed a rapid, strong down-regulation of both NPMI and NSUN2 upon arsenite treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Additional NSUN family members residing in the mitochondria (NSUN3, NSUN4) and cytoplasm (NSUN6) were similarly repressed in response to arsenite stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In conclusion, expression of NSUN2 and at least three of its m<sup>5</sup>C RNA methyltransferase family members were repressed in response to oxidative stress.</p>

<title>Stress induces a site-specific and dynamic loss of m<sup>5</sup>C</title>
<p>We then asked how stress-related loss of NSUN2 altered tRNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Indeed, MS quantifying total m<sup>5</sup>C in tRNAs confirmed that cells chronically lacking NSUN2 (<italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic>) show low levels of m<sup>5</sup>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>]. However, acute depletion of NSUN2 by oxidative stress exposure resulted in no significant differences in total m<sup>5</sup>C levels in tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Because tRNAs are highly abundant and stable and commonly contain m<sup>5</sup>C, we considered the possibility that early site-specific changes might not be detectable by MS. Therefore, we performed RNA BS-seq to quantify m<sup>5</sup>C at single-nucleotide resolution in tRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s004">S4D Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>RNA BS-seq revealed only a modest overall reduction of cytosine-5 tRNA methylation at NSUN2-dependent sites in two independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s004">S4E Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s015">S8A and S8B Data</xref>). NSUN2-independent methylated sites were unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s004">S4F Fig</xref>). Furthermore, our data allowed a high-resolution inspection of specific sites that require NSUN2 activity, which showed dynamic and reproducible changes in response to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4G–4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s004">S4G–S4I Fig</xref>). For example, methylation at C34 in Leu<sup>CAA</sup> decreased gradually with arsenite treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4H and 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s004">S4H Fig</xref>). Methylation of Asp<sup>GTC</sup> at position C47 only significantly changed at 2 hours of arsenite treatment, whereas nearby sites (C38, C48) remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4H and 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s004">S4I Fig</xref>). We observed a similar change in methylation levels when we pooled all other potentially non–tRNA targeted sites by NSUN2, whereas other m<sup>5</sup>C sites were unaffected by stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s016">S9A and S9B Data</xref>). Together, our data revealed that NSUN2-mediated deposition of m<sup>5</sup>C at distinct sites in tRNAs changed dynamically in response to oxidative stress.</p>

<title>Dynamic changes of site-specific m<sup>5</sup>C levels require NSUN2</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether NSUN2 was solely responsible for causing the site-specific methylation changes in tRNAs in response to oxidative stress.

<p>We confirmed that the overexpressed proteins behaved like endogenous NSUN2 and were down-regulated upon exposure to arsenite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), and then we assessed how global methylation levels changed. We selected all significant sites with more than 20% methylation in the NSUN2-rescued cells when compared to K190M-infected cells and found that the overall median methylation levels remained largely unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). MS for m<sup>5</sup>C using all tRNAs or tRNA Leu<sup>CAA</sup> confirmed similar methylation levels after exposure stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). Thus, global methylation levels in <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> rescued cells remained largely stable in response to stress.</p>
<p>Then, we identified all individual m<sup>5</sup>C sites showing significantly different methylation levels in NSUN2-rescued cells after 2 or 4 hours of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). A majority of these specific sites required NSUN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), and their changes in methylation were highly comparable to cells expressing endogenous NSUN2 (<italic>NSUN2</italic>+/+; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g004">Fig 4G–4I</xref>). For instance, C34 in the anticodon loop of tRNA Leu<sup>CAA</sup> exhibited up to 4-fold reduction of methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>). Levels of m<sup>5</sup>C located to other positions showed a more modest reduction or were unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5I–5L</xref>). Thus, we identified specific m<sup>5</sup>C sites that recapitulated the same changes in methylation when exposed to stress as described for <italic>NSUN2</italic>+/+ cells. Our rescue experiment therefore demonstrates that distinct m<sup>5</sup>C sites in tRNAs changed dynamically in response to stress and that these changes in methylation levels directly depended on NSUN2.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Methylation levels within the same tRNA molecule are independent from each other</title>
<p>To explain why the site-specific methylation levels were not detected by MS, we first considered the possibility that unmethylated tRNAs escaped the MS analysis because of the long half-life of methylated tRNAs and the enhanced biogenesis of tRFs in response to stress. To test this hypothesis, we measured m<sup>5</sup>C in stress-exposed tRNAs in the presence of an angiogenin inhibitor (N65828) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref041">41</xref>]. Indeed, we measured a reduction of m<sup>5</sup>C in all tRNAs and more than 2-fold reduction in tRNA Leu<sup>CAA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5M</xref>), confirming that angiogenin was a major endonuclease cleaving unmethylated tRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). However, the number of m<sup>5</sup>C per tRNA Leu<sup>CAA</sup> decreased only slightly after 4 hours of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5M</xref>; upper panel). tRNA Leu<sup>CAA</sup> contained two methylation sites, one in the anticodon C34 and one in the VL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5N–5P</xref>), and these sites were affected differently by oxidative stress. Only C34 decreased upon stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g005">Fig 5N–5P</xref>). We observed a similar dynamic change of methylation patterns within tRNA His<sup>GTG</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s005">S5E Fig</xref>). Moreover, other leucine isotype tRNAs such as Leu<sup>CAG</sup> were not methylated at C34 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). Thus, our data revealed that site-specific methylation of tRNAs changes dynamically during the cellular stress response even within the same tRNA molecule.</p>

<title>Site-specific tRNA methylation determines tRFs biogenesis in response to oxidative stress</title>
<p>Next, we asked how altered expression of NSUN2 during the cellular stress response affected the biogenesis of tRFs. We performed small RNA-seq to identify all tRNA-derived sequences that significantly (<italic>p</italic>adj &lt; 0.01) changed in <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells after exposure to sodium arsenite for 2 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s018">S11A and S11B Data</xref>).

Furthermore, we observed an enrichment of fragments starting at around positions 20 and 36, corresponding to the D-loop and the anticodon loop, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Because some RNA modifications can stall reverse transcription (RT) and potentially cause sequencing biases, we only analysed tRNA-derived sequences with consistent coverage in all four replicates and omitted all fragments with missing read values in any of the conditions from the analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s018">S11C Data</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we focused specifically on tRFs that were smaller than 40 nucleotides, which capture the products of endonucleolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s018">S11D Data</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed a clear separation by both genotype and treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), and tRFs from <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells clustered closer to <italic>NSUN2</italic>+/+ cells exposed to stress for 4 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Furthermore, tRFs clearly separated the 2- and 4-hours-treated <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells from their untreated control. In contrast, <italic>NSUN2</italic>+/+ cells only showed distinct changes in tRFs when exposed for 4 hours to arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). When subjected to stress, we discovered three distinct patterns of tRF production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; Cluster 1–3). Each cluster was dominated by distinct tRNA isoacceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), indicating that tRNAs were subjected to processing based on their sequence and potentially other corresponding internal modifications. Our data support a model in which all cells produce tRFs but the tRNA fragmentation pattern depends on the identity of the isoacceptor and the presence of modifications at distinct sites within the tRNA molecule.</p>
<p>In line with the reduction of NSUN2 protein expression in response to stress, tRFs derived from NSUN2-methylated tRNAs significantly increased after 4 hours of stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s006">S6A–S6C Fig</xref>; red and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s005">S5C Fig</xref>).

In conclusion, the production of tRFs in response to stress differed substantially in the absence of NSUN2, confirming that tRF biogenesis was influenced by tRNA methylation, isoacceptor identity, and cellular stress.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Biogenesis of tRF subsets is directly determined by tRNA methylation</title>
<p>To identify tRFs whose biogenesis directly required the enzymatic activity of NSUN2, we performed small RNA-seq analyses in the rescued <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells that were either untreated or exposed to sodium arsenite. We identified all tRFs with differential abundance in NSUN2-rescued cells after 4 hours of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s019">S12 Data</xref>). Untreated NSUN2-rescued cells clustered close to K190M-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), which was due to a distinct set of up-regulated and down-regulated tRFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6F</xref>; ‘NSUN2 4h’). The production of these tRFs required NSUN2-mediated methylation because they remained unchanged in K190M-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>). As described for cells expressing endogenous levels of NSUN2 (<italic>NSUN2</italic>+/+), the up- and down-regulated groups of tRFs were dominated by specific tRNA isoacceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). We concluded that NSUN2-mediated methylation at distinct sites within the tRNA molecule protected from processing into tRFs and thereby promoted efficient mRNA translation.</p>
<p>In particular, the formation of tRNA Glu<sup>CTC</sup>-derived tRFs depended on NSUN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). tRFs inhibit protein synthesis via several mechanisms including through direct inhibition of the ribosome or displacement of RNA-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref045">45</xref>]. To demonstrate that tRFs directly link stress sensing by NSUN2 to repression of protein synthesis, we independently added synthetic 5′ and 3′ tRNA Glu<sup>CTC</sup> fragments to <italic>NSUN2</italic>+/+ and <italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells and measured protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s006">S6E–S6H Fig</xref>). A scrambled noncoding RNA served as a negative control. Within 2 hours, 5′ and 3′ derived tRFs reduced protein synthesis in <italic>NSUN2</italic>+/+ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s006">S6F Fig</xref>). Similar to the stress response, the protein synthesis rate was only temporarily repressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s006">S6F Fig</xref>). In contrast, protein synthesis in <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells was unaffected by the introduction of additional tRFs, since <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells are already saturated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s006">S6G Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s006">S6C Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s005">S5C Fig</xref>).

<p>Two hours after stress exposure, regulators controlling mitochondrial function were significantly enriched in the differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g007">Fig 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s021">S14A Data</xref>). In particular, genes encoding for complex I subunit assembly significantly changed in the absence of NSUN2. Complex I is the major entry point for electrons into the respiratory chain and likely to act as the rate-limiting step in respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref046">46</xref>]. In line with these results, we confirmed that <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells contained less-active mitochondria in particular during the early stress response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Four hours after stress exposure, the differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in regulators of RNA and protein catabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g007">Fig 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s021">S14B Data</xref>). These results closely parallel those of our metabolic assay that showed how loss of m<sup>5</sup>C captures cells in a catabolic state and affected mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000297.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we asked whether factors promoting the stable catabolic state in <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells were translationally regulated and could therefore be identified using ribosome profiling (Ribo seq). We used our previous published dataset (phs000645.v5.p1), in which we profiled <italic>NSUN2−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells that were rescued with NSUN2 or two different enzymatic dead versions of the protein (C271A, C321A) and compared them to the empty vector control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s022">S15 Data</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref012">12</xref>]. We confirmed that genes specifically enriched in the NSUN2-rescued cells were regulators of mRNA translation and RNA catabolic processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s007">S7C–S7E Fig</xref>). We now have further demonstrated that the formation of m<sup>5</sup>C balances protein synthesis with the metabolic requirements of stress responses.</p>
<p>In summary, our data revealed a highly dynamic regulation of protein synthesis rates in response to stress that is tightly coordinated by tRNA methylation and cleavage. We further discovered that loss of a major RNA methyltransferase shaped the biogenesis of tRNA fragments and thereby induced a catabolic cell state.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>mRNA translation is a critical step for all gene expression programmes and also represents the most energy-consuming processes within cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref047">47</xref>]. Therefore, global and transcript-specific translation are continuously adapted to environmental cues including nutrients, growth factors, and stress stimuli. How precisely the external cues are sensed by the mRNA translation machinery, integrated into metabolic pathways, and then coordinated to trigger the appropriate cell response is less well understood. Here, we identify NSUN2 as an important sensor for oxidative stress. NSUN2 further links the environmental cue to the protein synthesis machinery via tRNA methylation. Loss of NSUN2 repressed global protein synthesis and thereby induced a catabolic cell state without affecting gene transcription.</p>
<p>External stress stimuli repress global protein synthesis, causing a switch of translation to stress- and cell type–specific regulatory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref048">48</xref>]. tRNAs play multiple regulatory roles in the adaptation of protein synthesis to the cellular stress response. For instance, the content of internal tRNA modifications and also the level of charged tRNAs rapidly changes in response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref049">49</xref>]. Loss of tRNA methylation at the VL causes global reduction of protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref012">12</xref>]. Changing the modifications at the wobble anticodon position alters transcript-specific translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Mature mammalian tRNAs are extremely stable, with an estimated half-life of 2–4 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref053">53</xref>], making the detection of dynamically changing m<sup>5</sup>C sites within hours of a stress response challenging. Nevertheless, we detected site-specific changes by RNA BS-seq. How m<sup>5</sup>C was site-specifically removed in distinct tRNAs is unknown, as no eraser protein has been identified so far. Alternatively, unmodified tRNAs might have a higher turnover and are therefore more difficult to capture than fully modified tRNAs.</p>
<p>Nucleotide modifications outside the anticodon loop are often linked to differential processing and cleavage of tRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref055">55</xref>]. Accordingly, NSUN2-expressing and -lacking cell populations differed in their production of tRFs under normal conditions and when exposed to cell stress. Depending on NSUN2-expression and stress, we observed distinct tRNA processing patterns. For instance, tRFs derived from tRNA Glu<sup>CTC</sup> were specifically enriched in NSUN2-depleted cells and decreased in abundance with stress. Similarly, synthetic tRNA Glu<sup>CTC</sup> fragments efficiently repressed protein synthesis, yet the effect was only short-lived. How the half-life of tRFs is regulated is currently unknown, but our data strongly indicate a dynamic turnover of the tRFs in response to stress. A high turnover of distinct tRFs can also explain the only temporal repression of global protein synthesis after stress exposure.</p>
<p>In summary, NSUN2-mediated formation of m<sup>5</sup>C is critical for integrating the cellular metabolic state with global protein synthesis and thereby triggers the appropriate cellular responses to external stress stimuli.</p>

<title>Cell sorting and analysis</title>
<p>Mouse keratinocytes from skin in telogen at postnatal day (P)49 of wild-type or NSUN2<sup>−/−</sup> male mice were isolated as follows: whole mouse back skin was sterilised with 10% Betadine and 70% ethanol and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The dermal side was floated on 0.25% trypsin without EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hours at 37°C. The epidermis was subsequently scraped from the dermis and disaggregated by gentle pipetting in low-calcium medium with 10% FCS and filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in the following antibodies to cell surface markers in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA): PE-conjugated anti-ITGA6 (1:500, clone GoH3, eBiosciences), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-CD34 (1:50, RAM34, eBiosciences), and goat anti-PCAD (1:50, R&amp;D Systems).

Operating settings were as follows: positive ion mode, skimmer voltage 15 V, cell accelerator voltage 5 V, N<sub>2</sub> gas temperature 230°C and N<sub>2</sub> gas flow 6 L/minute, sheath gas (N<sub>2</sub>) temperature 400°C with a flow of 12 L/minute, capillary voltage of 2,500 V, nozzle voltage of 0 V, and the nebuliser at 40 psi. The instrument was operated in dynamic MRM mode, and the individual MS parameters for the nucleosides are summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000297.s023">S16 Data</xref>. The mobile phases were A as 5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc (≥99%, HiPerSolv CHROMANORM, VWR) aqueous buffer, brought to pH 5.6 with glacial acetic acid (≥99%, HiPerSolv CHROMANORM, VWR), and B as pure acetonitrile (Roth, LC-MS grade, purity ≥ 99.95). A Synergi Fusion-RP column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, United States; Synergi 2.5 μm Fusion-RP 100 Å, 150 × 2.0 mm) at 35°C and a flow rate of 0.35 ml/minute were used. The gradient began with 100% A for 1 minute and increased to 10% B by 5 minutes and to 40% B by 7 minutes. The column was flushed with 40% B for 1 minute and returned to starting conditions to 100% A by 8.5 minutes followed by re-equilibration at 100% A for 2.5 additional minutes.</p>
<p>For the isolation of single tRNA isoacceptors, a modified approach was used to the one previously described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref064">64</xref>]. Briefly, tRNA LeuCAA was hybridised with a reverse complementary, biotinylated DNA-oligonucleotide (AGT CTG GCG CCT TAG ACC ACT CGG CCA TCC TGA CAA A [Biotin]) followed by immobilisation on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1, Life Technologies). The hybridisation step was performed in 5× SSC buffer (20x: 3 M NaCl, 300 mM trisodium citrate [pH 7.0]) using 1 μl biotinylated oligonucleotide (100 μM) and 1 μg of SEC purified total tRNA per 25 μl beads. Samples were denatured at 90°C for 3 minutes, hybridised at 65°C for 10 minutes, and cooled to room temperature. The magnetic Dynabeads were washed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref064">64</xref>]. Immobilisation of the hybrid was performed at 25°C under shaking for 30 minutes. The supernatant containing nontarget tRNAs was removed, and the beads were washed once in 1× SSC buffer and three times in 0.1× SSC buffer. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl MilliQ water and heated to 80°C for 3 minutes to elute the target tRNA. No further DNase treatment was carried out. The isolated tRNA was digested with 10 μl digestion mix (final volume: 30 μL). Finally, 9 μl of the digested and isolated tRNA was coinjected with 1 μl stable isotope-labelled internal standards for measurement by MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref063">63</xref>].</p>

<title>Sucrose density centrifugation</title>
<p>Sucrose gradients were used to separate subpolysomal and polysomal ribosomes. Sucrose gradients (10%–50% [w/v]) were prepared in gradient buffer (300 mM NaCl<sub>2</sub>, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 15 mM Tris-HCL [pH 7.5], 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml CHX).</p>
<p>Human dermal fibroblasts were grown and treated with sodium arsenite as described above. At 70%–80% confluency, cells were washed twice in PBS-CHX (100 μg/ml) and scraped into 500 μl lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl<sub>2</sub>, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 15 mM tris-HCL [pH 7.5], 1 mM DTT, 0.2 M sucrose, 0.1 mg/ml CHX, 0.5% IGEPAL, 100 U RNasin Plus RNase Inhibitor [N2615; Promega] per 0.5 ml). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 3 minutes prior to pelleting the cells at 1,300<italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes. The supernatant was then layered on top of the gradient and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm (acceleration 9, deceleration 6) for 2 hours at 4°C using an ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Gradients were fractioned using a gradient fractionation system (Presearch), and fractions were collected at 1-minute intervals using the FOXY Jr collection system (Presearch) at a flow rate of 1 ml/minute. Absorbance was measured constantly at 254 nm using a UA-6 UV-VIS detector (Presearch).</p>

<title>Sequencing library preparation</title>
<p>For all sequencing experiments, total RNA was isolated from human dermal fibroblasts, as described. The quality of the RNA and prepared libraries was assessed using the appropriate high-sensitivity RNA and DNA microfluidics chip on the Agilent Bioanalyzer platform (Agilent Technologies). All cDNA libraries were subjected to a cleanup step with the use of Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and further multiplexed for sequencing on a HiSeq platform (Illumina).</p>

<title>RNA BS-seq</title>
<p>RNA BS-seq libraries were generated from untreated and sodium arsenite–treated human dermal fibroblasts for 2 or 4 hours. Two independent experiments were performed; the first consisted of 4 and the second of 5 replicates per genotype and time point. Thus, a total of 9 replicates per condition and genotype were processed and analysed. To generate the samples, RNA was prepared and BS-treated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>]. Briefly, 15 μg of total RNA was depleted from the ribosomal RNA population by using the Ribo-zero kit (MRZH11124, Illumina). Approximately 1–2 μg of rRNA-depleted samples were then BS-treated by mixing them with 42.5 μl 40% sodium BS solution (pH 5.0) and 17.5 μl DNA protection buffer supplied with the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (59104; Qiagen). The reaction mixture was then incubated for three to four cycles of 5 minutes at 70°C, followed by 1 hour at 60°C on a thermal cycler. To desalt the reaction, all samples were passaged through Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography columns, following the manufacturer's instructions (732–6221; Bio-Rad), and next desulfonated by adding an equal volume of 1 M Tris (pH 9.0) to the reaction mixture and incubating for 1 hour at 37°C. BS-treated RNA samples were then precipitated overnight with 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.5), and 1–2 μl Glycoblue (AM9516; Ambion). To repair the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl termini produced during the BS/desulfonation reaction, T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) was used by mixing the RNA with 10x T4 PNK reaction buffer, 10 mM ATP, 10 U of T4 PNK enzyme, and RNase-free H<sub>2</sub>O to a final volume of 50 μl (M0201S; New England Biolabs). This was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, followed by a heat inactivation of the enzyme at 65°C for 20 minutes and an overnight precipitation of the RNA, as before. Approximately 400 ng of BS-converted RNA was finally used to generate BS-seq libraries. Taking into account that the above BS treatment and desulfonation protocol cleaves long RNAs into 100-nucleotide fragments, the TruSeq Small RNA preparation kit was used (Illumina) to generate platform-compatible libraries. In brief, kit-provided RNA-seq adapters were ligated to the BS-converted RNAs, reverse transcribed at 50°C for 1 hour with SuperScript III and 2 mM of each dNTP (18080085; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and followed by a PCR amplification programme, following the user manual's recommendations, to finalise the process.</p>

<title>Standard and small RNA-seq</title>
<p>Standard RNA-seq libraries were generated from human dermal fibroblasts previously treated with sodium arsenite for 2 or 4 hours. All cell samples were processed in four replicates per condition. Total RNA was extracted as described and depleted from ribosomal RNA using the Ribo-zero rRNA Removal Kit (MRZH11124, Illumina). The rRNA-depleted RNA was then used to generate RNA-seq libraries using the NEXTflex Rapid Directional RNA-seq Kit (5138–08; Illumina) or RNAHyper with Riboerase Kit (NEB).</p>
<p>Small RNA libraries were generated from human dermal fibroblasts treated with sodium arsenite for 2 or 4 hours, as described. At least four replicates per condition and genotype were processed and analysed. To generate the small RNA libraries, 10 μg of total RNA was subjected to a deaminoacylation reaction by mixing the purified RNA with 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1 mM EDTA, and RNAse-free H<sub>2</sub>O to a final volume of 300 μl. This reaction was incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C to deaminoacylate mature tRNAs. To further size-select the RNA, samples were loaded on Novex TBE Urea 6% gels (EC68652BOX; Thermo Fisher) and the desired RNA fractions purified. TBE Urea gels were pre-run in 1x TBE buffer (for 5x stock: 54 g Tris base, 27.5 g boric acid, 20 mL of 0.5 M EDTA [pH 8.0]) at 200 V for 30 minutes, while each sample was mixed with 2x Denaturing Sample Buffer (LC6876; Thermo Fisher) and denatured at 80°C for 5 minutes. To avoid renaturation, all samples were kept on ice. The polyacrylamide gels were then loaded with the RNA samples and the RNA Marker Low Easy ladder (R0002; Abnova) and run at 180 V for 1 hour. Each gel was next stained with ethidium bromide in 1x TBE buffer on a shaker for a few minutes, prior to being visualised over a UV transluminator. Using a scalpel and the RNA ladder as a guide, 20–150 bp fragments were excised. The gel piece was placed in a 0.5 ml tube pierced with a needle to create perforations, fitted in a 2 ml RNAse-free tube. To shatter the gel, the tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at maximum speed in a precooled 4°C benchtop centrifuge, and the gel pieces were eluted in 600 μl NaCl and 1 μl RNasin Plus RNase Inhibitor (N2615; Promega) overnight while rotating in a cold room. To remove any gel remnants and salts, each gel eluate was passed through a sterile Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube filter (CLS8160; Corning). The RNA flow-through was precipitated overnight, with ethanol and sodium acetate in −80°C. To collect the size-selected RNA, all samples were centrifuged for 30 minutes at maximum speed in a precooled 4°C benchtop centrifuge, the pellets washed with 70% ethanol, air dried, and finally resuspended in 12 μl RNAse-free H<sub>2</sub>O. To prepare the ends of the fragments for adapter ligation and library preparation, the samples were first heated at 70°C for 10 minutes and then mixed with 10x T4 PNK Reaction Buffer, 20 U of T4 PNK enzyme, and RNase-free H<sub>2</sub>O to a final volume of 50 μl (M0201S; New England Biolabs). This was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, followed by a heat inactivation of the enzyme at 65°C for 20 minutes and a final phenol:chloroform cleanup step and overnight ethanol precipitation. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in 7 μl RNAse-free H<sub>2</sub>O. The libraries were generated using the TruSeq Small RNA Preparation Kit (Illumina), for which 3′ adenylated and 5′ phosphorylated adapters, suitable for Illumina RNA-seq, were ligated to an average of 400 ng small purified RNA fractions. Samples were then reverse transcribed at 50°C for 1 hour with the SuperScript III cDNA synthesis kit (18080085; Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by a PCR amplification programme with Phusion DNA polymerase (F530S; Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

<title>Sequencing data analyses</title>
<p>For all sequencing datasets, automatically generated FastQC reports (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc</ext-link>) were used for the initial assessment of the quality and basic processing of the reads. Sequencing adapters were trimmed from the 5′ and 3′ ends of the reads using cutadapt (v.1.8.1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cutadapt/1.8.1" xlink:type="simple">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cutadapt/1.8.1</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For standard RNA-seq data, adapters were removed and paired-end RNA-seq reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38/g38) using Tophat2 (v.2.0.9; options:–read-mismatch 2 –max-multihits 1 –GTF) guided by ENSEMBL gene models (release 82), while allowing for two mismatches per read and unique alignments only. In order to determine the mRNA abundance, RNA-seq read counts for the full transcript were obtained using featureCounts (v1.5.0-p1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://subread.sourceforge.net/" xlink:type="simple">http://subread.sourceforge.net</ext-link>; options: -O—minOverlap 10 -p -C -M -B -t exon -g gene_id -T 6 -a). The datasets were then normalised, and the statistical significance of differential expression was evaluated by using the R/Bioconductor DESeq2 package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html" xlink:type="simple">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p>To determine RNA methylation levels using RNA BS-seq data, a tailored approach to the one previously published was followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>]. BS-seq reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38/hg38) by using Bismark (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark</ext-link>; v.0.14.4; options: ‘–directional–n 1 –l 100’). To complete the mapping, tRNA gene predictions were obtained from GtRNAdb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb" xlink:type="simple">http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb</ext-link>). Heatmaps displaying either C or T in the aligned reads at each cytosine position were generated using custom PERL scripts and matrix2png (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/matrix2png/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/matrix2png/</ext-link>) for visualisation. Cytosine positions on the heatmaps were reported relative to the annotated transcriptional start sites of the documented beginning of each tRNA.</p>
<p>For small RNA-seq data and to determine the abundance of tRNA fragments, a tailored approach was followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref011">11</xref>] in which first adapter-trimmed paired-end reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38/hg38) using bowtie (v.2.1.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2" xlink:type="simple">http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2</ext-link>; options:—no-mixed—no-discordant—end-to-end), while considering only reads that mapped uniquely to the genome. To annotate the tRNA-seq fragments, tRNA genes were downloaded from GtRNAdb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb" xlink:type="simple">http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb</ext-link>). Counts per tRNA fragments were normalised, and their respective abundances were statistically evaluated using the R/Bioconductor DESeq2 package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html" xlink:type="simple">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html</ext-link>) and represented as log2(DESeq2-normalised counts).</p>
<p>For tRNA fragment analyses, four replicates per condition and genotype were used from the second biological replicate. To identify tRNA-derived sequences, all significant fragments (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) in NSUN2<italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> cells versus NSUN2+/+ cells after 4 hours of sodium arsenite treatment were selected and filtered for fragments smaller than 40 nucleotides.

<title>Global mRNA translation analysis</title>
<p>To investigate global protein synthesis, human dermal fibroblasts untreated and treated with sodium arsenite, recombinant angiogenin, or tRNA fragments were complemented with OP-puro and further labelled as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000297.ref016">16</xref>]. Reconstituted OP-puro (50 μM; 10 mM reconstituted stock [pH 6.4]; Medchem Source) was added to each sample in culture medium precisely 1 hour prior to collection. In each assay, a sample not treated with OP-puro served as a negative control, and as a positive control, samples treated with 50 μg/mL CHX (100 mg/ml in DMSO, C4859; Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes were used. Cells were rinsed with PBS and then collected with Trypsin-EDTA (1:1 in PBS). After pelleting the collected cells and washing them once with PBS, these were resuspended in 0.5 ml PFA (1% w/v in PBS; Santa Cruz) and kept for 15 minutes on ice in the dark. Following fixation, samples were washed in PBS and permeabilised in PBS supplemented with 3% FBS and 0.1% Saponin (47036; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes at room temperature. To conjugate OP-puro to a fluorochrome, an azide-alkyne cycloaddition was performed for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. For this, the Click-iT Cell Reaction Buffer Kit (C10269; Life Technologies) and 5 μM of Alexa Fluor 555-Azide (A20012; Life Technologies) were used. To remove excess reagents and reduce the background signal, the cells were washed twice in PBS supplemented with 3% FBS and 0.1% Saponin. Finally, all samples were resuspended in PBS containing DAPI (1:3,000) and kept at 4°C until further analysis. The fluorescence of each sample was measured at 450/50 405 nm for DAPI and 585/15 561 nm for OP-puro. To analyse the data, fluorescence measurements were visualised by histogram, and the raw fluorescence values were extracted.</p>
<p>To visualise polypeptide synthesis in cultured cells, human dermal fibroblasts were grown directly on autoclaved glass coverslips placed in 12-well culture plates. Cell culture, sodium arsenite treatments, and the incorporation of OP-puro were carried out as described. To fix the cells, the glass coverslips were first briefly rinsed with 1x PBS and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature with PFA (4% PFA in PBS; Santa Cruz). To permeabilise the cells and additionally block unspecific antibody binding, all coverslips were first incubated with 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 minutes and next with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. To conjugate OP-puro to a fluorochrome, an azide-alkyne cycloaddition was performed for 30 minutes at room temperature and in the dark. For this, the Click-iT Cell Reaction Buffer Kit (C10269; Life Technologies) and 5 μM of Alexa Fluor 555-Azide (A20012; Life Technologies) were used. To remove excess reagents and reduce the background signal, the cells were washed once with 3% BSA in PBS. Op-puro-labelled cells were counterstained for their nuclei by using Hoechst (working dilution 0.5 μg/mL) for 10 minutes and mounted on glass slides with a PBS:glycerol solution (1:1). Glass slides were stored in the dark at 4°C until imaging.</p>
