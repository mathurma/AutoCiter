        <p>Nitric oxide reductases (NORs) are membrane proteins that catalyze the reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), which is a critical step of the nitrate respiration process in denitrifying bacteria. Using the recently determined first crystal structure of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic>-dependent NOR (cNOR) [Hino T, Matsumoto Y, Nagano S, Sugimoto H, Fukumori Y, et al. (2010) Structural basis of biological N2O generation by bacterial nitric oxide reductase. Science 330: 1666–70.], we performed extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of cNOR within an explicit membrane/solvent environment to fully characterize water distribution and dynamics as well as hydrogen-bonded networks inside the protein, yielding the atomic details of functionally important proton channels. Simulations reveal two possible proton transfer pathways leading from the periplasm to the active site, while no pathways from the cytoplasmic side were found, consistently with the experimental observations that cNOR is not a proton pump. One of the pathways, which was newly identified in the MD simulation, is blocked in the crystal structure and requires small structural rearrangements to allow for water channel formation. That pathway is equivalent to the functional periplasmic cavity postulated in <italic>cbb</italic><sub>3</sub> oxidase, which illustrates that the two enzymes share some elements of the proton transfer mechanisms and confirms a close evolutionary relation between NORs and C-type oxidases. Several mechanisms of the critical proton transfer steps near the catalytic center are proposed.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Denitrification is an anaerobic process performed by several bacteria as an alternative to aerobic respiration. A key intermediate step is catalyzed by the nitric oxide reductase (NOR) enzyme, which is situated in the cytoplasmic membrane. Proton delivery to the catalytic site inside NOR is an important part of its functioning. In this work we use molecular dynamics simulations to describe water distribution and to identify proton transfer pathways in cNOR. Our results reveal two channels from the periplasmic side of the membrane and none from the cytoplasmic side, indicating that cNOR is not a proton pump. It is our hope that these results will provide a basis for further experimental and computational studies aimed to understand details of the NOR mechanism. Furthermore, this work sheds light on the molecular evolution of respiratory enzymes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Bacterial denitrification is one of the examples of anaerobic respiration in which nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) is stepwisely reduced to dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Wuebbles1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Pereira1">[3]</xref>. During denitrification, the key intermediate step of the reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is catalyzed by a membrane-bound enzyme nitric oxide reductase (NOR) according to the following scheme: 2NO+2e<sup>−</sup>+2H<sup>+</sup>→N<sub>2</sub>O+H<sub>2</sub>O. Bacterial NORs perform fundamental chemistry and are the largest source of N<sub>2</sub>O, a greenhouse gas and an ozone-depleting substance, released into the atmosphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Wuebbles1">[1]</xref>. This enzyme also has an important role in the evolution of the respiratory system. NOR belongs to the superfamily of O<sub>2</sub>-reducing heme-copper oxidases (HCOs) and is believed to be evolutionary linked to a proton pump cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (CcO). Both enzymes may have evolved from a common ancestor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hendriks1">[2]</xref>. The ancestral oxidase was probably involved in NO reduction, but later switched to oxygen reduction and additionally acquired the ability of proton pumping, although this issue is still open to debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Pereira1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Sousa1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>After the structure of CcO was solved more than a decade ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Iwata1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Tsukihara1">[11]</xref>, that system became the focus of numerous experimental studies, which produced a number of X-ray structures from different organisms and a wealth of mutational, biochemical and spectroscopic data, as well as theoretical and simulation ones (for recent reviews, see refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Wikstrm1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Yoshikawa1">[14]</xref>). In contrast, the information about NORs was limited, but the first structure of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>-dependent NOR (cNOR) from <italic>Ps. aeruginosa</italic> has been recently determined by Shiro and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hino1">[15]</xref>, and that provides a basis for studies aimed at describing the mechanism of NO reduction at the atomic level. cNOR consists of two subunits, NorB and NorC, and contains four redox active metal centers, namely hemes <italic>b</italic>, <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>c</italic> and a non-heme iron (Fe<sub>B</sub>). The latter and the iron of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub> form the binuclear (BN) center, a site of the NO reduction. The crystal structure revealed that Fe<sub>B</sub> has three His and one Glu ligands and that a tightly bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is bridging hemes <italic>b</italic> and <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub>. Although the function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not yet fully clear, it is interesting to note that it has the same binding position as in a recently determined structure of the microaerobic respiratory enzyme <italic>cbb</italic><sub>3</sub> oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Buschmann1">[16]</xref>, which is a C-type HCO able to reduce NO to N<sub>2</sub>O in low-oxygen conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Forte1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Lee1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>For the NO reduction reaction protons have to be delivered to the BN center, which is buried inside membrane. Previous experiments with the whole-cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Shapleigh1">[19]</xref> and liposome-reconstituted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hendriks2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Reimann1">[21]</xref> cNORs demonstrated that protons utilized in the catalytic reaction are taken up (on a ms timescale) from the periplasmic side (i.e. the same side as electrons), which suggests that the NO reduction reaction is non-electrogenic and therefore cNOR is not a proton pump. In order to explain the functioning of cNOR, it is necessary to understand the detailed mechanism of the proton delivery to the BN center. Since proton transfer (PT) can occur efficiently only when the donor and acceptor groups are immediately close to each other, the long-distance proton translocations in proteins (e.g. proton pumping across the membrane or proton delivery from the bulk to the buried active site) require specialized proton-conducting pathways, which involve protein ionizable groups and intermediate water molecules as proton-binding sites (see e.g. refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Nagle1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Freier1">[28]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Analysis of the cNOR crystal structure yielded two independent H-bonded networks, designated as Channels 1 and 2, which are formed by the resolved water molecules and the charged/polar residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hino1">[15]</xref>. These channels were proposed as potential PT pathways. However, since X-ray crystallography provides only static snapshots of the protein structure, which are averaged over many unit cells, in general such structures even at high resolution show only a few water molecules (at the most stable positions) inside the protein but miss many dynamic ones. The proposed proton pathways did not provide a continuous connection from the surface to the active site (i.e. protonic “gaps” were present), and in particular the pathways near the catalytic center, where no water molecules were resolved, remained elusive. As we mentioned, in such situations the connectivity is expected to come from the intervening water molecules. Thus, water in cNOR could play a very important role in the enzyme function and has to be fully characterized.</p>
      <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of membrane proteins within an explicit membrane/solvent environment (for some recent works and reviews see refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Freier1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Kutzner1">[35]</xref>) can provide important information about the water dynamics, such as a “real” level of hydration and specific water positions inside the protein, and are most valuable in the cases when the water/PT channels are not yet described at the atomic level. For example, MD simulations have been recently used to explore the water dynamics in different regions in CcO and greatly contributed to the understanding of the details of PT channels in that enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hofacker1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Lee2">[42]</xref>. We note that a study with an explicit membrane/solvent by Olkhova <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Olkhova1">[39]</xref> suggested a large number of water molecules within the PT channels in CcO, in contrast to simulations which utilized different kinds of reduced models or truncated systems.</p>
      <p>In this work we performed MD simulations of cNOR. We focused on the water dynamics, with the aim to identify the water channels and H-bonded networks that could serve as pathways for the proton delivery to the active site. The obtained information will be important for further elucidation of the mechanisms of the proton translocation and NO reduction in cNOR.</p>

      <p>We performed an all-atom MD simulation of cNOR in the explicit lipid/water environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). The details of the system setup and simulation and analysis protocols are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s013">Text S1</xref>. Briefly, the initial system was prepared from a 2.7 Å resolution crystal structure of the cNOR from <italic>Ps. aeruginosa</italic> (PDB ID 3O0R) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hino1">[15]</xref>. A simulation system is shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g001">Figure 1a</xref>: cNOR was embedded into the pre-equilibrated POPE (palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine) lipid bilayer membrane and a solvent box of water molecules. The total size of the simulation system was ∼110,000 atoms. The main purpose of introducing the lipid bilayer in MD simulation is to model cNOR <italic>in situ</italic>, i.e. in the environment as close to its natural as possible. POPE is the major lipid component of bacterial membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Dowhan1">[43]</xref>. Explicit membrane provides additional stability to the protein in MD simulations and allows a correct description of the protein-solvent and protein-lipids interactions.</p>

After minimization and equilibration parts, production runs were performed at a constant temperature, pressure, and surface area (NPAT ensemble) for 300 ns, providing reasonable conformational sampling of the protein. Stability of the simulated protein-membrane complex was assessed from the analysis of several parameters along the MD trajectory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the helical C<sub>α</sub> atoms is below 2 Å while RMSD of C<sub>α</sub> atoms in a transmembrane (TM) region is ∼1.2 Å. The RMS fluctuations (RMSFs) calculated for each residue also illustrate that the TM region is very stable while the outer and inner domains exhibit, as expected, larger motions. Finally, the area/lipid, which was calculated using the Voronoi analysis tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Mori1">[47]</xref>, remains close to the experimental value for the POPE lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Rand1">[48]</xref>, also indicating a stable simulation of the protein-membrane complex.</p>

Four residues, namely Glu135, Asp198, Lys53<sub>c</sub>, and Glu57<sub>c</sub>, were designated as Channel 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hino1">[15]</xref>. [Subscript “c” indicates residues of the NorC subunit, while residues of the NorB subunit are numbered without additional subscripts.] In MD simulations we observed that Channel 1 indeed connects the protein surface to propionates of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub> (the distance ∼16 Å) via a number of ionizable residues and water molecules and supports formation of the H-bonded networks (see below). Our analysis provides important additional details about Channel 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). MD results indicate that the following three residues participate in the HB networks in that region: Arg134, Lys199, and Glu70<sub>c</sub>, and therefore they have to be included in Channel 1. All seven ionizable residues are highly conserved in cNORs. Together, they line up a large hydrophilic channel, and their sidechains assist in the formation of the H-bonded water chains.</p>

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative MD snapshot (at ∼100 ns) of the Channel 1 region. The pathway starts near Lys53<sub>c</sub>, Glu57<sub>c</sub> and Asp198 (the entrance from the bulk is indicated by a blue line) and leads to a water cluster near the heme <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub> propionates via a number of conserved charged residues and water molecules (see details in the text). Hemes <italic>b</italic> (dark-red) and <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub> (pink) and the charged residues lining the channel (colored by atom types, with carbons in yellow) are shown as sticks, Fe<sub>B</sub> (orange) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (green) ions as spheres, and water molecules present in or near the channel are shown in ball-and-stick representation (red/white). Important helices are labeled (green). The dashed lines indicate the hydrogen bonds within the forming continuous H-bonded networks, which connect the periplasmic surface with the propionates of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub>. In the MD simulation the Channel 1 interior region is very well hydrated, as illustrated by the water density averaged over 300 ns (a transparent light-blue isosurface shown at 25% occupancy). Figure reveals two branches of the water channel at both sides of Glu70<sub>c</sub>. (<bold>B</bold>) Water density in Channel 1 shown as a 2D contour map (a projection on the XY-plane was obtained by summing the water density in the Channel 1 region over the vertical Z-axis). Different colors correspond to water residence values, ranging from red (high water residence) to blue (low water residence). Positions of the Channel 1 residues and crystallographic waters in the cNOR X-ray structure are shown for reference as white sticks and purple spheres, respectively. Two branches of the potential proton pathway (indicated by the dashed black lines) go through high-occupancy water sites, which in general superimpose well with the positions of crystallographic waters.

        <p>Channel 1 has a connection to the bulk solvent between two helices, TM VI of NorB (with Asp198 and Lys199) and α2 of NorC (with Lys53<sub>c</sub> and Glu57<sub>c</sub>). The entrance site formed by the amino acids Glu57<sub>c</sub>, Lys53<sub>c</sub>, and Arg134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g002">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s002">S2</xref>) remains rigid due to three stable salt bridges: Glu57<sub>c</sub>-Lys53<sub>c</sub>, Arg134-Asp198, and Lys53<sub>c</sub>-Asp198 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s002">Figure S3</xref>). These residues partially block water influx. However, water molecules still occasionally cross through that site, and thus can serve as intermediate proton sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Also, the dynamic HB networks involving sidechains of Glu57<sub>c</sub> and Asp198 and waters at both sides of the entrance, i.e. in the bulk and inside the Channel 1 cavity, are observed at any time of MD trajectory. Therefore it is possible that one of these residues could be directly involved in PT by picking up protons from the bulk and releasing them to the water chain inside Channel 1. The mutagenesis experiments with <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> cNOR [Pia Ädelroth, unpublished data] showed the importance of Asp185 (equivalent to Asp198 in <italic>Ps. aeuginosa</italic> cNOR) for the enzymatic activity and proton uptake, and provide partial support to this proposal.</p>
        <p>From the entrance region the proton pathway proceeds further through the dynamic water chains. Water channels in cNOR have “irregular” shape and lack simple symmetry (like, e.g. straight TM channels in aquaporins or ion channels). Therefore to perform meaningful statistical analysis in each region we selected water molecules within a reasonable distance cutoff (typically 4.5 Å) near the sidechains of the pathway's residues. We verified that with such definition water molecules “inside the pathway” were not skipped. Our calculations show that Channel 1 is very well hydrated: in MD simulation ∼20 water molecules are observed in this hydrophilic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g002">Figure 2c</xref>), which is higher than ∼12 molecules resolved in the X-ray structure. This result can be explained by the presence of mobile water molecules, which were not resolved in X-ray crystallography.</p>
        <p>To provide some quantitative representation, we have calculated volume occupied by water molecules during simulation (“water density”, see e.g. refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Kandt1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Wolf1">[50]</xref>) in different regions of cNOR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates water spatial distribution in Channel 1 as obtained from MD simulation, showing both a 3D water volume map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, isosurface at 25% occupancy) and a 2D contour plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, an XY-plane projection of the water density; see figure caption for details). A few observations can be made from these figures. (i) Water density representation shows the extent of the hydrophilic regions and confirms a stable connection from the bulk to the active site heme. (ii) Water molecules form an extensive water cluster between propionates of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub> (PropA and PropD). [Please note that compared to the previously reported cytochrome c oxidase structures the active site heme in cNOR, i.e. heme <italic>b3</italic>, is flipped and the order of the propionate groups A and D is different.] (iii) After the entrance region, the channel goes into a water-filled cavity. An important finding is that further the pathway splits into two branches: one path leads via a water chain (5–6 water molecules) directly to PropA, while another – via Glu70<sub>c</sub> and a short chain (2–3 water molecules) at the other side of that residue – to PropD. The terminal region of both paths is the water cluster near heme <italic>b<sub>3</sub></italic> propionates. The existence of two branches in Channel 1 could be observed in the MD simulation, but was not evident from the static X-ray structure. This feature provides a possibility of PT over different pathways and probably adds to the robustness of the proton uptake via Channel 1. (iv) When water density is plotted at a higher occupancy level, one obtains positions of the water sites that are occupied almost permanently during the simulation. One example is a crystallographic water molecule, Wat65, which remains bound near Ca<sup>2+</sup> for the entire MD trajectory. Such “permanent” water sites in general superimpose well with the positions of waters resolved in the X-ray structure (indicated by purple spheres on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g002">Figure 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g002">Figure 2a</xref> also presents a typical configuration of the H-bonded networks forming in Channel 1, while Video S1 and multiple MD snapshots on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s005">Figure S5</xref> illustrate their time-dependent dynamics. The average lifetime of a hydrogen bond (HB) in the water chains is in the ps range due to rotating and/or moving water molecules. It can be seen that water molecules in Channel 1 have high mobility and exchange rates and, as a result, the forming H-bonded networks are constantly “fluctuating” (similar to the H-bonded networks in CcO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Olkhova1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Cukier1">[40]</xref>). Continuous HB paths between the bulk and heme <italic>b<sub>3</sub></italic> propionates do form, and their consistency is limited by the intervening water chains, namely a chain from Asp198 to Glu135 (probability ∼25–35%) and a chain from Asp198 to Glu70<sub>c</sub> (probability &gt;60%). But it is important that such connections are forming at all times, and thus can assist efficient proton translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Kaila1">[51]</xref>. Participation of the Channel 1 residues in the H-bonded networks can be assessed quantitatively by calculating the number of surrounding water molecules and formed HBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s012">Table S1</xref>). In particular, these results, in addition to visual analysis, suggest that Glu70<sub>c</sub> could play an important role in the proton uptake process. It is desirable to verify its involvement in the PT pathway by site-directed mutagenesis experiments.</p>

        <title>Periplasmic Channel 2</title>
        <p>From the inspection of the X-ray structure, Hino <italic>et al.</italic> identified another cavity, which contains many crystallographic waters, and proposed it as a second possible proton-conducting pathway (Channel 2 in Figure 3 in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hino1">[15]</xref>). In MD simulation we observed a large hydrophilic region formed by the residues Arg416, Thr66<sub>c</sub>, Glu77<sub>c</sub>, Gln411, and Gln415, with an exit to the bulk beyond the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). On average, there are 10 to 12 water molecules in the cavity. However, we found that water molecules from this cavity cannot pass to the water cluster near heme <italic>b<sub>3</sub></italic>, and further to the active site. Two loops, and more specifically two glycine residues Gly340 and Gly69<sub>c</sub>, are in close contact en route to heme <italic>b<sub>3</sub></italic> and, together with a ring of Tyr73<sub>c</sub>, disrupt a possible water chain. A close steric contact between two loops remains for the entire length of the MD trajectory, as evidenced by the Gly-Gly distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g003">Figure 3c</xref>), which stays around 3.5–4 Å (i.e. similar to the distance in the crystal structure). Water densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g003">Figures 3a and b</xref>) clearly show a wide gap with no substantial density between the upper hydrophilic cavity and the water cluster. We do not completely rule out a possibility that mobile water molecules can occasionally cross the gap region; however, no such crossings or continuous HB networks were observed in 300 ns. Moreover, the proton translocation through the region with no polar/charged residues or water molecules would encounter high activation barriers. Thus, our results do not support the previously proposed Channel 2 as an alternative pathway for proton delivery to the active site. The exact functional role of this hydrophilic cavity in cNOR is not clear.</p>

        <title>Periplasmic Channel 3</title>
        <p>A careful analysis of MD trajectories revealed another plausible proton pathway, which we designated as the (periplasmic) Channel 3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g004">4</xref>). This pathway involves the residues Glu135, Glu138, Arg57, Asn54, and Asn60<sub>c</sub>. The first three are highly conserved in all NORs and oxidases, while Asn54 is conserved in cNORs. In the X-ray structure, three water molecules are resolved in a cavity formed by these residues. During the initial part of the MD simulation this region has no connection to the periplasmic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g004">Figures 4a, b</xref>). The calculated water density clearly shows that the cavity is completely separated from the bulk solvent and that two asparagine residues, Asn54 and Asn60<sub>c</sub>, effectively work as a gate, blocking water access from the outside.</p>

The dynamic H-bonded water chains connect the bulk to the two important residues, Glu138 and Glu135, and can facilitate PT toward the active site.

        </fig>
        <p>However, after ∼165 ns in the MD simulation the Asn54-Asn60<sub>c</sub> gate opens and a new water channel is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g004">Figures 4c, d</xref>). A continuous water density then extends up to two important residues, Glu135 and Glu138, and the H-bonded networks involving mobile water molecules and amino acid sidechains readily form. The number of waters in the hydrophilic region, and in particular around the sidechain of Glu138, significantly increases with the gate opening and remains high even after the gate closes back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g005">Figure 5c</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g005">Figure 5</xref> also shows minimal distances between the Asn54-Asn60<sub>c</sub> and Glu138-Asn60<sub>c</sub> pairs in the MD simulation, along with the representative snapshots of the gate region. Clearly, the gate is closed when two Asn are H-bonded. Sidechains of Glu138 and Asn60<sub>c</sub> exhibit large-amplitude rotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s006">Figure S6</xref>), in particular Glu138 can take several conformations, and the initial event leading to the gate opening seems to be a rotation of Glu138 to the “up” position after ∼135 ns and the formation of a HB to Asn60<sub>c</sub>. Soon after that a strong HB between two Asn is broken. As a result, a helix TM II (with Asn54 on a top) slightly tilts away, and that opens water access to the internal cavity.</p>

        <p>An overlay of the open and closed configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g005">Figure 5f</xref>) shows that the required structural changes are rather small: two Asn move away only by a few Å, but that is enough to break a HB between them and to open access to the internal cavity for water molecules from the outside. The gate is open for ∼60 ns, after which the HB between Asn60<sub>c</sub> and Asn54 is re-formed; the HB between Glu138 and Asn60<sub>c</sub> breaks prior to that. The explicit gate opening/closing process and formation of the dynamic water chains in Channel 3 are illustrated by Video S2. We would like to emphasize that similar events were also observed in the extended simulation as well as in independent runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s007">Figure S7</xref>), indicating that such events can occur in cNOR on a 100-ns timescale, which is much shorter than the experimentally measured rate of the proton uptake (∼25 ms) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hendriks2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Reimann1">[21]</xref>. This suggests that such structural reorganizations due to protein fluctuations are feasible during catalysis in cNOR and that Channel 3, in principle, can provide a pathway for a water-mediated proton uptake. We propose to examine the role of Asn54 and Asn60<sub>c</sub> in the Channel 3 gating by the mutagenesis experiments.</p>
        <p>A newly found channel is consistent with previous experimental data. Two key residues, Glu135 and Glu138 (Glu122 and Glu125 in <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> cNOR), were shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be essential for the enzymatic activity and were proposed to be a part of the proton input pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Butland1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Flock1">[54]</xref>, though their exact positions predicted with the homology-based model (namely, on a protein outer surface) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Reimann1">[21]</xref> turned out to be incorrect. With the cNOR structure available now, it is known that Glu135 is a ligand to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. That explains why its substitution with Asp still showed a level of activity close to the wild type (i.e. Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination was kept) while a substitution with Ala or Gln resulted in a loss of activity (most likely caused by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dissociation). The structural function of Glu135 also makes its direct participation in PT problematic: it is unlikely that Glu135 can get protonated or that the protons coming from the periplasm can be transferred through a densely packed region occupied by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion and its ligands.</p>
        <p>The substitution of Glu138 with Ala and Asp resulted in a loss of activity, while a mutation to Gln showed some, though significantly reduced activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Thorndycroft1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Flock1">[54]</xref>. These results could indicate that the length of the sidechain is more important than retaining a negative carboxylic group at that position. The observation fits into the above suggested mechanism of the Channel 3 opening and “activation” of the proton pathway, which includes a Glu138 sidechain rotation to the “up” position to form a HB to Asn60<sub>c</sub>, thus helping to break a HB between two Asn.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Glu135, Glu138 can actively participate in the PT process. A Glu122Asp mutation in <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> caused a significant pK<sub>a</sub> shift of a presumed nearby proton donor group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Flock1">[54]</xref>, and Glu138 seems to be the best candidate for that role. The proton pathway beyond Glu138 is also offered by our MD results. After the gate opening, Glu138 is well hydrated, with typically 5 to 8 water molecules near its sidechain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g004">Figures 4c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g005">5c</xref>). We observed the H-bonded water chains leading from this site toward the water molecules bound near BN, thus avoiding the Ca<sup>2+</sup> site (see the corresponding discussion below).</p>
        <p>A key finding is that the suggested novel channel in cNOR is equivalent to the putative PT pathway (the “periplasmic cavity”) in a recently determined structure of <italic>cbb<sub>3</sub></italic> oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Buschmann1">[16]</xref>: a comparison of two regions shows that their positions are identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, the important residues which form this hydrophilic cavity, namely Glu135, Glu138 and Arg57 in cNOR and Glu122, Glu125, Arg57 in <italic>cbb</italic><sub>3</sub>, are conserved. The periplasmic cavity in <italic>cbb</italic><sub>3</sub> oxidase was suggested to be an exit pathway of the pumped protons <italic>or</italic> a pathway for proton uptake from periplasm when the enzyme is involved in NO reduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Buschmann1">[16]</xref>. The fact that for NO reduction <italic>cbb<sub>3</sub></italic> uses protons from the periplasmic side of the membrane has been recently confirmed by the experimental work of Lee <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Lee1">[18]</xref>. We note that such cavity is not found in other structurally known HCOs and that <italic>aa</italic><sub>3</sub> oxidases (A-type HCOs) are incapable of NO reduction, while <italic>ba</italic><sub>3</sub> oxidases (B-type HCOs) can reduce NO but much slower than <italic>cbb</italic><sub>3</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Pereira1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hemp1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Sousa1">[9]</xref>. The presence of a plausible PT pathway in the equivalent region in <italic>cbb</italic><sub>3</sub> oxidase is an additional argument for the functional importance of Channel 3 in cNOR. The finding that two enzymes likely have common elements of the PT mechanism, along with other common structural factors, such as the identical position of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, fits nicely into the phylogenetic pictures that draw C-type HCOs as the closest evolutionary relatives of NORs.</p>

        <title>PT pathways near the active site</title>
        <p>We have shown that Channel 1 and Channel 3 can connect the periplasmic surface to the region near heme <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub>. Its propionates together with a nearby water cluster and Glu138 are the likely intermediate proton acceptor groups. (It is less likely that PropA can get protonated since it serves as a ligand to Ca<sup>2+</sup>.) It is worth mentioning that in CcO one of the active site heme propionates is thought to be the likely proton loading site for the pumped protons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Sugitani2">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Kaila2">[57]</xref>. The idea about the functional importance of protonated water clusters inside proteins is also not new. For example, in CcO a protonated water cluster was suggested as a proton storage site in the D-channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Xu1">[58]</xref>, while in bacteriorhodopsin a protonated water cluster is a presumed proton release group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Garczarek1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Mathias1">[60]</xref>.</p>
        <p>An important question is how protons are delivered to the catalytic center when they are needed for the NO reduction, i.e. what are the structural elements critical for the final PT steps? The distance (&gt;8 Å) is still long for direct PT, but no water molecules were resolved in the vicinity of the BN center. So the further proton path was not clear from the X-ray structure, and intermediate water molecules are expected to play important role. In a working enzyme, water will be produced at the active site as a byproduct of the catalytic NO reduction. In contrast to the crystal structure, the MD simulation reveals the presence of water molecules near the BN center (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s008">Figure S8</xref>) and describes their distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The exchange rate of waters is much lower compared to the channels discussed above. Water molecules are found persistently at several positions and keep these positions for 20–50 ns or longer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s009">Figure S9</xref>); such water molecules might serve as intermediate proton sites. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g007">Figure 7</xref> depicts a representative configuration of water molecules in that region, along with the calculated water density (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s010">Figure S10</xref>). It can be seen that one permanent water site is located between two irons of the BN center (i.e. where NO ligands will bind during the enzymatic cycle), another corresponds to the water molecule bound between Fe<sub>B</sub> and Glu280, and two more water sites are located between Fe<sub>B</sub> and PropA. It is interesting that in a recent high-resolution structure of <italic>Th. thermophilus ba</italic><sub>3</sub> oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Tiefenbrunn1">[61]</xref> two water molecules were resolved at the identical positions.</p>

Thr330 and Ser277 are not protonatable residues and thus water molecules which could serve as proton sites are needed for PT along this path. Although water molecules are always present near PropD and there are no obstacles on the way to Thr330, they do not penetrate along this path, indicating that the cavity is very hydrophobic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002674.s009">S9</xref>).

        <title>No water channels from cytoplasm</title>
        <p>High-resolution crystal structures of CcO and subsequent mutational studies identified a number of critical residues in the proton pathways from the cytoplasm to the active site (K and D channels). However, in cNOR most of these residues are replaced by hydrophobic residues. The crystal structure of cNOR neither provides an obvious water channel from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane nor a H-bonded network in the regions that correspond to the K and D proton channels in CcO (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g004">Figure 4</xref> in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Hino1">[15]</xref>). Similarly, our MD simulation shows no water in those regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002674-g008">Figure 8</xref>), with the exception of a hydrophilic cavity below the active site with three glutamates, Glu211, Glu280, and Glu215. Thus, in cNOR there is no proton pathway from the cytoplasmic side. This is consistent with the experimental observations that cNOR is not electrogenic and has no proton-pumping activity, and that the electrons and protons for the catalytic reaction are supplied from the periplasmic side. The position of the above-mentioned small hydrophilic region overlaps with the terminal part of the K-pathway in cytochrome oxidases. That could indicate a beginning of the K-channel formation in the evolutionary steps leading to the appearance of proton pathways from the cytoplasm and eventually to the proton pumping in other HCOs. A very recent structural characterization of a single-subunit quinol-dependent NOR (qNOR) from <italic>G. stearothermophilus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Matsumoto1">[64]</xref> surprisingly revealed the existence of the water channel from the cytoplasmic side at the position equivalent to the canonical K-pathway and absence of the periplasmic pathways found in cNOR. It will be interesting to test by calculations if a similar cytoplasmic channel can be formed in cNOR as the result of selective mutations.</p>

        <title>Concluding remarks</title>
        <p>We have performed a 300 ns MD simulation of cNOR, based on its first crystal structure, and fully characterized water inside the protein. Our simulations have revealed two potential PT pathways from the periplasmic side, Channels 1 and 3. Both pathways are supported by the continuous distribution of water molecules and formation of the dynamic H-bonded networks within the channels, as well as by the highly conserved nature of the participating residues and previous experiments, which had shown functional importance of some of these residues. Since cNOR is not involved in a vectorial proton translocation (pumping against the gradient), a robust gating mechanism, as those suggested in CcO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Pisliakov1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Kaila2">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Quenneville1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Faxen1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Kim1">[66]</xref>, is not required, and chemical protons have to arrive at the active site in one way or another. So, in principle, both pathways may be used. From our MD results we cannot unambiguously establish what the exact role of each channel is or how they are synchronized. In our opinion, Channel 1 is probably the main pathway for the proton uptake since both static and dynamic structures clearly show extensive H-bonded networks and water chains, and the path toward the catalytic site seems to be more straightforward. Meanwhile, Channel 3 is revealed only by the dynamic simulations (and the water channel is formed only for a part of the simulation), some protein structural rearrangements are required there to allow for channel formation, and the path from Glu138 to the active site goes through an intermediate hydrophobic region.</p>
        <p>A further discussion about the details of the proton uptake mechanism in cNOR should be based on additional experimental evidences and explicit PT calculations. We would like to emphasize that MD simulations provide important information about the dynamics of water molecules and H-bonded networks and, as a result, about <italic>locations of potential proton pathways</italic>. However, classical MD simulations alone cannot describe explicit proton translocation, which is an intrinsically quantum mechanical process. The <italic>energetics of PT</italic> along different pathways has to be addressed by mixed QM/MM methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Swanson1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Pisliakov1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Kato1">[67]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Goyal1">[69]</xref>, and this will tell whether each pathway is feasible. The key issues in such calculations are the energies of charge formation at different sites along the translocation path and activation barriers of individual PT steps.</p>
        <p>In our calculations we observed a fairly high number of mobile water molecules (which could not be resolved in the X-ray structure) in the cNOR hydrophilic cavities. Similar results were previously reported in analogous MD studies (with explicit membrane/solvent, at ambient temperatures) of systems like proton pumps cytochrome c oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Olkhova1">[39]</xref>, bacteriorhodopsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Freier1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Grudinin1">[70]</xref>, bc1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Izrailev1">[71]</xref>, voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Ramsey1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Wood1">[72]</xref> and calcium pump <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Sugita1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002674-Musgaard1">[74]</xref>, whose function relies on the water-assisted proton translocation. Therefore such simulations, although they are computationally expensive, can be used for the detailed characterization of water inside membrane proteins and for the identification of potential proton pathways, which in many cases are critical for protein function.</p>
        <p>Finally, several common structural features, namely the position of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site and similarity of Channel 3 in cNOR and the periplasmic cavity in <italic>cbb</italic><sub>3</sub> oxidase, indicate the evolutionary relationship between the two enzymes. The likely loss of Channel 1 in <italic>cbb</italic><sub>3</sub> oxidase might be the key step during the molecular evolution leading to the establishment of the PT pathway from the cytoplasm, while a less effective Channel 3 was probably kept as a proton exit pathway for proton pumping. Our results have implications on the development of PT pathways in HCOs and the evolution of respiratory enzymes in general – a topic which remains a subject of intense debate.</p>
