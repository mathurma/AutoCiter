This presents a problem when trying to combine gene expression and regulatory interactions to model transcriptional regulatory networks. Using the available regulatory interactions to predict new interactions may lead to better coverage and more accurate models. Here, we develop SEREND (SEmi-supervised REgulatory Network Discoverer), a semi-supervised learning method that uses a curated database of verified transcriptional factor–gene interactions, DNA sequence binding motifs, and a compendium of gene expression data in order to make thousands of new predictions about transcription factor–gene interactions, including whether the transcription factor activates or represses the gene. Using genome-wide binding datasets for several transcription factors, we demonstrate that our semi-supervised classification strategy improves the prediction of targets for a given transcription factor. To further demonstrate the utility of our inferred interactions, we generated a new microarray gene expression dataset for the aerobic to anaerobic shift response in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We used our inferred interactions with the verified interactions to reconstruct a dynamic regulatory network for this response. The network reconstructed when using our inferred interactions was better able to correctly identify known regulators and suggested additional activators and repressors as having important roles during the aerobic–anaerobic shift interface.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The proper functioning of transcriptional gene regulation is essential for all living organisms. Several diseases are associated with loss of appropriate transcriptional regulation. Even in relatively simple organisms, such as the bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic>, response to environmental stress is a complex and highly regulated process. This process is controlled by a set of transcription factors that causes an increase or decrease in the expression levels of their target's gene. However, identifying the set of targets regulated by each of these factors remains a challenge. Even after decades of experimental research on <italic>E. coli,</italic> only a quarter of all gene products have a known regulator. Here, we develop a method that extends the known set of regulator–target relationships with additional predictions. Our method utilizes the DNA sequence control code and expression levels of known targets in a variety of conditions, as well as genes for which it is not known if they are targets of a specific regulator. We show that our method more accurately identifies true targets of known regulators than previous methods suggested for this task. We then applied our predictions to identify active regulators involved in the dynamic response that occurs in <italic>E. coli</italic> when it is deprived of oxygen.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received funding from NIH grant NO1 AI-5001, NSF CAREER award 0448453 to ZB-J, NIH U01 grant to ZNO (A1070499-11), and a Siebel Scholar Fellowship to JE.

Researchers have electronically encoded in databases (such as EcoCyc and RegulonDB) thousands of activation and repression relationships among transcription factors (TFs) and genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Keseler1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Salgado2">[3]</xref>. However, while <italic>E. coli</italic> has one of the most comprehensive datasets of experimentally verified transcriptional regulatory interactions of any organism, it is still far from complete. For instance, the experimentally verified and curated TF-gene interactions provides regulatory relationships for only approximately 1000 genes, which is well below the more than 4000 genes predicted to be present in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This relatively low coverage of the experimentally verified and curated interaction network presents a challenge when attempting to reconstruct the active regulatory network for a condition of interest based on microarray gene expression data. When analyzing microarray experiments, researchers often need information about the set of genes predicted or known to be regulated by various TFs. This information can then be used to determine the influence of the TFs in the condition of interest by indirectly observing the activity of the regulated genes, even for cases in which the TF is post-transcriptionally regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Ernst1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Kao1">[6]</xref>.</p><p>A traditional computational approach to identify additional gene targets of a TF, which has been applied to <italic>E. coli</italic>, is to characterize the DNA sequence binding preferences of a TF based on an alignment of known binding sites of the TF, and then use this alignment to scan the promoter region of genes for sites matching the preferences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Robison1">[7]</xref>. In some cases researchers have used conservation as an additional filter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Gua1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-VanNimwegen1">[10]</xref> or extended the alignment based approach using a biophysical based model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Roider1">[11]</xref>. While it has been shown that for some TFs in <italic>E. coli</italic> the presence of a motif can be highly predictive of true binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Wade1">[12]</xref>, for other TFs the motif pattern is more degenerate leading to reduced accuracy. An additional limitation in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where genes are organized into transcriptional units and many TFs function as both activators and repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Salgado1">[2]</xref>, is that motif scanning only determines the binding site location, which is not sufficient to determine if a specific binding site is being used to activate or repress a specific gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Babu1">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Another approach researchers have taken to predicting TF-gene interactions utilizes just mRNA expression data by evaluating whether the expression level of the TF and the target gene are consistent with a regulatory relationship. Faith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Faith1">[14]</xref> surveyed and evaluated a number of these methods using a compendium of <italic>E</italic>. coli gene expression data. They also introduced a new method for this task: The context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) which extends Relevance Networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Butte1">[15]</xref>. CLR was found to be the top performing method by Faith et al. at recovering known interactions. Other methods considered by Faith et al. include ARACNe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Margolin1">[16]</xref>, Bayesian Networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Friedman1">[17]</xref> and linear regression networks. The Relevance Network approach directly ranks TF-gene interactions based on a statistical measure such as the correlation coefficient or mutual information of the expression profile pairs. CLR extends Relevance Networks by considering the distribution of values obtained by the statistical measure for all pairs involving the same TF or regulated gene. The authors found in their evaluation that for CLR and Relevance Networks the best results were obtained using mutual information and the square of the correlation coefficient, respectively. As these methods predict network interactions exclusively from expression data this provides the advantage of being broadly applicable to organisms for which prior knowledge on gene regulation is limited. However in the case of <italic>E. coli</italic> these methods are unable to take advantage of known interactions or DNA sequence binding information to improve the accuracy of the predicted interactions. In particular these methods can only identify interactions for factors that are transcriptionally regulated, which may lead to missing many interactions for post-transcriptionally regulated factors.</p><p>In this paper we introduce a new method, SEREND (SEmi-supervised REgulatory Network Discoverer), to predict TF-gene regulatory interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000044-g001">Figure 1</xref>). SEREND is an iterative semi-supervised computational prediction method that takes advantage of known regulatory interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic> and extends them by leveraging TF sequence binding affinities and a compendium of expression data. Similar to other methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Ernst1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Kao1">[6]</xref> SEREND does not assume that a TF is necessarily transcriptionally regulated. Instead SEREND uses expression data in the context of known or predicted TF-gene interactions. However, these previous methods assume a fixed set of TF-gene interactions, while the purpose of SEREND is to predict additional TF-gene interactions. These predictions can later be used as input to these other methods, as we demonstrate for one method on a new expression dataset. Other methods performed iterative analysis as SEREND does here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Bergmann1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Ihmels1">[19]</xref>. However, unlike SEREND, which focuses on classification, the goal of these prior methods was clustering or gene set module identification leading to different treatment for the features used and different meanings for the resulting sets. Another method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Sun1">[20]</xref> used curated interactions and expression data along with Gene Ontology (GO) and phylogenic similarity to predict additional gene targets, but did not use an iterative or semi-supervised approach or motif information as we do here. We chose for our method not to use GO annotations in generating predictions giving us the advantage of being able to use GO for an unbiased assessment of the functional role of predicted targets.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000044-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000044.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Method overview.</title><p>SEREND takes as input a compendium of expression data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Faith1">[14]</xref>, a curated set of <italic>E. coli</italic> TF–gene interactions with direct evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Keseler1">[1]</xref>, and scores for TF–gene motif association based on the PWMs present in RegulonDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Salgado1">[2]</xref>. SEREND uses a logistic regression ensemble-based classification method where all non-confirmed targets were initially treated as unregulated by the TF. SEREND then relaxed this assumption using a self-training method. We evaluated the ranked predictions of SEREND using published ChIP-chip data, and by combining SEREND's predictions with a new set of time series gene expression data on aerobic-anaerobic shift response in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000044.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>In evaluating SEREND, we first establish that SEREND can successfully recover many direct gene targets implicated in chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP)-chip experiments and compare its ability to do so with other methods. To further test the predictive capability of SEREND and to assess the functional relevance of the newly-predicted TF-gene interactions, we combine them with new temporal microarray gene expression data obtained during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic growth conditions in <italic>E. coli</italic>. For this we use a recently introduced computational method, Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Ernst1">[4]</xref>, that allows us to analyze and model the dynamics of the transcriptional regulatory network in response to this environmental change. As we show, the reconstructed network response agrees well with known responses during the <italic>E. coli</italic> aerobic-anaerobic switch. Moreover, by using the new TF-gene interactions predicted by SEREND, DREM is also able to suggest additional TFs as controlling different stages of the aerobic-anaerobic switch response in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ranking New Predictions for a TF</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000044-g001">Figure 1</xref> outlines our strategy to generate ranked predictions of additional targets of a TF, including the direction of the interaction (activator or as a repressor). We first extracted from EcoCyc 11.5 all genomic targets of TFs among the 4205 genes that we considered that have been validated by direct experimental evidence (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We also extracted the directions of these interactions. This gave us 1760 interactions corresponding to 123 TFs and 974 genes. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000044.s003">Table S1</xref> for the distribution of the number of confirmed targets across TFs. We also obtained the expression value of all the genes across a diverse set of 445 experimental conditions based on a previously assembled compendium including genetic knockout experiments, overexpression experiments, and environmental stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Faith1">[14]</xref>. Finally for 71 of the 123 TFs we obtained a sequence binding affinity matrix from RegulonDB. We used these matrices to determine a score for the maximum agreement of the TF with a potential binding site at the promoter region of each gene (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref>). For the remaining 52 TFs the motif score was set to a constant 0, but otherwise the method remains the same.</p><p>We next used these features to obtain a ranked prediction of new interactions for each TF. Our method, SEREND, would first train two logistic regression classifiers for each TF. The first classifier uses the expression compendium to predict whether a gene is activated by, is repressed by, or is not a target of the TF. A challenge in training such a classifier is that there is no available list of genes which are confirmed not to be targets of the TF (negative information). SEREND initially sets the label for all genes without confirmed evidence in EcoCyc to not being regulated by the TF, though later the method will revisit these assignments. The second classifier uses motif information, specifically the score of the best binding site of the TF for each gene. The motif classifier labels are binary, denoting whether a gene is a target of the TF or not. Initially these labels also correspond to whether or not there is direct evidence in EcoCyc supporting the interaction. These two classifiers are then combined using a third “meta” logistic regression classifier. The reason we had SEREND keep the two sets of features separate initially is because of the large number of expression features, as opposed to the single motif feature. A classifier that directly uses both motif and expression data would likely be vastly emphasizing the expression data, whereas by combining the two classifiers SEREND can learn accurate weights independent of the available features. This approach is similar to ensemble methods such as stacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Wolpert1">[21]</xref> and mixture of experts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Jacobs1">[22]</xref>.</p><p>As we noted above, to generate a negative set SEREND used all genes without a direct evidence annotation in EcoCyc. While a vast majority of the genes in this set are indeed not regulated by the TF, some are real targets that have not been discovered to date. We thus had SEREND modify the labels for some of these genes using a type of semi-supervised classification method called self-training <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Zhu1">[23]</xref>. Semi-supervised methods of classification use unlabeled data in conjunction with labeled data to improve classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000044-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The self-training method of SEREND would change the label of genes from not being regulated by a TF to being regulated by the TF if the probability with which the meta-classifier classifies the gene for being regulated by the TF was sufficiently higher than expected (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The method then combined these new target predictions with the targets from the previous iteration and used them in a new iteration to re-train a classifier and repeated the process until convergence (no labels changed during an iteration).</p><fig id="pcbi-1000044-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000044.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Motivating the self-training method.</title><p>We abstractly represent the space of expression feature values in two dimensions (though in reality they form a high-dimensional space).

Unlike the other TFs, for Fis higher motif scores were not associated with higher likelihood of binding.

Additionally, we tested if the activator and repressor predictions are accurate for TFs that function in both roles.

Since these expression values were not used to generate our predictions they provide an unbiased test set for our predictions. We compared the average expression of the two sets of targets (curated and new predictions) for each TF activity mode (i.e., a factor and its influence as an activator or a repressor).

The map indicates that by 2 min those genes that were eventually upregulated (gray-colored genes), already had a different distribution than those which were downregulated (orange-colored genes). Among GO categories, the upregulated genes were most enriched for carbohydrate transport (p-val &lt;10<sup>−8</sup>), while the downregulated genes were most enriched for biosynthetic process genes (p-val &lt;10<sup>−30</sup>) including translation genes (p-val &lt;10<sup>−24</sup>). The map also indicates that between 5 min and 25 min there was a large change in expression distribution among the genes most activated and repressed in this condition. The last split event in the map occurs 25 min after the response, and the paths remain mostly unchanged thereafter, indicating that by 35 min at the transcriptional level <italic>E. coli</italic> has adapted to the anaerobic conditions. This also suggests that the transitional events that have occurred between 0–35 min after switching to an anaerobic state are events associated with the microaerobic response.

However, this information is not complete. Many of the genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> do not have any validated regulators and it is likely that many interactions are unknown even for those genes with one or more validated regulators. To make optimal use of the curated information, methods should leverage this information as much as possible when making additional predictions of TF-gene regulatory interactions. Such predictions would then be useful when combined with other high throughput data measuring responses of all <italic>E. coli</italic> genes in a condition of interest.</p><p>Here we presented a new semi-supervised learning-based method, SEREND, which uses curated data, sequence motif information, and a compendium of expression data to predict new TF-gene interactions. Using ChIP-chip data, we have shown that semi-supervised learning can improve predictions regarding TF-gene interactions. Using new temporal gene expression data for the aerobic-anaerobic switch response in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we have shown that these predictions can improve the utility of experimentally-verified interactions when reconstructing dynamic response networks. While the resulting networks utilized some of the new predictions these are primarily for TFs involved in this response. If the TF binds the DNA without effect on transcription in this condition these interactions would not be identified in the resulting map.</p><p>The resulting regulatory map for the aerobic-anaerobic response summarizes current knowledge and provides new insights into the role of various TFs in the response. The map labels the activators FNR, CRP, NarP, ModE, FhlA, and H-NS, and the repressors NarL and H-NS as associated with the upregulated genes, those assigned to the induced path in the first split. This means that the method predicts these TFs to be major regulators of the response, and likely the first TFs to upregulate expression of various genes when oxygen is removed from the growth medium. As mentioned above FNR, NarL and NarP are well known to be important regulators in this response. FhlA (formate hydrogen-lyase) is a well known transcriptional activator of <italic>hyc</italic> and <italic>hyp</italic> operons in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the FNR-mediated regulation of <italic>hyp</italic> expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> has also been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Messenger1">[42]</xref>, which might indicate that FhlA acts synergistically with FNR in regulating some genes during the anaerobic response. Published evidence has suggested that ModE is a secondary transcription activator of the <italic>hyc</italic> and the <italic>nar</italic> operons (encoding genes in response to nitrates and nitrites) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Self1">[43]</xref> and the <italic>dmsABC</italic> operon under conditions of anaerobiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-McNicholas1">[44]</xref>. The initial repressed pathway includes targets that are associated with activation by Fis, PhoB, and PhoP (indicating decreased activity of these TFs) and repression by FNR and ArcA. Fis is known to play a major role in reconfiguration of <italic>E. coli</italic> cellular processes by up-and down-regulating expression of various genes during changes in growth conditions, and its expression also varies dramatically during cell growth by autoregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Owens1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Ninnemann1">[46]</xref>. Additional TFs that are associated with activated genes at later split events include DcuR, TdcA, TdcR, and IHF. CRP has been described to govern the anaerobic transcriptional activation of the Tdc regulators (TdcA and TdcR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Sawers1">[47]</xref>, which supports our findings that these are secondary responders.</p><p>While we have used ChIP-chip data in evaluating predictions for some TFs, overall the number of TFs for which ChIP-chip data are currently available in <italic>E. coli</italic> is limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Wade1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Grainger1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Oshima1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Grainger4">[48]</xref>. In addition, unlike SEREND, ChIP-chip experiments do not differentiate between activator and repressor relationship. Furthermore SEREND may discover genes regulated by TFs that ChIP-chip experiments would not recover due to condition-specific binding activity or other experimental noise. Finally there could be cases in which a TF binding is detected in a ChIP-chip experiment, but a gene regulated by the TF is not associated with being a target of TF due to the imperfect process of mapping a TF binding location to a set of regulated genes. While motif input is also sensitive to this mapping, the expression input is not, thus in some of these cases SEREND could still predict the interaction.</p><p>One avenue for future work is to extend our semi-supervised methodology to also include data from ChIP-chip experiments in generating predictions. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a global atlas of TF-gene interactions is available based on ChIP-chip data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Harbison1">[49]</xref>, which researchers improved by combining the ChIP-chip data with other evidence sources, such as sequence motif and gene co-expression information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Harbison1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Holloway1">[51]</xref>. Another extension is to apply our methodology for inferring TF-gene interactions to additional model organisms.

The score of a site is the log-ratio of the probability of observing the sequence under a PWM model compared to a background model, which is similar to the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Robison1">[7]</xref>. We used a zero order background model, so under both the PWM and background model, the probability of a site is the product of the probability at each position. Under the background model we set the probability of observing a specific nucleotide to its overall proportion in non-coding regions. Under the PWM model, we set the probability of observing a specific nucleotide at a specific position to the ratio of the count for the nucleotide at that position over the total counts at the position in the PWM. We added a pseduo-count to each entry in the matrix equal to the non-coding region background probability of the corresponding nucleotide. For each gene we obtained its RegulonDB transcriptional unit assignment, which is based on either experimental evidence or computational inference. Six genes were not annotated as belonging to any transcriptional unit, and for these we assumed each was the only gene in their respective transcriptional units. We then determined the first gene transcribed in the gene's transcriptional unit, and the location of the start of the coding sequence of the gene from RegulonDB. We then scanned 50 base pairs downstream of the start of the coding sequence and 300 base pairs upstream, on both strands, recording the highest scoring motif hit. If the gene was annotated to belong to multiple transcription units with different first genes we took the value of the highest scoring site in any of the regions.

If the criterion for re-labeling a gene was satisfied, then the classifier gave greater probability than uniform that the gene was regulated by the TF, even though the classifier was trained with the input that the gene was not regulated by the TF. As <italic>k</italic> increases, the greater the probability as compared to uniform would be needed to re-label the gene.

Expression values were converted to a log base ten ratio relative to the 0 min time point. We selected only genes with no more than two missing time points and a log base ten fold change of at least 0.3 at one time point, resulting in a total of 2317 genes. The TF-gene association data were a matrix of TFs and genes with an entry being ‘1’ if the TF was predicted to be an activator for the gene, ‘−1’ if it was predicted to be a repressor, and ‘0’ otherwise. Dual regulated genes of a TF in the curated network received the majority label between ‘1’ and ‘−1’ of the other genes regulated by the TF. DREM uses an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Bengio1">[54]</xref> that allows TF-gene interaction information to influence transition probabilities in a gene-specific manner. DREM assigns each gene to its most likely path through the model based on its expression and the TFs that control it. A TF label is assigned to a path out of a split only if based on a hypergeometric distribution calculation its association score with regulating genes along the path out of the split, where a lower score indicates a stronger association, is below a certain cutoff. Here we use 10<sup>−4</sup> as the cutoff (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000044.s001">Text S1</xref> for maps with other cut-off scores). We used the DREM method as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000044-Ernst1">[4]</xref> except for a change in the model selection criteria. Instead of using a held out test set to evaluate models, under the modified criteria DREM would select models to maximize the log-likelihood minus a regularization penalty on the number of states. This allowed a more explicit penalization of the complexity of the model and allowed DREM to use all data in estimating the parameters and for model selection.
