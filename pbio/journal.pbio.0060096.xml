        <p>Replication and pathogenesis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is tightly linked to the structure of its RNA genome, but genome structure in infectious virions is poorly understood. We invent high-throughput SHAPE (selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) technology, which uses many of the same tools as DNA sequencing, to quantify RNA backbone flexibility at single-nucleotide resolution and from which robust structural information can be immediately derived. We analyze the structure of HIV-1 genomic RNA in four biologically instructive states, including the authentic viral genome inside native particles. Remarkably, given the large number of plausible local structures, the first 10% of the HIV-1 genome exists in a single, predominant conformation in all four states. We also discover that noncoding regions functioning in a regulatory role have significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.0001) SHAPE reactivities, and hence more structure, than do viral coding regions that function as the template for protein synthesis. By directly monitoring protein binding inside virions, we identify the RNA recognition motif for the viral nucleocapsid protein. Seven structurally homologous binding sites occur in a well-defined domain in the genome, consistent with a role in directing specific packaging of genomic RNA into nascent virions. In addition, we identify two distinct motifs that are targets for the duplex destabilizing activity of this same protein. The nucleocapsid protein destabilizes local HIV-1 RNA structure in ways likely to facilitate initial movement both of the retroviral reverse transcriptase from its tRNA primer and of the ribosome in coding regions. Each of the three nucleocapsid interaction motifs falls in a specific genome domain, indicating that local protein interactions can be organized by the long-range architecture of an RNA. High-throughput SHAPE reveals a comprehensive view of HIV-1 RNA genome structure, and further application of this technology will make possible newly informative analysis of any RNA in a cellular transcriptome.</p>

          <p>The function of the RNA genome of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is determined both by its sequence and by its ability to fold back on itself to form specific higher-order structures. In order to describe physical structures in a region of the HIV RNA genome known to play multiple, critical roles in viral replication and pathogenesis, we invent a high-throughput, quantitative, and comprehensive structure-mapping approach that locates flexible (unpaired) nucleotides within a folded RNA, assaying hundreds of nucleotides at a time. We find that the first 10% of the HIV-1 genome has a single predominant structure and that regulatory motifs have significantly greater structure than do protein-coding segments. The HIV genome interacts with numerous proteins, including multiple copies of the nucleocapsid protein. We directly map RNA–protein interactions inside virions and discover that the nucleocapsid prottein interacts with viral RNA in at least three distinct ways, depending on the context within the overall genome structure. Further application of the high-throughput RNA-structure analysis tools described here will make it possible to address diverse structure–function relationships in intact cellular and viral RNAs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>As is the case with many natural RNAs, the function of the HIV RNA genome is strongly linked to its ability to form higher-order structure and to interact with protein effectors in each stage of its replication cycle. The 5′ end of the HIV genome alone contains a noncoding, highly structured region that is involved in viral packaging, dimerization, pairing with the cellular tRNA primer for cDNA synthesis, and binding numerous viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b002">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Immediately downstream of this regulatory region, the HIV genome contains nine open reading frames. The first protein encoded by the HIV-1 genome is Gag, which is ultimately cleaved into a complex set of proteins, including matrix, capsid, and nucleocapsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b002">2</xref>]. The nucleocapsid protein has two dissimilar RNA binding activities. First, as part of the Gag precursor protein, the nucleocapsid domain specifically recognizes and directs the HIV genome to be packaged into new virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b005">5</xref>] in the context of a vast excess of other cellular RNAs. In contrast, the nucleocapsid protein also has a significant duplex destabilizing activity, which plays a key role in facilitating the RNA annealing and rearrangement events essential for viral reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b007">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Because of its importance in regulating replication and for governing interactions with protein cofactors, extensive efforts have been directed towards developing structural models for the HIV-1 genome and for identifying candidate interaction sites for the nucleocapsid protein. Multiple models based on phylogenetic, chemical mapping, and mutagenesis approaches have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b017">17</xref>]. In general, agreement between proposed structures is limited to highly structured hairpins; large zones of disagreement between models are common. The available experimental and sequence information is not sufficient to support one model over another. This lack of consensus in understanding HIV genome structure reflects challenges common to the analysis of any large RNA in its native biological context.</p>
      <p>One of the most successful methods for determining an RNA secondary structure has been phylogenetic covariation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b019">19</xref>]. However, this method has a narrow range of usefulness in that homologous RNAs must be similar enough to form the same structure, but simultaneously exhibit sufficient polymorphism to be informative. Few RNAs meet this standard. In the case of HIV and most viral RNAs, sequences are typically too similar to each other to provide sufficient constraints over large regions.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, RNA structural information can be inferred by treatment with chemicals or enzymes that discriminate between paired and unpaired nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b021">21</xref>]. This reactivity information is then used to choose among various models, usually predicted with the assistance of thermodynamic folding algorithms. Conventional chemical and enzymatic mapping information has a narrow dynamic range and is usually available only for 25% to 50% of nucleotides in an RNA. As a result, conventional mapping experiments tend to focus on short pieces of RNA in artificial contexts and rely heavily on thermodynamic prediction and extrapolation to relate structures and protein binding sites identified in vitro to the biology of large RNAs in their native contexts. When used against intact viral particles, conventional probes have thus far also been unable to detect protein–RNA interactions inside HIV virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b016">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>Therefore, comprehensive and accurate analysis of any cellular or viral RNA in a relevant biological context requires a new technology that may be used for any RNA sequence under a wide variety of biologically relevant conditions. Our approach is based on the observation that electrophiles, such as N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA), react selectively with flexible RNA nucleotides at the ribose 2′-hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b022">22</xref>].</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The RNA is exposed to NMIA at a concentration that yields approximately one 2′-<italic>O</italic>-adduct per 300 nucleotides (nts). Adducts are detected by their ability to inhibit primer extension by reverse transcriptase. A control extension reaction omitting NMIA to assess background, along with dideoxy sequencing extensions to assign nucleotide positions, are performed in parallel. These combined steps are called selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension, or SHAPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b024">24</xref>]. Because the four canonical RNA nucleotides each contain a 2′-hydroxyl group, local nucleotide flexibility at all sites in an RNA is quantitatively interrogated in a single experiment.</p>
      <p>In this work, we couple SHAPE chemistry with automated data readout and analysis systems so that hundreds of nucleotides of RNA structure can be analyzed in a single experiment. The overarching impact of this technology begins to realize the goal of making RNA structure analysis roughly as simple as contemporary DNA sequencing. High-throughput SHAPE (hSHAPE) makes it possible to rapidly measure RNA backbone flexibility at greater than 90% of the nucleotides in an RNA under a variety of biologically relevant conditions.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the power of hSHAPE while examining one of the most functionally important regions of an HIV genome, we applied hSHAPE to the first 900 nts of the 5′ end of the HIV-1 genome, under four biologically informative states. The data from these experiments allow us to address a comprehensive set of challenges that all require accurate knowledge of the structure of the HIV RNA genome: Does the viral genome have a global, long-range architecture, or is it largely organized as a series of isolated structural elements? Is it possible to identify RNA regulatory motifs based on their underlying RNA structure? Can consensus RNA binding sites be identified for the viral nucleocapsid protein, and if so, are these organized in domains? Can nucleocapsid interaction sites that function in specific RNA binding and genome packaging be distinguished from those that are targets for duplex destabilization by this same protein? If two classes of interaction sites for the nucleocapsid protein can be identified, do the specific binding and duplex destabilization activities operate in the same or in neighboring regions of the HIV genome?</p>

        <p>To create the technology necessary to analyze long regions of an RNA in biologically relevant environments in a single experiment, we performed each extension using a primer labeled with a color-coded fluorophore. The resulting cDNA products (from the (+) and (−) reagent reactions plus two sequencing traces) are combined and resolved in one multi-fluor run by automated capillary electrophoresis. In a single multiplex hSHAPE read, we typically obtain 250–400 nts of quantitative RNA structural information at single-nucleotide resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p>

        <p>These elution time versus dye amount data resemble DNA sequencing information analyzed by capillary electrophoresis, and require similar preprocessing steps, such as baseline correction and corrections for fluorescent multiplexing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b025">25</xref>]. However, whereas DNA sequencing requires detection of only the most intense peak at each position, the amplitudes in the (+) and (−) NMIA reagent channels in an hSHAPE experiment report quantitative RNA structural information. Peaks with little or no reactivity in the (+) NMIA channel correspond to RNA nucleotides constrained by base pairing or other interactions, whereas tall peaks indicate conformationally flexible positions (red and blue traces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The dynamic range that distinguishes flexible from paired nucleotides is approximately 30-fold.</p>
        <p>We calculated quantitative SHAPE reactivity information at every nucleotide position by developing hSHAPE-specific processing algorithms that (1) align the (+) and (−) NMIA channels to the RNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), (2) integrate the (+) and (−) NMIA peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), (3) correct signal decay (black line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), and (4) normalize SHAPE reactivities to a universal scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). In this case, these steps produce a single-nucleotide resolution view of RNA flexibility for HIV-1 nucleotides 8 through 286 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p>
        <p>To verify the accuracy of hSHAPE, we superimposed SHAPE reactivities on the well-characterized TAR and poly(A) stem-loops (nucleotides 1–104), which is the only region in the first 900 nts of the HIV RNA genome longer than approximately 50 nts for which prior analyses have converged on a single structural consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b016">16</xref>]. The SHAPE reactivity information is exactly consistent with the consensus secondary structure model for this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Nucleotides with normalized SHAPE reactivities greater than 0.5 are almost always single stranded (orange and red columns, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), whereas positions with reactivities less than approximately 0.2 (purple bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) are almost always paired. Reactivities between these values (green) may be paired or participate in other partially constraining interactions. SHAPE reactivities also accurately report fine-scale structural differences. For example, nucleotides in the UCU bulge in the TAR stem show intermediate reactivities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), consistent with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b026">26</xref>] that indicate that these nucleotides are partially stacked.</p>

        <title>Structural Analysis of Four HIV-1 Genome States</title>
        <p>Our goal was to determine the structure of and derive biological inferences for the 5′ region of the HIV-1 RNA genome, as it exists inside wild-type viral particles. As will be shown below, hSHAPE provides an extraordinarily detailed and high-resolution view of the HIV-1 genome inside authentic virions that reflects multiple biologically important RNA–RNA and RNA–protein interactions. To identify and characterize virion-specific RNA conformational changes and RNA–protein interactions, we used hSHAPE to analyze the structures of four states in total. In addition to (1) genomic RNA inside virions (the in virio state), we compared the structure of the in virio state with three simpler states involving (2) authentic HIV-1 genomic RNA that had been gently, but completely, deproteinized and extracted from virions (ex virio), (3) genomic RNA inside virions, but in which nucleocapsid-RNA interactions were selectively disrupted in situ by treatment with Aldrithiol-2 (AT-2 treated, described in detail below), and (4) a 976-nt HIV-1 transcript generated in vitro in the absence of any viral component. We used the protein-free ex virio RNA as the reference state for comparison. This RNA state is strongly influenced by the authentic virion environment but simultaneously lacks the complex influence of bound proteins.</p>
        <p>We constructed quantitative, single-nucleotide resolution profiles for the first 900 nts, or 10% of the HIV-1 genome, for each of these four states by combining the information from overlapping, and highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) hSHAPE reads. Two to three independent repetitions were obtained for each primer; standard deviations are small, on the order of 0.1 normalized SHAPE unit or less. By combining the results of 32 individual hSHAPE experiments of approximately 300 nts each, we obtained structural information for 94% of all nucleotides in these four states plus analysis of three structural mutants, for a total analysis of 9,100 nts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g003">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060096-sg001">S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Structural Model of the HIV-1 Genome</title>
        <p>The nucleotide-resolution SHAPE reactivities for the large analyzed region of the HIV-1 genome represent an unprecedented amount of structural information with which to characterize RNA structure, protein binding sites, and conformational changes that differentiate our four genome states. However, comprehensive single-nucleotide resolution data do not, by themselves, yield a secondary structure model for an RNA.</p>
        <p>We incorporate SHAPE reactivity information as an additional quasi-energetic constraint into an existing thermodynamic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b028">28</xref>] for RNA secondary structure prediction. Algorithms used to predict RNA structures from sequence show large increases in accuracy when experimental constraints are included in the prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b030">30</xref>]. Ongoing work from our laboratories shows that using SHAPE information to constrain RNA secondary structure prediction has a dramatic impact on the accuracy of predicted structures. For example, prediction accuracy improves from 52% to 90% for the RNase P specificity domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b030">30</xref>] and from 38% to approximately 90% for the 1,542-nt <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> 16S rRNA (unpublished data). These predictions feature overall topologies that closely resemble the correct structure, with errors generally limited to local rearrangements at multi-helix junctions.</p>
        <p>SHAPE reactivities provide model-free information about the extent of structure at each nucleotide. Therefore, in addition to proposing a complete secondary structure for our ex virio reference state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), we directly assessed the well determinedness of each helix in the secondary structure by increasing the relative weight of the SHAPE information in calculating low free-energy structures. We term this analysis the “pairing persistence” of each helix. Highly persistent helices (black and purple bars indicating base pairing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) form even when SHAPE reactivities were used to impose large pairing penalties for even slightly reactive nucleotides. Less persistent helices (blue and green bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) form only when the SHAPE contributions to the constraints are decreased.</p>

        <title>The 5′ Regulatory Domain Is More Highly Structured Than Adjacent mRNA-Like Coding Sequences</title>
        <p>The 5′ end of the HIV genome contains two functional regions whose boundary is the AUG start codon for the Gag coding sequence (nucleotides 336–338; in bold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Positions 5′ of the AUG start codon form a 340-nt–long noncoding regulatory domain that plays multiple important roles in the viral replication cycle. In contrast, nucleotides 3′ of the start codon contain the Gag protein coding region, of which we have analyzed approximately 560 nts.</p>
        <p>An important unresolved issue has been whether regulatory motifs might be identified from single RNA sequences. This is a challenging problem, and it is currently not possible to distinguish coding versus noncoding regions by thermodynamic secondary structure prediction alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b032">32</xref>]. hSHAPE analysis directly addresses this issue in two ways.</p>
        <p>First, the median SHAPE reactivity, a metric for the typical amount of structure in the two regions, is 0.14 for the 5′ regulatory domain and 0.40 for the 3′ mRNA-like region (dashed lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Differences in SHAPE reactivities between the two regions are statistically significant (Wilcoxon rank sum test <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.0001) with both the median and overall distribution being lower in the 5′ regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). The inflection point in SHAPE reactivities is nearly coincident with the AUG start codon (gray bar, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Second, the predicted secondary structure model can be used to infer the density of stable base pairing interactions in the 5′ regulatory versus 3′ coding regions. Nucleotides in the 5′ regulatory domain are 1.7 times more likely to be paired than those in the 3′ coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Although there are some flexible regions in the 5′ regulatory domain and a few stable duplexes in the 3′ coding region, overall there is a strong and statistically significant difference in the amount of structure in these two regions. Thus, by both criteria, hSHAPE clearly distinguishes between regulatory and coding regions within the HIV-1 genome because the noncoding regulatory domain is more highly structured than are coding sequences.</p>

        <title>The HIV-1 Genome Forms a Single Predominant Structure</title>
        <p>Comparison of the complete SHAPE reactivity profiles for the ex virio reference state with three other very different states—in virio, in virio with compromised nucleocapsid–RNA interactions, and an in vitro transcript—unexpectedly reveals that these four distinct states contain extensive regions with essentially identical structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). This is a remarkable result, considering the different biochemical histories of the four states. At the two extremes, the in virio RNA was maintained in its native conformation inside virions throughout the chemical interrogation step, whereas the in vitro transcript RNA did not interact with any authentic viral component, but instead, was synthesized and refolded entirely in vitro.</p>
        <p>We performed several control experiments to test how well hSHAPE detects significant, but local, differences in RNA conformation. These experiments encompassed analyzing an in vitro transcript containing a deletion of the U<sup>22</sup>CU<sup>24</sup> bulge in TAR, comparing the 976-nt in vitro transcript with a 3′ deletion that disrupts the pseudoknot at positions 79–85/443–449, and dissociating tRNA(lys3) from the ex virio RNA by a heating step. In each case, we detected strong changes in SHAPE reactivity exactly in the region whose structure was disrupted (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060096-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). These experiments are consistent with prior work that demonstrates that SHAPE is exquisitely sensitive to small changes in local RNA structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b036">36</xref>] and indicates that if structural differences exist between any two of our HIV-1 states, they are detectable by hSHAPE.</p>
        <p>In all normal retroviral particles, the genomic RNA exists as a dimer, with similar or identical RNA strands linked together by a limited number of base pairs and tertiary interactions. The dimeric structure appears to be a critical element in the selective packaging of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b038">38</xref>] and in template switching between two RNA monomers during reverse transcription that leads to recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b041">41</xref>], a major source of genetic variation for retroviruses. Dimerization is a complex process that may involve multiple stem-loops in the genome, but no single motif has been shown to be absolutely necessary for dimerization.</p>
        <p>In order to assess the dimeric nature of our in vitro transcript, we resolved monomeric and dimeric conformations of this RNA in nondenaturing gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). When the gel does not contain MgCl<sub>2</sub>, the HIV transcript RNA has a mobility identical to a monomer marker. In contrast, when Mg<sup>2+</sup> is added to the gel and running buffer, the transcript runs as a well-defined species consistent with formation of a dimer. This is exactly the behavior expected if the in vitro transcript forms one or more Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent loop-loop interactions. A similar loop-loop dimer state has been identified for the Moloney murine sarcoma retrovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b042">42</xref>].</p>

        <p>Dimerization is thought to involve an initial loop-loop interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b043">43</xref>] at the self-complementary sequence G<sup>257</sup>CGCGC<sup>262</sup>. We find that these nucleotides are unreactive in both the in vitro transcript and ex virio states (boxed nucleotides, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, both SHAPE reactivities and the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent behavior of the in vitro transcript strongly support formation of intermolecular base pairs at this loop.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the genomic RNA obtained from HIV viral particles forms a dimer that is stable even when subjected to gel electrophoresis in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b037">37</xref>]. We therefore sought to identify the structural differences that distinguish the loop-loop dimer formed by the in vitro transcript and the stable dimer in the ex virio state. However, we were unable to detect any statistically significant reactivity differences between the in vitro transcript and ex virio RNAs, including in sequences flanking the 257–262 loop (compare red and black traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g003">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g005">5</xref>B) or in base-paired regions of the TAR stem.</p>
        <p>Nucleotide resolution SHAPE data are therefore inconsistent with models derived from in vitro experiments that postulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b043">43</xref>] that dimerization in mature viruses is mediated by the formation of stable intermolecular duplexes involving the stem sequences adjacent to the DIS and TAR loops. However, our analysis based on HIV-1 genomic RNA purified from virions is consistent with recent in vivo experiments that show neither the TAR stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b044">44</xref>] nor the ability to form intermolecular base pairs in the DIS stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b045">45</xref>] are required for viral replication. Instead, we suggest that HIV-1 genome dimerization is mediated by loop-loop interactions alone, potentially augmented by interactions that have not yet been identified. Another possibility is that large-scale structural changes occur, but yield almost identical local nucleotide flexibilities in the pre- and post-dimer RNAs. We think this is a remote possibility, given the ability of hSHAPE to detect small changes in local RNA structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060096-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, within the predominant state for this large region of the HIV-1 genome, there are numerous regions that are persistently accessible to SHAPE chemistry. These regions are expected to hybridize readily with complementary sequences, including antisense and RNA interference (RNAi)-based oligomers, and represent multiple new and attractive targets for anti-HIV therapeutics (red and orange positions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).</p>

        <title>The tRNA(lys3) Binding Site</title>
        <p>Reactivity profiles for the four states analyzed in this work do show limited structural differences, which are consistent with important, but local, RNA conformation and protein binding effects. Because hSHAPE gives quantitative information at each nucleotide position, structural differences are readily detected both by comparing two reactivity profiles or by subtracting one profile from another to yield a difference plot (for example, see lower panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Over the 900 nts of analyzed sequence, there is a single region that shows significant differences between the ex virio reference state and the transcript RNA, refolded in vitro. This region lies between nucleotides 160 and 200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). The most dramatic difference is that the ex virio state is much less reactive at positions 182 to 199 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). This region maps exactly to the main tRNA(lys3) primer binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b001">1</xref>] and indicates that the primer is tightly paired to the HIV-1 RNA genome in viral particles. The in vitro transcript, which is not bound by tRNA, folds into a different local structure in these regions (compare the tRNA(lys3) binding sites in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g005">5</xref>C). We confirmed that these structural differences reflect tRNA binding by dissociating the tRNA from the genomic RNA via a heating step (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060096-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The tRNA primer also has the ability to form additional interactions with the genomic RNA, although current proposals for these interactions diverge widely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b047">47</xref>]. The SHAPE data show a clear pattern in which the ex virio state is more reactive at positions 161–166 and less reactive at positions 168–170, as compared with the in vitro transcript. These reactivity changes are consistent with tRNA(lys3)-induced structural rearrangement in RNA sequences outside the primary 18-bp tRNA primer binding site. The SHAPE reactivities thus strongly support a model in which the cellular tRNA(lys3) molecule interacts with the HIV-1 genome via three distinct base-pairing interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, see tRNA(lys3) label).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The most prominent protein ligand for genomic RNA in mature HIV virions is the nucleocapsid protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b006">6</xref>]. The nucleocapsid protein functions in two, almost diametrically opposed, ways. As part of the Gag precursor, the nucleocapsid domain binds specifically to the HIV genome to direct packaging of this RNA into nascent virions. As the mature nucleocapsid, this protein is thought to interact nonspecifically with RNA and thereby destabilize RNA duplexes and facilitate strand rearrangement and annealing events.</p>
        <p>These activities are mediated, in part, by two copies of a CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>4</sub>HX<sub>4</sub>C motif that coordinate a zinc ion to form a compact “zinc knuckle” domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). This domain has been shown to bind guanosine in model systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b007">7</xref>]. Thus far, it had not been possible to convincingly identify specific sites in the genome that bind or are destabilized by nucleocapsid or Gag proteins in virions.</p>
        <p>In this work, we took advantage of the prior discovery that “zinc ejecting” agents like 2,2′-dithioldipyridine (or Aldrithiol-2 [AT-2]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g006">Figure 6</xref>B) covalently modify cysteine residues in the zinc knuckle motifs and disrupt interactions between the zinc ion and its cysteine ligands. Treatment of viral particles with AT-2 promotes formation of reagent-nucleocapsid and nucleocapsid–nucleocapsid crosslinking and efficiently compromises nucleocapsid–RNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b050">50</xref>]. AT-2–treated virions retain the ability to bind to target cells and to undergo membrane fusion as well as native viral particles; however, these virions are not infectious and cannot undergo the first steps of reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b050">50</xref>]. Thus, treatment with AT-2 severely compromises the RNA-binding activity of the nucleocapsid protein, but leaves the surface of the virus particle intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b050">50</xref>]. To detect nucleocapsid–RNA interactions inside intact viral particles, we therefore treated virions with AT-2 and then analyzed the structure of the resulting genomic RNA using hSHAPE (see scheme, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). This approach constitutes a “reverse footprinting” experiment in which the effects of nucleocapsid–RNA interactions are detected by disrupting the zinc knuckle-RNA interactions inside virions.</p>

        <title>Nucleocapsid and HIV-1 Genome Structure</title>
        <p>Three initial conclusions are apparent from comparison of the in virio with the ex virio and AT-2-treated states. First, regions showing strong changes in SHAPE reactivity in the AT-2-treated state almost always resemble the protein-free ex virio state (compare blue and red traces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g007">Figures 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g008">8</xref>A). These experiments confirm that AT-2 treatment does disrupt nucleocapsid–RNA interactions inside virions, but importantly, that compromising the zinc knuckle structures in the nucleocapsid protein does not cause formation of nonspecific aggregating interactions with the genomic RNA.</p>

        <p>Second, disrupting nucleocapsid–RNA interactions by AT-2 treatment both increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g008">Figure 8</xref>) local nucleotide flexibility in distinct genome regions. The strongest and most densely arrayed effects of AT-2 treatment lie in the 5′ regulatory domain (upward and downward pointing arrowheads, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, even in the context of an intact HIV-1 genome, nucleocapsid proteins recognize smaller motifs within this large RNA.</p>
        <p>Third, we observe three different interaction motifs between nucleocapsid protein and the HIV-1 genome. In order to systematically locate and characterize these motifs, we subtract the SHAPE reactivities of the in virio state from the AT-2–treated state, and plot the smoothed differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g007">Figures 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g008">8</xref>B). These difference plots reveal locations in the RNA that are reproducibly affected by nucleocapsid protein binding.</p>
        <p>Eleven sites show statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) increases in SHAPE reactivity in the AT-2–treated state. Seven of these lie in a single compact domain involving positions 224–334 in the genome (cyan, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The strongest single effect of compromising nucleocapsid–RNA interactions occurs at positions 271–274, followed closely by positions 239–244 (emphasized with double asterisks and upwards pointing arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g007">7</xref>B). These sites, which have not been previously implicated in nucleocapsid or Gag recognition, are likely to be the primary interaction motifs for the viral nucleocapsid protein domain at the 5′ end of the HIV-1 genome. We also identify other sites with smaller AT-2–induced reactivity changes, which we characterize as secondary (single asterisks; positions 224–227 and 308–312, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and tertiary sites (positions 289–292, 318–320, and 326–329). All seven sites feature a general structural consensus characterized by a G-rich single-stranded sequence flanked by stable helices.</p>
        <p>The remaining four sites that are not clustered in the nucleocapsid interaction domain also occur at G-rich single-stranded regions adjacent to a stable helix (positions 201–205, 381–398, 553–558, and 606–609). In sum, these experiments indicate that hSHAPE directly identifies RNA interaction motifs inside native virions, that nucleocapsid protein binds at specific sites, and that many nucleocapsid-binding motifs are clustered in a domain within the 5′ regulatory region of the HIV-1 genome.</p>

      <sec id="s2i">
        <title>Structure Destabilizing Activity of Nucleocapsid</title>
        <p>In addition to recognizing specific motifs in the HIV-1 genome, the nucleocapsid protein also functions to destabilize short RNA helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b007">7</xref>]. If the nucleocapsid protein were functioning as a duplex destabilizer inside virions, compromising the activity of nucleocapsid (by AT-2 treatment) would reduce local nucleotide flexibility, and thus decrease SHAPE reactivities, at defined sites.</p>
        <p>Nucleocapsid-mediated destabilization of HIV RNA genome structure is thus reported as negative peaks in a difference analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Comparison of SHAPE reactivities for the in virio state with those for the AT-2 state in a difference analysis indicates that there are two statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) classes of sites in which local RNA structure is destabilized by intact nucleocapsid protein. A series of very strong effects is seen over the first 185 nts of the genomic RNA (emphasized with solid gray arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g008">8</xref>B). No other region in the first 900 nts of the HIV-1 genome shows this concentrated and large-magnitude structural destabilizing activity by nucleocapsid. We also observe additional sites that lie at relatively widely spaced intervals in the coding region that experience enhanced SHAPE reactivity upon compromising the zinc knuckle motif (dashed gray arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, these experiments emphasize the unanticipated result that the helix-destabilizing activity of the nucleocapsid protein does not fall randomly throughout the genomic RNA, but instead, has its greatest effect in a compact domain immediately 5′ to the tRNA binding site.</p>

        <title>A Structure for the HIV-1 Genome</title>
        <p>The first 10% of the HIV-1 RNA genome represents a microcosm of many possible classes of interactions that occur in any large cellular RNA. This RNA contains an extensive noncoding regulatory domain and also serves as a template for protein synthesis. The RNA also contains large-scale structures that are important for forming a dimeric state that facilitates genetic recombination, for base pairing with a specific cellular tRNA, and for binding of the viral Gag protein or nucleocapsid domain. A complete understanding of HIV RNA genome structure holds promise for identifying new targets for anti-HIV interventions.</p>
        <p>A critical attribute of hSHAPE analysis is that it is both more complete and quantitative than conventional approaches. This difference is readily seen by comparing the single-nucleotide resolution SHAPE information with prior analyses of HIV genome structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g009">Figure 9</xref>). It is clear that all of these studies are mapping nearly identical RNA conformations. Nucleotides reported to be reactive towards single-strand selective enzymatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b015">15</xref>] or chemical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b016">16</xref>] reagents almost always have high SHAPE reactivities; whereas, nucleotides that are cleaved by V1 nuclease, which shows a preference for double-stranded RNA, exhibit low SHAPE reactivity.</p>

All mapping data were aligned with the HIV-1 NL4–3 sequence.

        <p>Our secondary structure model is most similar to the proposal of Damgaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b015">15</xref>], but still contains many substantive differences with respect to this and other models that reflect three innovations unique to the hSHAPE approach. First, hSHAPE yielded structural information for 94% of all nucleotides in the analyzed region, which is far more than any prior effort. Near completeness is essential because RNA secondary structure prediction in the absence of constraining reactivity data yields structures with significant errors, especially as RNA length increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b053">53</xref>]. In the case of HIV-1 genomic RNA, relatively little data had been obtained for positions 110–145, 220–243, 276–282, 370–450, and 465–530, and no data were available 3′ of position 720. Second, our model reduces the influence of end-effect artifacts that occur with analysis of small RNA fragments because it is generated via hSHAPE using full-length genomic RNA. For example, structures that involve or lie inside of long-range interactions, such as the 108–114/335–341 stem (called the U5-AUG interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b015">15</xref>]) are mispredicted if the RNA sequence does not include the complete domain. Third, incorporation of SHAPE reactivity information as a pseudo-free energy change term makes the structure prediction calculation relatively insensitive to errors in any single reactivity measurement.</p>
        <p>hSHAPE analysis of four biologically relevant states of the HIV-1 genome indicates that this RNA has a single, strongly conserved structure. This result challenges previous proposals for multiple conformations in this region of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b043">43</xref>] and likely reflects that we maintained the native conformation of authentic, long HIV-1 RNAs. Additional conformations may exist at other stages of the viral infectivity cycle.</p>
        <p>hSHAPE analysis also indicates that regulatory and protein coding regions in HIV-1 are structurally distinct as judged by their quantitative SHAPE reactivities. Regulatory domains are more highly structured than coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">4</xref>C). hSHAPE may be a broadly useful tool for identifying highly structured regulatory motifs in other viral and cellular RNAs.</p>

        <title>Three Classes of Sites at Which Nucleocapsid Modulates HIV Genome Structure</title>
        <p>Understanding the RNA binding specificity and functions of the HIV nucleocapsid protein has proven to be challenging both because nucleocapsid has opposing specific and nonspecific binding activities and also because preferred RNA binding sites had not been clearly defined. In addition, previous in vitro mapping experiments using dimethyl sulfate failed to identify any HIV RNA–protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b016">16</xref>], likely because the limited structural sensitivity of this reagent. To overcome these challenges, we invented experiments that focused on the native RNA binding activity of the nucleocapsid protein inside wild-type virions.</p>
        <p>We used the zinc ejecting agent AT-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b050">50</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g006">Figure 6</xref>) to compromise nucleocapsid–RNA interactions inside virions. The effects of disrupting nucleocapsid–RNA interactions by AT-2 treatment are highly specific because changes in SHAPE reactivity are always localized to a small set of continuous nucleotides at each site. Notably, we observe structural changes consistent with both the specific RNA binding and with the duplex destabilizing activities of nucleocapsid.</p>
        <p>As judged by (1) conserved sequences and structures and (2) their location in the genome, we identify three classes of nucleocapsid protein interactions with the HIV-1 genome. For all three classes, measured differences between the in virio and AT-2–treated states were highly statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas, reactivity differences between nucleotides outside of these sites were statistically equivalent. The first class is a specific nucleocapsid binding site motif, and the other two classes are sites at which nucleocapsid destabilizes RNA duplex structure.</p>

          </fig>
          <p>Sites 1–5 and Ψ within the nucleocapsid interaction domain share a consensus motif comprised of a purine-rich flexible region of 3–4 nts adjacent to a helix that usually terminates in a C-G base pair. Identification of this structural consensus was only possible in the context of the new, SHAPE-constrained, secondary structure. These sites share both a limited sequence homology and a characteristic experimental SHAPE reactivity profile (above the solid line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g010">Figure 10</xref>A). Analysis of the information content in these sites indicates that the most prominent determinants for specific RNA binding are a single-stranded guanosine residue followed by a 3′ double-stranded region. The total information content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b055">55</xref>] of this site is 9.6 bits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g010">Figure 10</xref>B). The single-stranded guanosine is an important feature of the binding site, consistent with structural and biochemical analyses of nucleocapsid–RNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b059">59</xref>]. However, this nucleotide represents only one-fifth of the total information in the site, which emphasizes that the overall structural context plays an equally important role in defining a nucleocapsid protein binding site.</p>
          <p>The seventh site, the splice-donor (SD) stem-loop, is homologous in terms of sequence information; however, the flexible loop does not conform with the reactivity consensus because the loop nucleotides are unreactive towards SHAPE (see black nucleotides in the SD site, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g010">Figure 10</xref>A). NMR experiments show that nucleocapsid interacts with the Ψ and SD hairpins in completely different ways, involving protein interactions at opposite faces of an RNA helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b059">59</xref>], which reinforces the SHAPE analysis that local structure and nucleocapsid protein binding at these two sites are distinct.</p>
          <p>The six sites that conform to both the information content and the SHAPE structure consensus (above the solid line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g010">Figure 10</xref>A) lie in a single domain in our structure model for the 5′ end of the HIV-1 genome. This nucleocapsid recognition domain overlaps the packaging signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b003">3</xref>] and the region that forms a loop-loop interaction in the genomic RNA dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g005">5</xref>A). Our experiments support a model in which the 223–334 domain dimer interacts with multiple nucleocapsid molecules and potentially with the nucleocapsid motif in Gag proteins. The specific juxtaposition of multiple high-affinity nucleocapsid/Gag binding sites in the dimer would then function as the structural motif that specifically directs HIV genomic RNA to be packaged in nascent HIV virions.</p>

          <p>We also detect two classes of conserved motifs at which intact nucleocapsid protein increases local flexibility. In Class 2 sites, nucleocapsid destabilizes RNA structure at six compact regions between the 5′ end of the genome and the tRNA primer binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g008">Figure 8</xref>B; and solid gray arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

For all sites except the one containing position 107, the largest differences in SHAPE reactivity are asymmetrically distributed across the consensus motif. Nucleocapsid increases local nucleotide flexibility in the single-stranded region and at 1–2 nts in the “top” duplex strand (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g011">Figures 11</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">4</xref>A).</p>

          <p>The six sites in the 3′ coding region, termed Class 3 sites, conform to a different consensus in which nucleocapsid protein destabilizes RNA structure (dashed arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). These six sites can also be characterized by their SHAPE reactivities and by the net information content of their sequences. Strikingly, these motifs share a consensus that is different from the duplex destabilized sites in the 5′ regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g011">Figure 11</xref>C). The motif contains a 5′ duplex that terminates in a G-C or other G-containing base pair followed by an A/U-rich single-stranded region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g011">Figure 11</xref>D). For Class 3 motifs, AT-2–mediated reductions in SHAPE reactivities generally span the “top” strand of the duplex and then extend in a 3′ direction into the single-stranded region.</p>
          <p>Class 2 and 3 sites share important features: both include single-stranded A/U-rich motifs adjacent to a duplex in which the first base pair includes a guanosine nucleotide. We propose that the duplex destabilizing activity of the nucleocapsid protein reflects protein binding to these guanosine residues and binding-induced destabilization of the rest of these short duplexes. The motifs differ in that the single-stranded elements lie 5′ versus 3′ of the duplex. We hypothesize that this asymmetry is linked to the function of nucleocapsid in facilitating distinct steps in the retroviral replication cycle. Class 2 sites all lie immediately 5′ to the tRNA(lys3) binding site and therefore represent the first nucleotides traversed by the viral reverse transcriptase during viral DNA synthesis (solid gray arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). These data are consistent with a model in which nucleocapsid facilitates the initiation of reverse transcription of the viral genome. In contrast, nucleocapsid interactions at Class 3 sites may have evolved to promote a different process involving HIV RNA, like facilitating translation of the 3′ coding sequences and movement of the ribosome during translation.</p>

        <title>Perspective</title>
        <p>Using hSHAPE technology, we measured structure at 94% of the first 900 nts of the HIV-1 genome under seven sets of instructive conditions for a total analysis of 9,100 nts. Comparing structural information from these states indicates that large regions of the HIV-1 genome form a single structure, that regulatory motifs in the genome are highly base paired, that specific and nonspecific RNA binding modes of the nucleocapsid protein are manifest via interactions with domain-like elements of the RNA, and that the duplex destabilizing activity of nucleocapsid is mediated by two distinct classes of RNA sites. Because of its completeness, hSHAPE analysis provides information sufficient to discriminate between otherwise contradictory models for the HIV-1 genome.</p>
        <p>Just as DNA sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of DNA genome function, high-throughput RNA structure analysis makes possible investigation of intact RNAs from any viral or cellular transcriptome, as a function of multiple biological states. We anticipate that hSHAPE will contribute significantly to establishing the connections between RNA structure and translational regulation, alternative splicing, binding by small interfering and related small RNAs, higher-order folding and packaging in viruses, and many other RNA-based processes.</p>

Processing steps included (1) baseline correction, (2) color separation to correct for spectral overlap of the fluorescent dyes, and (3) mobility shift correction to align corresponding peaks in the four channels. Areas under each peak in the (+) and (−) NMIA traces were obtained by (1) peak detection and interpolation to align peaks in each channel with the RNA sequence and (2) performing a whole-trace Gaussian-fit integration. Integrated peak intensities were corrected for signal decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b063">63</xref>] as a function of read length by assuming a constant probability for extension at each nucleotide position, after excluding the 2% of most-highly reactive peaks:

SHAPE intensities at each individual nucleotide were examined manually to identify positions where high background was present in the (−) reagent control experiment. A very small number of positions fell into this category (&lt;6%) and were marked as containing no data. Quantitative SHAPE reactivities for individual datasets were normalized to a scale in which 0 indicates an unreactive site and the average intensity at highly reactive sites is set to 1.0. The normalization factor for each dataset was determined by first excluding the most-reactive 2% of peak intensities and then calculating the average for the next 8% of peak intensities. All reactivities were then divided by this average. This simple normalization procedure places all absolute reactivities on a scale of 0 to approximately 1.5 (ordinate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Normalized hSHAPE reactivities from each primer extension reaction were processed independently.

        <title>Statistical analyses, general procedures.</title>
        <p>To analyze differences in SHAPE reactivities between groups of nucleotides, such as comparing the 5′ regulatory versus 3′ protein coding regions, several tests were applied to determine the statistical characteristics of the subgroups and to determine the appropriate statistical measures of differences. We applied Levene's test to analyze homoscedasticity, which confirmed that the SHAPE reactivity variances between analyzed groups of nucleotides are equivalent. However, quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots of these data indicated departures from normality for the SHAPE reactivity data, so the standard Student <italic>t</italic>-test could not be applied. Instead, we applied the Wilcoxon rank sum test to analyze the statistical SHAPE reactivity differences between groups, which eliminates dependence on normality by rank-ordering the reactivity data and deriving statistics from the rankings. In the small number of cases in which reactivity data were missing for a nucleotide in one group, then that nucleotide was removed from the other groups in a given comparison. All analyses were performed using the open source R package (version 2.6.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b064">64</xref>].</p>
        <p><italic>Differences in structure between regulatory and coding domains.</italic> SHAPE reactivity data for the ex virio state were divided into two groups corresponding to the 5′ regulatory (nucleotides 1–335) and Gag coding sequences (nucleotides 336–906) and analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

        <p><italic>Absence of differences between TAR and DIS SHAPE reactivities for in vitro transcript, ex virio, and AT-2–treated states.</italic> Reactivity data were analyzed for the TAR (nucleotides 1–57) and DIS (nucleotides 236–282) regions. Three groups of reactivities were collected, reflecting each RNA state (in vitro, ex virio, and AT-2 treated) with 141 and 129 nts for the TAR and DIS regions, respectively. We applied a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to the three groups for each of the regions, to test whether they displayed statistically significant differences among groups for either region. The F ratio was calculated to determine whether the means of individual groups, corresponding to the three states, represent significant variation from the overall mean. The initial F ratio values calculated showed no significant difference between groups, with <italic>p</italic>-values of 0.63 for TAR and 0.98 for DIS, respectively. However, because SHAPE reactivities are not normally distributed, the F ratio can be inaccurate. To assess whether the initial F ratio was representative of the underlying distribution, we performed bootstrap resampling of the SHAPE data from the groups, with replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b065">65</xref>]. We recalculated the F ratio for each of 15,000 repetitions, then calculated <italic>p</italic>-values by determining the number of times F ratios with larger (more extreme) values were obtained. The bootstrap–re-estimated <italic>p</italic>-values were 0.625 for TAR and 0.974 for DIS, in close agreement with the initial calculation. This indicates that the original F ratio, which showed no statistical difference between these groups, is representative of the lack of difference between the TAR and DIS structures in these three HIV-1 RNA genome states.</p>

For each state, the nucleotides were divided into the three nucleocapsid protein binding classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g008">8</xref>). This resulted in two groups of 34, 42, and 28 nts for the Class 1, 2, and 3 sites, respectively. Each of these were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. For all three classes of nucleocapsid protein interaction sites, <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.001, indicating statistically significant differences in the SHAPE reactivity between in virio and AT-2–treated states. We also performed the inverse analysis, using all nucleotides that were not associated with any of the three classes of nucleocapsid sites. The Wilcoxon test yielded a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.859, indicating that nucleotides outside of these sites were statistically equivalent.</p>
        <p>Information content of nucleocapsid protein binding sites was calculated as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060096-b055">55</xref>]. Because the number of sequences was relatively small, information content shows some variation depending on the specific alignment. For example, information content was 9.6 bits for the alignment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060096-g010">Figure 10</xref>; alternative alignments yielded information contents of 8 to 12 bits.</p>
