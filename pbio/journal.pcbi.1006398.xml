<abstract>
<p>Bacterial and human voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub>s) exhibit similar cation selectivity, despite their distinct EEEE and DEKA selectivity filter signature sequences. Recent high-resolution structures for bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>s have allowed us to learn about ion conduction mechanisms in these simpler homo-tetrameric channels, but our understanding of the function of their mammalian counterparts remains limited. To probe these conduction mechanisms, a model of the human Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel has been constructed by grafting residues of its selectivity filter and external vestibular region onto the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>Rh channel with atomic-resolution structure. Multi-μs fully atomistic simulations capture long time-scale ion and protein movements associated with the permeation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions, and their differences. We observe a Na<sup>+</sup> ion knock-on conduction mechanism facilitated by low energy multi-carboxylate/multi-Na<sup>+</sup> complexes, akin to the bacterial channels. These complexes involve both the DEKA and vestibular EEDD rings, acting to draw multiple Na<sup>+</sup> into the selectivity filter and promote permeation. When the DEKA ring lysine is protonated, we observe that its ammonium group is actively participating in Na<sup>+</sup> permeation, presuming the role of another ion. It participates in the formation of a stable complex involving carboxylates that collectively bind both Na<sup>+</sup> and the Lys ammonium group in a high-field strength site, permitting pass-by translocation of Na<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, multiple K<sup>+</sup> ion complexes with the DEKA and EEDD rings are disfavored by up to 8.3 kcal/mol, with the K<sup>+</sup>-lysine-carboxylate complex non-existent. As a result, lysine acts as an electrostatic plug that partially blocks the flow of K<sup>+</sup> ions, which must instead wait for isomerization of lysine downward to clear the path for K<sup>+</sup> passage. These distinct mechanisms give us insight into the nature of ion conduction and selectivity in human Na<sub>v</sub> channels, while uncovering high field strength carboxylate binding complexes that define the more general phenomenon of Na<sup>+</sup>-selective ion transport in nature.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Ion channels can rapidly and selectively conduct an ionic species, essential for the firing of neurons, where sodium and potassium channels respond to changes in membrane potential to release stores of sodium and potassium ions in succession. The ability of a protein pore to discriminate between these two nearly identical ions has remained an intriguing problem for decades. In particular, the origins of sodium selectivity have been obscured by diverse protein chemistries that exhibit sodium-selective conduction in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we use multi-microsecond atomistic simulations to observe and contrast the permeation mechanisms of sodium and potassium ions in model human and bacterial sodium channels. These channels exhibit shared features of conduction, centered on the involvement of charged protein groups that form complexes with the smaller sodium ion. In the human channel model, we observe a special role for the signature lysine that allows sodium to pass, but partially blocks potassium. As sodium channels are vital to heartbeat, sensation, muscle contraction and brain activity, these insights could assist developments in improved therapeutics for disorders such as epilepsy and chronic pain, with mechanisms relevant to a range of ion transport processes in biology and materials.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels are widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems where they participate in essential functions, including heartbeat, muscle contraction and brain activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref002">2</xref>]. Dysfunctional Na<sub>v</sub>s are associated with several physiological disorders, including epileptic seizures and chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref004">4</xref>], and they are therefore a major target for new drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref005">5</xref>]. However, our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing these channels remains incomplete, largely due to the lack of high-resolution structural data on mammalian Na<sub>v</sub>s. There have, however, been recent breakthroughs in the structural determination for several Na<sub>v</sub> channels that enable investigations into molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>The first high-resolution structure of a Na<sub>v</sub> channel was the X-ray structure of the bacterial channel Na<sub>v</sub>Ab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref006">6</xref>], which was followed by numerous other high resolution structures, including for Na<sub>v</sub>Rh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref007">7</xref>], Na<sub>v</sub>Aep1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref008">8</xref>] and Na<sub>v</sub>Ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref010">10</xref>]. Although no mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> structure is yet available, two eukaryotic Na<sub>v</sub> structures have recently been solved using cryo EM; Na<sub>v</sub>PaS from cockroach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref011">11</xref>] and a newly resolved EeNa<sub>v</sub>1.4 from electric eel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref012">12</xref>], released after the simulations in this study were completed. Na<sub>v</sub>PaS has a 36–46% sequence identity to human Na<sub>v</sub> channels, but is 300–500 residues shorter. Na<sub>v</sub>PaS has several residues in and around the SF unresolved, has reduced charge in the vestibule of the SF compared to human Na<sub>v</sub>s and a resolution of 3.8 Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref011">11</xref>]<sub>.</sub> EeNa<sub>v</sub>1.4 has a 65% sequence identity to the human Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 and a resolution of 4 Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref012">12</xref>]. The lower resolution of these structures is significant given the small size of the Na<sub>v</sub> SF (diameter of ~3.6 Å at its narrowest point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref012">12</xref>]), and thus while these new structures help guide and validate studies, there remains much to be learned from the existing high-resolution bacterial structures. Bacterial and human Na<sub>v</sub> channels share several features including Na<sup>+</sup>-selective conduction, voltage-dependent activation, pore-based inactivation and drug modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref016">16</xref>]. While there is only a 25–30% sequence identity between bacterial and human Na<sub>v</sub>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref010">10</xref>], there exists evidence for overall shared structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref013">13</xref>]. Human Na<sub>v</sub>s consist of four domains, DI-DIV, linked together to form one long polypeptide chain, whereas the simpler bacterial channels are made up of four identical subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Each of these domains/subunits consists of 6 helical trans-membrane spanning segments, S1-S6, where S1-S4 make up a voltage sensor domain (VSD) and S5-S6 the pore domain (PD). Between these two latter segments is a P-loop that includes a narrow ion selectivity filter (SF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>), which establishes an ion preference “fingerprint” (permeability Li<sup>+</sup>~Na<sup>+</sup> &gt; K<sup>+</sup>~Cs<sup>+</sup>~Rb<sup>+</sup>) that is the same for both bacterial and human Na<sub>v</sub>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref018">18</xref>]. Both eukaryotic and bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>s are Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup> selective with eukaryotic Na<sub>v</sub>s selecting for Na<sup>+</sup> with P<sub>Na+</sub>/P<sub>K+</sub> ~10–30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>] and bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>s with P<sub>Na+</sub>/P<sub>K+</sub> ~5–170 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref020">20</xref>]. Due to the structural and functional similarities, the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels offer an excellent template, or scaffold, to support investigation into the core functional activities of mammalian Na<sub>v</sub>s.</p>

<p>Despite overall conservation of structure and function, the channels present distinct SF sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), with bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels making use of a ring of four Glu side chains (EEEE), to create a high field strength binding site (S<sub>HFS</sub>) thought to favor Na<sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref013">13</xref>], whereas all mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> utilize a ring of Glu, Asp, Lys and Ala (DEKA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref021">21</xref>], containing not only acidic residues, but also a basic lysine side chain that is known to be crucial to selectivity in mammalian channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref021">21</xref>]. So how do these different channels achieve similar ion selectivity, and does the existence of disparate sequences mean that bacterial and mammalian channels impose their ion preference via different molecular strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref018">18</xref>]? We seek to reveal and compare the fundamental rules of selective ion permeation for the whole family of sodium channels, by exploring ion conduction mechanisms in a human Na<sub>v</sub> channel to compare to previous simulations in bacterial channels.</p>
<p>There are 9 different Na<sub>v</sub>s comprising Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 to Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref022">22</xref>], with highly conserved sequences throughout these different subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref023">23</xref>]. Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 is abundant in the human nervous system and has been investigated extensively using methods of mutagenesis and electrophysiology (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>]). Here we take advantage of the conserved structural and functional features between mammalian and bacterial channels to generate a model of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, which incorporates the key SF and vestibular regions, into a high-resolution bacterial structure. Such grafting has previously been successful experimentally for imparting Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity on a bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref026">26</xref>]. The bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>Rh structure was chosen as the scaffold due to its higher sequence similarity in and around the SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; only shown for Na<sub>v</sub>Ab, Na<sub>v</sub>Rh and Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, however, it can be seen that the same is true also for Na<sub>v</sub>Ms, Na<sub>v</sub>Ae and Na<sub>v</sub>Ct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref016">16</xref>]). In particular, other bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>s have one residue extra just above the SF (Gly182; Na<sub>v</sub>Ab numbering) compared to Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Furthermore, those channels have an arginine (Arg185; Na<sub>v</sub>Ab numbering) close to the SF that was found to interfere with the side chains of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 SF in our separate models using Na<sub>v</sub>Ab as a scaffold (not shown). We also note that proposed open structures of a bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> have been presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref027">27</xref>], but our simulations (not reported here) have suggested that the proposed open Na<sub>v</sub>Ms structure does not stay open without strong constraints, as discovered previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref028">28</xref>]. Furthermore, previous studies of ion selectivity in bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>s using a closed lower gate have shown good sampling of ion translocation throughout the SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref031">31</xref>], and are thus capable of shedding light on selectivity mechanisms by revealing the underlying equilibrium free energy surfaces governing multi-ion movements. There is minimal thermodynamic perturbation for ions in the SF and cavity due to the closed lower gate, with the free energy of an ion inside open and closed Na<sub>v</sub>Ab pores having been shown to be similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous simulations of bacterial channels have taught us much about the potential behavior of the human sodium channel. The bacterial SF contains a highly conserved ring of four Glu side chains forming a high field strength site (S<sub>HFS</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref006">6</xref>]. Early simulation studies revealed ion binding sites and indications of a multi-ion conduction mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref036">36</xref>]. These studies suggested favoring of a partly-hydrated Na<sup>+</sup> due to the SF geometry in the Na<sub>v</sub>Ab crystal structure and the strength of interaction of ions with glutamate side chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref036">36</xref>]. They also demonstrated the ability of the SF to bind 2 ions concurrently within the S<sub>HFS</sub> site, with higher affinity for Na<sup>+</sup> potentially creating a reduced permeation barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref036">36</xref>]. Simulations have shown that the SF is flexible and wide enough to house multiple Na<sup>+</sup> ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref037">37</xref>], and is occupied by an average of two to three ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref038">38</xref>]; although simulations under significant membrane potentials have indicated reduced occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref028">28</xref>]. However, microsecond-length MD simulations have shown that the symmetric arrangement of Glu side chains in the crystal structure is broken on long time scales, affecting ion occupancy and having significant implications for the permeation mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref039">39</xref>]. These studies demonstrated that there is coupling between ion translocation and SF conformation, with isomerization of glutamate side chains catalyzing Na<sup>+</sup> conduction. These long unbiased simulations have described a stable 2-ion state, where the ions are trapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]. While some studies have focused only on this 2-ion state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref036">36</xref>], it has been shown that it is when a third ion enters the SF that efficient knock-on of the bottom ion into the central cavity occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]. The top ion can either knock-on or pass-by the middle ion in S<sub>HFS</sub>, with both permeation pathways experiencing similar energy barriers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s004">S2 Fig</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]). Regardless, binding of Na<sup>+</sup> to the S<sub>HFS</sub> Glu side chains is central to understanding Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup> selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Conduction is reliant on the flexibility of these side chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref036">36</xref>], where Na<sup>+</sup> ions form favorable 2 ion-2 carboxylate clusters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s004">S2 Fig</xref>, states C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>) that are not stable for K<sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]. Human Na<sub>v</sub> channels do not possess a symmetric E ring, but contain a set of carboxylates that might mediate similar complex formation. In particular, the DEKA signature sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1</xref>, right inset) contains two carboxylates that may be sufficient. However, human channels also possess a well-conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref024">24</xref>] charged ring in the outer vestibule, immediately adjacent to the SF, consisting of Glu, Glu, Asp and Asp residues (E<sub>I</sub>E<sub>II</sub>D<sub>III</sub>D<sub>IV</sub>; with the exception of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 that contains E<sub>I</sub>E<sub>II</sub>I<sub>III</sub>D<sub>IV</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref040">40</xref>]. The residues in these two rings have been shown to be asymmetrical in position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref041">41</xref>] and highly flexible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref042">42</xref>], and thus may facilitate multi-ion conduction, akin to the bacterial channels.</p>
<p>Substitution experiments have shown that the DEKA-ring is crucial for the selection of Na<sup>+</sup> ions in mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>], with at least one of the D and E necessary to preserve selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>]. The most important carboxylate in the DEKA ring is the E, which together with the K (residue 1422 in human Na<sub>v</sub>1.2), maintains wildtype (WT) selectivity, despite mutation of the D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>]. However, if the positions of these two residues (E and K) are swapped, into DKEA, selectivity is reduced nearly 4-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>], showing the importance of their precise locations, potentially due to interactions with surrounding amino acids, or implying a specific coordinating complex for Na<sup>+</sup> during conduction. Mutagenesis has also shown that both the charge and length of the K<sub>1422</sub> are necessary for maintaining Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity; substitution of Lys with neutral side chains causing a complete loss of Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity, and substitution with negatively charged side chains even reversing selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>]. Previous computational studies examining the role of Lys in conduction have also been based on models using bacterial structures, and concluded on a passive blocking role for Lys. Xia et al. replaced the ring of four Ser in the bacterial channel Na<sub>v</sub>Rh with DEKA and performed MD simulations to find that only when the Lys was constrained to E<sub>IV</sub> was the SF permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref044">44</xref>]. Mahdavi et al. threaded the amino acids from rat Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 onto the backbone of a pore only model of Na<sub>v</sub>Ab, also suggesting that ion translocation requires displacement of Lys out of the permeation pathway, by hydrogen bonding to the neighboring DIV Ser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref045">45</xref>]. We will show in this study, using extended length simulations, that Lys in fact plays an active role in conduction (not just based on pore occlusion) that is quite different for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions.</p>
<p>The vestibular EEDD-ring has also been shown to be important for ion conduction, possibly because it increases the electrostatic attraction of extracellular cations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref047">47</xref>]. However, all four residues are not equally important, with cysteine mutations showing the greatest decrease in conduction occurs when domain II Glu is mutated (effect on conduction: E<sub>II</sub>&gt;E<sub>I</sub>&gt; D<sub>IV</sub>~D<sub>III</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref041">41</xref>]. Furthermore, mutagenesis experiments have shown that replacement of EEDD residues can be detrimental to Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity. In particular <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>Na</italic></sub>/<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>K</italic></sub> has been shown to decrease when D<sub>IV</sub> is replaced with Cys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref048">48</xref>], while other experiments have shown little or no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref049">49</xref>]. Functionally, therefore, the exact roles of the outer ring carboxylates in selectivity are not well defined. Previous models based on bacterial structures have implied a greater thermodynamic preference for Na<sup>+</sup> in the lower SF, and an additional outer binding site at the EEDD-ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref045">45</xref>]. However, we will show that on long timescales, SF rearrangements allow for stable complexes with carboxylates from both the S<sub>HFS</sub> and outer ring that are important to Na<sup>+</sup> permeation.</p>
<p>Experiments have suggested that Na<sub>v</sub>s possess multiple binding sites inside the SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref053">53</xref>]. However, the evidence for their ability to bind multiple ions at the same time is inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref055">55</xref>]. Investigations of flux coupling suggest a flux ratio exponent close to unity for mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels, which is generally thought to imply a 1-ion conduction mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref055">55</xref>]. Furthermore, anomalous mole fraction effects, considered evidence of ion cooperation during conduction, have only been observed in bacterial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref018">18</xref>] and not mammalian Na<sub>v</sub>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref053">53</xref>]. Such effects are normally expected in single-file channels that impose ion correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref056">56</xref>], but may also arise from preferential and localized ion binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref059">59</xref>]. Single-file conduction is unlikely in Na<sub>v</sub> channels given their size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref060">60</xref>] and flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref042">42</xref>]. However, absence of an anomalous mole fraction effect does not rule out ion cooperativity. The fact that anomalous mole fraction effects are seen in bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels in the absence of bona fide single-file permeation, as suggested by several simulation studies, as well as the decoupling of ion and water fluxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref028">28</xref>], demonstrates limitations in the ability of this measure to identify a multi-ion mechanism. Likewise, there exists contradictory evidence from single channel conductance measurements for mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels, which have shown a saturating dependence on concentration in some experiments, indicative of a single ion mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref052">52</xref>], whereas others, where a wider range of concentrations have been examined, witness a complex relationship that may be explained by a multi-ion conduction mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref053">53</xref>]. Thus the experimental evidence is inconclusive when it comes to the ion occupancy and potential multi-ion conduction mechanism in mammalian Na<sub>v</sub>s. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can therefore help us elucidate the mechanisms involved in ion selectivity in Na<sub>v</sub>s.</p>
<p>Bacterial and human Na<sub>v</sub> channels therefore both possess several carboxylate side chains in (or adjacent to) the SF, allowing for multiple high field strength sites that may bind one or more ions, possibly leading to increased Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref061">61</xref>]. In a multi-ion/multi-ligand complex there will be competition between favorable ion-ligand and unfavorable ligand-ligand and ion-ion energies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref062">62</xref>], needing long time scale simulations to capture the ion and protein configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]. The mechanism is further complicated by the presence of the Lys, which may increase the sampling challenges due to side chain isomerizations. We thus turn to long MD simulations to capture those ion and slowly interconverting protein movements using the DE Shaw Anton supercomputer. We have performed multi-μs simulations where Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> are permitted to freely diffuse into and out of the SF of the Na<sub>v</sub>Rh/Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 model, observing the involvement of DEKA and outer EEDD rings, as well as participation of the signature Lys in multi-ion binding complexes, revealing distinct permeation mechanisms for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We have created a model of human Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 that includes the most important residues for ion permeation and selectivity, using a structurally well-defined bacterial channel as a scaffold. Although other parts of the channel may be important for attracting ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref011">11</xref>], the main functional region involves the SF and outer vestibular regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref024">24</xref>]. The sequence alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1</xref> was used to create a model of human Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 based on the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>Rh structure (PDB:4DXW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref007">7</xref>]), due to their higher sequence homology in and around the SF region, as discussed above. The mutated region (framed in cyan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), spanning residues 174–184 (Na<sub>v</sub>Rh numbering used herein), was chosen to introduce the SF and vestibular sequence with minimal perturbation. This includes the human DEKA and EEDD rings (residues 180 and 183/184) in the upper SF. Furthermore, residues 174–177 are located behind the SF and may interact with the side chains of the SF. In particular, within that range is Na<sub>v</sub>Rh Q175, which is a positively charged Arg in Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 DI and DII, and may influence both structure and ion conduction. To minimize perturbation, side chains of the chosen amino acids were removed from Na<sub>v</sub>Rh and the corresponding Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 side chains rebuilt manually using the CHARMM program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref063">63</xref>]. Herein the residues from the DEKA ring will be referred to by their 1-letter abbreviations. To avoid confusion with the symbol for Lys (K), potassium will always be referred to in ionic form, K<sup>+</sup>. The Asp and Glu residues from the vestibular EEDD ring will be referred to according to their domain numbers (E<sub>I</sub>, E<sub>II</sub>, D<sub>III</sub> and D<sub>IV</sub>).</p>
<p>Between the DEKA ring and the EEDD ring the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 sequence is one residue shorter in DII than in the bacterial channels. This residue (number 181) was removed, and neighboring residues (180–182) joined with constrained MD simulation (see below). We note that the original Na<sub>v</sub>Rh SF structure was closed at the lower gate as well as having a slightly collapsed SF. The collapsed SF has been proposed to be associated with the orientation of the Ser181 side chains, blocking the SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref064">64</xref>], however, after removing the Ser side chains as well as patching Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 residues and equilibration (described below), the filter forms an open SF conformation that allows us to study ion permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Other changes to the model, including the rebuilding of missing intracellular loops connecting S2 and S3 helices in the VSD using Rosetta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref065">65</xref>], and the maintenance of a key hydrogen bond between Thr178 and Trp182 that has been postulated to be important for keeping the shape of the SF in bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref007">7</xref>], are described in the Supplementary Information.</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict or measure the pK<sub>a</sub> shift of Lys in a non-aqueous microenvironment with the coming and going of conducting ions, such as in the SF of a Na<sub>v</sub> channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref066">66</xref>]. Large pK<sub>a</sub> shifts have been recorded in channel environments, and protonation states depend on the exact environment and ion occupancy, which will fluctuate over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref067">67</xref>]. The dependence of Na<sub>v</sub> conduction on the protonation states of key residues in the SF has therefore been investigated in several studies of bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref068">68</xref>]. Furthermore, quantum mechanical calculations using simplified models of the DEKA ring alone have demonstrated that a thermodynamic preference for Na<sup>+</sup> may be achieved with either protonation state of the Lys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref061">61</xref>]. However, the signature Lys has been shown to be crucial to Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>], intuitively suggesting that its charge may be important.

<p>The proteins were embedded in lipid bilayers of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), being the best characterized lipid for MD simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref069">69</xref>], with explicit TIP3P water molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref070">70</xref>] and 150 mM of NaCl or KCl solution.

Simulations all used the CHARMM36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref069">69</xref>] lipid and CHARMM22 protein and ion parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref072">72</xref>] with CMAP corrections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref075">75</xref>], chosen to provide direct comparison to our past simulations of the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>Ab channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]. However, attention to ion-carboxylate parameters was given to ensure accurate interactions for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> inside the SF, with standard parameters for the ion-carboxylate interaction shown to lead to reasonable agreement with both <italic>ab initio</italic> MD free energies of binding and osmotic pressure data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref076">76</xref>].

<p>The free energy map, or potential of mean force (PMF), for ion movement was calculated for each system using trajectory data with specific pore ion occupancies, from unbiased simulations as <italic>W</italic>({<italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>}) = −<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> ln <italic>ρ</italic>({<italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>}) + <italic>C</italic>, where <italic>ρ</italic> is the unbiased probability distribution as a function of reaction coordinate(s) {<italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>}, being the vertical positions of one or more ions (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>, or <italic>z</italic><sub>3</sub>; defined with <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub> being the lower-most ion), or their centroids (e.g. <italic>z</italic><sub>12</sub> = (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>)/2), each relative to the center of mass of the protein, <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>ref</italic></sub>, and where <italic>C</italic> is a constant. See Supplementary Information for more details, including error calculations.</p>
<p>The most important states involved in the permeation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions across the SF were identified from the PMFs and cluster analysis. The frames were broken down according to ion occupancy as well as ion-ion and ion-carboxylate distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Different states were identified according to how many carboxylates were interacting with the ion/ions using a cutoff defined from the radial distribution functions in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s005">S3 Fig</xref>, with further details of the clustering method described in the Supplementary Information. These states include complexes involving one or more carboxylate groups, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> ions and/or the signature Lys ammonium group. To evaluate the relative binding affinities of these states, Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref077">77</xref>] calculations were performed to obtain the relative binding free energies of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> to each particular complex.

<title>A stable human Na<sub>v</sub> model with asymmetric and flexible selectivity filter</title>
<p>After patching of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 SF and vestibular residues into the bacterial channel, followed by equilibration, the overall structures of the PD and SF were stable and settled down to RMSD 2–3 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s006">S4 Fig</xref>) after initial changes during the first <italic>μ</italic>s of simulation, with the level dependent on the choice of Lys protonation state (see below). Late changes are seen, especially for simulations in KCl, due to the onset of permeation following conformational changes within the SF, described below. The first 1 <italic>μ</italic>s of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 model with charged Lys with NaCl and KCl and the first 0.25 <italic>μ</italic>s of the shorter simulation with uncharged Lys have been discarded as equilibration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). We observe that the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 SF is relaxing into an asymmetrical shape where the DEKA and EEDD-ring span ~10–15 Å, allowing interactions with residues other than their immediate neighbors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s007">S5 Fig</xref>), explaining the increased RMSD. Previous experiments involving cysteine mutations have shown that the residues in the filter of an Na<sub>v</sub> channel are indeed asymmetrical in height and that the inner and outer rings span up to ~15 Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref041">41</xref>]. This asymmetry destabilizes the Thr/Cys178-Trp182 bond, important for keeping the shape of the SF in bacterial channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref007">7</xref>], which are seen to break and form several times during the simulations.</p>
<p>Flexibility has been shown to be a critical property of the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channel SF to facilitate ion conduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]. Furthermore, pairwise cysteine mutations have suggested significant flexibility (up to 7 Å) of the residues in the SF of a mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref048">48</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref042">42</xref>]. We observe high flexibility in the Na<sub>v</sub>Rh/Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 SF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s008">S6 Fig</xref>, with mean SF backbone fluctuations being approximately twice as large as those for Na<sub>v</sub>Ab (RMSF~1.5 Å and RMSF~0.8 Å for Na<sub>v</sub>Rh/Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>v</sub>Ab, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s008">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). These RMSF values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s008">S6A Fig</xref>) are mostly due to asymmetric subunit movements, with the RMSF values halved when computed based on subunit-by-subunit orienting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s008">S6B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The recent eukaryotic Na<sub>v</sub>PaS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref011">11</xref>] and EeNa<sub>v</sub>1.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref012">12</xref>] cryo EM structures offer related structural data to validate our model, although at limited resolution where several SF side chains were not resolved, preventing immediate conclusions about specific interactions. Structural alignment between the Na<sub>v</sub>Rh/Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 model and the Na<sub>v</sub>PaS or EeNa<sub>v</sub>1.4 structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s003">S1 Fig</xref>) shows structural similarities between the proteins, with key residues at the same positions. Due to the highly dynamic nature of the SF and its side chains, structural comparisons are limited and will depend on the choice of structure from the model simulation. Overall, however, structures are consistent, with the RMSD of the SF and vestibular region (residue 178 to 184) backbone being 2.0 Å and 2.3 Å when aligning to all four subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s003">S1A Fig</xref>), and 1.8 Å and 2.1 Å when aligning subunit by subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s003">S1A Fig</xref>), for Na<sub>v</sub>PaS and EeNa<sub>v</sub>1.4, respectively. The residues of the DEKA and EEQD/EEDD rings are asymmetrical in position in all three structures, with these residues spanning 10–15 Å in the model, ~10 Å in Na<sub>v</sub>PaS and ~14 Å in EeNa<sub>v</sub>1.4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). The spread of these side chains in both our model and the Na<sub>v</sub>PaS and EeNa<sub>v</sub>1.4 structures, combined with the high flexibility and lack of experimental resolution in this region, indicates that SF dynamics may play an important role in conduction.</p>

<title>Selectivity filter with neutral lysine exhibits bacterial-like multi-ion complex formation and conduction</title>
<p>The DEKA Lys has been shown to be crucial to Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity in mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>]. However, the protonation states of amino acids in a dynamic microenvironment, like that seen here within the SF), are hard to pinpoint experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref066">66</xref>] and may have large fluctuations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref067">67</xref>]. We have therefore investigated ion permeation in Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 not only with a protonated (Lys<sup>+</sup>) but first also with a deprotonated Lys (Lys<sup>0</sup>). Importantly, this allows us to isolate the role that the positive charge may play in the SF of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 for Na<sup>+</sup> permeation, and offers a comparison to existing bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> simulations.</p>
<p>Permeation of Na<sup>+</sup> in the SF of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 model when its DEKA Lys is neutral involves both 2-ion and 3-ion conduction mechanisms with an average number of 2.1±0.2 Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the SF, similar to (albeit slightly less than, though within the errors) that seen in the bacterial channel Na<sub>v</sub>Ab (2.3±0.5 ions; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]). The ions are partly hydrated as they permeate the SF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s009">S7 Fig</xref>). In the time series for ion movements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g002">Fig 2</xref>, several ions (colored lines) are observed to enter and exit the central cavity (below −5 Å), often coexisting within the SF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s015">S1 Movie</xref>). We see 61 complete permeation events through the SF (inward or outward moving involving 16 distinct ions) and the ions appear to move independently of the neutral Lys side chain (black line). Snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g002">Fig 2</xref> show representative configurations of a 2-ion and 3-ion state, where we see multi Na<sup>+</sup>-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes similar to those in for the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>, to be discussed below). However, in the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel it most commonly not only involves carboxylates only from the inner DEKA-ring, but also from the outer EEDD-ring, whose carboxylates reach down to help coordinate the ions, as opposed to only using two carboxylates from the inner ring, as was the case of the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>Ab channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>].</p>

<p>This cooperation between the DEKA and EEDD-rings creates a longer SF binding region with a broad span of negative electrostatic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), leading to less distinct binding sites. While Na<sub>v</sub>Ab has all of its charged side chains in one symmetrical ring, Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 has its charges spread out in two asymmetrical and highly flexible rings creating a broad S<sub>HFS</sub> (ion density map shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), compared to Na<sub>v</sub>Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Commonly a binding site is created with two Na<sup>+</sup> and one or two carboxylates from the DEKA and EEDD rings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 2 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s010">S8 Fig</xref>). The specific residues involved vary and we see several distinct carboxylate-ion complexes forming during the simulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 2 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s010">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Double ion occupancy dominates in the SF, but 3-ion occupancy is also common (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s010">S8A Fig</xref>). When the SF is occupied by a single ion it is most commonly unbound, however, it is also likely to be bound to one or more carboxylate side chains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s010">S8B Fig</xref>). When there are two ions in the filter they most likely form single ion complexes with multiple carboxylates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s010">S8C Fig</xref>). They are also often singly bound or bound together in a tight multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complex (defined by the radial distribution function in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s005">S3 Fig</xref>; with ions within 4.7 Å of each other and 2 or more carboxylate groups (based on central C atom) from the DEKA and EEDD-rings within 3.8 Å of the ions). When there are three ions in the SF, two of these are most likely to be bound together in a tight multi-carboxylate complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s010">S8D Fig</xref>). We have previously shown that multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes play a role in Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity in acid sensing ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref076">76</xref>]. When these complexes are present, the ions are mostly bound by E and/or D from the DEKA ring, together with the outer ring D<sub>III</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 2). This cooperativity of inner and outer charge rings is common and while all carboxylate side chains from either of the two rings ring are not necessary, at least one is needed for Na<sup>+</sup> binding in the S<sub>HFS</sub>. In particular, the DEKA ring is involved ~80% of the time, the EEDD ring ~80% of the time, and both rings cooperatively involved ~60% of the time. This need for only one of the carboxylates in the DEKA ring to maintain cation permeability has previously been implicated by mutagenesis experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the longer SF binding region in Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 with neutral Lys, we see a conduction mechanism resembling that of the bacterial Na<sub>v,</sub> relying on multi ion-multi carboxylate clusters for an efficient knock-on conduction. When there are 2 ions within the SF, at <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub> (lower) and <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub> (upper), the free energy map (as function of <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g004">Fig 4A</xref> exhibits three states; A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. In state A<sub>2</sub>, the upper ion is in the vestibular region of the SF (<italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~14Å) and the lower ion is collectively bound by the inner (purple side chains) and outer rings (green side chains) (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~7Å). In state B<sub>2</sub> the top ion has joined the bottom ion and they are both bound by the inner and outer rings (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~<italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~7Å) forming cooperative tight multi-ion/multi-carboxylate clusters, commonly made up by D, E and D<sub>III</sub>, and reminiscent of those seen in the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>). In state C<sub>2</sub> the top ion has either pushed the bottom ion into the cavity by Coulomb repulsion (dashed line) or it has passed by the bottom ion and entered the cavity itself (dotted line crossing the diagonal, y = x, represented by black dashed line), in both cases translocating from <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~7 Å to <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~-10 Å, while the other ion remains collectively bound to the inner and outer rings. These distinct permeation pathways are equally likely, with the largest barrier encountered being 1.9±0.8 kcal/mol.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g004">Fig 4B–4D</xref> show free energy projections for the 3-ion occupancy state, with ion positions specified as <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub> (lower ion), <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub> (middle ion), <italic>z</italic><sub>3</sub> (upper ion) or <italic>z</italic><sub>23</sub> (COM of the two upper ions). Here state A<sub>3</sub> has one ion in the middle of the two rings (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~7 Å) and one ion in the vestibule (<italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~14 Å), and an additional ion entering from the bulk above (<italic>z</italic><sub>3</sub>~15 Å). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref> we see how the upper ion pushes the middle ion downward to bind together with the lower ion at the inner ring (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~<italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~6 Å), represented by state B<sub>3</sub>, before eventually entering this site itself and pushing the bottom ion into the cavity, state C<sub>3</sub>, completing the conduction event. The broad free energy surface in panel c is due to the range of binding sites offered by the inner and outer carboxylate rings, as well as the fact that the centroid of 2 ions may span a wide range. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g004">Fig 4D</xref> shows another projection involving only the top two ions (<italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>z</italic><sub>3</sub>). The dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g004">Fig 4D</xref> shows how the top ion moves from state B<sub>3</sub> to state C<sub>3</sub> by entering the S<sub>HFS</sub> and knocking the bottom ion downward. The dotted line shows an alternative path where the top ion instead passes by the middle ion before knocking the bottom ion into the cavity. Regardless of the permeation pathway, the largest barrier experienced during permeation through the SF in the 3-ion state is 1.4±0.6 kcal/mol, similar to that experienced for Na<sup>+</sup> in the bacterial channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s004">S2 Fig</xref>). These results demonstrate that low barrier conduction may occur via knock-on or pass-by mechanisms in either 2- or 3-ion occupancy states for Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, but where 3-ion conduction is energetically more favorable, with reduced activation barrier. However, considering a 2-ion occupancy is more common (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s010">S8 Fig</xref>), the 2-ion mechanism is likely also contributing significantly to the overall ion flux.</p>
<p>We therefore have observed that the mammalian SF conducts Na<sup>+</sup> ions well with a neutral/deprotonated Lys in the DEKA ring, providing a useful comparison to the bacterial channel, with similar multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes forming during permeation (although involving both SF DEKA and vestibular EEDD carboxylates). However, because Lys is so important to permeation and selectivity experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>], but when neutral apparently plays only a passive role that would not implicate it, this suggests that we must turn our attention to the protonated Lys case.</p>

<title>Charged lysine forms a high field-strength complex to facilitate Na<sup>+</sup> conduction</title>
<p>When Lys is charged, there is an average of 1.5±0.4 Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the SF and permeation involves either 1 or 2-ion conduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s016">S2 Movie</xref>). This reduction in ion occupancy (compared to the neutral Lys case above and the bacterial channel) is presumed to be due to the reduced negative charge inside the SF.

<p>Snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g005">Fig 5</xref> show representative configurations of 1- and 2-ion carboxylate complexes. As with the neutral Lys case, we see multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complex formation where the residues from the EEDD ring (green) bend down into the SF region, leading to the binding of ions together with the carboxylates from the DEKA ring (purple; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 3). The DEKA ring is involved in binding ~50% of the time, the EEDD-ring ~90% of the time, and both rings cooperatively involved ~40% of the time. These complexes are most commonly (69±11%) involving D from DEKA and E<sub>II</sub> from EEDD. The ammonium group of the Lys from DEKA is also involved, binding 61±10% of the time to the E or D from the DEKA-ring. The salt bridge between Lys and one or both of these residues has previously been suggested by mutagenesis experiments as being important for Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>], and may be responsible for the importance of the precise sequence position of the Lys in the DEKA ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>]. We also observe that when ions enter the SF, the ammonium group of Lys (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g005">Fig 5</xref>) is displaced downward; being knocked-on, like any other ion. Thus, the charged Lys is intimately involved in the multi-ion mechanism. Importantly, it also participates in a Lys+Na<sup>+</sup>/carboxylate complex, similar to the 2-ion/multi-carboxylate clusters, commonly coordinated by D and E<sub>II</sub> and sometimes additionally by E (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 5). The ability to form these complexes is likely dependent on the location of the Glu and Lys in the DEKA ring, and swapping their positions might affect this complex formation thus decreasing selectivity, as indicated by mutagenesis experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>]. We will see below how this tight cluster plays an important role in the conduction mechanism.</p>
<p>Free energy projections reveal the relationship between the ions and the position of the ammonium group of Lys, <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>, demonstrating conduction with 1-ion and 2-ion occupancies in the SF. When there is a lone ion in the SF, at <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>, the free energy map (as function of <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g006">Fig 6</xref> exhibits four states; A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>1.</sub> In state A<sub>1</sub>, the ion is in the outer vestibular region of the SF (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~14Å) and the Lys is bound to one of the inner ring carboxylates (<italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~1 Å). In state B<sub>1</sub>, the ion has entered deeper into the SF and is bound to the inner and outer rings (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~6 Å). The dotted line shows an alternative state, B<sub>1</sub>’, in which the ion entering the filter replaces the ammonium group of the Lys, which is displaced downward (from <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~6 Å &amp; <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~1 Å to <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~4 Å &amp; <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~-2 Å). It is interesting to note that there is no conduction occurring when this happens. The ion is bound tightly to the DEKA ring and the ammonium group of the Lys is too repulsive for it to pass by in the lower part of the filter, where the electrostatic potential is not as negative. However, the dashed line shows how the ion can cross the ammonium group of the Lys in a region of higher field strength created by multiple carboxylates (<italic>z</italic>~2 Å), leading to state C<sub>1</sub>. In state C<sub>1</sub> the ammonium group of the Lys remains bound to the inner ring (<italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~2 Å) and the ion is bound to the backbone carbonyl of the two residues underneath the DEKA ring (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~-2 Å). In state D<sub>1</sub> the ion has left the SF and entered the cavity (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~-8 Å), completing the permeation event. The dashed arrow shows the minimum free energy path for conduction, where the largest barrier encountered is 1.7±0.3 kcal/mol.</p>

<p>The 2-ion conduction mechanism is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">Fig 7</xref>. The free energy projection in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">Fig 7A</xref> shows the position of the bottom ion (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>) as a function of the Lys (<italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">Fig 7B</xref> shows the COM of the two ions (<italic>z</italic><sub>12</sub>) as a function of the Lys, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">Fig 7C</xref> shows bottom versus top ions. In this 2-ion case, we see five distinct states; state A<sub>2</sub> is like the corresponding 1-ion state A<sub>1</sub>, but with an additional ion entering from the bulk above (<italic>z</italic><sub>12</sub>~14 Å). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">Fig 7B</xref> we can see how the two ions enter deeper into the SF and bind collectively to the inner and outer rings, just above the Lys in state B<sub>2</sub> (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~<italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~7 Å &amp; <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~2 Å). There is an additional state B<sub>2</sub>’, related to B<sub>2</sub>, where the ammonium group of the Lys is displaced downward (from <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~6 Å &amp; <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~2 Å to <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~4 Å &amp; <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~-2 Å; dotted line). However, just as for the 1-ion state, this downward Lys displacement is not sufficient for conduction, instead requiring that the ammonium group of Lys rise up and join one of the ions in a new intermediate stable state C<sub>2</sub> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">Fig 7A</xref> (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~<italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~2 Å). This state only appears when there are 2 Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the filter and seems to be vital for efficient permeation, because it allows the ion to pass the Lys with reduced energetic barrier (dashed line). The ion then binds below the Lys to the backbone carbonyls of the lower SF represented by state D<sub>2</sub> (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~-2 Å &amp; <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~2 Å). In state E<sub>2</sub> the top ion pushes the bottom ion into the cavity and binds to the inner ring (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~-6 Å, <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~6 Å &amp; <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~2 Å). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">Fig 7C</xref> shows only the two ions, at <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub> (lower) and <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub> (upper), and the corresponding states. The top ion can either enter and knock on or pass by the bottom ion. The dashed arrows show the lowest free energy path for conduction. The greatest barrier to overcome in the 2-ion state is 1.6±0.7 kcal/mol. Importantly, while conduction was seen to be possible with a singly-occupied SF (seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g006">Fig 6</xref>; dashed line), the entrance of a second Na<sup>+</sup> ion enables a stable state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">Fig 7A</xref>; state C<sub>2</sub>) where the ammonium group of the Lys and the bottom ion are collectively bound by the carboxylates, this allows the ion to pass by the Lys and in to the cavity with a lower barrier. As we shall see below, this efficient conduction mechanism does not exist for K<sup>+</sup> ions.</p>

<p>Most of the time there exists a single K<sup>+</sup> ion in the SF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s011">S9 Fig</xref>). When there are two K<sup>+</sup> ions in the SF they are generally further from each other, with a mean ion-ion distance of 15.1±0.8 Å, compared to 11.4±1.2 Å for Na<sup>+</sup>. Snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g008">Fig 8</xref> show representative configurations. The K<sup>+</sup> ions most commonly bind to single carboxylates or stay unbound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s011">S9 Fig</xref>). The lower occupancy and the larger ion-ion distances mean that we do not see the same tight multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes as frequently as we did for Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s011">S9 Fig</xref>), and when they do occur they are almost always singly coordinated by outer ring carboxylates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 4). Instead, a single K<sup>+</sup> ion typically enters the SF and binds solely to the D from the DEKA ring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 6). The DEKA ring is involved in binding ~40% of the time, the EEDD ring ~70% of the time, and both rings cooperatively involved only ~10% of the time. This reduced binding and absence of complex formation deep in the SF slows K<sup>+</sup> permeation. We instead observe K<sup>+</sup> ions held bound to the D of DEKA, electrostatically repelled by the Lys ammonium group, until the Lys side chain changes rotamer downward to allow ion movement, in stark contrast to the Na<sup>+</sup> case above.</p>
<p>We again see conduction with either 1 or 2 K<sup>+</sup> ion occupancy. However, unlike for Na<sup>+</sup> ions, we see similar permeation mechanisms when 1 or 2 K<sup>+</sup> ions are in the SF. This, together with the large K<sup>+</sup>- K<sup>+</sup> distance of 15.1±0.8 Å, compared to 11.4±1.2 Å for Na<sup>+</sup>, suggest that the second ion does not participate in conduction but rather is loosely associated around the vestibule region. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g009">Fig 9A</xref> shows the 1-ion conduction mechanism, with the ion at <italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>, and the ammonium group of Lys, at <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>. We observe four states in the 2D PMF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g009">Fig 9</xref>; A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1,</sub> C<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>1</sub>. In state A<sub>1</sub> the ion is in the vestibular region of the SF (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~14 Å) and the Lys is bound to one of the inner ring carboxylates (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~0 Å). The ion then moves down and binds to the outer ring (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~8 Å) represented by state B<sub>1</sub>. In state C<sub>1</sub>, the ion has entered deeper into the SF and is now bound only to the carboxylate of the D<sub>1</sub> from the DEKA ring (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~4 Å). The Lys is still bound to the inner ring in both these two states (<italic>z</italic><sub>K</sub>~0 Å). The ions do not have considerable effect on the position of the ammonium group of the Lys. However, occasionally (~10% of the time) the Lys changes rotamer downward (<italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>&lt;-2 Å), allowing leakage of K<sup>+</sup> ions and thus permeation, represented by dashed line, leading to state D<sub>1</sub>. After the conduction event, the ammonium group of the Lys again bends upward to bind to the inner ring carboxylates (<italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~2 Å). For this to happen the K<sup>+</sup> ion has to pass by the ammonium group of the Lys in the lower part of the SF (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>~<italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>~-2 Å) where the electrostatic potential is less negative, leading to a larger energy barrier of 2.8±0.3 kcal/mol, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g008">Fig 8A</xref> along the pathway represented with a dashed arrow. This increased barrier (by 1.1±0.4 kcal/mol) would suggest a relative permeability for the channel of the order of 10, which is consistent with the experimental value for mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels (e.g. P<sub>Na+</sub>/P<sub>K+</sub> ~10 in Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 from rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>]). This estimate, however, assumes the rate-limiting step for conduction does not involve Lys rotameric change, which was observed here on the multi-μs timeframe; apparently exceeding the sub-μs scale of permeation, but which may not have been reliably quantified based on 4μs simulation.</p>

<p>The 2-ion conduction mechanism in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g009">Fig 9B</xref> looks very similar, with the large K<sup>+</sup>- K<sup>+</sup> distance of 15.1±0.8 Å showing that it is the same as the 1-ion conduction mechanism, only with an additional ion in the vicinity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g009">Fig 9B</xref> shows the 2D PMF with the bottom ion, at <italic>z</italic><sub>1,</sub> and the ammonium group of Lys, at <italic>z</italic><sub>Lys</sub>, being almost identical to the 1-ion case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g009">Fig 9A</xref>; supporting the lack of a concerted 2-ion conduction mechanism. The lower ion enters the channel, binds collectively to the DEKA and EEDD rings in state B<sub>2</sub>, before binding solely to the DEKA ring in state C<sub>2</sub>. To enter the cavity, the ion has to wait for the Lys to change rotamer, it can then pass the Lys ammonium group in the lower SF, and then move further down into the cavity (state D<sub>2</sub>). In the meanwhile, the upper ion generally sits in the vicinity of the SF. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g009">Fig 9C</xref> we see how the two ions can cross each other in the top part of the channel. The top ion can be anywhere between <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~7 Å and <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~15 Å during conduction, however, with a slight preference around <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>~12 Å. The 2-ion energy barrier is similar to the 1-ion case at 2.7±0.3 kcal/mol. The Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> barriers differ by 1.1 kcal/mol, however, the slowest coordinate in the K<sup>+</sup> translocation pathway appears to involve the structural isomerization of the Lys side chain downward to permit conduction, leading to a permeation event that is more costly for K<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p>Key to the low barrier for Na<sup>+</sup> permeation is its ability to form tight multi-ion/multi-carboxylate clusters as well as a complex with Lys and 2 carboxylates, allowing pass-by conduction in the S<sub>HFS</sub>. We do not see the same tight K<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> clusters nor the simultaneous binding of K<sup>+</sup> and Lys near the DEKA ring. Instead we see a lone K<sup>+</sup> ion that is singly bound and forced to pass by the Lys lower in the SF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s011">S9 Fig</xref>), where the electrostatic field is less favorable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), making the whole process far less likely.</p>
<p>We now explore the thermodynamic stabilities of the complexes observed during permeation events to understand the causes of the different Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> mechanisms that may underlie selectivity.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Multi-ion complex stability underpins selective conduction</title>
<p>Multi-ion complex formation with carboxylates is required for efficient permeation as it helps draw in and stabilize the ions in the SF. This acts as a precursor for the ion+Lys/multi-carboxylate complex that aids in the crossing of the SF. The analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s011">S9 Fig</xref> suggests that such multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes appear more favorable for Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup>. When the SF is occupied by a single ion, Na<sup>+</sup> is most commonly bound to one or more carboxylate side chains (45% and 26%), whereas K<sup>+</sup> is more likely to be unbound (61%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s011">S9B Fig</xref>), and Na<sup>+</sup> is several times more likely than K<sup>+</sup> to form multi-carboxylate complexes (26% vs. 6%). Of the multi-ion occupancies observed, Na<sup>+</sup> ions are most likely to be either singly bound or in loose multi-carboxylate complexes (42% and 40%), whereas K<sup>+</sup> is most likely to be either singly bound or unbound (52% and 36%). Na<sup>+</sup> is several times more likely to form tight multi-ion/multi-carboxylate clusters than K<sup>+</sup> (12% vs. 3%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s011">S9C Fig</xref>). For Na<sup>+</sup> ions, these clusters are predominantly made up by outer ring carboxylates together with either the E or D from the DEKA ring, most commonly E<sub>II</sub> together with D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 3). For K<sup>+</sup> such complexes are almost always made up only by the outer ring carboxylates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 4).</p>
<p>Thus, tight 2-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes, similar to the complex that is formed before the low free energy pass-by conduction events for Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">Fig 7</xref>; state B<sub>2</sub>), are more common for Na<sup>+</sup> than K<sup>+</sup>, and may be very important for selectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s011">S9 Fig</xref>). FEP calculations were used to investigate the relative stabilities of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in such a complex. The most representative multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complex was identified to be bound collectively by D and E<sub>II</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g010">Fig 10B and 10C</xref>; inset) (69%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006398.s002">S1 Table</xref>; column 3). Results from FEP calculations show preferential binding by Na<sup>+</sup> with 4.8±0.1 kcal/mol for single ion occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), showing a strong inherent preference by carboxylates to bind Na<sup>+</sup>, in agreement with Eisenman high field strength theory on ion selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref078">78</xref>]. Quantum mechanical calculations using a model DEKA ring have demonstrated a similar preference for Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup> (4.8 kcal/mol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref079">79</xref>]), revealing consistency between models. The same complex containing two ions shows a large preference of 8.3±0.1 kcal/mol for Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g010">Fig 10B and 10C</xref>); 4.2 kcal/mol from the transformation of the 1<sup>st</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g010">Fig 10B</xref>) and 4.1 kcal/mol from the transformation the 2<sup>nd</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g010">Fig 10C</xref>). This shows that an additional ion creates extra stability for Na<sup>+</sup> relative to K<sup>+</sup>. When another ion is added to the complex, the cumulative ion-carboxylate attraction increases faster than the carboxylate-carboxylate and ion-ion repulsion, more so for Na<sup>+</sup> than K<sup>+</sup>, giving additional stability to Na<sup>+</sup> complexes. These complexes create deeper binding in the SF that aids crossing the ammonium group of the Lys. We note that this large cumulative free energy difference between Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions to form a 2-ion complex with multiple carboxylates is not the key energy controlling the different permeation mechanisms in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g009">9</xref>, but represents the relative stability of a complex that is particular to Na<sup>+</sup>, and largely unseen for the K<sup>+</sup> ion because of its low stability, helping explain the distinct mechanisms.</p>

<p>During the ion crossing of the charged Lys, the ion creates a stable transition state together with the Lys and multiple carboxylates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g010">Fig 10D</xref>; inset). This ion-Lys state is bound collectively by the D and E from the DEKA ring, as well as E<sub>II</sub> from the outer ring, and shows preferential binding of a single Na<sup>+</sup> by 4.3±0.4 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g010">Fig 10D</xref>). This ability to create a joint ion-Lys complex to facilitate crossing of the Lys in the S<sub>HFS</sub> is the salient difference in Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> permeation mechanisms<sub>.</sub></p>
<p>The K<sup>+</sup> ion instead usually resides alone in the SF and crosses the ammonium group of the Lys further down, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g010">Fig 10E</xref>; inset), where the electrostatic fields arising from carboxylates in the upper SF is less attractive. If we examine the relative free energies of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions in this region of the SF near the Lys, where such crossing occurs for K<sup>+</sup>, we calculate a similar but reduced value of 3.1±0.2 kcal/mol, still favoring Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006398.g010">Fig 10E</xref>). This value remains negative because the ion remains in contact with D and E side chains from the DEKA ring as it passes the Lys side chain. Theoretically, both K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> should be able to translocate in this fashion when the Lys moves downward, but this was not observed for Na<sup>+</sup>. We may understand this from the relative destabilization of Na<sup>+</sup> in this region relative to the selective multi-carboxylate complexes that form above it, making downward movement of Na<sup>+</sup> less likely.</p>
<p>We therefore hypothesize that selective permeation in Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 arises from the distinct mechanisms (Lys-complex pass-by Na<sup>+</sup> permeation versus electrostatically Lys plugged K<sup>+</sup> permeation), which originates from the difference in stabilities of multi-ion and ion-Lys complexes in the high field strength region of the SF. Multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes have also been seen to be crucial for Na<sup>+</sup> permeation in the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>Ab channel, where a preference for single Na<sup>+</sup> ions of -2.2±0.6 kcal/mol has been estimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]. In the bacterial channel, we also suggest that optimal conduction requires the greater occupancy of the 3-ion state which is achieved when the crystallographic E177-S178 H-bond is lost on 2 opposite monomers, allowing the S<sub>HFS</sub> carboxylate groups to reach toward the center of the SF and coordinate 2 Na<sup>+</sup> ions concurrently. This two-Na<sup>+</sup>/two-carboxylate complex offers additional stability, allowing those 2 ions to coexist in S<sub>HFS</sub>, and we calculate the relative stability of Na<sup>+</sup> vs. K<sup>+</sup> in S<sub>HFS</sub> to become -3.8±0.2 kcal/mol in Na<sub>v</sub>Ab. This observation suggests that Na<sup>+</sup> ions adopt a specific 3-ion arrangement with 2 ions at the level of S<sub>HFS</sub>, that does not occur in simulations of K<sup>+</sup>, which closely parallels our observations in the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The ability to select for native ions while discriminating against other similar ions, is one of the key features of voltage gated ion channels. Ion conduction is a dynamic process that involves conformational isomerizations of the residues of the SF, as well as cooperation between multiple ions, requiring long timescale simulations to extract the underlying energetic landscape. In the absence of a high-resolution structure of a mammalian channel to study selectivity and conduction at the molecular level, we designed a model of the human Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 by patching the essential sequence of residues in and around the SF, including the key DEKA and EEDD rings, into the Na<sub>v</sub>Rh bacterial channel. This Na<sub>v</sub>Rh/Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel relaxes into an asymmetrical configuration, where the DEKA and EEDD rings are highly flexible and cooperate to ensure efficient conduction and selectivity for Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup>, in line with previous studies of bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels where similar flexibility has been shown to be critical for ion conduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The presence of a positively charged Lys in Na<sub>v</sub> channels has long been a source of intrigue; being essential for selectivity, but its specific role unexplained. Previous computational studies of eukaryotic Na<sub>v</sub> models point toward a passive, hindering role, where the Lys side chain needs to bind away from the middle of the pore lumen in order to allow conduction of Na<sup>+</sup> ions. We reveal a more intimate role for this residue, depending on its protonation state. When Lys is deprotonated (neutral), we observe a 2 to 3-ion occupancy in the SF where both 2- and 3-ion knock on conductions are common, facilitated by tight multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes that are made possible by the flexible side chains of the SF. When Lys is instead protonated (charged), we see reduction to 1 to 2-ion occupancy, due to the extra charge introduced by the ammonium group of the Lys. In fact, we see the Lys actively participating in the conduction mechanism with a role similar to that of a permeating ion. In the presence of K<sup>+</sup> ions, the conduction mechanism instead relies on single ion permeation, where multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes are less likely.</p>
<p>These multi-Na<sup>+</sup>/multi-carboxylate complexes help attract Na<sup>+</sup> in to the SF of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, where binding deeper in the SF stabilizes the ions. Interestingly, the carboxylates involved in these key multi-Na<sup>+</sup>/multi-carboxylate complexes generally include only one carboxylate from DEKA and one or two from the EEDD ring in the vestibular region, rather than both D and E from the DEKA ring. This observation is consistent with mutagenesis experiments showing the need for only one of the D and E from the DEKA ring, supporting the idea of involvement of the outer ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref019">19</xref>]. These Na<sup>+</sup> favorable complexes are more commonly bound collectively by D and E<sub>II</sub>. Cysteine mutations of the residues in the EEDD ring show the greatest decrease in conduction when this domain II Glu (E<sub>II</sub> in our model) is mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref041">41</xref>], consistent with our observation that this residue from the outer ring is particularly important.</p>
<p>In the case of charged Lys we see conduction that is possible with a singly occupied SF, however, the binding of a second Na<sup>+</sup> ion reduces the conduction barrier by creating an intermediate state that enables efficient multi-ion conduction. The second Na<sup>+</sup> ion helps to push the ion already in the SF and stabilize a state where the ammonium group of the Lys and the bottom ion are collectively bound by the carboxylates, allowing the ion to pass by the Lys into the cavity. The facilitating of inward conduction by the presence of an additional external Na<sup>+</sup> ion may explain the robust inward rectification of current in mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels seen experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref001">1</xref>]. Even though more space for conduction can be created in the SF by the steric unplugging of the ammonium group of the Lys, no conduction occurs in that state. This behavior is consistent and comparable with previous results in Na<sub>v</sub>Ab, where pass by of ion by another would only occur at the level of S<sub>HFS</sub>. When the charged ammonium group of Lys is in the S<sub>HFS,</sub> where the electrostatic potential is most negative, it creates a smooth electrostatic environment leading into the cavity, whereas when it is in the down state it creates a zone of high electrostatic potential that cuts the cavity off from the SF. The Na<sup>+</sup> ion can benefit from the smooth energetic surface by binding at S<sub>HFS</sub> in a multi-ion complex with Lys, whereas K<sup>+</sup> cannot; instead becoming partially electrostatically blocked by the Lys in the lower SF. This illustrates the fundamental role of the Lys as an active participant in the selective conduction mechanism. K<sup>+</sup> is far less likely to form these multi-ion/multi-carboxylate complexes; in particular, we see preferential binding of 8.3±0.1 kcal/mol for Na<sup>+</sup>-Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> in these complexes. Furthermore, K<sup>+</sup> does not form the stable multi-carboxylate/Lys state. In fact, the ion+Lys/multi-carboxylate cluster favors Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup> by 4.3±0.4 kcal/mol. The consequence of this difference in affinity is a completely different conduction mechanism for K<sup>+</sup>, having to pass the ammonium group of Lys in the lower part of the SF, where the electrostatic environment is not as favorable. Interestingly, the apparently independent conduction pathways for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions could potentially explain absence of anomalous mole fraction effects in mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref053">53</xref>]. In the future, simulations of a model human Na<sub>v</sub> channel in an open conformation, based on constrained-open Na<sub>v</sub>Ab or Na<sub>v</sub>Ms structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref027">27</xref>], could be used to explore the competition of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions under the driving force of a membrane potential.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that mammalian Na<sub>v</sub>s select for Na<sup>+</sup> via a different mechanism to bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>s, owing to their divergent S<sub>HFS</sub> site forming residues (EEEE Vs DEKA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref080">80</xref>]. While this appears to be the case based on our observations, we do see evidence for common features that may be central to Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity. Both bacterial and human channels make use of an efficient multi-ion process enabled by flexible carboxylates binding two Na<sup>+</sup> ions during ion knock on or pass by conduction events. The efficiency of this multi-ion mechanism is reliant on the formation of 2-Na<sup>+</sup>/2-carboxylate complexes, whose thermodynamic stabilities are increased for Na<sup>+</sup> compared to K<sup>+</sup>. Even though bacterial channels possess 4 carboxylates at the S<sub>HFS</sub> site, only two are needed for high affinity binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref030">30</xref>]. Thus, the bacterial channel uses two of its four EEEE Glus, whereas the human channel uses carboxylates both from the DEKA and EEDD rings, leading to a Na<sup>+</sup> permeation process that closely resembles our observations in the model human channel. However, the Lys residue in the human DEKA signature participates in the multi-ion knock-on mechanism in ways that impose a unique ion discrimination process, perhaps explaining the higher level of ion selectivity in mammalian Na<sub>v</sub>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006398.ref001">1</xref>]. We propose that this additional selectivity is achieved by establishing distinct permeation mechanisms for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions, where the Lys expedites Na<sup>+</sup> translocation through high field strength complex formation, while partially blocking the K<sup>+</sup> ion.</p>
