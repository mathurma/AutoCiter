<abstract>
<p>Thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the last several years there have been a number of studies attempting to identify mechanisms that stop thrombus growth. This paper identifies a novel mechanism related to formation of a fibrin cap. In particular, protein transport through a fibrin network, an important component of a thrombus, was studied by integrating experiments with model simulations. The network permeability and the protein diffusivity were shown to be important factors determining the transport of proteins through the fibrin network. Our previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mice have shown that stabilized non-occluding thrombi are covered by a fibrin network (‘fibrin cap’). Model simulations, calibrated using experiments in microfluidic devices and accounting for the permeable structure of the fibrin cap, demonstrated that thrombin generated inside the thrombus was washed downstream through the fibrin network, thus limiting exposure of platelets on the thrombus surface to thrombin. Moreover, by restricting the approach of resting platelets in the flowing blood to the thrombus core, the fibrin cap impaired platelets from reaching regions of high thrombin concentration necessary for platelet activation and limited thrombus growth. The formation of a fibrin cap prevents small thrombi that frequently develop in the absence of major injury in the 60000 km of vessels in the body from developing into life threatening events.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>To restrict the loss of blood following rupture of blood vessels, the human body rapidly forms a clot consisting mainly of platelets and fibrin. However, to prevent formation of a pathological clot within vessels (thrombus) as a result of vessel damage or dysfunction, the response must be regulated, and clot formation must be limited. Our previous studies demonstrated that as a laser-induced thrombus stabilized in mice, the ratio of fibrin to platelets at the thrombus surface increased significantly. Stabilized non-occluding thrombi were observed to be covered by a fibrin network (‘fibrin cap’). In the present work the role of the fibrin network in protein transport is examined by integrating experiments in microfluidic devices with the hemodynamic thrombus model. The study reveals permeability of the fibrin network and protein diffusivity to be important factors determining the transport of blood proteins inside the thrombus. It is shown that the fibrin network does not dramatically limit the diffusion of thrombin but impairs flowing platelets in blood from reaching regions of high thrombin concentration thus, reducing the probability they are activated and stably integrated into the thrombus. This novel, counter-intuitive mechanism suggests that a fibrin network formed at early stages of thrombus initiation can prevent normally asymptomatic thrombi from developing into pathological clots.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Damage or inflammation to the blood vessel wall initiates the development of intravascular clots (thrombi). Uncontrolled growth of thrombi can result in occlusion of the blood vessel, starving tissues in the flow field of nutrients and oxygen. Furthermore, clot fragments washed away from the thrombus (emboli) may lodge in the vasculature of the lungs and brain causing life threatening conditions such as pulmonary embolism and ischemic stroke. Thromboembolic disease is a major biomedical problem with 900,000 cases per year in the USA leading to 300,000 deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Wakefield1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Kamocka1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Xu2">[5]</xref> that following laser-induced injury to a few cells lining the vessel wall small non-occlusive thrombi initially grow rapidly by accumulating platelets. After several minutes, growth ceases and the thrombi stabilize. The cessation of growth occurs as the surface composition of the developing thrombus changes. While actively growing during the first few minutes following injury the surface is composed primarily of platelets. As the thrombus stabilizes the surface composition changes to one composed primarily of a fibrin network containing cellular and platelet clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003095-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We previously developed multi-scale models of clot formation taking into account all main components including hemodynamics, molecular signaling leading to platelet activation and coagulation biochemical reactions taking place in blood and on surfaces of platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Xu1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Xu3">[6]</xref>. A combination of experimental approaches, image analysis and multi-scale modeling was used for formulating a novel biological hypothesis of a fibrin cap being capable of stopping blood clot growth by interfering with the transport of thrombin to the thrombus surface. Thrombin is a potent platelet activator and is required for fibrin generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Xu1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Xu4">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Xu5">[8]</xref>. By interfering with thrombin transport to the thrombus surface, we hypothesize the fibrin cap can limit further growth.</p>
<p>Because thrombin is primarily generated by coagulation reactions concentrated on the surface of activated platelets in the thrombus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Brass1">[9]</xref>, it is important to study the movement of thrombin through the fibrin network to determine if the network limits the distribution of thrombin to affect thrombus growth. Conceivably, the fibrin network forms a diffusion and permeability barrier and prevents the transport of thrombin to the thrombus surface.</p>
<p>This paper examines this hypothesis by studying in detail protein advection and diffusion to describe thrombin transport through fibrin networks (fibrin cap). It integrates computational and experimental analysis to show how the formation of a fibrin network limits thrombus growth. Network permeability and protein diffusion are the important factors determining the transport of proteins through the fibrin network of thrombi. We report on the experimental measurements of these factors and the development of a thrombus hemodynamics model incorporating them. We show that networks formed under physiological concentrations of fibrinogen and thrombin do not appreciably affect the diffusion of thrombin indicating the fibrin network does not provide a diffusion barrier. However, it is demonstrated that in permeable fibrin network, thrombin generated by platelets is rapidly washed downstream by advection. Only a thin band upstream and above the source of thrombin maintains an appreciable thrombin concentration, similar to the distribution expected in the absence of a fibrin network. However, the pore size in a newly formed sparse network is small enough to exclude resting platelets in flowing blood from approaching the thrombus core. The resting platelets in flowing blood contacting the thrombus therefore do not reach regions with sufficiently high thrombin concentration necessary for their activation and stable incorporation into the developing thrombus. Thus, the development of a sparse, permeable fibrin network on the thrombus surface may provide a mechanism to limit continued growth of small thrombi. The network does not provide a transport barrier for thrombin but rather a shield blocking resting platelets from approaching sites of thrombin generation. Our results identify a novel mechanism and reinforces the concept that the spatial separation of sites of factor activation and factor activity are important to understanding thrombogenesis. The suggested mechanism may prevent small thrombi, which frequently form as a result of activation or damage of a few endothelial cells, from growing into symptomatic occlusive clots.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<p>Since thrombin is critical for continued thrombus growth, we developed a thrombus hemodynamics model to compute the thrombin concentration at different positions in the thrombus. The model assumes thrombin is generated on the surface of activated platelets in the thrombus core and is transported through the fibrin network that surrounds the core both by advective flow of fluid permeating through the fibrin network and by diffusion through the fibrin gel. To calibrate the model, we experimentally determined fibrin clot permeability and thrombin diffusion rates through a fibrin network. Permeability was determined by perfusing liquid through fibrin gels formed with a physiological range of fibrin concentrations (0.5 to 4.0 mg/ml). Protein diffusion rates were determined using Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Soumpasis1">[10]</xref> protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003095-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, we also examined the diffusion rates of larger molecules, Fab IgG (MW = 50 kDa), in fibrin networks to assess the effect of the protein size on its diffusion. The experimentally determined measurements of permeability, protein diffusivity and the fibrin network density were then used for predictive analysis in the thrombus hemodynamic model.</p>

<title>Fibrin Network Permeation</title>
<p>Permeability of the fibrin networks was quantified from Darcy's equation using liquid flow rate and pressure gradient measurements across the fibrin networks. Our measurements showed a substantial decrease of the fibrin network permeability (Darcy's constant) by three orders of magnitude, as the fibrinogen concentration increased from 0.2 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL. A power law fit was used to obtain an explicit relationship between the permeability, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the fibrin volume fraction, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Under slight hydrostatic pressure the clot fibers deformed, broke near wall regions, and bundled together, severely disrupting the network structure. Meanwhile, clots prepared with fibrinogen concentrations higher than 1 mg/mL were stable to imposed pressure. The measured permeability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was in the range from 1 to 1000 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>There are no noticeable changes in the diffusion coefficient of thrombin and Fab IgG up to a fibrinogen concentration of 2 mg/mL and 0.4 mg/mL, respectively, indicating no diffusion retardation. However, the increase of fibrinogen concentration to 4 mg/mL reduced diffusivity of Fab IgG by 22% and diffusivity of thrombin by 13%, indicating that fibrin network structure impedes the molecular diffusion due to smaller gel pore size. Pore size between fibers was estimated from microscope images to vary from 10 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m at 0.4 mg/mL of fibrinogen to less than the microscope resolution of 0.2 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m at 4 mg/mL of fibrinogen. These estimates did not consider pores between fibrils whose dimensions were beyond the microscope resolution limit. Our results also showed that the noticeable changes of thrombin diffusivity occurred when fibrinogen exceeded 2 mg/mL.

<title>Protein Mobile Fraction</title>
<p>From our FRAP experiments we found that a small fraction of probe molecules (1% to 5%) were immobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003095-g005">Figures 5A, 5B</xref>). This suggests the importance of considering probe-fiber interaction including molecular binding and probe trapping in fibrin fiber nano-pores to understand protein transport through fibrin networks. Indeed, because fibrin polymerization occurred while probe molecules were present in the fibrinogen solution, the polymerized fibers might incorporate probe molecules. These molecules can be introduced in fibers as a solute phase, in the case of Fab IgG, or as both a solute phase and as molecules specifically bound to fibrin, in the case of thrombin. The SAXS experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Yeromonahos1">[23]</xref> revealed that depending on fibrinogen concentration, the solute phase in fibers can reach 80% with an average of 50–60%. Although gels in these experiments did not contain probe molecules, in our study, we anticipate a certain fraction of the probe proteins (non-interacting Fab IgG and possibly interacting thrombin) to be present as a solute in the fiber nano-pores. We do not expect binding of Fab IgG to the fibrin surface. However, we presume possible binding of thrombin to fibrin as demonstrated by previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Liu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Bnninger1">[21]</xref>, in which high and low affinity sites were detected.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, our results show that the molecular mobility decreases not only in the dense fibrin networks, but also in the networks prepared with low (less than 1 mg/mL) fibrinogen concentrations. Clearly, the protein binding probability should be proportional to the exposed surface of the fibrin fibers. As we found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003095-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), the fiber thickness decreases as the fibrinogen concentration increases. Thicker fibers incorporate a larger fraction of probe molecules than thin fibers, which affects the total mobile fraction. Intuitively, as the fibrin volume fraction increases with the further increase of fibrinogen concentration (greater than 2 mg/mL), probe mobility becomes suppressed due to the larger exposed fibrin surface area and smaller pore sizes of the denser network. Our findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Bnninger1">[21]</xref>, which indicated irreversible binding of thrombin to fibrin and dependence of binding affinity on fiber thickness. Thus, the presence of a small non-mobile fraction can be attributed to probe specific binding to fibrin fibers (thrombin) as well as probe trapping inside fibrin nano-pore structures (thrombin, IgG).</p>

<title>Effect of Fibrin Cap on Hemodynamics and Protein Transport</title>
<p>One of the factors determining thrombus growth is the spatial distribution of hemostatic activators such as thrombin which causes activation of platelets and fibrin polymerization. Based on our observations that stabilized thrombi are covered by fibrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Kamocka1">[2]</xref> and using our <italic>in vitro</italic> fibrin permeation and protein diffusivity measurements, we built a hemodynamics model to study the effect of the fibrin network on thrombin transport. In the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003095-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), the geometry of a small thrombus comprises a central non-permeable core of radius <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> consisting of densely packed activated platelets and a permeable fibrin network covering the thrombus core.

The porous structure of the fibrin cap permits blood flow within the cap, and therefore the transport of proteins includes both diffusion and advection.</p>

<p>To determine which mechanism drives protein transport in a thrombus and how it depends on permeability of the network and protein size we compared advective and diffusive fluxes within the fibrin cap. We calculated the flow field for a small thrombus with dimensions, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using solution for the stream function (Equations (13) and (14) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003095.s005">Text S3</xref>). We found that the variation of fibrin cap permeability from high to low values noticeably changes the flow through the cap. Highly permeable cap (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) hardly affects the flow outside the thrombus core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003095-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). As the permeability of the cap decreases down to its minimum value of 3 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the cap performs almost as a non-permeable shell restricting flow within the thrombus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003095-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>In the vicinity of the non-permeable thrombus core, the flow velocity tends to zero according to no-slip boundary conditions, which leads to the formation of a diffusion layer near the surface of the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003095-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The thickness of this diffusion-prevailing layer can be found from the balance between advective and diffusive fluxes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the thickness of the diffusion layer, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the protein concentration on the core surface, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the protein diffusivity, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the local advection velocity. In terms of the Peclet number, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, this condition means <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1, which yields the thickness of the diffusion layer profile, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> linearly depends on the protein diffusion coefficient and inversely proportional to the local advection velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which in turn, depends on the fibrin cap permeability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Equation (14) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003095.s005">Text S3</xref>). Our calculations showed that in high permeable networks the thickness of the thrombin diffusion layer was about 4% of the thrombus radius <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas for low permeable networks <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ranged from 10% to 20% of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The larger Fab IgG molecules have 2x lower diffusivity resulting in a 2x thinner diffusion profile than thrombin. This points out the importance of considering effects of protein size on diffusion retardation. The presence of multiple protein molecules inside the thrombus will result in different diffusion layer profiles and therefore, different spatial distributions of proteins inside the thrombus.</p>

<title>Effect of Fibrin Cap Permeability on Thrombus Mechanical Stability</title>
<p>To assess the effect of fibrin cap permeability on the mechanical stability of a thrombus (embolization), the stress tensor was integrated over the thrombus surface and the hydrodynamic force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> acting on the thrombus was calculated (Equation (30) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003095.s005">Text S3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003095-g007">Figure 7B</xref> shows how this force depends on the fibrin network permeability and thickness. The presence of a high permeable fibrin cap results in a force close to that acting on a thrombus core. As the fibrin volume fraction in a cap increases, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> monotonically approaches the force on a non-permeable thrombus cap.

Therefore, as the fibrin cap of the thrombus develops, enhancing the internal cohesive forces within the thrombus, the permeability of the cap decreases and the stress on the thrombus surface increase. As a result, if flow induces the thrombus to embolize, it is more likely that a thrombus with a denser fibrin network would detach from the vein surface as a whole.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper provides justification for a previously unrecognized possible mechanism limiting growth of small asymptomatic thrombi. The mechanism suggests that the fibrin network overlaying a thrombus observed in mice limits the thrombus growth by affecting the transport of proteins and by separating resting platelets in flowing blood from regions of high thrombin concentration generated by the thrombus core. Our analysis integrating experiments on protein diffusion and fluid permeation with the hemodynamic thrombus model revealed that permeability of the fibrin network and protein diffusivity are important factors affecting transport of blood proteins inside the thrombus.</p>
<p>We found that over a physiologically relevant range of fibrinogen concentrations (0.5 to 4 mg/mL) fibrin networks do not seem to form a strong diffusion barrier and that they minimally restrict the diffusion of thrombin. It was shown that the diffusivity of thrombin in the fibrin network can be hindered by 13%, whereas diffusivity of bigger molecules, Fab IgG, can be reduced by as much as 22%. We also found that the fibrin network permeability, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, decreases by three orders of magnitude when fibrinogen concentration increases from 0.5 to 4 mg/mL. This essentially reduces advective flow in thrombi. It should be noted that although FRAP permits measuring diffusivity of proteins in a biopolymer network environment, some limitations exist when studying diffusion in extracellular matrices. As was recently shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Zhou1">[26]</xref>, in cases where there is cellular accumulation and degradation of the protein diffusant, if diffusion is fast enough, overall FRAP kinetics tends to reflect the time scale of uptake and degradation rather than diffusion. These effects can be important when performing FRAP of thrombin diffusing through platelet aggregates composing a thrombus core. Thrombin binding to platelets' (GP) Ib-V-IX receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Drmann1">[27]</xref> makes the fluorescence recovery a complex function of both binding and diffusion and therefore, requires proper quantitative interpretation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Sprague1">[28]</xref>. In this case, one should consider Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Sisan1">[29]</xref> as an alternative to the FRAP method to measure molecular diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Zhou1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>The experimentally obtained metrics characterizing diffusive and advective transport inside the clot were incorporated into a thrombus hemodynamical model to run predictive simulations. We showed that the size of diffusive and advective regions strongly depends on the permeability, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, of the fibrin cap and the diffusion coefficient, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, of the protein. We demonstrated that the presence of a permeable fibrin cap limits thrombin accumulation on the thrombus surface to its downstream zone. The thrombin concentration on the upstream thrombus surface and in the region above the core are insufficient to support activation of resting platelets in flowing blood near the thrombus. In a high permeable cap, advective flow washes thrombin produced on the surface of the platelets in the thrombus core downstream, thus limiting continued growth except at the very downstream surface of the thrombus. Meanwhile, a low permeable fibrin cap impenetrable to platelets can delay platelet exposure to thrombin and, subsequently, reduce platelet activation and aggregation.</p>
<p>The structural composition of thrombi can vary depending on the vessel type (venous versus arterial), the nature of the vessel injury, and physiological and hemodynamic conditions. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Welsh1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Stalker1">[31]</xref> studied thrombus development in mouse cremaster arterioles and did not observe fibrin accumulation on the luminal thrombus surface that we see on stabilized small thrombi formed in venules. There are several differences in the injury models that might account for the reported difference in thrombus structure. Arterial thrombi form at higher shear rates and are platelet rich, while venous thrombi are fibrin rich. Additionally, the injury model reported by Stalker et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Stalker1">[31]</xref> involves vessel rupture and clot formation in the extravascular space while in the mesentery model thrombi formed in the absence of detectable bleeding. Thus, the extent of injury and exposure of blood to the internal layers of the vessel wall is different in the two injury models. In injuries in which we induce bleeding we observe rapid fibrin accumulation at the base of the thrombus, similar to what was observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Stalker1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, using thrombin-sensitive platelet binding sensor (ThS-Ab), Welsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Welsh1">[30]</xref> identified thrombin rich regions in the developing thrombus. The sensor binds CD41 on platelets and following thrombin cleavage of the ThS moiety generates a fluorophore. According to this study, the highest levels of thrombin arose between 40 and 160 seconds nearest the injury site where fibrin colocalized and where the thrombus was most mechanically stable. Low thrombin activity was detected away from the vessel wall in the thrombus and was below the minimum detection limit in the outer most, 10 micron thick, layer of the thrombus. Although thrombus composition is different in arterioles, these results are in agreement with our simulations for venous thrombi, showing that thrombin concentration decreases from the thrombus interior to its surface, down regulating thrombus growth.</p>
<p>Stalker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Stalker1">[31]</xref> and Voronov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Voronov1">[32]</xref> reported the transport of different size molecules through platelet-reach thrombi. It was shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Stalker1">[31]</xref> that greater packing density in the core facilitated contact-dependent signaling and limited entry of plasma-borne molecules visualized with fluorophores coupled to dextran and albumin. Using Lattice Boltzmann method to simulate the flow through a reconstructed thrombus and Lagrangian Scalar Tracking with Brownian motion transport to model diffusion, transport of different factors was simulated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Voronov1">[32]</xref>. Modelling was performed for an input average lumen blood velocity of 0.478 cm/s, which resulted in 0.2 mm/s mean flow rate within the thrombus outer shell. The shell was calculated to be 100-fold more permeable than the thrombus core with core permeability of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These results support our assumption that platelet core in our thrombus model can be considered impermeable relative to the fibrin cap with permeability in the range from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Voronov1">[32]</xref> the effective diffusion coefficients of FX, ADP and Ca were calculated and the averaged tortuosity, defined as the ratio of the diffusion coefficient in pure liquid phase to that in the clot, was found to be from 2 to 2.5. Meanwhile, our measurements provide the maximum achievable tortuosity corresponding to 4 mg/mL fibrinogen concentration to be around 1.14 for thrombin and 1.28 for Fab-IgG. Although these experimentally derived tortuosity values and tortuosity values calculated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Voronov1">[32]</xref> were obtained for different thrombus models and experimental conditions, it is likely the platelet clots hinder molecular diffusion to a greater extent than fibrin networks due to smaller platelet clot pore sizes. Our findings as well as results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Voronov1">[32]</xref> demonstrate that both fibrin cap and platelet-rich clots do not present a strong diffusion barrier for the relevant molecules, whereas, permeability can greatly affect protein transport in thrombi.</p>
<p>Overall, our results complement recent studies on thrombus development and emphasize the importance of spatial distributions of sites of factor activation and factor activity in regulating thrombogenesis. Our findings suggest that timely formation of a fibrin network on the surface of a developing small thrombus could limit its further growth. The proposed mechanism can prevent small blood clots from becoming large pathological thrombi creating life threatening emboli.</p>

<title>Biological background</title>
<p>Fibrin and platelets are the major components of a growing thrombus. Fibrin is formed in a thrombus when its soluble precursor protein in blood, fibrinogen, is cleaved by the enzyme thrombin and polymerizes to form a fibrin gel. Fibrin(ogen) mediates platelet adhesion by linking adjacent activated platelets and forms a network providing structural stability. Platelets are cell fragments present in blood that bind to sites of vessel injury. Upon binding to the injury site, platelets can be activated, resulting in dramatic shape changes and the release of prothrombotic factors. Activated platelets support coagulation reactions that generate thrombin to activate additional platelets and convert fibrinogen to fibrin. These activities suggest that the prothrombotic activity on the thrombus surface promotes continued growth by generating fibrin and incorporating and activating new platelets. It is not clear what processes disrupt this positive feedback mechanism and prevent thrombi from growing indefinitely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Diamond3">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Mann1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our previously developed multiscale model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003095-Xu1">[4]</xref> of thrombus formation included molecular signaling considerations (platelet activation), biochemical reactions (the coagulation and anticoagulation pathways) and blood flow (hemodynamic effects). The model not only described how the thrombus developed in time but also included spatial considerations. The model predicted that platelets flowing in blood initially aggregated at the injury site, were activated by agonists and supported coagulation reactions that generated thrombin. Thrombin is not only a potent platelet activator, but also catalyzes the formation of fibrin. The model supported our experimental observations that after the formation of an activated platelet core, a fibrin network would form on the thrombus surface. It suggested that the fibrin cap forming on the thrombus surface might limit its growth by interfering with the transport of thrombin. Thus, the model integrated intracellular signaling events, a network of biochemical reactions and hemodynamic considerations to suggest a novel mechanism that might limit thrombus growth.</p>

Polymerization was initiated by adding thrombin (1 U/mL final), the solution was rapidly pipeted 7–8 times and injected into glass microchannels (VitroCom, NJ) of rectangular cross sections (200 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>×2 mm, 3 cm long, wall thickness 20 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

<title>Clot permeability measurements</title>
<p>To measure permeability, clots were prepared in transparent plastic tubes and glass capillaries having internal diameter of 1.5 mm and 1 mm, respectively. The length of plastic tubes was 2 cm and the length of glass capillaries varied from 1 cm to 1.9 cm. Distilled water was perfused hydrostatically by gravity through the tube. The flow rate was determined by measuring the mass of outflow liquid with scales (Acculab, ALC-320.3, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.001 g) at different times for three different pressure drops. The pressure drop across the gel was measured using a pressure transducer as well as by liquid column height measurements. Permeability was determined from Darcy's equation as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the length of the cylindrical clot, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is liquid viscosity, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the pressure drop across the clot.</p>

<p>Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to measure thrombin and Fab IgG hydrodynamic diameters. In DLS, Brownian motion is measured and related to the size of the particles through the Stokes-Einstein equation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the Boltzmann's constant, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the temperature, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the dynamic viscosity, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003095.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the diffusion coefficient. Since most molecules are not spherical, the hydrodynamic diameter is determined as the diameter of a sphere that has the same translational diffusion speed as the molecule. Measurements were performed at 30°C in three series of 15 measurements for each sample of thrombin and Fab IgG solutions. Zetasizer Nano S90 with Zetasizer software was used for DLS data collection and analysis.</p>

<p>FRAP measurements and fibrin network imaging were performed using laser confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 510 Meta with 20×, 63×, and 100× objectives (20/0.4, 63x/1.4 Oil DICIII, and 100x/1.4 Oil DICIII). The sample ROI was bleached using 720 nm laser line (Multiphoton Coherent Chameleon XR tunable pulsed laser, 705–980 nm, maximum power 1 W). The bleaching was performed in circular ROIs at typical laser output power of 25–50 mW. For monitoring a recovery signal from labeled thrombin and Fab Igg, the sample was illuminated using the 514 nm laser line from an Argon-ion laser. The emitted fluorescence was detected after passing through 544–608 nm band pass filter. For acquisition of fibrin network images, the pinhole size was adjusted to 1 Airy unit and a 561 nm laser line (DPSS561-10) with 544–608 nm band pass filter were used. The output laser power during image acquisition ranged from 0.1 to 0.15 mW. Details of FRAP method are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003095.s003">Text S1</xref>.</p>
