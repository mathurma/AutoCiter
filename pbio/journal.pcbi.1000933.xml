<p>The <italic>var</italic> gene encoded hyper-variable <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family mediates cytoadhesion of infected erythrocytes to human endothelium. Antibodies blocking cytoadhesion are important mediators of malaria immunity acquired by endemic populations. The development of a PfEMP1 based vaccine mimicking natural acquired immunity depends on a thorough understanding of the evolved PfEMP1 diversity, balancing antigenic variation against conserved receptor binding affinities. This study redefines and reclassifies the domains of PfEMP1 from seven genomes. Analysis of domains in 399 different PfEMP1 sequences allowed identification of several novel domain classes, and a high degree of PfEMP1 domain compositional order, including conserved domain cassettes not always associated with the established group A–E division of PfEMP1. A novel iterative homology block (HB) detection method was applied, allowing identification of 628 conserved minimal PfEMP1 building blocks, describing on average 83% of a PfEMP1 sequence. Using the HBs, similarities between domain classes were determined, and Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain subclasses were found in many cases to be hybrids of major domain classes. Related to this, a recombination hotspot was uncovered between DBL subdomains S2 and S3. The VarDom server is introduced, from which information on domain classes and homology blocks can be retrieved, and new sequences can be classified. Several conserved sequence elements were found, including: (1) residues conserved in all DBL domains predicted to interact and hold together the three DBL subdomains, (2) potential integrin binding sites in DBLα domains, (3) an acylation motif conserved in group A <italic>var</italic> genes suggesting N-terminal N-myristoylation, (4) PfEMP1 inter-domain regions proposed to be elastic disordered structures, and (5) several conserved predicted phosphorylation sites. Ideally, this comprehensive categorization of PfEMP1 will provide a platform for future studies on <italic>var</italic>/PfEMP1 expression and function.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>About one million African children die from malaria every year. The severity of malaria infections in part depends on which type of the parasitic protein PfEMP1 is expressed on the surface of the infected red blood cells. Natural immunity to malaria is mediated through antibodies to PfEMP1. Therefore hopes for a malaria vaccine based on PfEMP1 proteins have been raised. However, the large sequence variation among PfEMP1 molecules has caused great difficulties in executing and interpreting studies on PfEMP1. Here, we present an extensive sequence analysis of all currently available PfEMP1 sequences and show that PfEMP1 variation is ordered and can be categorized at different levels. In this way, PfEMP1 belong to group A–E and are composed of up to four components, each component containing specific DBL or CIDR domain subclasses, which in some cases form entire conserved domain combinations. Finally, each PfEMP1 can be described in high detail as a combination of 628 homology blocks. This dissection of PfEMP1 diversity also enables predictions of several functional sequence motifs relevant to the fold of PfEMP1 proteins and their ability to bind human receptors. We therefore believe that this description of PfEMP1 diversity is necessary and helpful for the design and interpretation of future PfEMP1 studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) mediates adhesion of infected erythrocytes (IE) to various host cells on the vascular lining, during the blood stage of malaria infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Baruch1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Su1">[2]</xref>. Naturally acquired protective antibodies in malaria-exposed individuals target PfEMP1, suggesting it is possible to develop PfEMP1 based vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Staalsoe1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Magistrado1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>The majority of the parasite's ∼60 PfEMP1-encoding <italic>var</italic> genes are situated in subtelomeric regions close to other variant antigen-encoding genes such as the <italic>rif</italic> and <italic>stevor</italic> gene families, while the remaining ∼40% are found centrally in the chromosomes. Based on sequence similarity, <italic>var</italic> 5′ UTR sequences can be divided into upstream sequence (UPS) classes A, B, C or E. These UPS classes correlate with chromosomal position of the genes, as well as domain complexity of the encoded PfEMP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Lavstsen1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Kraemer1">[11]</xref>. Subtelomeric UPSA and UPSB genes are oriented tail to tail (3′ to 3′), while central UPSC genes are oriented head to tail in a tandem repeat manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Gardner1">[12]</xref>, which has lead to the definition of group A, B and C <italic>var</italic>/PfEMP1, and two intermediate groups B/A and B/C, that contain <italic>var</italic>/PfEMP1 with chromosomal position or domain composition different from that predicted from their UPS class. The hyper-variable <italic>var</italic> gene repertoire is to a large extent generated by frequent meiotic ectopic recombination in the mosquito abdomen, probably facilitated by alignment of <italic>var</italic> genes in the nuclear periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Taylor1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-FreitasJunior1">[14]</xref>. There is also evidence suggesting that mitotic recombination occur, and that this allows further diversification of the <italic>var</italic> gene repertoire during human infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Duffy1">[15]</xref>. Comparison of the clones 3D7, IT4 and HB3 revealed only two <italic>var</italic> genes, <italic>var1</italic> and <italic>var2csa</italic>, that were conserved in all three genomes, and a semi-conserved gene, <italic>var3</italic>, found in IT4 and 3D7. The three conserved <italic>var</italic> genes are more than 75% identical over multiple domains, whereas most other PfEMP1 (even proteins with the same domain architecture) display less than 50% amino acid sequence identity between individual domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Kraemer2">[16]</xref>. <italic>Var2csa</italic> is particularly unique as it has a unique UPSE, encodes unique Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains, as well as a distinct acidic terminal segment (ATS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Salanti2">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus, parasite genomes appear to harbor essentially similar <italic>var</italic> repertoires, each reflecting the worldwide <italic>var</italic> diversity that has ensured the optimal survival of the parasite population. The clinical significance of the described <italic>var</italic> groups has been demonstrated in several studies, and indicates the existence of underlying functional differences in adhesion characteristics of the expressed PfEMP1 variants. This relationship is best illustrated by the malaria syndrome occurring in pregnant women, which is precipitated by the accumulation, in the placenta, of parasites expressing VAR2CSA that mediates binding to proteoglycans on syncytiotrophoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Salanti2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Fried2">[21]</xref>. Several lines of evidence indicate that the relatively rapid development of immunity to severe childhood malaria is mediated through antibodies directed against a restricted semi-conserved subset of parasite antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Marsh2">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Gupta1">[23]</xref> that are associated with the development of severe disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Bull1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Nielsen1">[25]</xref>. In particular group A and to some extent group B <italic>var</italic> genes have been linked to disease severity in studies of expression of these variants in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Bian1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Warimwe1">[33]</xref>. A recent study has corroborated these findings and qualified which group A and B PfEMP1 variants may be associated with severe malaria disease, by demonstrating a sequential and ordered acquisition of antibodies to PfEMP1 domains in Tanzanian plasma donors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Cham1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast to pregnancy malaria, it is still unclear which human receptor binding, if any particular, is linked to severe forms of childhood malaria. Parasite adhesion has been demonstrated to endothelial cells, immune system cells, uninfected erythrocytes and platelets. Several human cell receptors, including the extensively studied CD36 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), have been implicated in adhesion, although no consensus on association between receptor binding and severe malaria has been reached (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Rowe1">[35]</xref>). PfEMP1 is responsible for parasite adhesion, as several single domains of the large multi-domain PfEMP1 molecules have been shown to bind human receptors. From N- to C-terminal, PfEMP1 has previously been described as composed of an N-terminal segment (NTS), Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains, Cys rich inter-domain regions (CIDR), C2 domains, one transmembrane region (TM) and the acidic terminal segment (ATS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Six major classes of DBL domains have been proposed based on amino acid sequence similarity: DBLα, β, γ, δ, ζ, and ε. DBL domains have been further characterized by definition of 10 semi-conserved homology blocks (HBa-j) interspersed by hyper-variable regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>, and by definition of three structural subdomains (S1–3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Higgins1">[37]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). It has been shown that various DBLβ domains have affinity for ICAM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Oleinikov1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith2">[40]</xref>, whereas DBLδ adheres to platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) and DBLα has been associated with binding to heparin sulfate (HS), blood group A antigen and complement receptor 1 (CR1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Chen1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Rowe2">[42]</xref>. CR1 binding is associated with IE adhesion to uninfected erythrocytes, a phenomenon known as rosetting, which appears to be mediated to some degree by group A PfEMP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Rowe2">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-ViganWomas1">[44]</xref>.</p>

<p>CIDR domains have been divided into three classes: CIDRα, β, and γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Su1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Lavstsen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Kraemer2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>, and described as consisting of three regions, those being the minimal CD36 binding region denoted M2, flanked by less conserved M1 and M3 regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Baruch3">[45]</xref>. Several CIDRα class domains have been found to mediate binding to the human CD36 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Baruch1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Baruch3">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Gamain1">[46]</xref>, however, such binding is limited to group B and C PfEMP1, indicating that group A variants have a distinct function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Robinson1">[47]</xref>. Furthermore, CIDRα domains have been found to bind immunoglobulin M and PECAM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Chen1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although it is evident that the organization of PfEMP1 sequence diversity is of relevance for malaria pathogenicity, the vast sequence variation of the protein family continues to impede experimental procedures and interpretations. In order to better understand and determine the potential targets for a PfEMP1-based vaccine against severe malaria, it is therefore essential to establish a rigorous classification and solid reference frame of PfEMP1 diversity.</p>
<p>In this work, PfEMP1 repertoires from seven genomes are annotated with updated domain boundary definitions. The data includes four thoroughly sequenced <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genomes that have not previously been classified: DD2 from Indochina (9.55× coverage), RAJ116 from India (7.3× coverage), IGH-CR14 from India (10.19× coverage), and the Ghanaian isolate PFCLIN (8× coverage). Domain architectures of 399 PfEMP1 are aligned, revealing conserved domain architectural features. The homology block concept, first described by Smith <italic>et al.</italic> (2000) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>, is extended from DBL domains to the entire PfEMP1 by application of a novel iterative homology search technique, defining 628 homology blocks covering on average 83% of any PfEMP1 with only 4% self-overlap. The homology blocks describe relations between sequences in finer detail than domains, revealing that domain subclasses often consist of fragments from different domain super-classes, probably as a result of extensive recombination. Evidence for a recombination hotspot is also found. The definition of conserved blocks in PfEMP1 allows identification of conserved functional elements, such as predicted sites for post-translational modifications, which may significantly affect both substrate binding and immune evasion.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<p>The <italic>var</italic> gene sequence analysis was based on two different bioinformatics approaches. First, phylogenetic trees were constructed using re-assessed PfEMP1 domain borders, with the aim of reclassifying and annotating the main PfEMP1 features UPS, NTS, DBL, CIDR and ATS. Secondly, a novel iterative homology detection method, defining a set of homology blocks, was used to describe domain similarities and to guide <italic>var</italic> gene recombination site and functional predictions.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Grouping and componential composition of PfEMP1</title>
<p>In total 399 PfEMP1 sequences were annotated and their domains aligned. The alignments confirmed what recent studies of the DBL fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Klein1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Singh1">[49]</xref> and binding affinities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Oleinikov1">[38]</xref> have implied; that the domain borders, by which PfEMP1 domain subclasses have been classified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>, needed revision. The redefined domain borders introduced by this study are specified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s012">Text S1</xref>, and lead to two fundamental nomenclature changes: omitting the term “C2” from DBLβ domains, as also suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Howell1">[39]</xref>; and the separation of M3 sequences from CIDR domains. Distance tree analysis of all DBL domains confirmed the expected phylogenetic grouping of DBL into six major classes (DBLα, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ), as well as five smaller distinct classes (the four N-terminal DBL domains of VAR2CSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Lavstsen1">[10]</xref>, and the DBLα of VAR3 which grouped in a separate cluster between DBLα and DBLζ). Five major CIDR domain classes were defined: CIDRα, β, γ, δ, and pam (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s002">Figure S1</xref>). The CIDRδ class has not previously been identified, probably due to the difference in sequence depth between this and previous CIDR classification (655 vs. 36) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>. The inter-domain 2 (ID2) of VAR2CSA is partially homologous to CIDR domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Andersen1">[50]</xref>, and was therefore included here as CIDRpam, although particularly different from other CIDR domains. NTS sequences were divided into three classes, NTSA, NTSB, and NTSpam (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s003">Figure S2L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s004">Figure S3Y</xref>), while ATS sequences were divided into ATSA, ATSB, ATSpam, ATSvar1, and ATSvar3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s003">Figure S2M</xref>).</p>
<p>The 5′ upstream sequences of <italic>var</italic> genes were analyzed by two different methods: Markov clustering (MCL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-VanDongen1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-VanDongen2">[53]</xref>, and neighbor joining (NJ) clustering (based on multiple sequence alignments). The two analyses yielded congruent trees, although additional subclusters could be identified in the NJ tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s003">Figure S2N and O</xref>). All previously suggested UPS subgroups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Kraemer2">[16]</xref> (UPSA1–2, UPSB1–4, UPSC1–2 and UPSE) could be identified, although with some modifications and four additional subgroups (UPSA3 and UPSB5–7).</p>
<p>Although the number of available <italic>var</italic> sequences varied between the seven studied genomes (39 to 63), the genomes contained similar <italic>var</italic> UPS distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and as expected, UPSE flanked <italic>var2csa</italic>, NTSA and ATSA were exclusively encoded by UPSA flanked genes, whereas other NTS and ATS classes were found in UPSB and C flanked genes. The general observation that UPSA and UPSB genes are located head to head in the telomeres was also confirmed (data not shown), although only limited information on chromosomal location was available. Based on domain annotation of the extracellular part of PfEMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4</xref>), these could be described as consisting of four components: component 1 (present in ∼95% of all PfEMP1) containing the N-terminal NTS-DBLα-CIDR domains, component 2 (present in ∼43% of all PfEMP1) containing one to three DBLβ and DBLγ domains, component 3 (present in ∼80% of all PfEMP1) containing DBLδ-CIDRβ/γ domains, and component 4 containing C-terminal domain combinations of DBLζ and DBLε domains (present in ∼28% of all PfEMP1) or single DBLβ or DBLγ domains (present in ∼8% of all PfEMP1). The complexity of domain structure followed the UPS classification, in agreement with established group A, B and C PfEMP1 nomenclature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Lavstsen1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Kraemer1">[11]</xref>. There was an overrepresentation of component 2 encoding genes in group A compared to group B or C <italic>var</italic> (p&lt;0.0001; X<sup>2</sup> test of component 2 prevalence in group A–C), and component 4 was found in both group A and B but rarely C.</p>
<p>PfEMP1 inter-domain (ID) sequences were also aligned and classified. Most ID sequences were found to flank component 3, and characteristic for these sequences were long Pro-rich stretches, charged polyAsp/Glu stretches, and an amino acid composition biased towards Ala, Asp, Glu, Pro, Lys, and Val. The sequences downstream of component 3 could be classified, and were either of a M3A type if flanked by component 4, or M3AB if flanked by TM-ATS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s004">Figure S3Z</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4</xref>). Due to less functional constraints, ID sequences may have more relaxed requirements to the position of recombination break points, compared to within domains.

<title>Inter-domain elasticity</title>
<p>The function of the ID sequences is unknown, although one possibility is that these regions confer elasticity to the PfEMP1 proteins, as suggested for similar sequence in the PEVK region of the human striated muscle protein titin (also known as connectin). The PEVK region of titin contains several PPAK domains, a 26–28 residue repeat consisting of low-complexity sequence biased towards Pro, Ala, Val, Lys, and Glu, and these domains are interspersed by polyGlu regions. The PEVK region length is correlated with elongation ability of sarcomeres in striated muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Labeit1">[54]</xref>, and the secondary structure has been found to be disordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Duan1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>The PfEMP1 ID regions are found in lengths up to ∼200 residues, and the amino acid composition is very similar to the one found in titin PEVK. Hits to the Pfam PPAK domain definition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Finn1">[56]</xref> in four PfEMP1 supports the sequence similarity (E&lt;0.1 in DD2var52, IT4var64, HB3var34 and PFCLINvar47). The acidic and basic residues can potentially form random structures based on polar interactions, mixed with Pro which introduces kinks in the protein backbone, together forming a structure with spring-like properties. Elasticity could enhance the ability of infected erythrocytes to adhere to endothelial cells by providing a smooth deceleration, as well as extend the time given to establish strong molecular interactions with targets. It is likely that the variant disordered structure of the inter-domain regions impede antibody targeting.</p>

<title>PfEMP1 groups contain specific subclasses of DBL and CIDR domains</title>
<p>The redefinition of domain borders, and the large increase in sequence data, called for a detailed subclassification of PfEMP1 domains. This was done by a distance tree analysis described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s012">Text S1</xref>, summarized for DBL and CIDR domains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g002">Figure 2</xref>. The sequence diversity of the major DBL and CIDR domain classes differed both with respect to homogeneity (i.e. shared AA %-identity), and the degree to which subclasses could be distinguished. The previously observed division of DBLα into DBLα1 and DBLα0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Lavstsen1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Kraemer1">[11]</xref> was confirmed, however a third distinct class of sequences, DBLα2, was also identified. Sequences of DBLα1 grouped relatively evenly into eight subclasses, including the particularly distinct DBLα1.3 of VAR3 (note description of nomenclature usage in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s012">Text S1</xref>), whereas the DBLα0 sequences spread more unevenly into 24 subclasses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s003">Figure S2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s004">Figure S3I–K</xref>). The homology block analysis of VAR3 (described in the homology block section below) revealed that the N-terminal part of DBLα1.3 is similar to other DBLα domains, but interestingly, the C-terminal half of the domain is essentially a DBLζ3 domain. All DBLε and DBLζ domains grouped evenly into distinct subclasses, while DBLβ and DBLγ domains were divided into less distinct subclasses of varying sizes, and most (∼90%) of DBLδ sequences could not be subclassified. The homogeneity of the six major classes differed with DBLβ domains being the most (45%) and DBLε the least (31%) homogenous classes. In particular subclasses DBLε1/2/11/13 were distinctively different from the majority of DBLε domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s003">Figure S2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s004">Figure S3N–Q</xref>). Similar to DBL domains, the level of subclassification of major CIDR domain types varied. Most members of CIDRα3.1 and CIDRβ subclasses could not be separated, whereas other CIDR domains grouped in evenly sized subclasses. The homogeneity of CIDR classes varied with CIDRα1 and CIDRδ domains exhibiting higher sequence similarities than the other CIDR classes. Sequence conservation logos for all large CIDR classes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s004">Figure S3A–H</xref>.</p>

<p>Annotation of the PfEMP1 using detailed DBL and CIDR subclassification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4</xref>) showed that most classes could be linked to a specific UPS class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g002">Figure 2</xref>). When domain classes were found frequently in genes of more than one group, they were most often shared between group A and B or group B and C, but rarely A and C. These observations support the validity of the subclassification, and the notion that group A–C <italic>var</italic> genes predominantly recombine separately.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the phylogenetic domain analysis allowed classification of all PfEMP1 domains, and defined several novel domain classes. In addition, PfEMP1 domain variation was described in an unprecedented level of detail, by the allocation of the DBL and CIDR domains into subclasses. This classification is based on domain similarities averaged over the whole domains, opposed to local similarities which may vary across the length of the domains, as described in the homology block analysis below. The validity of the classification must be experimentally tested, but the association between domain and UPS class suggests, that at least some of the domain subclasses confer specialized cytoadhesion properties.</p>

<title>Identification of conserved PfEMP1 domain cassettes</title>
<p>Conserved domain compositional features in PfEMP1 molecules were studied in alignments of annotated PfEMP1 sequences.

<title>Overview of distinct PfEMP1 domain cassettes.</title>
<p>A PfEMP1 domain cassette was defined as a <italic>var</italic> gene sequence encoding two or more DBL or CIDR domains with subclasses that could be predicted from each other. In a few cases domain cassettes (filled frames) could be expanded with additional domains but in limited number of genes or genomes (punctured frames). A cassette was given an association score calculated as the average of all domain pair associations of a domain cassette. Each domain pair association (A–B) was calculated by dividing the number of times the domain combination was observed in the dataset by the least number of times either A or B was found in the dataset. The association score does not include the UPS association. Associated UPS classes are colored according to the UPS class most often observed flanking the cassette. Less frequent flanking UPS classes are in brackets. The number of times a given domain cassette was observed (count) and the number of genomes in which it is present (genomes) within the seven genomes, 3D7, HB3, DD2, IT4, IGH, RAJ116 and PFCLIN are given. The frame number in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4</xref>, detailing the genetic context of the domain cassette is also given.</p>

<p>The three conserved <italic>var</italic> genes <italic>var1</italic>, <italic>var2csa</italic> and <italic>var3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g003">Figure 3</xref>, cassettes 1–3), all encoding unique DBL domains, were present in all seven <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genomes, except <italic>var3</italic> which was not present in HB3 and IGH. As previously reported, fragments of <italic>var1</italic> and <italic>var2csa</italic>, but not <italic>var3</italic>, were found in <italic>P. reichenowi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Trimnell1">[57]</xref>. Some variation in domain composition was observed within the three conserved gene families. Thus, in RAJ116, <italic>var2csa</italic> encoded an extra C-terminal DBLε domain, and in DD2, the <italic>var1</italic> gene encoded C-terminal domains different from the other <italic>var1</italic> genes. <italic>Var1</italic> of 3D7 and IT4 appeared to lack an exon2 sequence, whereas five <italic>var1</italic> genes had a premature stop codon at similar positions in their exon2. Domain pairs characteristic for <italic>var1</italic> (DBLγ1/15-DBLε1 and DBLζ1/2-DBLε) were found in other group A <italic>var</italic> genes (IT4var9, IGHvar32, DD2var23 and HB3var06). Taken together, this indicates that <italic>var1</italic> often is found as truncated gene, and that the particular functional properties of VAR1 may have moved to other PfEMP1 variants. Similarly, a VAR3 sequence corresponding to 80% of the exon1 as well as exon2 was found in the 3′ end of RAJ116var03, consistent with how DBLζ and DBLε domains are positioned in other PfEMP1. The domain composition variation within the three most conserved <italic>var</italic> genes highlight the importance of ectopic recombination of large single or multi domain elements for the generation of PfEMP1 diversity.</p>
<p>Among the novel domain composition phenomena, domain cassette 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g003">Figure 3</xref>) was the most prominent. This four domain C-terminal cassette was found exclusively in ten group A PfEMP1, and in six of the seven <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genomes as well as in <italic>P. reichenowi.</italic></p>
<p>Interestingly, nearly all DBLζ and DBLε domains were found in C-terminal domain cassettes (domain cassettes 1,3,6,7 and 9–12) and often occurred in genes encoding CIDRγ1/2/9 domains (approx. three of four CIDRγ1/2/9 domains flank DBLζ and DBLε domains). The unambiguous partition of DBLε subclasses and the positional and compositional similarities between different DBLε, could suggest that specialized functions reside in these structures.</p>
<p>In the PfEMP1 N-terminal, DBLα subclasses correlated well with the subclasses of their neighboring CIDR domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4B</xref>). As expected, all group A PfEMP1 except VAR3 exclusively contained the domains DBLα1-CIDRα1/β2/δ/γ3, but furthermore, group A PfEMP1 appeared to be divided into those harboring either DBLα1.5/6/8-CIDRβ2/γ3/δ (includes cassettes 11 and 16 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4</xref>, frame 15) or DBLα1-CIDRα1. Within group B and C PfEMP1 two major groups were observed, those encoding DBLα0 domains associated with CIDRα2, and those encoding DBLα0 domains associated with CIDRα3. In addition, eight distinct CIDRα containing cassettes were found, including domain cassette 8 which is particularly noteworthy, as it is associated with UPSB2 (7 of 12 domain cassette 8 encoding genes are flanked by 7 of 11 UPSB2) and contains DBLα2, which formed a separate cluster from DBLα0 and α1 in the DBLα tree. Domain cassette 8 may be expanded further in a less well defined form with two domains (DBLβ12-DBLγ4 or DBLγ6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4A</xref>, frame 10).</p>
<p>Several more elusive domain architectural constraints were observed, which may crystallize into domain cassettes if higher sequence depth is acquired. These included the group A specific domain combinations DBLα1.4-CIDRα1.6/7-DBLβ3, which both could represent the core of what have been proposed as VAR4 (represented by PFD1235w; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4A</xref>, frame 9) as well as DBLβ7-DBLγ-DBLγ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4A</xref>, frame 9).</p>
<p>The present description of PfEMP1 diversity was based on analysis of seven near complete genome sequences: four Asian, two African <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Mu1">[58]</xref>, and one Central American isolate. None of the described domain architectural constraints were found exclusively in the African or Asian isolates, which strongly imply that there is no basic difference between the PfEMP1 repertoires of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> around the world. However, more <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome sequences are desirable to gain a better resolution of conserved domain cassettes.</p>
<p>In general there were no correlation between occurrences of N-terminal and C-terminal domain cassettes, and whereas group A PfEMP1 shared no N-terminal domain cassettes with group B or C PfEMP1, C-terminal domain cassettes were more often shared among PfEMP1 groups. The three conserved <italic>var</italic> genes have already attracted warranted attention, but while the binding specificity of VAR2CSA and its relevance in pregnancy malaria is well established, no function or clinical importance has been assigned to VAR1 and VAR3. Several studies have aimed to define the PfEMP1 molecular background for severe malaria in children. Most <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Kaestli1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Rottmann1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Kyriacou1">[31]</xref> have relied on relating phenotypic or clinical data to the phylogeny of partial DBLα tags amplified from parasite cDNA, or direct quantitative PCR measurements of group A, B and C <italic>var</italic> genes. Although these approaches target some of the best conserved PfEMP1 phenomena, both methods disregard the structures unlinked to the PfEMP1 N-terminal, and fail to reflect some of the most evident of the conserved N-terminal domain cassettes. Nevertheless, the consensus drawn from these studies and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of model parasite lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Jensen1">[28]</xref> emphasize the importance of group A PfEMP1 in severe malaria, and interestingly, often the particularly distinct group A domain cassette 5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Magistrado1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Jensen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Cham1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although several of the domain classes and PfEMP1 structural constraints presented here are vaguely defined and by themselves difficult to rank according to clinical relevance, the PfEMP1 diversity described by groups, components, domain classes and cassettes offers an operational model for design and interpretations of future experimental studies.</p>

<title>PfEMP1 homology blocks</title>
<p>DBL domains consist of hyper-variable and conserved regions, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Su1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Dahlback1">[59]</xref>, and in a comparison of DBL similarity, Smith <italic>et al.</italic> (2000) were able to define a set of ten homology blocks with an average length of 21 amino acids, conserved in all DBL domain classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>. To describe in detail these frequent shifts in conservation level across PfEMP1, an iterative method was developed that automatically defines a set of homology blocks in a set of unaligned protein sequences. The method is especially appropriate for the frequently recombining <italic>var</italic> genes, as the short homology blocks are less inclined to group unrelated sequences which may be forced together in longer domain alignments.</p>
<p>The term homology block (HB) refers to a sequence profile defined from a multiple sequence alignment, here described by a hidden Markov model (HMM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Durbin1">[60]</xref>. Sequences with similarity above a threshold to the sequence profile are termed members, hits or occurrences of the homology block, and the members of a homology block can be defined in a sequence by searching with the HMM.</p>
<p>Starting from a full sequence database, homology blocks were one after one first defined and then excluded from the database. Each homology block was defined to be the sequence profile with the highest number of occurrences in the database, i.e. the most conserved sequence, with boundaries optimized to match this criterion. Sequence similarity was assessed with HMM log-odds scores, and a significance threshold of S≥9.97 bits was used for all homology blocks, to ensure that each member of a homology block was at least 1000 times more likely to be related to the sequence profile, than to a random sequence with amino acid frequencies as in the database. Thus, a set of homology blocks was defined, where each homology block comprises all related sequence stretches in the database. The method is described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s013">Text S2</xref>.</p>
<p>The analysis was performed on a database with 311 PfEMP1 sequences containing information on the entire molecule or a full exon1. Twenty DBL containing paralogs were also included to enable estimates of evolutionary relationships. The minimal length of the homology blocks was set to seven amino acids, as this is approximately the length required to reach the sequence similarity significance threshold. Sequences with less than five homologs in the database were not included in the homology block set, since PfEMP1 from more than seven <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genomes were in the dataset, and the main interest was to determine sequence features conserved in most of these genomes.</p>
<p>Characteristics for the resulting 628 homology blocks are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g004">Figure 4</xref>. On average 83.5% of a PfEMP1 sequence was described by homology blocks, and the remaining fragments were either shorter than seven residues, or had fewer than five homologous sequences. Overlap between homology blocks were mainly concentrated in areas with low complexity sequence, such as the inter-domain regions, and amounted to an average of 4.2% of HB occurrences in a PfEMP1 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The most frequent HB length was 10 residues, while the average was 19 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). HB average sequence identity was between 19–100%, and as might be expected for the shortest sequences, only similarities with high identity could be detected within the significance threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The analyzed PfEMP1 sequences contained 311 NTS, 199 ATS, 1043 DBL and 552 CIDR domains, while the paralogs contained 30 DBL domains. One homology block occurred 1605 times in the database and was found in all DBL and CIDR domains, except 20 (not present in DBLpam2, DBLε7 and DBLε12), while four other blocks were found in all DBL domains and six blocks were strongly correlated with CIDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The homology blocks were numbered according to their frequency in the database, with the most frequent being HB number one.</p>

<p>88 PfEMP1 were not in the HB definition sequence set, and when the 628 defined homology blocks were predicted in these proteins, 82.5% (SD ±4.9%) of each PfEMP1 were on average covered by HBs, similar to the coverage in the definition sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), showing that the homology blocks describe universal PfEMP1 sequence features.</p>

The conserved side of HB1 faced HB2, which was found to be the most conserved sequence in DBL domains, with a mean amino acid sequence identity of 56%. HB2 was part of a longer helical structure and interfacing with HB1, HB3 from the other helix bundle, and HB4 which formed the non-surface exposed part of S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g005">Figure 5B and C</xref>). All these interactions probably constitute the main selection pressure, keeping HB2 relatively conserved. HB3 in S2 corresponded to HB2 in S3, with interactions to HB2, HB5 and HB4, and with mean sequence identity of 47% it was found to be the second most conserved part of DBL domains. HB5 was mainly conserved on one side of the helix like HB1, suggesting for both that they may be frequently exposed on the surface of PfEMP1.</p>

<p>Side chains in conserved amino acid positions were mainly directed towards other conserved parts, although some were pointing outwards probably to interact with other less conserved domain parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g005">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Functions for some of the conserved amino acids in HB1–5 were identical in both structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g005">Figure 5A and D</xref>), where they formed polar and hydrophobic interactions between the three subdomains. Besides from the conserved polar interactions shown, the conserved Pro on position 4 in HB4, which introduced a kink in the β-sheet structure of S1, was in a position allowing it to interact hydrophobically with the also conserved Trp on position 8 in HB2. It may thus contribute to hold the β-sheet in place. In general the conserved positions of HB1–5 described a set of residues, which in the known DBL domain structures interact to hold together the three DBL subdomains, so they can be said to constitute the conserved core structures and interactions of DBL domains.</p>
<p>HB1–5 were found among the 10 homology blocks defined by Smith <italic>et al.</italic> (2000) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>, where HB4 = HBb, HB3 = HBd, HB5 = HBf, HB2 = HBh and HB1 = HBj. The remaining homology blocks, defined in that paper, were not found to be conserved in all DBL classes, based on the chosen similarity significance threshold.</p>
<p>Homology blocks specific for all CIDR domains were also found, and they were present in the most conserved part of CIDR, the designated minimal CD36 binding region or M2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Baruch3">[45]</xref>, for which the structure is known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Klein1">[48]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g005">Figure 5E and F</xref>). HB8, HB1 and HB10 were found to correspond to helix 1, 2 and 3 respectively in the three-helix bundle, and the similarity of this bundle to subdomain 3 of DBL was confirmed by the presence of HB1 in all CIDR and DBL domains. The conservation of these three helices suggests that this structure is common to all CIDR domains. Interestingly, four HBs (HB12, 7, 9 and 6) situated in subdomain S3 of DBLα and DBLδ domains, were exclusively found flanking all CIDR domains, strongly supporting the link between CIDR and DBL domains.</p>
<p>Side chains of conserved residues in HB1, 8 and 10 were mainly directed towards the center of the CIDR three-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), where they interacted to keep the structure together. Some parts of the structure have not been solved, including the C-terminal end of HB8 with several conserved basic residues and a Cys likely to form a disulfide bridge to position 1 in HB1. A few conserved residues in HB8 were directed away from the helix bundle core. Among these were the basic position 24 and possibly also 28 as the distance fits with a helix turn. These residues may thus be involved in interactions with surrounding parts of the PfEMP1 such as the helix-loop of CIDR, or even substrate binding, and they may be target for the cross-reactive antibodies inhibiting CD36 binding described by Mo <italic>et al.</italic> (2008) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Mo1">[63]</xref>.</p>

<title>Alignment of DBL homology blocks</title>
<p>Just as PfEMP1 can be represented as strings of amino acid symbols or strings of domain names, they can be represented at an intermediate level as a string of homology blocks. To study similarities between DBL domains, the homology block sequences of 1043 DBL domains, consisting of 378 different HBs, were studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Occurrences of the same homology block were vertically aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>, center), and rows in the alignment were sorted according to a NJ-tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>, left) built based on differences in HB composition of the DBL sequences. The five core homology blocks divides DBL domains into six regions, and sequence conservation logos are shown for representative homology blocks in each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>, top and bottom).</p>

<p>Many of the domain classes derived from trees based on amino acid alignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s003">Figure S2</xref>), were also found by the tree based purely on the absence or presence of homology blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and these groups can thus be described by a specific homology block combination. Most major classes formed monophyletic groups, with the exception of DBLγ and DBLε, which formed one big cluster with several well-defined subgroups. Minor subgroups were mainly found in DBLζ, γ and ε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>, tree group a–u), and many correlated well with domain classes based on amino acid alignments. Most subgroups of DBLα, β, and δ were too subtle to be distinguished. The DBLα0-DBLα1 division was not clearly found, although HB36 may approximately describe the difference, by being present in 205 of 230 DBLα0 domains, and in none of the 61 DBLα1. HB36 was absent in all cys2 sequences but present in all cys4 sequences, thus describing the division between group 1–3 and 4–6 in the DBLα sequence tag classification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Bull2">[64]</xref>.</p>
<p>Domain subclasses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g002">Figure 2</xref>) could often be described by subclass specific homology blocks. For instance DBLζ4 was described by HB283 and HB284. Other subclasses were characterized by HBs shared exclusively with other major domain classes, examples being DBLζ1, which shared HB19 with DBLα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6e</xref> S1, blue), and DBLγ2/9 domains, which were characterized by having a DBLβ S3 subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref> S3, green pointers). Similarly, the S3 subdomain of VAR1 DBLε1 was very similar to the one present in a number of DBLγ sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref> S3, tree group u). Cassettes could also be identified, exemplified by HB331, which occurred exclusively in the N-terminal of DBLβ domains in domain cassette 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>DBLα1.3 of VAR3 contained HB17 and HB19 which were characteristic for DBLα domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref> S1), but S2c and S3 in DBLα1.3 were very characteristic for DBLζ, sharing several DBLζ specific homology blocks: HB92, HB99, HB592, HB93, and HB18. Thus, homology block analysis of VAR3 suggests that DBLα1.3 is a DBLα-ζ hybrid, and it will be interesting to see if the function of this domain is similar to any of the two combined classes alone. The finding of DBLζ elements in VAR3 associates this PfEMP1 with the domain combination DBLζ-DBLε, often found in component 4 cassettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g003">Figure 3</xref>, Component 4), which could imply functional analogies between VAR3 and these cassettes.</p>
<p>DBLpam1 and 2 shared homology blocks with DBLα/β/ζ, while DBLpam4 and to a high degree DBLpam5 and 6 shared blocks with DBLγ/δ/ε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, DBLpam1 contained HB65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref> S1, pink), a sequence that was mainly found in DBLβ. However, in the C-terminal end DBLpam1 shared HB60 with DBLα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref> S2c, yellow) and HB115 with DBLζ1/5/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref> S3b, green, tree group b, c and e). Thus, DBLpam1 appeared to contain elements from all of DBLα, β and ζ. The shared homology blocks, as well as the fact that the hybrid domains DBLα1.3 and DBLpam1 appears to be functional, suggests a more recent common ancestry and possibly related functions of DBLα, β, ζ, pam1 and pam2 domains.</p>
<p>Similarities between major DBL classes also varied considerably across the length of the domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and a major homology break point, where similarities differed on each side, was observed for many sequences around HB2, the most conserved DBL homology block.</p>
<p>In the N-terminal, a clear division was found between DBLα/β/ζ and DBLγ/δ/ε, best defined by HB11 and HB13, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s003">S2a</xref>). At this end of DBL domains, only the core homology blocks HB1–5 occurred in both groups, indicating low levels of recombination between these groups, and possibly different functions. Within these groups, DBLζ had high similarity to DBLβ, most significantly in the S1 subdomain, and DBLδ was very reminiscent of the DBLγ in the N-terminal, some sequences were even identical on the homology block level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6g, h, j, and k</xref>).</p>
<p>The C-terminal of DBL domains could also be divided into two major groups, consisting of the S3 subdomains of DBLα/δ and DBLζ/β/γ/ε, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s004">S3</xref>). DBLα and δ shared four homology blocks connecting to the downstream CIDR domains. S3 homology blocks in DBLζ and β were uniform and specific to each class, whereas DBLγ and ε S3 were more diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s004">S3</xref>).</p>
<p>N- and C-terminal ends of several major DBL domain classes thus appear to have different sequence similarities, most likely reflecting that the sequences have been joined through recombination, often with a break point around HB2, and they therefore have different evolutionary histories. Phylogenetic classification based on whole domain sequence alignments will tend to be an average of such different histories.</p>

<title>Evolutionary relationships among DBL subdomain sequences suggest intra-DBL recombination break point</title>

<p>Relations among sequences of the S3 DBL subdomain clearly differed from those of S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref>). DBLα and DBLδ S3 subdomains were found to be closely related, separated from the remaining sequences in all 1000 bootstraps, whereas in S2, DBLα was most closely related to DBLβ and ζ, supported by 99% of the bootstraps. Similarly, DBLγ and DBLε S3 subdomains were closely related, while S2 sequences of DBLγ were closely related to DBLδ, separated from DBLε by several highly supported branches. This strongly indicates that the evolutionary histories for S2 and S3 subdomains are different, as also suggested by the homology block analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and that recombination most likely has occurred with break point between these subdomains.</p>
<p>In agreement with the homology block analysis, the division between DBLα/β/ζ and DBLγ/δ/ε was well supported by bootstrap values in both S1 and S2, as was the separation of each of the domain classes DBLα, β, and ζ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s002">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s003">S2</xref>). For S1 and S2, DBLδ and DBLγ sequences were clustered together with low bootstrap support for separation within this group, although a specific set of DBLδ sequences had particularly close relations to DBLγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s002">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s003">S2</xref>). The relationship was most pronounced in the S2 subdomain, where 46 DBLδ sequences represented in all seven genomes, and including all non-DBLδ1 subclasses, were found closer to the DBLγ clade. The 3D7 genes containing these DBLδ sequences were MAL6P1.4, PF11_0521, PF13_0003 and PF11_0008. The latter <italic>var</italic> gene has been found to be the target for protective antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Magistrado1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Cham1">[34]</xref>, and together with PF13_0003 contains cassette 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>DBLα1 S3 sequences flanked by CIDRα1 domains were well supported as a subgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref> S3-1). Interestingly, all those DBLα domains that were not followed by CIDRα (DBLα1.5/6/8 domains), had an S3 subdomain which clustered with DBLδ S3 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref> S3-2), indicating recombination between DBLα and DBLδ. Similarly, DBLδ clusters were found for DBLδ domains followed by CIDRγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref> S3-3), and CIDRβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref> S3-4). These associations between S3 and CIDR indicate that the recombination break point occurs within the DBL domain when CIDR domains are exchanged, and further supports a functional dependency between CIDR and their upstream DBL domains.</p>
<p>DBLγ and DBLε S3 subdomains were found mixed in one cluster with low bootstrap support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref> S3-5, 6, 7, 8), although the subgroups were to some degree specific for either DBLγ or DBLε. One DBLγ clade was composed of S3 subdomains of DBLγ5/6/12/16/17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref> S3-7), captured by HB136 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6n</xref>) and found in a set of 36 PfEMP1 nearly void of DBLε and ζ domains. Two small DBLγ subgroups, DBLγ1/15 of VAR1, and a group comprising DBLγ2/9 domains, were found separately, and the latter group was closely related to DBLβ S3 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref>-S3-9), as expected from the homology block alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6k and l</xref>). These DBLγ-β hybrid domains appeared in 16 PfEMP1, found in 6 of 7 genomes (not HB3), the 3D7 gene being PF07_0050.</p>
<p>DBLε S3 sequences were dichotomized with a bootstrap support of 80%. One clade contained all DBLpam5, two DBLpam6, as well as DBLε5/7/12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref> S3-8). The S3-8 cluster was characterized well by HB97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6p and s</xref>), which was also present in several paralogs, such as PFA0665w DBL2 and PFD1155w DBL2, indicating that HB97 describes an ancient conserved domain element, a notion supported by its presence in the conserved genes <italic>var1</italic> and <italic>var2csa</italic>. The presence of HB97 in paralogs and many DBLε domains, suggests that of all PfEMP1 domain classes, DBLε may bear the highest resemblance to a common ancestral DBL domain.</p>
<p>The subdomain sequence comparison thus corroborates observations on homology block and domain level. The relations found between S3 subdomain sequences differ markedly from relations between S1 and S2 sequences, which supports the theory of a recombination hotspot between subdomain S2 and S3. The homology block analysis further suggests that the break point often occurs around HB2.</p>
<p>The subdomains S1 and S2 of DBLγ and DBLδ domains appear to be closely related, whereas the S3 subdomain sequences are distantly related, indicating recombination with break point around HB2. Furthermore, HB2 recombination products have been identified with 5′ DBLγ and 3′ DBLβ/ε sequences, as well as with 5′ DBLα and 3′ DBLδ sequences.</p>
<p>The area around HB2 is a hotspot in the sense that recombination has occurred at this position more frequently than at other sites during the history of the <italic>var</italic> genes. It is however difficult to say if this area has an especially elevated recombination frequency, or if the high number of observed recombination events is purely due to functional selection, i.e. there has been recombination all over the gene, but mainly recombinants with break points near HB2 have been retained due to better functionality. Recombination between DBLβ and DBLγ appears to be rare, judging from the fact that DBLγ-β hybrid domains are represented in 6 of 7 genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref>-S3-9, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s007">Figure S6</xref>), and that these sequences form a cluster in the HB61 tree. This is suggestive of a common ancestral sequence dating back before geographic separation of the genomes. Recombination between DBLα and DBLδ with break point in the HB2 area, resulting in S3 and CIDR domain exchange, may be a more frequent event, judging from the fact that all four combinations of DBLα/δ-CIDRβ/γ occur, which are likely to be the product of at least two recombination events. Corroborating this, S3 subdomains followed by CIDR1β and CIDR2β clustered together, separate from a cluster of S3 sequences followed by CIDR1γ and CIDR2γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g007">Figure 7</xref> S3-2). These sequence relations were also found in the phylogeny for HB7, indicating that the break point of these recombination events occurred upstream of HB7, and thus near HB2.</p>
<p>Frequent recombination around HB2 could suggest independent functions for S1+S2 and S3, as proposed for VAR2CSA domains where S3 generally was found to be less surface-exposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Andersen1">[50]</xref>. This may be particularly true for DBLγ/δ S1+S2 sequences, as they apparently can be combined successfully with very diverse downstream sequences, including DBLβ S3 subdomains and CIDR domains.</p>
<p>Recombination is also likely to occur between more closely related domains, e.g. within a domain class. This will probably occur more frequently due to higher sequence similarity, but will result in more subtle changes. DNA must be analyzed to detect such subtle changes optimally, and this could be done by studying the phylogenetic trees built for each homology block. This comprehensive task is however not within the scope of the current study. A recombination analysis has previously been performed on sequences encoding DBLpam3 domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Dahlback1">[59]</xref>, and interestingly the most significant recombination hotspot in this DBL class was also found near HB2.</p>

<title>Potential integrin binding of DBLα0 domains</title>
<p>Integrins are a family of cell surface membrane receptors, mediating binding to the extracellular matrix, as well as interacting with plasma proteins and counter receptors on other cells, thereby involving them in basic processes such as cell adhesion, cell migration and cell-cell communication. Integrins are heterodimers composed of two membrane anchored subunits, α and β of which the human genome encodes 18 and 8 variants respectively, combining into 24 known, human receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Takagi1">[67]</xref>. Integrin subunit homologs are found in both complex and simple metazoan organisms including sponges and corals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Nichols1">[68]</xref>, and the wide distribution, both in species and across tissue types, makes the receptors an attractive target for pathogens, such as various bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, which use these receptors for adhesion or internalization in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Stewart1">[69]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Hostetter1">[72]</xref>.

It has previously been shown that IE adhesion to human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) can be inhibited by anti-α<sub>v</sub> antibodies (i.e. antibodies targeting the v variant of integrin α subunits), suggesting that IE can bind to α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Siano1">[74]</xref>.</p>
<p>The amino acid trimer motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) is commonly found in integrin binding proteins, including disintegrins, ornatin, and many extracellular matrix proteins.

Only one motif was found per DBLα0 domain, and all seven genomes had RGD-containing DBLα0 domains. Interestingly all RGD motifs were evenly distributed in three fixed positions in DBLα0: (1) HB19 position 6–8, (2) HB12 position 14–16 and (3) HB7 position 15–17.</p>
<p>The three RGD sites in DBLα0 were predicted to be situated in loop regions by domain structure homology modeling (data not shown), and especially RGD position 2 and 3 were exposed on a loop in subdomain S3, between the helices covered by HB1 and HB2, held in place by several Cys residues.</p>
<p>PfEMP1 similarity to disintegrin and ornatin was found by searching 311 PfEMP1 against the Pfam domain database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Finn1">[56]</xref>, resulting in six hits to the disintegrin domain, and five hits to ornatin (E&lt;1 for all hits). 10 of these 11 hits were situated in DBLα0, overlapping the second RGD position mentioned above, and not all of the hit sequences contained an RGD motif.</p>
<p>The finding of two independent significant sequence features pointing towards integrin binding, and on top of this, the co-localization of these features in DBLα0, suggests that some DBLα0 domains are likely to mediate integrin binding, which may also be the phenomenon observed by Siano <italic>et al.</italic> (1998) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Siano1">[74]</xref>.</p>
<p>In relation to this, pentamidine is an RGD analogue used for treatment of many pathogen-caused diseases including malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Bray1">[78]</xref>, and it is possible that this drug may work partly as integrin antagonist, thus to some extent inhibiting IE binding to endothelial cells.</p>

<p>158 homology blocks found in 552 CIDR domains were aligned and clustered by HB composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

CIDRα1 domains, which have been shown not to bind CD36 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Robinson1">[47]</xref>, shared HB121 in the M2 helix loop, which was markedly different from HB32 shared by the remaining CIDRα in this region. CIDRβ/δ/γ domains were characterized by HB24 in M2, except CIDRγ6/8 domains with a differing helix loop defined by HB212 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g008">Figure 8</xref> M2).</p>
<p>Using the VarDom server, two HBs were found in the helix-loop of the MC179 CIDRα structure: HB32 covering helix a and b (see logo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g008">Figure 8</xref> M2), and HB372 covering the small helix c, a sequence which is mainly present in CIDRα2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Though the structure appeared twisted in the crystal so helix a and b were slightly separated, it was found likely that semi-conserved HB32 hydrophobic positions 17, 18 and 21 in helix a, under monomeric circumstances interact with conserved HB32 hydrophobic positions 45, 48, 51 and 52 in helix b to keep the helices together (logo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g008">Figure 8</xref> M2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g009">Figure 9</xref>, green residues). Similarly, the highly conserved HB32 positions 8 and 12 in helix a binds helix c through conserved hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g009">Figure 9</xref>, green residues). The Asp-Ile-Glu (DIE) motif at HB32 position 44–46 supports CD36 binding, as binding ability has been found to be disrupted when the motif is substituted with the motif Gly-His-Arg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Gamain1">[46]</xref>. This substitution of a conserved hydrophobic Ile with a charged His residue in helix b, is likely to result in a different conformation of these helices, emphasizing the importance of this helix pairing in CD36 binding. HB32 position 33–41 shows that in a subset of CIDRα (28% of the HB32 sequences), an insertion containing several acidic residues appears at the apex between helix a and b. In the majority of CIDRα, this apex contains a semi-conserved Tyr-Gly-Asn (YGN) motif on position 25 to 28 in HB32, which may also be surface-exposed in the monomeric structure. Phosphorylation sites are predicted in all HB32 sequences, and when present, the Tyr in YGN is also predicted as target for this modification. Phosphorylation is involved in CD36 binding, though only phosphorylation of the CD36 receptor has been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Yipp1">[79]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Ho1">[80]</xref>.</p>

<title>Possible N-terminal N-myristoylation of group A PfEMP1 may anchor N-terminal in membrane and cause alternate transportation to IE membrane</title>
<p>HB155 and HB264 were found in the N-terminal of group A PfEMP1, containing the characteristic motif MGxxx[S/T] required for the lipid modification N-myristoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g010">Figure 10</xref> NTS). N-terminal N-myristoylation is the covalent attachment of a 14-carbon myristate group to N-terminal Gly through an amide bond, after removal of the start Met residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Resh1">[82]</xref>. This reaction generally takes place in the cytoplasm during protein synthesis and entails transfer of the lipid chain from myristoyl-CoA, catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Gunaratne1">[83]</xref> (reviewed by Resh 2006 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Resh2">[84]</xref>). Myristate is able to insert hydrophobically into a lipid-bilayer, and thus create an unstable binding to a membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Peitzsch1">[85]</xref>. Attachment of an N-myristoylated protein to the membrane can be stabilized by the presence of basic residues interacting with negatively charged membrane phospholipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Sigal1">[86]</xref>, or by further acylation of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Nadolski1">[87]</xref>. Two important roles for N-myristoylation are in membrane anchoring and protein trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Batistic1">[88]</xref>.</p>
<p>N-myristoylation is conserved across eukaryotic species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Farazi1">[89]</xref>, and several experimentally confirmed N-terminally myristoylated proteins in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> share the common eukaryotic motif MGxxx[S/T] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Rahlfs1">[90]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Struck1">[94]</xref>.

The two homology blocks, HB155 and HB264 were present in 41 PfEMP1 N-terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g010">Figure 10</xref> NTS) that were all predicted to be N-myristoylated by the NMT predictor.

<p>N-myristoylation may act as a localization signal and affect trafficking of PfEMP1, like PfGRASP which is dependent on a functional myristoylation motif for localization to the golgi apparatus through a brefeldin A independent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Struck1">[94]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Struck2">[97]</xref>. PfGRASP has a terminal sequence (MGAGQTK) which is very similar to IT4var08 (MGAGQST) and RAJ116var05 (MGASQSK), the latter getting the highest score of all PfEMP1 by the NMT predictor.</p>
<p>It is still unknown if the PEXEL motif is cleaved and acetylated in PfEMP1, like in some other exported proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Boddey1">[98]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Chang1">[99]</xref>. If NTS is not removed by PEXEL cleavage, then the N-myristoylated N-terminal can be translocated across the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Utsumi1">[100]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Denny1">[101]</xref>, and exposed on the IE surface. The unstable membrane binding caused by N-terminal N-myristoylation could by itself play a major role in mediating adherence of IE to host cell membranes. The unspecific binding of several acylated PfEMP1 to any part of a host cell (e.g. endothelial cell) membrane, possibly combined with receptor binding mediated by other parts of PfEMP1, could together form a strong interaction. A mechanism known as myristoyl switching has been found in some acylated proteins, where ligand binding induces a conformational change, regulating if the fatty acid is hidden in a hydrophobic pocket within the protein or if it is exposed for membrane interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Ames1">[102]</xref>.</p>
<p>Stable membrane anchoring is also possible, as the N-terminals of some PfEMP1 possess several basic residues that can act in synergy with the lipid chain to bind the membrane. Generally UPSA have a higher pI (i.e. are more basic) than other PfEMP1 N-terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g011">Figure 11B</xref>). Other types of less site-specific acylation, such as S-acylation at some of the many Cys residues, may also help tether the protein to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Nadolski1">[87]</xref>.</p>

<title>Inter-domain homology blocks</title>
<p>52 homology blocks had more than 50% of their occurrences in inter-domain regions, i.e. outside defined domains. Three of the most frequent inter-domain homology blocks are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g010">Figure 10</xref>-ID. The 52 inter-domain homology blocks were mainly low complexity sequences, occurring in repeats and overlapping each other. To determine the distribution of these homology blocks in PfEMP1 sequences, a NJ-tree was constructed based on ID homology block composition of the PfEMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g010">Figure 10</xref> ID). In general the homology blocks were uniformly scattered amongst PfEMP1 sequences, although four groups were distinguished with representatives in at least 6 of the 7 genomes. VAR1 and VAR2CSA had unique conserved inter-domain sequences with low amounts of the low-complexity sequence found in many other PfEMP1, and therefore, they formed separate groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g010">Figure 10</xref> ID, tree group 1 and 2). Interestingly, one cluster was defined by two unique inter-domain homology blocks, HB341 and HB295 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g010">Figure 10</xref> ID, group 3). This cluster of 11 group A PfEMP1 with similar DBLβ/γ containing domain composition (part of frame 9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4A</xref>) captured all occurrences of double DBLβ domains, was represented in 6 of 7 genomes (not RAJ116), and the 3D7 genes were PFD1235w and PF11_0521, which have been linked to severe malaria and ICAM-1 binding respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Jensen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Oleinikov1">[38]</xref>. The fourth distinct group was defined by HB280 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g010">Figure 10</xref> ID, group 4), conserved in 5 of 7 genomes (not 3D7 and HB3) and comprised 11 proteins, including among others the ICAM-1 binding associated IT4var14 (A4var) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Smith2">[40]</xref>. All members in the fourth group lacked other ID HBs, most were flanked by UPSB1, and 10 of 11 had the same C-terminal domain combination ending with DBLγ-DBLζ4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g003">Figure 3</xref>, cassette 9; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s005">Figure S4A</xref>, frame 7). The conservation of an ID region together with the semi-conserved domain architecture and UPS sequences, suggests a more recent common ancestor for genes in these groups. It will be interesting to see if the members of these groups share receptor-binding properties.</p>
<p>The Cys-containing M3 regions (M3A and M3AB) were found to be positionally linked to the upstream CIDR domain, while the amino acid composition correlated more highly with the downstream domain architecture. Two homology blocks were able to capture most occurrences of the two Cys-residues found after CIDRβ and γ, despite of the surrounding low-complexity sequence, seeing that a few other positions besides the Cys were conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g008">Figure 8</xref> M3).</p>

ATS starts N-terminally with the transmembrane region, which was captured by HB21. The intron splice site between exon 1 and exon 2 lies immediately downstream of the transmembrane part, so the short basic stretch which follows transmembrane regions, and interacts with the negatively charged membrane phospholipids, was found in the following HB41. ATSA, which is associated with UPSA, was distinguished as sequences where HB69 and HB112 occurred simultaneously.</p>
<p>ATSvar1, ATSB17, and the ATS of VAR2CSA, were characterized by lacking the final three homology blocks conserved in all other ATS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g010">Figure 10</xref> ATS, HB46/47/51, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s008">Figure S7D</xref>).</p>
<p>ATSB17 was found in six group C PfEMP1, distributed in six genomes (not IT4), and containing several DBLβ/γ domains. The two <italic>var2csa</italic> genes in the HB3 genome had an ATSB14 more similar to the ATS of non-VAR2CSA PfEMP1, however these were truncated before the final three homology blocks. Other VAR2CSA ATS had normal length but contained unique sequences instead of the three conserved homology blocks. The five <italic>var1</italic> genes possessing an exon 2, were all flanked by a 3′UTR encoding the three missing homology blocks. Compared to a common ATS, ATSvar1 was missing ∼150 AA, ATSB17 was lacking ∼100 AA, whereas the ATS of VAR2CSA was missing or differed from the final 100–130 AA.</p>
<p>The finding that VAR1 and VAR2CSA both have a shortened ATS, could suggest that ATSvar1 is functional despite of truncation, and question the hypothesis that VAR1 exclusively exists as a pseudogene.</p>
<p>The final three ATS homology blocks could be a non-essential functional element in PfEMP1, for example acting as signal peptide during transport to the erythrocyte membrane, which would result in differences for VAR1, VAR2CSA, and ATSB17 PfEMP1, compared to other PfEMP1.</p>

Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the PfEMP1 ATS was recently shown to alter its association with parasite-encoded knob-associated His-rich protein (KAHRP), and to regulate cytoadherence of IE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Hora1">[104]</xref>.</p>
<p>Judging from phosphorylation site predictions and conservation levels in the homology blocks, some examples of conserved potential phosphorylation sites were, in DBL domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g006">Figure 6</xref>): HB19 position 28 (DBLα S1), HB82 position 11 (DBLα S2b), HB36 position 8 (DBLα0 S2c), and Tyr in HB29 (DBLδ and γ S2c). In CIDR one of many examples is the mentioned YGN motif in CIDRα HB32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Several sites of all three types are conserved in the ATS HB41, HB43, and HB69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000933-g010">Figure 10</xref> ATS). Phosphorylation sites have been predicted for all PfEMP1 sequences, and the conservation of these can be inspected for each homology block on the VarDom server.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if some of these sites are surface-exposed and thus accessible to kinases, as the introduction of large, negatively charged phosphate groups could result in conformational changes, or contribute to charged binding surfaces, and thus result in functional and antigenic variation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The reclassification of PfEMP1 domains by alignment and distance tree analysis introduced a few larger and several smaller new subclasses. Although the classification is a result of a phylogenetic approximation of the different evolutionary histories of the domain sequence blocks, identification of conserved PfEMP1 domain architectures was possible. These structures represent a novel perspective on the PfEMP1 architecture. DBL and CIDR domains appear to be inherited in conserved domain structures that to a large extent fall within four major components. These conserved domain structures although large and complex may well represent functional units of the whole PfEMP1 molecule.</p>
<p>Apart from the known conserved <italic>var</italic> genes, <italic>var1</italic>, <italic>var2csa</italic>, and <italic>var3</italic>, 18 domain cassettes and several less well-defined structural phenomena were observed for the seven sequenced genomes. The established division of group A, B and C was confirmed although importantly, N- and C-terminal conserved domain structures occurred independently of each other, with distinct C-terminal DBLε-containing structures transcending the three conserved genes, as well as group A, B, and C.</p>
<p>Homology blocks covering on average 83.5% of a PfEMP1 sequence were defined, describing the PfEMP1 family on a more detailed level than domains, yet more simplified than the amino acid level. Local similarities between domain classes were thus described, and homology blocks specific for PfEMP1 domain classes, components, and cassettes, were found. The HB analysis also revealed a recombination hotspot between subdomain S2 and S3 in DBL domains, which has helped shape the antigen repertoire. Thus, several DBL domains are hybrids of different major classes - an observation important for functional studies as well as antibody cross-reactivity and vaccine design.</p>
<p>Several conserved elements were described by the homology blocks, including: (1) DBL domain core interactions conserved in all DBL domains, holding the subdomains together, (2) an acylation motif found to be conserved in group A <italic>var</italic> genes, suggesting N-terminal N-myristoylation of a subset of PfEMP1, (3) conserved residues predicted to be phosphorylation sites, and (4) PfEMP1 inter-domain regions, which are proposed to be elastic disordered structures.</p>
<p>The novel iterative homology block detection method is potentially applicable to any protein dataset, and would be especially suitable for compositional analysis of other frequently recombining gene families.</p>
<p>The VarDom server was introduced, where all presented information on domain classes and homology blocks can be retrieved, and new sequences can be classified and related to other PfEMP1 proteins in the seven genomes. Ideally, the server will allow better interpretation and facilitate the development of new approaches in PfEMP1 research. For example analysis of <italic>var</italic> expression data from microarrays and short high through-put sequence reads or the design of recombinant proteins for immunizations or functional studies could all benefit from this detailed account of PfEMP1 diversity and ultimately aid the development of PfEMP1 based malaria interventions.</p>

For all <italic>var</italic> genes with intact N-terminal segments, 2000 bp 5′ UTRs were also retrieved where possible. In total 399 annotated genes and open reading frames spanning over the length of at least two DBL/CIDR domains were kept for the sequence alignment and distance tree analysis, whereas the homology block dataset consisted of the 311 full length or exon1 sequences, as well as 20 DBL-containing paralogs from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, <italic>vivax</italic>, <italic>yoelii</italic> and <italic>knowlesi</italic>. For meaningful interpretations, the first approach required sequence lengths spanning at least two PfEMP1 features, whereas the latter, was based on whole or exon1 sequences to avoid generating false homology block break-points.

<title>Domain alignment and phylogeny</title>
<p>Large phylogenies comprising all DBL or CIDR sequences were inferred by multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE (version 3.7) followed by application of the neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in MEGA (version 4.0.2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Tamura1">[105]</xref>. Major domain classes were deduced and named according to previously defined classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000933-Lavstsen1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Major domain-class sequences were further subclassified through a recursive process involving: (1) re-alignment of sequences, (2) construction of a maximum likelihood tree, and (3) split of sequences into two clusters at a tree bipartition validated by at least 50% of the bootstraps. If a suitable bipartition was found, the process would be repeated for each of the two formed clusters. If the sequences on the other hand were not divided, they were all assigned to the same subclass and given a number. In addition to bootstrap support, two other properties were used to evaluate bipartitions and determine if and where the trees should be split: the number of genomes represented in each cluster, and the within-cluster average distance (WCAD), which was used as a measure for the relatedness of clustered sequences. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000933.s012">Text S1</xref> for details on domain border and distance tree cluster definitions.</p>

<ack>
<p>We are very grateful to those who generated and made available the sequence data of the seven genomes. HB3, DD2, IGH and RAJ116 parasite isolates were sequenced at the NIAID Microbial Sequencing Center at the Broad Institute. The sequence data from the IT clone, the clinical isolate (PFCLIN) and clone 3D7 were produced by the Pathogen Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</p>
