<p>The A20 protein is a known inhibitor of apoptosis that here is shown to be a novel cancer stem cell-promoting factor associated with poor glioma patient survival.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Glioblastomas are deadly cancers that display a functional cellular hierarchy maintained by self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. We determined that A20 (TNFAIP3), a regulator of cell survival and the NF-κB pathway, is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs, we targeted <italic>A20</italic> expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFα-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but <italic>A20</italic> knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFα-mediated apoptosis. The decreased survival of GSCs upon <italic>A20</italic> knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with <italic>A20</italic> targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. Although inactivating mutations in <italic>A20</italic> in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival. A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Glioblastomas are the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors in adults, with a median survival of only 12–15 months. Glioblastomas display a cellular hierarchy with a subset of cells having stem cell–like properties, including the capacity to self-renew and propagate tumors. Specific ablation of cancer stem cells is widely thought to be critical for effective and long-lasting treatment of cancers. We report the identification of the antiapoptotic protein A20 (which is also known as TNFAIP3) as a novel regulator of glioma stem cell survival. Glioma stem cells overexpress A20 relative to non-stem glioma cells, and this protects them from cell death, whereas depletion of A20 attenuates glioma stem cell survival and tumor growth. Interrogation of a molecular glioma database reveals that A20 levels correlate with decreased survival in patients. These data indicate that A20 is a tumor enhancer in the context of glioma, which importantly contrasts with its known function as a tumor suppressor in the context of lymphoma. Therefore, A20 may be a context-specific regulator of cancer stem cell survival and growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tumors are aberrant organ systems that display a complex interplay between neoplastic cells and recruited vascular, inflammatory, and stromal elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Reya1">[1]</xref>. Cellular heterogeneity within the neoplastic compartment has been modeled with complementary stochastic and hierarchical paradigms. Molecular signals that drive tumor formation and maintenance frequently are shared with normal development and wound responses, processes in which normal stem and progenitor cells function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Reya1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Rosen1">[4]</xref>. Stem cell–like cancer cells (or cancer stem cells) need not be derived from normal stem cells but may be subjected to evolutionary pressures that select for the capacity to self-renew extensively or differentiate depending on conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Reya1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Fulda1">[5]</xref>. Cancer stem cells have been derived from several primary brain tumors, but both their derivation and characterization are incomplete and rapidly expanding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Singh1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Zhou1">[35]</xref>. Glioblastoma (World Heath Organization grade IV astrocytoma) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Central1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Louis1">[37]</xref>. Current glioblastoma therapies, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, are highly toxic, offering only palliation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Central1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Louis1">[37]</xref>. Although brain tumor stem cells remain controversial due to the evolving understanding of their nature, a number of reports have demonstrated that glioblastomas contain cancer stem cells and that these cells contribute to therapeutic resistance and tumor angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Reya1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Zhou1">[35]</xref>. Significant effort has been undertaken to identify potential targets in cancer stem cells that promote tumor maintenance and that might be amenable to disruption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Zhou1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>To identify molecular targets in cancer, the majority of analyses completed to date compare bulk tumor to normal tissues and may therefore underestimate the importance of genes and proteins expressed within the cancer stem cell subpopulation. For example, comparison of GSCs to non-stem glioma cells or bulk tumor has resulted in greater understanding of the importance of HIF2α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Lee1">[10]</xref>, L1CAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bao3">[21]</xref>, and Bmi-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Abdouh1">[22]</xref> for GSC tumorigenic capacity. These proteins are all relatively overexpressed in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and now known to regulate GSC growth, survival, and self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Lee1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bao3">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Abdouh1">[22]</xref>. These biological processes are also regulated in GSCs by more well-established molecular mediators of cancer such as c-myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Wang1">[23]</xref> and AKT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bleau1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Gallia1">[26]</xref>. Together, these studies demonstrate that isolation and characterization of GSCs can define new molecular targets for cancer therapy and determine novel roles for established signaling pathways in cancer stem cell biology.</p>
<p>We speculated that the cell survival and NF-κB regulator A20, or Tumor Necrosis Factor α inducible protein 3 (TNFAIP3), was one molecular target with a greater role in glioma than currently understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Beyaert1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Heyninck1">[39]</xref>. An oncogenic role for A20 is suggested by the increased <italic>A20</italic> expression in some cancers: A20 is elevated in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Codd1">[40]</xref>, poorly differentiated head and neck cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Codd1">[40]</xref>, gliomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Guo1">[41]</xref>, and inflammatory breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Lerebours1">[42]</xref>. Increased A20 expression in breast cancer cells confers resistance to TNFα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Opipari1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Jttel1">[44]</xref> and tamoxifen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Vendrell1">[45]</xref>, suggesting A20 mediates survival and chemoresistance. Although these data imply a protumorigenic role for A20, gene expression and functional studies in other cancer types suggest A20 is a tumor suppressor. Deletions and inactivating mutations have been identified in B-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphomas, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Compagno1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Chanudet1">[51]</xref>. In addition, decreased A20 was associated with resistance to DNA-damaging agents in glioma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bredel1">[52]</xref>. Together, these data indicate that the role of A20 in cancer biology may be context and tissue-type dependent and is an important area for further investigation. Evidence from the <italic>A20</italic> null mice also suggested a link to stem cell biology: the epidermal and dermal layers of <italic>A20<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are significantly thicker than that of wild-type controls, demonstrating A20 regulates skin cell fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Lee2">[53]</xref>. Based on these data, we examined the role of A20 in cancer stem cell biology in gliomas. We determined A20 is elevated in GSCs where it is required to maintain growth and survival. Importantly, we find increased <italic>A20</italic> mRNA expression or copy number is associated with poor glioma patient survival.</p>

<title>A20 Is Highly Expressed in Glioma Stem Cells</title>
<p>To determine whether A20 could differentially contribute to glioma biology through the recently identified glioma subfractions, we utilized several complementary methods to evaluate A20 expression in freshly isolated GSC-enriched and -depleted cultures derived using our previously published methodology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Li1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bao1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bao2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bao3">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Wang1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Eyler1">[25]</xref>. To determine whether A20 was differentially expressed at the transcript level, total mRNA was collected and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. We found GSC-enriched cells isolated from short-term xenografts expressed elevated <italic>A20</italic> mRNA levels in comparison to matched non-stem glioma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We had previously confirmed that these cells self-renew and propagate tumors in an immunocompromised host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Li1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bao1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bao3">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Wang1">[23]</xref>. As in our past studies, the GSCs also express high levels of the glioma stem cell marker encoded by <italic>Olig2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with these results, GSCs isolated directly from patient specimens also expressed elevated levels of A20 and Olig2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine whether elevated <italic>A20</italic> mRNA expression correlated with increased A20 protein levels, we next visualized A20 expression using immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). Increased expression of A20 was observed in GSCs in comparison to matched non-stem glioma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). GSCs form neurospheres when cultured in serum-free media. When single neurospheres were sectioned, we determined A20 was coexpressed with the stem cell transcription factor Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). To confirm these results, we enriched or depleted GSCs from either short-term xenografts or patient tumor specimens and isolated lysates for immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g001">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In every tumor tested, GSCs displayed strikingly elevated A20 levels compared to matched non-stem cells. Similar to results with mRNA, the differential expression of A20 was true whether subfractions were isolated from patient specimens passaged short term in immunocompromised mice or directly from patient specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g001">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<p>To further evaluate whether cells expressing a GSC marker also highly express A20 at the single-cell level in a quantitative manner, we performed flow cytometric analysis with cells double labeled for A20 and CD133. We confirmed that A20 is highly coexpressed with the glioma stem cell marker CD133 (Prominin-1) when cells were isolated from a patient specimen passaged short term in immunocompromised mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) or directly isolated from patient specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). When bulk tumor cells were analyzed for expression of CD133 and A20, greater than 75% of CD133+ cells were also A20+, whereas less than 10% of CD133− cells were A20+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s002">Figure S2A</xref> and 2SB). The percentage of CD133+ cells is also higher in the A20+ subpopulation: greater than 50% of A20+ cells were CD133+, whereas less than 8% of A20− cells were CD133+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g002">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s002">Figure S2C and S2D</xref>).

<title>Expression of shRNA Directed against <italic>A20</italic> Decreases GSC Growth and Survival</title>
<p>Although our findings demonstrated A20 was consistently up-regulated in GSCs, no studies to date have suggested a functional role for A20 in cancer stem cells. As A20 was linked to cell survival in some reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Lee2">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Tewari1">[57]</xref>, we first assessed the ability of A20 to regulate GSC cell growth and apoptosis by targeting <italic>A20</italic> expression using lentiviral transduced short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (Sigma Mission shRNA). To control for potential off-target shRNA effects, two different sequences of shRNA directed against <italic>A20</italic> and a nontargeting shRNA were used when cell numbers permitted. Transduction with <italic>A20</italic> shRNA reduced A20 protein levels in GSCs in comparison to the nontargeting control, but did not alter Olig2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). <italic>A20</italic> targeting profoundly impacted GSC growth as demonstrated by a marked reduction in cell numbers over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>).

<title>A20 Protects GSCs from TNFα-Induced Apoptosis</title>

We therefore investigated the effect of TNFα on the survival of GSC-enriched and -depleted cultures. TNFα increased apoptosis in non-stem glioma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>), consistent with prior results in glioma cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-ChambautGurin1">[70]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Wakabayashi1">[71]</xref>.

To determine the role of A20 in GSC TNFα apoptotic resistance, GSCs were transduced with either shRNA directed against <italic>A20</italic> or nontargeting shRNA and subsequently treated with TNFα. Consistent with our prior results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g004">Figure 4</xref>), GSC apoptosis was increased with targeting of <italic>A20</italic> as measured with caspase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g006">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).

<title>Targeting <italic>A20</italic> Increases the Survival of Mice Bearing Human Glioma Xenografts</title>
<p>Our results thus far determined an important role for A20 in GSC growth, survival, and self-renewal in vitro, but the ultimate goal of any cancer stem cell–directed therapy is to provide therapeutic benefit in vivo. We therefore evaluated the ability of <italic>A20</italic> targeting to increase the survival of immunocompromised mice bearing intracranially implanted human glioma cells. For initial experiments, we performed an in vivo limiting dilution assay with GSCs transduced with nontargeting control shRNA or shRNA directed against <italic>A20</italic>. Tumor-bearing mice were allowed to survive until the development of neurologic signs in each animal (including lethargy, ataxia, paralysis, or seizure) in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved protocols. For all cell numbers transplanted, the median survival of mice injected with GSCs derived from either T3359 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) or TB-08-0118 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) was increased with <italic>A20</italic> knockdown.

<title>A20 Expression Is Elevated in Human Glioma Patients and Correlates with Poor Survival</title>
<p>Our data in human glioma patient specimens and xenografts in vitro and in vivo suggested that elevated A20 levels in GSCs are protumorigenic. To extend these results into a clinical analysis, we utilized two databases: the National Cancer Institute's Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which respectively contain information from multiple brain tumor types or glioblastoma only. Using REMBRANDT, we found that up-regulation of <italic>A20</italic> mRNA 2-fold or greater in all glioma patients correlated with a significant decrease in survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). When the analysis was restricted to Grade II or Grade III astrocytoma, <italic>A20</italic> mRNA up-regulation 2-fold or greater also significantly correlated with decreased survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). However, <italic>A20</italic> mRNA up-regulation did not correlate with survival in glioblastoma patients in either REMBRANDT or TCGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g008">Figure 8C</xref> and unpublished data). These data demonstrate that elevation of <italic>A20</italic> in early clinical stages of glioma correlates with poor survival, but differences in <italic>A20</italic> expression in the bulk tumor at the time of glioblastoma diagnosis cannot predict survival. As global gene expression analyses currently available in the public databases cannot consider the contribution of the GSC subfraction, these data may underestimate the importance of A20 in glioblastoma. However, it remained possible that an overall elevation of <italic>A20</italic> in glioblastoma patients compared to lower grade astrocytomas contributed to the poorer survival of glioblastoma patients. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the median expression intensity of <italic>A20</italic> across tumor types in REMBRANDT. We found elevated levels of <italic>A20</italic> in glioblastoma compared to all other types of brain tumors as well as control (nontumor) tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). As elevated levels of mRNA may reflect an increase in gene copy number, we sought to determine whether genomic changes in <italic>A20</italic> occurred in glioma patients. Copy number REMBRANDT analysis for <italic>A20</italic> indicated that a 3-fold or greater amplification of the 6q23.3 chromosomal region correlated with poor survival, although the number of patients in this group was small (<italic>n</italic> = 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000319-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). It is also important to note that, in contrast to lymphoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Compagno1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Chanudet1">[51]</xref>, inactivating point mutations in <italic>A20</italic> were not identified in recently completed genetic screens of the glioma genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-The1">[72]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Parsons1">[73]</xref>. These data further suggest that A20 activity is important for glioma development and biology.

<p>Understanding the genetic and/or protein expression profile of patients in which A20 is elevated may be important for elucidating the mechanisms through which <italic>A20</italic> is induced or the pathways through which A20-expressing cells regulate survival. We therefore utilized the TCGA glioblastoma database to evaluate the presence of common glioblastoma mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s006">Figure S6A and S6B</xref>) and expression of TNFα signaling mediators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s006">Figure S6C</xref>) in patients with different levels of <italic>A20</italic> expression. Tumors with <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>NF1</italic> mutations were enriched in tumors with high <italic>A20</italic> expression in comparison to tumors with intermediate or low <italic>A20</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s006">Figure S6A and S6B</xref>). In contrast, the percentage of samples with <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations was lowest in tumors with high <italic>A20</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s006">Figure S6A and S6B</xref>). Further evaluation of expression of TNFα signaling mediators in patients with differential <italic>A20</italic> levels demonstrated higher TNF receptor and <italic>RelB</italic> mRNA expression in tumors with elevated <italic>A20</italic> expression. These data suggest that A20 expression may be indicative of elevated TNFα or NF-κB signals. As the effects of these two pathways on GSC pro-tumorigenic behaviors are relatively unknown, more thorough evaluation of their biologies in the context of cancer stem cells may be warranted.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our appreciation of the complex interactions between cell types during tumor initiation, progression, and recurrence continues to grow with our increasing understanding of cancer biology. Whereas researchers once considered tumors to be masses of clonal cancer cells, the involvement of immune cells, endothelial cells, and neighboring fibroblasts to tumor growth is now well recognized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Reya1">[1]</xref>. We believe that the identification of cancer stem cells with a probable concurrent stochastic clonality builds upon this model to recognize a previously underestimated contribution of the heterogeneity of tumor cells themselves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Reya1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Rosen1">[4]</xref>. By profiling the molecular and biological properties of cancer stem cells, we may therefore identify genes and proteins whose importance in cancer was poorly recognized. We have now determined that the inhibitor of apoptosis A20 is a cancer stem cell target. A20 was elevated in GSCs in comparison to non-stem glioma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels in cells isolated directly from glioma patient specimens and human glioma xenografts. Targeting <italic>A20</italic> expression with shRNA in GSCs significantly impaired their growth and survival in vitro and increased tumor latency in mice bearing human glioma xenografts. The importance of A20 to human glioma patients is further demonstrated by the association of elevated A20 levels with poor outcome.</p>
<p>Although current methods for cancer stem cell enrichment from solid cancers have been sufficient to differentiate tumor subpopulations, prospective identification of cancer stem cells has limitations that contribute to the controversy surrounding their existence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Reya1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Zhou1">[35]</xref>. Due to the restricted amount of tissue often available after pathologic review, it is difficult to generate enough patient-derived GSCs for the majority of experiments without culture or amplification as a xenograft. As we believe that microenvironmental conditions within the tumor contribute to GSC maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Heddleston1">[74]</xref>, we utilize a xenograft isolation system to obtain sufficient GSCs, but validated key studies with direct analysis of patient specimens. Experiments with cells directly derived from primary glioma specimens would be optimal, but results in GSCs from xenograft and patient-derived specimens have, thus far, been similar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Li1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bao2">[15]</xref>. Once tissue or xenografts are obtained, enrichment or depletion of cancer stem cells from the bulk tumor can be useful to respectively isolate glioma stem cell and non-stem glioma cell fractions with the stipulation that both GSC and non-stem glioma populations are heterogeneous and unlikely to be mutually exclusive based on current sorting protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Reya1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Rosen1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bidlingmaier1">[27]</xref>. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorting to enrich for glioma stem cells has relied on the presence of the glycosylated form of the cell surface marker CD133 (Prominin-1): a protein whose role in tumorigenesis and glioma biology remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bidlingmaier1">[27]</xref>. However, CD133 is not the only marker useful for prospective identification of glioma stem cells, not all CD133+ cells are GSCs, and CD133 cannot exclusively segregate for tumorigenic potential and self-renewal in all glioma patient samples and cell lines studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bidlingmaier1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Persson1">[33]</xref>. The side population associated with ABCG2 transporter activity has been shown to be an important segregator for tumorigenic potential in mouse and human gliomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bleau1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Persson1">[33]</xref>. In gliomas without CD133 expression, the carbohydrate antigen SSEA-1/CD15/LeX can enrich for tumor-initiating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Son1">[32]</xref>. CD133 and SSEA-1 separations are based on the use of antibodies against unspecified carbohydrate modified epitopes, adding further complexity by suggesting that posttranslational modifications to cell surface proteins are important for cancer stem cell biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bidlingmaier1">[27]</xref>. These data suggest that, similar to leukemias, no one cell surface marker will be sufficient to isolate a homogeneous population of cancer stem cells from solid tumors. It is therefore enticing to suggest that molecular targets, such as A20, that are elevated in GSC-enriched fractions may segregate for a cancer stem cell subpopulation. Validating our findings in a model without dependence on CD133, we characterized A20 expression in lines with tumor enrichment in the SSEA-1+ fraction and found increased A20 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000319.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These results strongly suggest that A20 segregates with tumor initiating potential.</p>
<p>Our data with A20 expression suggest that, regardless of the cell surface markers used for isolation, the tumor-maintaining glioma subfractions may have common intracellular molecular targets. Determining the direct contribution of A20 (or cells expressing other identified nuclear targets such as HIF2α<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Li1">[11]</xref> and Bmi-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Abdouh1">[22]</xref>) is limited by our inability to sort for live A20-positive cells due to its intracellular localization. However, one recent study was able to utilize an indirect reporter based method to further elucidate the role of the transcription factor Oct4 in cancer stem cell biology. When the Oct4 promoter was used to drive green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in osteosarcoma cells, reporter activity could identify tumor-initiating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Levings1">[75]</xref>. Application of similar methodologies to other cancer stem cell targets could permit the development of non-cell surface marker based sorting techniques and lead to further confirmation of the existence of cancer stem cells.</p>
<p>Although cancer stem cells can be isolated using different methodologies, a common theme in cancer stem cell biology is the ability of this tumor subpopulation to survive cellular assaults and repopulate the tumor. To date, only a few molecular mechanisms for GSC resistance to apoptotic signals have been identified. GSC radioresistance is linked to elevated checkpoint activation and DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bao2">[15]</xref>, whereas chemoresistance is associated with improved drug efflux due to the presence of the ABCG2 transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bleau1">[24]</xref>. Resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in GSCs may be due to reduced levels of caspase 8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Capper1">[19]</xref>, and GSCs appear to be less sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis due to decreased levels of oligomeric Fas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bertrand1">[20]</xref>. Our data now add A20 as one of this growing list of prosurvival mediators in GSCs. We find that knockdown of <italic>A20</italic> induces apoptosis in GSCs and sensitizes GSCs to TNFα-induced apoptosis in cell culture, although we have not measured apoptosis specifically in the GSC compartment in vivo. Whether elevated levels of A20 in GSCs could also regulate other forms of therapeutic resistance remains to be investigated, but it is interesting to note that <italic>A20</italic> was one of a set of genes identified as mediators of resistance to O6-alkylating agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bredel1">[52]</xref>. Cell lines were derived from primary and recurrent tumors selected for resistance to 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) or temozolomide in media with 20% fetal calf serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bredel1">[52]</xref>. Under this prodifferentiating condition, down-regulation of A20 and the established pluripotency gene leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were both associated with chemoresistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Bredel1">[52]</xref>. Roles for A20 (our data) and LIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Peuelas1">[34]</xref> in GSC self-renewal imply that elevation of these proteins would be more likely to facilitate rather than impede GSC mediated chemoresistance. These data reinforce the notion that the differentiation state of the glioma cells may differentially impact the mechanisms through which tumor cells survive cellular stresses (i.e., conditional essentiality).</p>
<p>Our examination of A20 in the context of glioma heterogeneity revealed A20 contributes to GSC protumorigenic behaviors, but recent evidence in the literature suggests a tumor suppressive role for A20 in other cancers. Although we find A20 is highly expressed in GSCs and point mutations in A20 have not been identified in glioma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-The1">[72]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Parsons1">[73]</xref>, <italic>A20</italic> deletion and mutation is prevalent in lymphoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Compagno1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Chanudet1">[51]</xref>. <italic>A20</italic> knockdown in GSCs promotes apoptosis and reduces tumorigenic potential in mouse models of human cancer, but overexpression of A20 in A20-deficient lymphoma cells produces similar results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Compagno1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Kato1">[47]</xref>. Together, these data suggest that A20 may be a tumor suppressor or a tumor enhancer depending on the cancer type. Many molecular pathways, including the NF-κB pathway which A20 can inhibit, may be either pro- or antitumorigenic depending on the cellular context and tumor stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Pikarsky1">[59]</xref>. For example, inhibition of NF-κB signals in mouse epidermis resulted in squamous cell carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-vanHogerlinden1">[76]</xref>, whereas a similar transgenic strategy in transformed hepatocytes prevented tumor progression to hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Pikarsky2">[77]</xref>. A20 may similarly have differential effects on tumor development or progression depending on the biological requirements for A20 in specific tissues. Indeed, unique roles for A20 in lymphoma and glioma tumor biology may be anticipated based on differences in basal expression between lymphoid tissues and the brain. In the majority of tissues, including brain, A20 expression is induced by a variety of stimuli (TNFα, lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1), but unexpressed or expressed at very low levels under basal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Lee2">[53]</xref>. However, A20 is constitutively expressed in lymphoid tissues, particularly the thymus and lymph nodes where A20 is critical for suppression of inflammatory responses mediated by NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Lee2">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000319-Tewari1">[57]</xref>. Mutation of <italic>A20</italic> may therefore be more beneficial during the development of lymphoma. In contrast, our analysis suggests A20 levels increase with brain tumor grade, suggesting a benefit for A20 elevation in astrocytoma growth and linking A20 to glioma tumor progression. Thus, the precise biological and molecular outcomes of targeting <italic>A20</italic> in each tumor type must be further defined, particularly before broadly applying A20-based therapies for cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Our data implicate A20 as an important mediator of cancer stem cell biology by demonstrating that A20 is involved in glioma maintenance through the regulation of GSC growth and survival. The increased survival of mice bearing intracranial tumors upon <italic>A20</italic> targeting, and the decreased survival of glioma patients with elevated mRNA, both indicate that inhibition of A20 (or its downstream mediators) may be beneficial for glioma therapy. However, the increased survival of mice upon A20 restoration to A20-deficient lymphoma cells demonstrates that targeting A20 may be harmful for other tumor types. As we do not fully understand the mechanisms that cause A20 to have differential effects on tumor growth and cancer cell behaviors, further elucidation of A20 molecular and biological signals is warranted.</p>
