        <p>It has long been thought that signal joints, the byproducts of V(D)J recombination, are
          not involved in the dynamics of the rearrangement process. Evidence has now started to
          accumulate that this is not the case, and that signal joints play unsuspected roles in
          events that might compromise genomic integrity. Here we show both ex vivo and in vivo that
          the episomal circles excised during the normal process of receptor gene rearrangement may
          be reintegrated into the genome through <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination
          occurring between the episomal signal joint and an immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor target.
          We further demonstrate that cryptic recombination sites involved in T-cell acute
          lymphoblastic leukemia–associated chromosomal translocations constitute hotspots
          of insertion. Eventually, the identification of two in vivo cases associating episomal
          reintegration and chromosomal translocation suggests that reintegration events are linked
          to genomic instability. Altogether, our data suggest that V(D)J-mediated reintegration of
          episomal circles, an event likely eluding classical cytogenetic screenings, might
          represent an additional potent source of genomic instability and lymphoid cancer.</p>

          <p>Lymphoid cells recognize billions of pathogens as a result of gene rearrangements that
            generate pathogen-specific B- and T-cell receptors. This genetic reshuffling, called
            V(D)J recombination, occasionally misfires and damages genomic integrity. When such
            aberrations dysregulate proto-oncogenes, cancer ensues. It has become increasingly clear
            that multiple oncogenes acting in different cellular pathways can cooperate to cause
            cancer. Nevertheless, in the case of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, about a third
            of cases display oncogene activation in the absence of identified aberration, suggesting
            the presence of additional mechanisms of chromosomal alteration. In the hunt for such
            mechanisms, episomal circles (DNA segments that are excised during V(D)J recombination)
            have recently drawn attention. Moreover, signal joints, short sequences formed after
            gene rearrangements, once considered harmless, now appear to take part in events that
            might compromise genomic integrity. Using ex vivo recombination assays and genetically
            modified mice, we demonstrate that episomal circles may be reintegrated into the genome
            through recombination occurring between the episomal signal joints and a T-cell receptor
            target. Furthermore, we show that cryptic recombination sites located in the vicinity of
            oncogenes constitute hotspots of episomal insertion. Altogether, our results suggest
            that reintegration of excised episomal circles constitute a potential source of genomic
            instability and cancer in leukemia and lymphoma.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>V(D)J recombination is a unique mechanism of somatic recombination aimed to provide a large
        antigen receptor repertoire in T and B cells (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b001">1</xref>] and references therein). During
        this process, the variable (V) diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments present within
        the immunoglobulin (IG) and T-cell receptor (TCR) loci, are assembled to form a complete VDJ
        exon encoding the variable region of the IG/TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The recombination requires the presence of
        specific motifs flanking all the V, D, and J gene segments (12– and
        23–recombination signal sequences [RSSs]), and allowing the
        recruitment, binding, and proper positioning of the products of the recombination activating
        genes 1 and 2 <italic>(RAG-1/2).</italic> Recent data suggest that in vivo, RAG-1/2 proteins
        initiate the rearrangement by performing a first single-strand nick at the exact border
        between a 12-RSS and its adjacent coding gene segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b002">2</xref>]. This leads to the capture of a 23-RSS, the
        formation of a 12/23 synaptic complex in which the two DNA/protein structures are held in
        close juxtaposition, and the generation of another nick at the captured 23-RSS. Within this
        complex, RAG-1/2 catalyzes a <italic>trans</italic>-esterification reaction in which each
        liberated hydroxyl group attacks the opposite DNA strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b003">3</xref>]; this generates four broken ends held in a
        postcleavage synaptic complex: two blunt RSSs or signal ends (SEs), and two covalently
        sealed hairpin coding ends (CEs). The broken ends are then efficiently repaired by the
        nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b006">6</xref>]; on the one hand, hairpins present at the CEs are resolved through the
        Artemis endonuclease activity; when opened at bases off the apex, hairpin opening generates
        overhanging flaps, which, if filled in by a DNA polymerase activity, form palindromic (P)
        stretches. Nontemplated (N) nucleotides may be added de novo by the terminal
        deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and/or nucleotides may be deleted from the CEs. Ligation
        of the processed CEs forms a highly diversified coding joint (CJ). By contrast, the two SEs
        present in the synaptic complex undergo only limited processing (some N addition and rare
        nucleotide deletion) before joining into signal joints (SJs). While CJs give rise to the
        functional recombination products, the SJs are merely the byproduct of V(D)J recombination.</p>

      <p>SJs have until recently been assumed to be “harmless” and irrelevant in
        the dynamics of the V(D)J recombination process, but evidence now starts to accumulate that
        this is not the case, and that they play unsuspected roles in events which might compromise
        genomic integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b008">8</xref>]. SJs are indeed constituted of
        two functional RSSs fused back to back, each of which therefore potentially capable of
        further V(D)J rearrangement in presence of RAG-1/2. The issue of SJ reactivity was initially
        addressed ex vivo by the use of integrated minilocus and transient extrachromosomal
        recombination substrates containing germline gene segments flanked by their RSSs, and
        undergoing rearrangement in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b011">11</xref>].
        Both integrative and extrachromosomal experiments indicated that, following a first
        rearrangement by inversion, the SJ produced was indeed reactive, and could engage into
        further cycles of rearrangement with RSS partners in <italic>cis</italic> (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g001">1</xref>D). In vivo and ex vivo observations have revealed that
        the products resulting from such secondary SJ rearrangements consist of one new SJ and one
        hybrid RSS/coding-segment junction (hybrid joint [HJ]), albeit with the
        molecular features of a CJ (i.e., with N nucleotide insertion, and extensive nucleotide
        deletion and P nucleotide addition at both the RSS and coding segment sides; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b012">12</xref>]. This
        junction, which we refer to as a “pseudo-hybrid” joint (ΨHJ), is
        thereby morphologically distinguishable from CJs, SJs, and to a large extent from
        “genuine” HJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b018">18</xref>].
        ΨHJs constitute therefore specific signatures of such ongoing SJ rearrangement
        events. Interestingly, recent in vivo data suggest that IGK/IGL rearrangement hierarchy and
        isotypic exclusion might in part be achieved by ongoing SJ recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b012">12</xref>]. Thus, SJ reactivity might
        have also evolved as part of the dynamics of the V(D)J rearrangement process. Eventually,
        the pathological counterpart of this possible physiological extension of the V(D)J
        recombination capability has also been shown to occur in cases of oncogenic chromosomal
        translocation, in which ongoing rearrangement of the resulting chromosomal SJ (CSJ)
        constitutes the source of oncogene activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b008">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the normal process of V(D)J recombination, the large majority of SJs produced is however
        not retained on the chromosome, but excised on episomal circles (ECs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Because ex vivo RAG binding (or rebinding) also
        efficiently takes place on episomal SJs (ESJs), leading to SJ recleavage and, at least in
        vitro, to RAG transposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b007">7</xref>], we reasoned that ongoing <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination
        might also and concurrently occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g001">Figure
        1</xref>B). This might result in the same type of <italic>insertion</italic> of the whole
        circle into the genome as previously observed in vivo for RAG-mediated transposition
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b019">19</xref>], with the
        important difference that it would in this case employ <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J
        recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b023">23</xref>], a
        process potentially more efficient than RAG transposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b028">28</xref>].
        Both mechanisms might obviously lead to similar genomic instability events, including
        oncogenic activation/deregulation. In this report, we investigated V(D)J-mediated ESJ
        insertion as an additional potent source of genomic instability and oncogenic deregulation
        in lymphoid cells.</p>

        <title>ESJs Undergo <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J Recombination Ex Vivo</title>
        <p>To investigate the possibility that excised episomes can reintegrate the genome through
          ongoing recombination of the SJ, we first assessed the ability of an ESJ to undergo
            <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination in an ex vivo
          <italic>trans</italic>-recombination substrate assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b020">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Three different human ESJs and two standard
          RSSs were cloned in separate extrachromosomal recombination substrates; two genuine SJs
          were used as “donor” ESJ plasmids: Jδ1/Dδ3 and
          Ki/Jκ3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b012">12</xref>]; furthermore, an artificial Dβ1Δ ESJ was generated
          by mutagenesis deletion of the 12-bp Dβ1 coding sequence located between the
          Dβ1 5′ and 3′ RSSs; the human Jβ2.7 and
          VκA27 gene segments were used as 12-RSS “target” substrates.
          NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cotransfected with donor and target plasmids either with or
          without RAG-1/2 and TdT expression vectors. Bulk plasmid DNA was recovered after 48 h of
          culture, and junctions resulting from <italic>trans</italic>-recombination between the ESJ
          and the target RSS were amplified in a single round PCR. Primer combinations were designed
          to detect the 2 expected integration breakpoints complying with a 12/23 synapsis:
          combination (3 + 2) was used to detect putative SJs, and combination (1
          + 4) was used to detect putative ΨHJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). PCR products were revealed by an
          IRD800-labeled primer extension (PE) assay allowing a precise to-the-base resolution of
          the amplified species (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>

              no or limited nucleotide processing). PE assays shown were performed on 0.75 μl
              PCR. Five independent PCRs from two independent transfections performed with
              (T3–T4) or without RAG-1/2 (T1–T2) are shown for each
            junction.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>In absence of the RAGs, faint and nonrecurrent PCR products scattered at various sizes
          were obtained for both primer combinations (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, ΨHJ T2, ~160 bp; additional bands are
          also present outside the visualized parts of the gels). To assess the identity of such
          junctions, double-nested secondary PCR were performed, and the amplification products were
          cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis confirmed the occurrence of junctions that were
          not generated by RAG-mediated recombination, but rather due to random breaks joined
          through NHEJs and/or homologous recombination pathways (not shown). Such junctions,
          collectively referred to as “break/repair,” have been previously
          described, and represent the RAG-independent recombination background of the
          <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b029">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>In presence of RAGs, however, more intense and recurrent PCR products of the expected
          sizes were obtained for both PCR combinations (typical examples are illustrated for the
          Dβ1Δ × Jβ2.7 combination in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). SJ primer combination (3 + 2)
          usually displayed one major band and few minor species around that position, as expected
          from a standard SJ, which generally presents limited nucleotide processing. ΨHJ
          primer combination (1 + 4), on the other hand, displayed a pattern of intense
          bands around the expected size, representing the typical spectra of largely processed
          junctions. Sequence analysis of cloned products from double-nested secondary PCR confirmed
          the presence of the two specific breakpoints expected from V(D)J-mediated ongoing ESJ
          recombination in most cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g003">Figures 3</xref>
          and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g004">4</xref>; also, see below). Thus, and as
          anticipated from previous studies describing ongoing recombination of SJ with targets in
            <italic>cis,</italic> our results demonstrate that ESJs are also capable of ongoing
          efficient RAG-mediated recombination with RSS targets in <italic>trans</italic> in the
          context of a 12/23 synapsis. However, as the ESJ is formed by a functional 12-RSS and a
          functional 23-RSS, both potentially able to bind the RAGs, we next wondered if this
          particular structure might allow to bypass the 12/23 rule for synapsis and give rise to
          additional recombination products that we would fail to detect with the two primer
          combinations used above. Double-nested PCR with the two complementary primer combinations
          (1 + 3) and (2 + 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g002">Figure
            2</xref>A) corresponding to a 12/12 synapsis were thus performed on the same bulk DNA.
          Such combinations, however, gave rise to only weak amplification products. Cloning and
          sequencing confirmed in most cases the occurrence of the symmetrical 12/12 SJ (1
          + 3) and ΨHJ (2 + 4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). This suggests that although a fraction of
          the <italic>trans</italic>-recombination can occur in violation of the 12/23 rule (as in
          normal V(D)J recombination), this represents a minor population, and the large majority of
          the RAG-mediated recombinants are detected with primer combinations (3 + 2) and
          (1 + 4), in accordance with a 12/23 synapsis between the ESJ and its RSS target.
          Accordingly, the use of ESJ donors made of two 12-RSS in the context of a 12-RSS target
          did not give rise to any specific amplified signal, while each of the two RSS from an ESJ
          donor made of two 23-RSS gave rise to efficient recombination in the context of the same
          12-RSS target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg001">Figure
          S1</xref>B). In addition, the use of ESJ donor constructs made of one functional and one
          nonamerless RSS through deletional mutagenesis showed that while deletion of the nonamer
          from the reactive 23-RSS completely abolished recombination, deletion of the nonamer from
          the bystander 12-RSS did not modify the overall efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg001">Figure S1</xref>C).
          Altogether, our data clearly indicate that <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination of
          ESJ obeys the 12/23 rule and is not dependent on alternative mechanisms such as ESJ
          opening by nick–nick (see below for a potential role of nick–nick in
          the generation of some junctions).</p>

        <p>We next analyzed in details the sequences issued from recombination of the ESJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g004">4</xref>). SJs obtained were morphologically undistinguishable
          from standard SJs, with the presence of some N insertion and limited nucleotide deletion
            (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g003">Figure 3</xref>; 3T3). Likewise, detailed
          analysis of the ΨHJ revealed that in most sequences, end processing similar to
          that of a standard CJ (nucleotide deletion, N and P nucleotide addition) occurred at both
          the SE (the bystander 12-RSS of the ESJ) and the CE sides of the joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g004">Figure 4</xref>; 3T3). This strongly suggests
          that once engaged in synapsis, and despite its ability to bind the RAGs, the bystander RSS
          of the ESJ mostly behaves as a coding segment, and undergoes therefore the hairpin
          formation step, followed by hairpin resolution and further processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg002">Figure S2</xref>, left
          panel). Nevertheless, the presence of sequences containing a full-size ESJ bystander RSS
          (e.g., Jδ1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g004">Figure 4</xref>)
          together with the ambiguity in the assignment of P nucleotides in presence of TdT,
          suggested possible RAG binding on both ESJ RSSs, and involvement of alternative pathways
          of RAG-mediated recombination. To confirm the involvement of <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J
          recombination and to test the potential contribution of alternative pathways, the ESJ
          assay was repeated in the GUETEL Artemis-deficient cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b030">30</xref>]. During standard V(D)J
          recombination, failure to resolve hairpin CEs in absence of the Artemis endonuclease
          results in the absence of CJ formation without impeding SJ formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b033">33</xref>]. Similarly, the absence of Artemis in the
          ESJ assay should prevent ΨHJ formation without hindering the generation of SJs.
          Following cotransfection of the GUETEL cell line with the
          (Ki/Jκ3)ESJ/VκA27 couple, PCR was performed as above and the
          amplification products cloned and sequenced. As expected, SJs were obtained in absence of
          Artemis and were undistinguishable from SJs obtained both in the Artemis-proficient 3T3
          cells and in the GUETEL cell line complemented with Artemis (GUETEL-A; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b030">30</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Despite the absence of Artemis, weak
          amplification products were also obtained for the ΨHJ PCR combination (1
          + 4). However, the sequenced junctions displayed virtual absence of N insertion
          and nucleotide processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g004">Figure 4</xref>),
          in sharp contrast to the morphology of ΨHJs obtained in Artemis-proficient cells
          (3T3 and GUETEL-A). The features of the Artemis<sup>−/−</sup>
          junctions are however strongly reminiscent of HJs generated by the “RAG-mediated
          joining” pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b018">18</xref>].
          RAG-mediated joining is an NHEJ-independent pathway related to RAG transposition in which
          a direct attack of a free 3′ hydroxyl group from the SE into the hairpinned CE
          bypasses the hairpin resolution step (illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg002">Figure S2</xref>, right
          panel); this usually results in the generation of a class of HJs displaying a full-size
          RSS joined to a coding sequence with limited processing (depending on the position of the
          attack in the hairpin). The presence of such junctions in the absence of Artemis suggests
          that both <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination and RAG-mediated joining concurrently
          occur to generate ΨHJs and HJs, respectively. However, the virtual absence of such
          junctions in Artemis-proficient cells (3T3, Artemis-complemented) strongly suggests that
          RAG-mediated joining constitutes a minor recombination pathway compared to
          <italic>trans-</italic>V(D)J recombination. Thus, the junctions with a full-size ESJ
          bystander RSS initially observed in Artemis-proficient cells are Artemis dependent, and
          are either ΨHJs in which processing is limited due to RAG-binding on the bystander
          RSS, or HJs generated through “RSS swapping” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg002">Figure S2</xref>, middle
          panel).</p>
        <p>Altogether, our results indicate therefore that standard <italic>trans-</italic>V(D)J
          recombination is the major pathway of RAG-mediated ESJs ongoing rearrangement.</p>

        <title>ESJs Are as Efficient as Standard RSSs to Undergo <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J
          Recombination Ex Vivo</title>
        <p>How efficient is <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination of ESJs? In the case of
          recombination between two standard coding-segment RSSs, the frequency of
          <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination has been previously shown to be reduced
          compared to <italic>cis</italic>-V(D)J recombination events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b021">21</xref>]. In the present case of recombination
          between an ESJ and its RSS target, the presence of the second RSS in the SJ could
          structurally impede—or on the contrary stimulate—RAG fixation and/or
          activity on the reactive one, and modify the overall recombination efficiency. We
          therefore compared in the ex vivo assay the efficiency of <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J
          recombination of an ESJ and a RSS target with the efficiency of
          <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination between two standard coding-segment RSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). To do so, we tested two pairs
          of plasmids: (Jδ1/Dδ3) ESJ × Jβ2.7 versus
          Dδ3 × Jβ2.7, and (Dβ1ΔESJ ×
          Jβ2.7 versus Dβ1 × Jβ2.7. Following transfection and
          harvesting carried out as above, semiquantitative primary PCR amplification of the
          breakpoints was performed, and serial dilutions were revealed by PE. As illustrated in
            <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g005">Figure 5</xref>B for the
          (Jδ1/Dδ3) ESJ × Jβ2.7 versus Dδ3
          × Jβ2.7 couples, no significant difference could be seen in the
          formation rate of SJs in the presence of an ESJ. Similarly, results showed comparable
          rates in the formation of a ΨHJ relative to a CJ. We conclude that ESJs are at
          least as efficient as standard RSSs to undergo <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination.
          Altogether, this suggests that the presence of the bystander RSS does not impede the
          recombination process, whether structurally (through steric constraints) or functionally
          (through nick–nick activity). From the mechanistic point of view, this data
          predicts therefore that in vivo, V(D)J-mediated reintegration of ESJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) should not be different from
          V(D)J-mediated translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g001">Figure
          1</xref>C); most important, both processes should use the same RSS targets with the same
          efficiency.</p>

        <title>Cryptic RSSs Involved in Oncogenic Translocations Constitute Hotspots of Episomal
          Reintegration through Ongoing V(D)J Recombination of an ESJ</title>
        <p>V(D)J-mediated translocations have been shown to occur not only between authentic RSSs
          from distinct IG/TCR loci, but also between authentic RSSs and fortuitous sequences in the
          genome resembling a RSS (cryptic RSSs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b034">34</xref>]. The mistargeting of the RAGs towards
          cryptic RSSs located in the vicinity of a silent proto-oncogene is a recurrent source of
          genomic instability and oncogenesis. Erroneous targeting of cryptic sites located near the
            <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>TAL2</italic> proto-oncogenes in t(11;14)(p13;q11) and
          t(7;9)(q34;q32) translocations, respectively, represent prototypical examples of such
          oncogenic translocations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b037">37</xref>].
          Our data above suggest that in vivo, such cryptic sites might provide efficient targets
          for ESJ reintegration. To further define the potential oncogenic properties of episomal
          reintegration, we next investigated in our ex vivo assay the capacity of ESJs to target
          oncogenic cryptic RSS. The human <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>TAL2</italic> cryptic
          RSSs and flanking sequences were cloned in a recombination substrate plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) and assayed in parallel to the
          Jβ2.7 segment as a target for the (Jδ1/Dδ3) ESJ, using the
          PCR/PE assay described above. Our results show a similar considerable high rate of
          V(D)J-mediated recombination of the ESJ with the <italic>LMO2</italic> and
          <italic>TAL2</italic> cryptic RSSs than with the Jβ2.7 authentic RSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). To further estimate the
          likelihood in vivo of SJ insertion in such cryptic RSS<italic>,</italic> the
          <italic>LMO2</italic> versus the <italic>HPRT</italic> intron 1 region were assayed as
          competitive targets for the (Jδ1/Dδ3 ESJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). The <italic>HPRT</italic> intron 1 region was
          chosen as a competitor because it contains a well-described cryptic RSS classically
          involved in illegitimate V(D)J-mediated deletion of exons 2–3 in vivo
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b038">38</xref>], and has
          also been identified as a site of ESJ reintegration in vivo ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b039">39</xref>]; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>) as well as a region of RAG transposition in vivo
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b019">19</xref>]. While
          recombination with the <italic>LMO2</italic> cryptic RSS constituted a hotspot of
          integration, no recombination could be observed in the <italic>HPRT</italic> region,
          neither specifically at the cryptic RSS, nor in the surrounding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Similar results were obtained
          when using a target plasmid containing a second copy of the <italic>HPRT</italic> fragment
          in a head-to-tail orientation, and forming a cruciform structure (not shown). Altogether,
          these data strongly suggest that cryptic sites such as <italic>LMO2</italic> with much
          higher recombinogenic potential than the <italic>HPRT</italic> intron 1 cryptic RSS might
          also be targeted in vivo by ESJ insertion and could potentially lead to oncogenic
          activation.</p>

        <title><italic>trans</italic>-Chromosomal ΨHJ Breakpoints Are Readily Detectable In
          Vivo</title>
        <p>We next investigated the physiological relevance of the reintegration of excised episomes
          through ongoing SJ recombination. As a first approach, we sought to assess if
            <italic>trans</italic>-chromosomal ΨHJ breakpoints were present and detectable
          in vivo, and if so, to estimate their formation rate. To do so, we designed primer
          combinations allowing the amplification of <italic>trans</italic>-TCR ΨHJ in mouse
          thymocyte DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050043-t001">Table 1</xref>). Additional
          combinations designed to amplify <italic>trans</italic>-TCR CJs and
          <italic>trans</italic>-TCR SJs were also performed as reference. To detect such relatively
          rare <italic>trans</italic>-TCR recombination events, we used a sensitive fluctuation PCR
          assay allowing the detection of less than one recombination event in a million cells (see
            <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Positive PCR-amplification
          replicates were obtained for all <italic>trans</italic>-TCR combinations in the broad
          range of ~1 in 1,000,000 cells to 1 in 10,000 cells. Sequence analysis of the
          PCR-amplification products was carried out to assess the identity of the junctions, and
          revealed the presence of ΨHJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), CJs, and SJs (not shown). Importantly, the
          ΨHJs obtained in vivo displayed the same molecular features as observed in the ex
          vivo assay, with extensive nucleotide processing on both sides of the junctions, and N/P
          addition. These results clearly demonstrate that ΨHJ breakpoints are indeed
          generated in vivo. Furthermore, such junctions are readily detectable in mouse thymocytes
          at a range similar to that of equivalent <italic>trans</italic>-CSJs and CJs. In line with
          our ex vivo results, this indicates that in vivo, SJs undergo efficient ongoing
            <italic>cis</italic>- and/or <italic>trans</italic>-rearrangement with RSS targets in
          the genome with surprisingly high frequency. This suggests further that in presence of
          RAGs, CSJs and/or ESJs are indeed very recombinogenic structures.</p>

          and TCRδ/β translocations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050043-t001">Table 1</xref>), were crossed with a Dβ1GFP knockin
          mouse, in which the introduction of the GFP in the Dβ1 gene segment and flanking
          23-RSS abolishes Dβ1-Jβ1/2 rearrangements (SS, OC, PF, unpublished
          data). In the (Dβ1<sup>GFP</sup> × Eβ<sup>−</sup>)
          double-mutant (DE) mice, all TCRβ chains are consequently produced via a
          Vβ-Dβ2-Jβ2 rearrangement from the Dβ1<sup>GFP</sup>
          allele (unpublished data), and all TCR excision circles issued from
          Dβ-Jβ rearrangements carry a (Dβ2Jβ2) ESJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Because one allele is knocked

          TCRβ cannot be present in TCRαβ<sup>+</sup> cells
          from DE mice. In absence of translocation to TCRβ, no
          <italic>trans</italic>-TCRβδ CSJ is produced, and all

        <title>High Rates of Chromosomal Aberrations Combining Insertion and Translocation</title>
        <p>During our screen of <italic>trans</italic>-TCR SJs described above, we noticed the
          presence of amplification products larger than expected. Out of a total of 310 PCR
          replicates of seven distinct <italic>trans</italic>-TCRδ/β SJ
          combinations, 120 were PCR positive and four were of unexpected larger size (unpublished
          data). Sequencing of the cloned products revealed that large amplicons resulted from
            <italic>cis</italic>-V(D)J recombination to a cryptic site in one case, and to a
          downstream gene segment in another case; eventually, two of the four cases showed the
          insertion of a sequence from the TCRδ locus with features compatible with
          RAG-mediated ESJ reintegration. In one of these two cases, a ~900-bp
          Jδ1-Dδ2 fragment was inserted into a Jβ2.7/Vδ2 CSJ
          target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). The breakpoints
          consisted of a perfect SJ on the right arm of the insertion; on the left arm, a junction
          compatible with a ΨHJ was found, displaying a deletion of three nucleotides on one
          side of the joint, a deletion of one nucleotide on the other side, and one N nucleotide
          addition; in the second case, the same ~900-bp Jδ1-Dδ2 fragment was
          observed inserted into a Dβ1/Vδ2 CSJ target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050043-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Similarly, one of the breakpoints displayed a
          perfect SJ, and the other breakpoint consisted of an SJ with 2 N insertions. Considering
          the structure of the target, this last junction was ambiguous to assign as an SJ or a
          ΨHJ, and could have occurred through nick–nick, V(D)J, and/or
          RAG-mediated joining. Nevertheless, all junctions complied with the 12/23 rule and with
          features of RAG-mediated breaks, and it is therefore very likely that both cases represent
          in vivo examples of RAG-mediated reintegration of a Jδ1-Dδ2 ESJ. In
          the two cases, both ESJ reintegration and translocation events occurred, and two
          mechanisms could therefore account for their formation: either the
          <italic>trans</italic>-TCR translocations occurred first, and provided a
          <italic>trans</italic>-TCR SJ target for ESJ reintegration; or, alternatively, ESJ
          reintegration in a standard RSS target (e.g., Vδ2) could have occurred first,
          and provided a <italic>trans</italic>-TCR structure and/or breakpoints prone to
          V(D)J-mediated translocation. Intriguingly, the actual frequency of this double
          translocation/insertion event (2/120 = ~10<sup>−2</sup>
          <italic>trans</italic>-recombination events) was not compatible with the expected combined
          frequency of each independent event: (<italic>trans</italic>-TCR translocation
            ~10<sup>−4</sup>–10<sup>−6</sup> × reintegration
            ~10<sup>−4</sup>–10<sup>−6</sup> =
            ~10<sup>−8</sup>–10<sup>−12</sup>). Furthermore, as the
          assay is limited to PCR-amplifiable sizes of the inserted fragment (such as the relatively
          short Jδ1-Dδ2 episome), the apparent rate of reintegration is probably
          vastly underestimated. This strongly suggests that the two events are linked, either
          because CSJs constitute preferential targets for ESJ reintegration, or because ESJ
          reintegration generates genomic instability leading to further chromosomal abnormalities;
          such abnormalities could consist of chromosomal translocations as detected here, or
          potentially more complex events which could not be detected in the present in vivo assay.</p>

      <p>During B- and T-cell ontogeny, ECs are sequentially excised from the genome of lymphoid
        cells as a result of the hierarchically regulated D-to-J, V-to-DJ, and V-to-J rearrangement
        events. Such episomes are believed to be nonreplicative, but have nevertheless been shown to
        be surprisingly stable structures, persisting until diluted out by cell divisions

        functional RSSs, each of which are susceptible to (re-)bind the RAG proteins when
        (re-)expressed at the various cell maturation steps until final downregulation
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b043">43</xref>]. On the other hand, <italic>trans-</italic>V(D)J recombination
        occurring between RSSs or cryptic RSSs located on distinct chromosomes is a relatively
        common event in developing lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b044">44</xref>], which has
        been shown to lead to recurrent oncogenic translocations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b034">34</xref>]. Here we show both ex vivo and in vivo that
        ECs may be reintegrated into the genome through <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination
        occurring between the ESJ and an IG/TCR or one of the many cryptic RSS targets scattered in
        the genome.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Molecular Mechanisms of ESJ Reintegration in Ex Vivo Assays</title>
        <p>We have demonstrated in ex vivo assays that the efficiency of
          <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination of an ESJ with a RSS target is not
          quantitatively different from the <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination occurring
          between two RSSs. This is somehow unexpected, because its particular structure confers
          additional properties to the ESJ. ESJs are efficiently cleaved ex vivo and in vitro by the
          nick–nick mechanism, a symmetrical nick occurring 5′ of each RSS
          (simultaneously or sequentially) and generating two flush SEs ending with 3′
          hydroxyl groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b007">7</xref>]. Remarkably, this process bypasses both the formation of a hairpin
          intermediate and the need of synapsis with another RSS. In the context of ongoing SJ
          recombination, one could think that efficient nick–nick opening of lone ESJs
          upon RAG binding might prevent the occurrence of synapsis with a RSS target, and thus
          considerably reduce the overall frequency of <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J rearrangement.
          Our ex vivo data clearly argue against this assumption, and suggest that
          <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J rearrangement is largely independent of nick–nick.
          This however does not preclude that ESJ opening by nick–nick might occasionally
          participate in the synapsis, and the recent in vivo demonstration of synapsis by capture
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b002">2</xref>] provides a
          plausible two-step scenario of the occurrence of nick–nick within a 12/23
          synapse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg004">Figure
          S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Incidentally, our data provides additional evidence that HJs can be formed ex vivo
          through both NHEJ-dependent and NHEJ-independent pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).
          RAG-mediated joining has been initially proposed as an efficient alternative pathway of
          NHEJ-independent HJ formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b018">18</xref>].
          However, conflicting data have been reported on the relevance of this pathway ex vivo and
          in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b046">46</xref>]. In
          particular, recent data indicated that at least ex vivo, RAG-mediated joining is seldom
          observed in presence of full-length RAGs, even in the absence of the concurrent NHEJ
          pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b046">46</xref>]. We find here the presence
          of HJ with features of RAG-mediated joining in the absence, but not in the presence of
          Artemis, suggesting that at least ex vivo, HJ formation is a mixed process consisting of
          efficient RSS “swapping” and inefficient RAG-mediated joining.
          Interestingly, it is possible that the frequency of RAG-mediated joining would be favored
          in our assay, due to the participation of an ESJ. As mentioned above, nick–nick
          opening of the ESJ in the context of a 12/23 synaptic complex would generate two flush SEs
          ending with 3′ hydroxyl groups. While the two reactive RSSs might be sequestered
          by tight binding in the SE postcleavage complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg004">Figure S4</xref>), this additional free 3′ OH would
          provide an available substrate for hairpin attack, at least in absence of concurrent
          hairpin resolution by Artemis. Thus, nick–nick opening might participate in both
            <italic>trans</italic>-V(D)J recombination and RAG-mediated joining.</p>

        <title>In Vivo Reintegration of Excised ECs by the V(D)J Recombinase</title>
        <p>Using WT and DE double-mutant mice, we could estimate that ESJ reintegration in authentic
          TCR RSS targets occurs in vivo in the broad range of 1 in 1,000,000 to 1 in 10,000 mouse
          thymocytes, depending on the integration site. In agreement with our results, recent data
          provide further evidence for the existence of V(D)J-mediated ESJ reintegration in vivo,
          and concur with the idea that it constitutes a significant source of genomic instability.
          Using a screen for <italic>HPRT</italic> mutants, Finette and colleagues recently
          identified a case in which a Vα/Jα episome was found inserted in the
          cryptic 23-RSS from <italic>HPRT</italic> intron 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b039">39</xref>]. This finding is all the more remarkable
          given that this <italic>HPRT</italic> cryptic site has been shown to exhibit a very low
          recombinogenic potential in functional assays ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b047">47</xref>], our unpublished data), and provides direct
          evidence that in vivo, human cryptic RSSs constitute efficient targets for ESJ
          reintegration. In the same line, using a double selection assay allowing for the recovery
          and quantification of excision/reinsertion events in a pre–B-cell line, Reddy et
          al. recently identified three cases of V(D)J-mediated reintegration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b048">48</xref>]. In full agreement with our
          in vivo estimation, they evaluated a rate of one reintegration out of every 100,000 V(D)J
          recombinations. Considering the average number of V(D)J recombination per B or T cell,
          these data suggest that the daily lymphocyte output in human could be accompanied by as
          many as 5,000 ESJ reintegration events.</p>

        <p>Authentic RSSs from IG/TCR must without doubt constitute preferential targets for such
          reintegration. However, there are an estimated 10 million functional cryptic sites
          dispersed throughout the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b047">47</xref>], some of them displaying much higher recombinogenic potential than
          the <italic>HPRT</italic> intron 1 cryptic RSS in which ESJ reintegration was found
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b037">37</xref>]. Most important, some of them are already
          known to provide recurrent targets for oncogenic (type 1) V(D)J-mediated translocations.
          In T-ALL, for example, the mistargeting of the RAGs towards such cryptic RSSs located in
          the vicinity of a silent proto-oncogene is a recurrent source of genomic instability and
          oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b034">34</xref>].
          We demonstrate in our ex vivo assay that cryptic sites involved in oncogenic
          V(D)J-mediated translocations are also hotspots for ESJ recombination; it seems thus
          reasonable to think that in vivo, such cryptic RSSs might provide as efficient targets for
          ESJ reintegration than for chromosomal translocations. ESJ reintegration could lead to
          similar oncogenic activation/deregulation, either through the insertion of active immune
          regulatory elements (e.g., the TCRδ enhancer excised during
          ΔRec/ΨJα or Vα/Jα rearrangements
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b049">49</xref>], or the IGK enhancer excised during KDE/Ki

          et al., unpublished data).</p>
        <p>If ESJs are at least as efficient as any standard coding-segment RSS to undergo V(D)J
          recombination with a RSS target in <italic>trans,</italic> the two processes are nearly
          identical mechanistically, and the RSS/cryptic RSS targets are the same, why then has
          V(D)J-mediated oncogenic translocation been largely documented in the literature, but
          V(D)J-mediated reintegration never been reported up to now in lymphoid malignancies?
          Higher-order spatial genome organization is a contributing factor in the formation of
          recurrent translocations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b053">53</xref>]. In contrast, increased mobility of the EC might favor interactions
          and recombination of ESJs, with targets located in parts of the genome generally
          segregated. Oncogenic targets might thus be distinct for reintegration and translocation.
          However, due to the multiplicity and size range (from &lt;1 Kb to several Mb) of the
          excised episomes, as well as the diversity of insertion targets, reintegration events are
          very unlikely to be detected by routine analysis. Particularly, and in contrast to
          chromosomal translocations, episomal reintegration is invisible by standard karyotype

          neoplasia provide proof of principle that episomal reintegration can indeed lead to
          cancer, and illustrate the complexity and unlikelihood of identifying such events without
          specifically designed screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b057">57</xref>].
          For example, using complex DNA fiber-FISH and three-color interphase FISH techniques on
          samples from follicular lymphoma patients devoid of the hallmark t(14;18)(q32;q21)
          translocation, Vaandrager et al. identified two cases in which the <italic>BCL2</italic>
          gene was excised from 18q21 and inserted into the IGH locus at 14q32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b058">58</xref>]. The relatively high
          frequency (5%) of such events, discovered relatively recently by Vaandrager et
          al. out of an abundantly studied and characterized pathology, illustrate well the extent
          to which insertional events might be missed by routine cytogenetic and molecular analysis.
          Another possibility which could account for the rarity of cases of episomal reintegration
          observed in lymphoid neoplasia is that episomal reinsertions might generate unstable
          transitory structures in the genome, leading to additional aberration events and more
          complex genomic configuration. This possibility is supported by the unexpected high
          frequency of two in vivo cases observed in this study, combining ESJ reintegration and
          translocation events. Similar examples of genomic instability following reintegration of
          episomal structures have been previously documented. In mouse plasmacytoma, Kovalchuk and
          colleagues have shown that class-switch–mediated Eμ/Sμ episomal
          reintegration into c-MYC favors t(12;15) translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b056">56</xref>]. Although the ground of such instability is
          not yet clear, an obvious possibility is that a fraction of the recombination events might
          lead to incomplete insertion in vivo. Alternatively, the reinserted episomes might in vivo
          retain their initial “open” chromatinized structures, and provide
          preferential accessible targets for the recombination machinery. The V(D)J-mediated
          instability of reinserted ESJs would be especially relevant in neoplastic cells such as
          T-ALLs, in which arrest of differentiation at early stages of T-cell development leads to
          sustained RAG levels.</p>
        <p>Gene profiling studies have shown that a substantial fraction of the T-ALL cases display
          oncogenic activation in absence of detectable chromosomal alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b059">59</xref>], suggesting the presence of
          alternative pathways of oncogenesis. Some of them have indeed been recently discovered,
          and involve episomal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050043-b060">60</xref>]. Considering the large number of ESJs produced daily and the
          mechanistic similarities between ESJ reintegration and oncogenic translocations, our data
          suggest that reintegration of excised ECs by the V(D)J recombinase might also account for
          some of these cases, and constitute an additional potent source of genomic instability.
          Definitive answer to this open question will however await large-scale screens of human
          lymphoid cancer samples with specifically adapted strategies.</p>

          plasmids recovered by alkaline lysis and phenol-chloroform extraction as previously

          <title>Three Possible Pathways of a RAG-Mediated Hybrid Junction Resulting from Ongoing
            Recombination of an ESJ in <italic>trans</italic></title>
          <p>(Left) ESJ opens by standard RAG-mediated nick and
            <italic>trans</italic>-esterification in the context of a normal 12/23 synapsis; despite
            its ability to bind the RAGs, the bystander 12-RSS of the ESJ behaves as a coding
            segment, and undergoes hairpin formation. Artemis-dependent hairpin resolution, further
            processing, and NHEJ-dependent repair leads to a ΨHJ displaying processing on
            both sides of the joint; nevertheless, processing may be more limited at the RSS side,
            due to protection conferred by RAG binding.</p>
          <p>(Middle) SJ opening by nick–nick in the context of a standard 12/23 synapse
            (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg004">Figure S4</xref>
            for details) provides an ESJ 12-RSS with a free 3′ OH. As an alternative, a
            rare 12/12 synapsis might also provide an ESJ 12-RSS with a free 3′ OH. In an
            Artemis-dependent pathway, hairpins are resolved by Artemis, processing occurs, and
            intermediate products are mistakenly repaired by RSS “swapping,”
            leading to HJ formation. Because the ESJ 12-RSS did not go through a hairpin formation,
            and is bound to the RAGs, limited processing occurs at the RSS side.</p>
          <p>(Right) In the Artemis-independent RAG-mediated joining pathway, a direct attack of the
            ESJ 12-RSS free 3′ OH into the hairpinned CE bypasses the hairpin resolution
            step, and results in the generation of a class of HJ displaying a full-size RSS joined
            to a coding sequence with limited processing (depending on the position of the attack in
            the hairpin). In sequences from Artemis-proficient cells, the virtual absence of joints
            with features of RAG-mediated joining, the minor representation of products from 12/12
            synapsis, and the presence of nucleotide deletion/addition at both sides in most of the
            joints, indicate that in the vast majority of cases, ESJs opened by standard
            RAG-mediated nick and <italic>trans</italic>-esterification in the context of a normal
            12/23 synapsis.</p>

          <p>In a first step, both the target 12-RSSs and the ESJ 12-RSSs would independently
            undergo a RAG-specific nick; in a second step, the RAG-associated prenicked 12-RSS
            target would capture the 23-RSSs of the prenicked ESJ, forming a synaptic complex and
            initiating the second, symmetrical nick at the ESJ, eventually resulting to its opening
            in absence of transesterification. Although flush ESJ 12-RSSs could also be provided by
            rare 12/12 synapses, the two-step nick–nick process provides a potential
            pathway by which HJs could be generated in the context of a 12/23 synapse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050043-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Ellipses

          <title>Calibration of the PCR/PE Assay</title>
          <p>The PCR/PE assay was tested by performing PCR amplification on serial dilutions of bulk
            DNA harvested from transfections.</p>
          <p>(A) A portion (10 μl) of the reaction was loaded on ethidium
            bromide–stained 1% agarose gel (M, 100-bp marker). The expected
            band (319 bp) is not detectable at any dilution.</p>
          <p>(B) A portion (1 μl) of the PCR was then used for the PE assay, in the same
            conditions as described in Materials and Methods. The PCR/PE assay for the
            (Jδ1/Dδ3) ESJ/Jβ2.7 T1 transfection is shown, and
            illustrates the dynamic range of the assay. Bulk DNA (1 μl) was subsequently used
            as the standard condition for semiquantitative PCR.</p>
          <p>(C) PE assay conditions were also tested on serial dilutions of PCR amplification
            products performed on 1 μl harvested bulk DNA. Three dilutions (1.5 μl,
            1.0 μl, 0.75 μl) were used as the standard condition for the PE assay.</p>
          <p>(D) Primer calibrations. Triplex PCR amplifications were performed in the same
            conditions as the primary PCR described in Materials and Methods, using a 1:1:1 mix of
            the indicated primers, and on serial dilutions of a 1:1 mix of plasmid DNA constructs
            containing the appropriate tags (indicated in brackets); each primer couple amplified
            its specific target with similar sensitivity, indicating that there is no large bias in
            the PCR detection of the rearrangements due to the use of distinct primers.</p>
          <p>(E) Similarly, the efficiencies of the various labeled PE primers were also compared on
            serial dilutions from primary PCR. PE assays were performed in the same conditions as
            described in Materials and Methods, using the indicated labeled primers (*), on serial
            dilutions of the last dilution point (0.25 pg) of the corresponding triplex PCR. Again,
            primer comparison shows a similar sensitivity, indicating that there is no large bias in
            the PE detection of the rearrangements.</p>
