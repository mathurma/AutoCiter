<abstract>
<p>The cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria, a structure comprising an outer (OM) and an inner (IM) membrane, is essential for life. The OM and the IM are separated by the periplasm, a compartment that contains the peptidoglycan. The OM is tethered to the peptidoglycan via the lipoprotein, Lpp. However, the importance of the envelope’s multilayered architecture remains unknown. Here, when we removed physical coupling between the OM and the peptidoglycan, cells lost the ability to sense defects in envelope integrity. Further experiments revealed that the critical parameter for the transmission of stress signals from the envelope to the cytoplasm, where cellular behaviour is controlled, is the IM-to-OM distance. Augmenting this distance by increasing the length of the lipoprotein Lpp destroyed signalling, whereas simultaneously increasing the length of the stress-sensing lipoprotein RcsF restored signalling. Our results demonstrate the physiological importance of the size of the periplasm. They also reveal that strict control over the IM-to-OM distance is required for effective envelope surveillance and protection, suggesting that cellular architecture and the structure of transenvelope protein complexes have been evolutionarily co-optimised for correct function. Similar strategies are likely at play in cellular compartments surrounded by 2 concentric membranes, such as chloroplasts and mitochondria.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats that humanity faces today. In particular, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria has become a pressing issue. Infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria are indeed difficult to treat because of the presence of a double-membraned envelope that renders these bacteria less permeable to many antibiotics. Bacteria invest a great deal in protecting their envelope. They have evolved complex stress-sensing systems that allow them to monitor envelope integrity in order to detect and fix damage when it occurs. Here, using the model bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, we show that the ability to sense and respond to stress depends on the architecture of the cell envelope, in general, and on the distance between the 2 membranes, in particular. Thus, searching for drugs targeting envelope architecture is an attractive strategy for new antibacterials. In addition, our work reveals the physiological function of the Braun’s lipoprotein (Lpp), the numerically most abundant protein in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and the first lipoprotein that was discovered several decades ago.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although the multilayered architecture of the cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria was first described in the 1960s, we are still unraveling the links between the structure of this cellular component and its functions in the cell. The envelope of these bacteria consists of an inner membrane (IM), a classical phospholipid bilayer around the cytoplasm, and an outer membrane (OM), an asymmetric structure with phospholipids in the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharides in the outer leaflet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref001">1</xref>]. The space between the IM and the OM defines the periplasm, a cellular compartment that contains the peptidoglycan, a polymer of glycan strands cross-linked by short peptides that provides shape and osmotic protection to cells. This multilayered envelope, which contributes to cellular integrity and modulates permeability, is required for life and serves as an interface to the external milieu. Several essential protein machineries are present in the cell envelope, where they engage in processes that are important for envelope assembly and protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref005">5</xref>]. Many of these machineries span the periplasm, with components in both the IM and OM. The pathways that assemble the envelope and that monitor envelope integrity are tightly coordinated in order to sense and respond to damage. However, while the mechanisms of these pathways and how they cooperate to ensure envelope homeostasis have been the focus of numerous studies, the extent to which they depend on the architecture of this compartment for correct functioning is unknown.</p>
<p>To close this gap, here we investigated a key player in the organization of the cell envelope of Enterobacteriaceae: the small, alpha-helical protein Lpp, also known as Braun’s lipoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref006">6</xref>]. Lpp is numerically the most abundant protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, with &gt;1 million copies per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref007">7</xref>]. Such an extreme abundance suggests that it plays a major role in the cell. Importantly, Lpp provides the only covalent connection between the OM and the peptidoglycan: it is anchored to the OM via a lipid moiety at its N-terminus and attached to the peptidoglycan via its C-terminus. The attachment of Lpp to the peptidoglycan is catalyzed by a family of L,D-transpeptidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref008">8</xref>] that link the C-terminal lysine of Lpp to a diaminopimelic acid residue in the peptide stems of the peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref009">9</xref>]. Three <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> periplasmic enzymes (YbiS, ErfK, YcfS) exhibit this activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref008">8</xref>]. Both this functional redundancy and the high abundance of Lpp suggest that it must be critically important to covalently connect the OM to the peptidoglycan. However, <italic>lpp</italic> deletion mutants grow and divide normally in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref010">10</xref>]. The physiological importance of Lpp and of covalently anchoring the OM to the peptidoglycan therefore remains enigmatic.</p>
<p>To control the critical biogenesis of the envelope and maintain its integrity, bacteria have evolved intricate signal transduction systems that induce stress responses to deal with potential dysfunctions and environmental insults to the envelope. In Enterobacteriaceae, the Regulation of Capsule Synthesis (Rcs) system monitors the integrity of the OM and the peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Drugs that interfere with peptidoglycan assembly or alter the lipopolysaccharide leaflet of the OM induce Rcs, which represses cellular motility and produces an extracellular capsule that functions like a protective shield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref014">14</xref>]. Rcs is a complex stress-signaling cascade involving at least 6 components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref012">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Most Rcs-inducing cues are sensed by RcsF, an OM-localized lipoprotein, which detects damage caused by chemicals targeting the OM or the peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref016">16</xref>] or by mutations in genes involved in envelope assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref017">17</xref>]. Under stress, RcsF interacts with IgaA, an IM protein, thus constituting a molecular signal that turns on the Rcs pathway via a phosphorylation cascade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s003">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref012">12</xref>]. Rcs therefore mediates signal transduction from the outmost cell layer (the peptidoglycan and the OM) to the control center of the cell (the cytoplasm). To what extent the functioning of a system such as Rcs, with components on both sides of the periplasm, depends on the architecture of the cell envelope remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we established that the transmission of stress signals from the OM to the IM depends on the size of the periplasm. By manipulating the length of the lipoprotein Lpp, we demonstrated that cells in which the IM-to-OM distance is artificially increased become blind to stress affecting the peptidoglycan and the OM. Remarkably, we restored the line of communication between the 2 membranes in cells with a larger envelope by increasing the length of the stress sensor lipoprotein RcsF. We also established that the OM must be covalently attached to the peptidoglycan for intermembrane communication to occur.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In order to interrogate the importance of attaching the OM to the peptidoglycan for the communication of information about cellular stress to the cytoplasm, we triggered the Rcs system in an RcsF-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref016">16</xref>] with the compound A22, which inhibits the actin-like protein MreB<sup>15</sup>, and mecillinam, a ß-lactam antibiotic, which inhibits the essential transpeptidase PBP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref019">19</xref>]. Both drugs cause cells to round and eventually lyse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref021">21</xref>]. Under these conditions, relative to wild-type (WT) cells, the Rcs pathway was impaired in a mutant lacking YbiS, the primary L,D-transpeptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref008">8</xref>], and even more in a mutant lacking all 3 L,D-transpeptidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref008">8</xref>] (Δ<italic>ybiS</italic>Δ<italic>erfK</italic>Δ<italic>ycfS</italic> cells, denoted Δ<italic>ldt3</italic> here) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

<title>The lack of Lpp-peptidoglycan attachment impairs Rcs activation in response to stress.</title>
<p>A chromosomal P<italic>rprA-lacZ</italic> fusion was used to monitor Rcs activity. (A) Deletion of <italic>ybiS</italic> alone (Δ<italic>ybiS</italic>) or of the 3 L,D-transpeptidases (YbiS, ErfK, YcfS) encoded by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Δ<italic>ldt3</italic>) impaired Rcs activity in response to 5 μg/ml A22 or 0.3 μg/ml mecillinam, compared to WT (<italic>F</italic><sub>(9, 36)</sub> = 39.45, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 2-way ANOVA). No significant difference was observed between nontreated and treated cells from the mutants. (B) Deletion of <italic>mdoG</italic> constitutively activated Rcs in the WT background (Δ<italic>mdoG</italic>) but not in cells lacking L,D-transpeptidase activity (Δ<italic>ldt3</italic>Δ<italic>mdoG</italic>). Baseline Rcs activity in Δ<italic>mdoG</italic> cells is significantly higher than that in Δ<italic>ldt3</italic>Δ<italic>mdoG</italic> cells (<italic>F</italic><sub>(6, 14)</sub> = 68.25, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 1-way ANOVA). Expressing WT YbiS from a low-copy plasmid (pAM238), but not an inactive mutant (YbiS<sub>C186A</sub>), restored Rcs activity in the Δ<italic>ldt3</italic>Δ<italic>mdoG</italic> mutant. Rcs activity in Δ<italic>ldt3</italic>Δ<italic>mdoG</italic> cells harbouring pYbiS was significantly higher than that in Δ<italic>ldt3</italic>Δ<italic>mdoG</italic> cells with empty plasmid or pYbiS<sub>C186A</sub> (<italic>F</italic><sub>(6, 14)</sub> = 68.25, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 1-way ANOVA). (C) Expressing WT YbiS from a low-copy plasmid (pAM238), but not an inactive mutant (YbiS<sub>C186A</sub>), also restored Rcs activity in Δ<italic>ldt3</italic> cells in response to mecillinam and A22. Rcs activity in treated cells harbouring pYbiS was significantly higher than that in treated cells with empty plasmid or pYbiS<sub>C186A</sub> (<italic>F</italic><sub>(8, 57)</sub> = 20.75, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 2-way ANOVA).

Deletion of <italic>mdoG</italic> has been reported to constitutively activate Rcs via RcsF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref022">22</xref>]. Expression of the L,D-transpeptidase YbiS, but not of a catalytically inactive variant, from a plasmid restored Rcs signalling both in the Δ<italic>ldt3</italic>Δ<italic>mdoG</italic> mutant and in the Δ<italic>ldt3</italic> mutant in response to A22/mecillinam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Thus, the inability to induce Rcs directly results from the lack of L,D-transpeptidase activity in these cells. Cells expressing an Lpp variant lacking the residue (K58 in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>) required for attachment of the protein to the peptidoglycan (Lpp<sub>ΔK58</sub>) were also unable to trigger Rcs in response to mecillinam, A22, or <italic>mdoG</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s005">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that cells become blind to insults that normally activate the Rcs system via RcsF when Lpp is detached from the peptidoglycan.</p>
<p>We then probed whether the failure to induce Rcs resulted specifically from the inability of RcsF to sense stress in cells with no peptidoglycan-linked Lpp. RcsF forms a complex with BamA, the key component of the β-barrel assembly machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref023">23</xref>], and with the β-barrel proteins OmpA, OmpC, and OmpF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref024">24</xref>]. When in complex with these proteins, RcsF is sequestered from IgaA, its downstream partner, and cannot activate Rcs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref011">11</xref>]. We previously reported that Rcs-inducing compounds such as A22 and mecillinam decrease the levels of the BamA-RcsF complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref011">11</xref>], likely because newly synthesised RcsF molecules cannot bind BamA under stress. In our model, failure to bind BamA prevents the sequestration of RcsF by β-barrel proteins, allowing RcsF to interact with IgaA and to turn on Rcs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref011">11</xref>]. Here, we determined that A22 and mecillinam decreased the levels of BamA-RcsF in Δ<italic>ldt3</italic> cells, similar to the decrease in WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s006">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). Thus, the absence of Rcs induction in cells with no peptidoglycan-bound Lpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s005">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>) did not result from an impaired ability of RcsF to sense stress.</p>
<p>Recent studies in <italic>Salmonella</italic> concluded that Lpp was a principal determinant of the size of the periplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref025">25</xref>], prompting us to consider the possibility that in cells with no peptidoglycan-bound Lpp, the structure of the cell envelope is affected in such a way that the OM lipoprotein RcsF cannot reach across the periplasm to contact IgaA in the IM and activate the Rcs system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Here, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a technique in which cells are preserved in a frozen-hydrated, near-native state, revealed that cells expressing Lpp<sub>ΔK58</sub> formed OM blebs and had envelope defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Similar morphological deformities were observed with the <italic>lpp</italic> deletion mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref026">26</xref>], indicating that, in the case of this mutant, deformities specifically resulted from the absence of covalent anchoring of the OM to the peptidoglycan. Interestingly, the average IM-to-OM distance increased by about 3 nm compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), which suggested that the absence of Rcs induction in cells with no peptidoglycan-bound Lpp could result from a larger periplasm. However, the IM-to-OM distance varied considerably along the cell axis, which complicated further interpretation of the results obtained in cells expressing Lpp<sub>ΔK58</sub>.</p>

<p>Increasing the length of Lpp was previously reported to change the IM-to-OM distance in <italic>Salmonella</italic> without causing OM blebbing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref025">25</xref>]. To clearly establish the importance of IM-to-OM distance in Rcs signalling, we engineered <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains expressing longer Lpp variants (insertions of 14 residues (Lpp<sub>+14</sub>) or 21 residues (Lpp<sub>+21</sub>)) from the native <italic>lpp</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s007">S5A Fig</xref>); with these strains, we sought to increase the IM-to-OM distance without altering Lpp cross-linking to the peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s007">S5B Fig</xref>). Strikingly, cryo-EM revealed that the IM-to-OM distance in these strains increased proportionally to the length of Lpp, with increases of 3 nm and 4 nm in cells expressing Lpp<sub>+14</sub> and Lpp<sub>+21</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We next used the engineered strains to test the impact of increasing the IM-to-OM distance on Rcs signalling. Remarkably, adding 14 or 21 residues to Lpp completely abolished Rcs activation: cells expressing Lpp<sub>+14</sub> or Lpp<sub>+21</sub> did not turn on Rcs when exposed to mecillinam or A22 or deleted for <italic>mdoG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Stress was still sensed by RcsF in these strains, as BamA-RcsF levels decreased under stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s008">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). In addition, retargeting RcsF to the IM by altering its sorting signal constitutively induced Rcs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s009">S7 Fig</xref>), as expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref015">15</xref>], indicating that Rcs could still be turned on in strains expressing Lpp<sub>+14</sub> or Lpp<sub>+21</sub>. Interestingly, increasing the length of Lpp was well tolerated: cells expressing Lpp<sub>+14</sub> or Lpp<sub>+21</sub> exhibited no growth defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s007">S5C Fig</xref>), did not bleb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and had WT morphology except for a larger periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<p>The results above are consistent with the hypothesis that RcsF does not activate the Rcs system when the size of the periplasm increases because RcsF cannot reach IgaA. If this hypothesis is correct, then making RcsF longer should allow this protein to span the increased IM-to-OM distance in order to reach IgaA and activate Rcs. RcsF has a 32-residue unstructured linker that is located upstream of the signalling domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref031">31</xref>] and that most likely allows the protein to reach the IM. To make RcsF longer, we added 7 residues to the C-terminal part of the linker (RcsF<sub>+7</sub>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s010">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>). Because this sequence is disordered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s010">S8C and S8D Fig</xref>), we predicted that adding it to the linker would increase the length of RcsF by 2–3 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s010">S8C Fig</xref>), roughly corresponding to the increase in length resulting from the addition of a 14-residue α-helix to Lpp (strain <italic>lpp</italic><sub>+14</sub>). Remarkably, expression of RcsF<sub>+7</sub> in cells producing Lpp<sub>+14</sub> fully restored Rcs signalling in response to <italic>mdoG</italic> deletion, A22, or mecillinam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). It also partially rescued signalling in cells expressing Lpp<sub>+21</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), in which the periplasmic size is larger than WT by 4 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Thus, increasing the length of RcsF restored normal Rcs signalling in cells in which the IM-to-OM distance was increased to a similar extent. These observations support our model that, in cells with a larger IM-to-OM distance, the absence of Rcs induction under stress results from the inability of RcsF to reach the other side of the periplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s011">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Taken together, our results reveal the importance of controlling the IM-to-OM distance in the maintenance of intermembrane communication within the cell envelope, establishing the physiological importance of the size of the periplasm and highlighting the exquisite architectural organisation of the envelope. In particular, we demonstrated that strict control over the IM-to-OM distance is required for effective envelope surveillance and protection during exponential growth. Even a slight increase in the size of the periplasm disrupted the line of communication between the OM and the IM, effectively disconnecting the outer part of the envelope from the cytoplasm, where cellular behaviour is controlled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s011">S9 Fig</xref>). Thus, envelope components have likely been subjected to evolutionary pressure to properly function in the strictly controlled dimensions of the periplasm. For example, the sizes of RcsF and of the periplasmic domain of IgaA must have been rigorously selected to allow the optimal transmission of stress signals between these 2 proteins across the envelope.</p>
<p>In addition, our observation that cells expressing longer Lpp variants had no phenotype in the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004303.s007">S5B–S5E Fig</xref>) reveals that the essential envelope-spanning machineries involved in elongation and division have enough intrinsic flexibility to adapt to changes in envelope architecture, suggesting that evolution has selected for robustness in the case of these systems. These results motivate future research to test whether the correct functioning of other envelope-spanning systems in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and other bacteria also depends on strict control over IM-to-OM distance and to determine the evolutionary advantage that makes the Rcs system so susceptible to changes in the size of the periplasm.</p>
<p>Recent work revealed that Lpp functions as an OM tether under normal growth conditions in <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref025">25</xref>]. Accordingly, removing the covalent connection between OM-anchored Lpp and the peptidoglycan leads to the formation of OM blebs in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Interestingly, although the average IM-to-OM distance was larger in cells expressing Lpp<sub>ΔK58</sub> than in cells expressing WT Lpp, WT size was maintained in substantial portions of the envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). A likely explanation is that in the absence of peptidoglycan-bound Lpp, envelope proteins such as the lipoprotein Pal and the β-barrel OmpA, which noncovalently bind peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref033">33</xref>], partially compensate for the loss of Lpp periplasmic spanners, sustaining WT size in some envelope areas. Strikingly, in cells expressing Lpp<sub>+14</sub> or Lpp<sub>+21</sub>, the IM-to-OM distance increased homogeneously along the cell axis, and no WT size was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004303.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>), suggesting that these longer versions of Lpp override proteins like Pal and OmpA and impose a larger periplasm. Thus, Lpp may act as both a tether and a support column for the OM.</p>
<p>Lpp was the first lipoprotein to be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref006">6</xref>]. However, the functional importance of this massively abundant protein remained poorly defined. Fifty years later, the crucial role of Lpp in controlling the architecture of the bacterial cell envelope, and in particular the IM-to-OM distance, is finally coming to light. The current investigation has revealed the importance of controlling this distance in the maintenance of intermembrane communication within the cell envelope. Cellular compartments surrounded by 2 concentric membranes occur in all kingdoms of life. By highlighting the importance of controlling the intermembrane distance in gram-negative bacteria, our work suggests that similar strategies are at play in other cellular compartments surrounded by 2 concentric membranes, such as chloroplasts and mitochondria.</p>

Rabbit anti-RcsF (from the Collet laboratory’s collection) and rabbit anti-Lpp (from the Hughes laboratory’s collection) were diluted 1:10,000 in 1% skim milk, TBS-T (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma; 1:10,000 in 1% skim milk, TBS-T) and washed with dilution buffer. Labelled proteins were detected via enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Thermo Scientific), which was imaged with a GE ImageQuant LAS4000 camera (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). To measure RcsF levels, band intensities were quantified using ImageJ 1.48v (NIH) and analysed with ImageQuant TL software 1Dv8.1 to ensure that they were within the linear range.</p>

<title>The Rcs phosphorelay system detects envelope stress due to alterations to the OM or the peptidoglycan.</title>
<p>The OM lipoprotein RcsF senses most of the cues activating the Rcs system. Under stress conditions, RcsF interacts with the inner membrane protein, IgaA, alleviating its inhibitory effect on the Rcs system. How IgaA down-regulates the Rcs system is unknown. When the system becomes activated, the histidine kinase RcsC autophosphorylates, then transfers the phosphate to RcsD and thence to the response regulator RcsB. Phosphorylated RcsB forms homodimers or heterodimers with RcsA to regulate the expression of target genes involved in motility, colanic acid synthesis, biofilm formation, osmotic homeostasis, and periplasmic quality control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref035">35</xref>].

<title>The distance between the IM and the OM is critical for efficient envelope surveillance and protection.</title>
<p>When the bacterium is subjected to stress in the OM or in the peptidoglycan, it activates the Rcs system to control and fix the damage. (A) In order to activate Rcs, the stress sensor lipoprotein RcsF, which is localised in the OM, must cross the periplasm to reach the IM protein IgaA. IgaA functions as the down-regulator of the Rcs system. When interacting with RcsF, IgaA alleviates its inhibition of Rcs, triggering the Rcs response. The architecture of the cell envelope needs to be tightly controlled to allow the information to be transmitted from RcsF in the OM to IgaA in the IM. In WT cells, the IM-to-OM distance is maintained by Lpp, a trimeric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004303.ref046">46</xref>] lipoprotein that cross-links the OM to the peptidoglycan. (B) Preventing the attachment of Lpp to the peptidoglycan (Lpp<sub>ΔK58</sub>) or (C) making this lipoprotein longer (Lpp<sub>+14</sub> and Lpp<sub>+21</sub>) increases the width of the periplasm, which disrupts the line of communication between the 2 membranes. (D) Increasing the length of the RcsF N-terminal linker restores Rcs signalling by allowing RcsF to span the wider cell envelope and contact IgaA.
