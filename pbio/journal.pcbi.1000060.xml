An increasingly recognized phenomenon among human transcription factors is the formation of structure upon target binding. Here, we study the folding and binding of the pKID domain of CREB to the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP. Our simulations of a topology-based Gō-type model predict a coupled folding and binding mechanism, and the existence of partially bound intermediates. From transition-path and Φ-value analyses, we find that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, implying that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. A change of structure following binding is reminiscent of an induced-fit mechanism and contrasts with models in which binding occurs to pre-structured conformations that exist in the unbound state at equilibrium. Interestingly, increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a “fly-casting”-like process. We find that the inclusion of attractive non-native interactions results in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhance the on-rate of binding, but do not significantly change the binding mechanism. Our study helps explain how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition. The simulations are in general agreement with the results of a recently reported nuclear magnetic resonance study, and aid in the interpretation of the experimental binding kinetics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Protein-protein interactions are central to many physiological processes. Traditionally, the atomic structure of the isolated proteins, as obtained from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, has been thought to determine the molecular recognition and binding process. However, this view has been challenged by the discovery of natively unstructured proteins, including many human transcription factors, which assume ordered molecular structures only upon binding to their targets. Understanding these transitions from a dissociated and unfolded state to a bound and folded state is key to unraveling how transcription factors, proteins involved in the system that controls the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA, perform their function. We conducted molecular simulations to study the binding of a well characterized transcription/co-transcription factor complex. We found that the transcription factor is unstructured when binding to its partner, with folding into an ordered structure occurring only after the initial binding event. The resulting coupled folding-and-binding mechanism is found to be in accord with state-of-the-art experimental data. Transcription-factor binding in an unstructured state may confer an advantage in protein target recognition by accelerating the rate of association without compromising the ability to bind to a diverse set of proteins with high specificity and yet relatively low affinity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>AT is supported by a PEW Latin American Fellowship.

Even though this is true for many proteins, where structure and function are closely related, a rapidly increasing number of proteins have been found that are natively unfolded or that have long unstructured regions (&gt;50 residues) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Dyson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Tompa1">[4]</xref>. For many of these proteins, and transcription factors in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Minezaki1">[2]</xref>, this intrinsic disorder appears to be required for their function. Transcription factors are essential players in signal transduction by regulating gene expression in the nucleus in response to changes in the cellular environment.

To transmit the correct signal, transcription factors need to associate with many diverse proteins with high specificity and yet relatively low affinity, as they need to dissociate upon signal completion. Having substantial unstructured regions may help in binding to different targets with large surfaces of interaction, and with different conformations, to achieve the required specificity and relative affinity. Moreover, being unstructured may be relevant for the rapid degradation of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Desterro1">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The transcription factor cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB) represents a well-characterized paradigm for an unstructured peptide that adopts a folded structure upon binding its co-activator CREB binding protein (CBP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Dyson1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Wright1">[8]</xref>.

We analyze the binding mechanism quantitatively by identifying the key features of binding transition states (TS) using a Bayesian formula relating the equilibrium and transition-path ensembles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Best1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Hummer1">[29]</xref>. Our simulations are in general agreement with recent NMR data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Sugase1">[23]</xref> and also help refine the interpretation of the experimental results. We show that this process occurs via a coupled folding and binding mechanism that typically begins with the binding of an unstructured α<sub>B</sub> region in pKID, followed by the folding of α<sub>B</sub> into a helix, and finally the docking of the α<sub>A</sub> helix. Our simulations show that the TS structures of this coupled binding-and-folding reaction are more closely related to the unstructured conformations of pKID than to the bound conformation. Surprisingly, simulations in which the helical propensity of the unbound pKID was increased resulted in a decrease in the rate of binding in comparison to the unstructured pKID. These findings are in contrast to models that invoke the binding of pre-folded conformations or a TS similar to the complex structure. By calculating Φ values from tertiary contacts we have identified a key residue for the coupled folding-and-binding mechanism, Leu<sup>141</sup>, that interacts with the hydrophobic groove of KIX in the TS. Moreover, by adding non-native interactions in addition to those present in the Gō-like model we explored the role of non-specific interactions in the binding process. The simulations of the resulting non-Gō model show an enhanced formation of encounter complexes, in agreement with a recent NMR study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Sugase1">[23]</xref>. We find that additional sequence-based (“non-native”) attractive interactions do not significantly change the binding mechanism, as captured by the transition state ensemble and the pathways taken between unbound and bound states. However, strengthening the non-native interactions and the resulting formation of non-specific encounter complexes increases the binding rate constant, reflecting the increased interaction cross section, consistent with results for binding of globular proteins and protein folding kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Schreiber2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Clementi1">[30]</xref>. Overall, using a simple coarse-grained model we provide a detailed dynamic picture of the folding and binding process of an unstructured protein that is in accord with state-of-the-art experimental data.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Coupled Folding and Binding Mechanism</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows a schematic representation of the distinct domains within CREB, including Q1, Q2, BZIP and pKID as described above. Long equilibrium simulations of the complex were initiated from the NMR structure of the complex (PDB code 1KDX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Radhakrishnan1">[12]</xref>) as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. Only residues 119–146 of phosphorylated KID, here referred to as pKID, undergo folding and binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To monitor folding and binding of pKID to KIX separately, we calculated the fraction of intramolecular native amino-acid contacts of KIX (Q<sub>KIX</sub>) and pKID (Q<sub>KID</sub>), and the fraction of intermolecular native contacts (Q<sub>C</sub>) that are formed over the course of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g002">Figure 2</xref>). During most of the simulation time the conformation of KIX remained folded and close to the native structure, held together by an extensive network of inter-residue interactions (as compared to the relatively few interactions between pKID and KIX, which makes it energetically much easier to dissociate the complex than to unfold KIX). However, a minor population of a partially unfolded state was found for the KIX domain (data not shown). This observation is qualitatively consistent with the existence of a partially unfolded high-energy state of KIX that is sparsely populated under native conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Tollinger1">[31]</xref>. The conformation of unbound pKID retains part of the intramolecular native contacts, as measured by Q<sub>KID</sub>, mainly because helix α<sub>A</sub> remains partially folded, in agreement with previous experimental results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Radhakrishnan2">[13]</xref>. The increased stability of helix α<sub>A</sub> in comparison to helix α<sub>B</sub> can be explained energetically, from α<sub>A</sub> having more and stronger intramolecular contacts than α<sub>B</sub>. The fraction of native intermolecular contacts between pKID and KIX, Q<sub>C</sub>, allows us to monitor the exchange at equilibrium between the two most populated states of the system, the bound (Q<sub>C</sub>∼0.9) and unbound conformations (Q<sub>C</sub>∼0.0). The aggregate simulation data include a total of 889 binding and dissociation transitions, allowing us to characterize in detail the dynamic changes that occur during the folding/binding process.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000060-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000060.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The fraction of native contacts for pKID, KIX, and the complex.</title><p>Fraction of native amino-acid contacts as a function of time for the intermolecular complex (Q<sub>C</sub>; top), KIX (Q<sub>KIX</sub>; center), and pKID (Q<sub>KID</sub>; bottom).

Notably, the free energy profile also suggests two major populated conformations in the bound state, one with the complex fully formed (Q<sub>C</sub>∼0.9), and a second, “partially bound” intermediate conformation (Q<sub>C</sub>∼0.75). We can gain further insight into the binding mechanism by separating the intermolecular contact fraction, Q<sub>C</sub>, into contacts between KIX and helices α<sub>A</sub> and α<sub>B</sub> of pKID, Q<sub>CA</sub> and Q<sub>CB</sub>, respectively. The binding free energy surface as a function of these two coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g004">Figure 4</xref>; representative structures superimposed) shows a dominant L-shaped path from unbound (Q<sub>CA</sub>∼Q<sub>CB</sub>∼0) to fully bound (Q<sub>CA</sub>∼Q<sub>CB</sub>∼0.9), with the contacts to helix α<sub>B</sub> formed before those to α<sub>A</sub>.

In those simulations, we added sequence-based attractive interactions between non-native residue pairs of pKID and KIX to the otherwise unchanged native-topology based interactions. We explored a broad range of non-native interaction strengths, from 0 to 100% relative to the native interactions (whose strength was not varied). We found that for non-native interaction strengths &gt;50%, the folding and binding process was very “glassy”, governed by escape from many deep local minima in the energy surface (data not shown), in contrast to the facile kinetics deduced from experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Sugase1">[23]</xref>. For non-native interaction strengths between 0 to 50% we obtained similar binding free energy surfaces as with the Gō-type model, with only a small reweighting of the minima (e.g., an increase in complexes formed only by helix α<sub>A</sub>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000060.s001">Figure S1</xref>). As the main effect of adding non-native interactions, we find increased flux on a secondary pathway of the folding and binding transition. This pathway involves the formation of intermediate I<sub>B</sub>, from the unbound state to the minimum at Q<sub>CA</sub>∼0.2, Q<sub>CB</sub>∼0, proceeding to the minimum at Q<sub>CA</sub>∼0.2 Q<sub>CB</sub>∼0.9, and then to the bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000060.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Whereas the relative contribution of this pathway to the overall reaction is negligible with only native attractions, it is found to have appreciable flux with non-native interactions added, but still much less than the main pathway involving the initial formation of intermediate I<sub>A</sub>.</p><p>In summary, the following predominant binding mechanism emerges. Before binding helix α<sub>A</sub> is mostly formed. Helix α<sub>B</sub>, in contrast, is largely unfolded. Initially, pKID binds to KIX with a largely unstructured α<sub>B</sub> region that then folds over the surface of KIX. Once helix α<sub>B</sub> is mostly folded and bound (I<sub>A</sub>), binding of helix α<sub>A</sub> locks the complex. A secondary pathway with much lower flux, involves the binding of helix α<sub>A</sub> to the α<sub>3</sub> helix of KIX, with α<sub>B</sub> unbound and unstructured (I<sub>B</sub>), folding by the binding of the the initially unstructured α<sub>B</sub> and its folding. Such independent dissociation of the two pKID helices in the two intermediates also seems reasonable in view of the bound structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which shows that the two bound helices lack tertiary interactions with each other, explaining their non-cooperative dissociation.</p><p>A recently published study used NMR relaxation-dispersion experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Sugase1">[23]</xref> to infer the formation of a single binding intermediate. Interestingly, the rates of interconversion of the intermediate and the bound state were fitted separately to the relaxation-dispersion curves for certain “clusters” of residues, with marked differences between the rate coefficients for clusters belonging to α<sub>A</sub> and those belonging to α<sub>B</sub> (see Table 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Sugase1">[23]</xref>). The rate of conversion from the intermediate state to the fully-bound state was more than four times faster for clusters of residues belonging to α<sub>B</sub> than for those belonging to α<sub>A</sub>, whereas the rate for conversion from the fully-bound to the intermediate state was faster for residues in α<sub>A</sub> than α<sub>B</sub>, an unexpected result for a strictly two-state system. Our simulations suggest a simple mechanism which explains this finding: the intermediate state actually consists of two sub-states, one (I<sub>A</sub>) with helix α<sub>B</sub> folded and bound, and helix α<sub>A</sub> unbound and only partially formed; the other (I<sub>B</sub>) with α<sub>A</sub> bound, and α<sub>B</sub> unbound. One can associate the rates from helix α<sub>A</sub> with the interconversion of intermediate I<sub>A</sub> with the bound state, and those from helix α<sub>B</sub> with the interconversion of I<sub>B</sub> and the bound state. From the ratio of these experimentally measured rates (Table 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Sugase1">[23]</xref>), it follows that in steady state the population of I<sub>A</sub> is about 20 times larger than that of I<sub>B</sub>. Indeed, we find in the simulations that the population of I<sub>A</sub> is significantly larger than that of I<sub>B</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000060.s001">Figure S1</xref>), with a population ratio of ∼70, thus differing by a factor of about 3.5 from experiment (or about <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> ln 3.5∼0.75 kcal/mol in the free energy). Structurally, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>, we predict ∼80% intramolecular helical contacts for residues on á<sub>A</sub>, and ∼70% for á<sub>B</sub>. This is in reasonable agreement with the experimental estimates of ∼90% folded for á<sub>A</sub> and ∼70% folded for á<sub>B</sub>, inferred from NMR chemical shift differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Sugase1">[23]</xref>. (Note that the measured chemical shift differences of the different residues report on the structure in the respective intermediates: I<sub>A</sub> for residues in α<sub>A</sub>, and I<sub>B</sub> in α<sub>B</sub>, not the population-weighted average.) Overall, we find nearly quantitative agreement with experiment, with respect to both the equilibrium populations of the two intermediates and their structural characteristics. Thus our work is a true prediction of binding mechanism from simulation.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000060-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000060.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Structural characteristics of the transition state ensemble.</title><p>(A) and (B) show the probability density function (pdf) of intramolecular native contacts of helix α<sub>A</sub> (Q<sub>αA</sub>) and helix α<sub>B</sub> (Q<sub>αB</sub>) of pKID for the unbound state, TS, intermediates I<sub>A</sub> and I<sub>B</sub>, and bound states.

The value of Q<sub>C</sub> with the highest p(TP|Q<sub>C</sub>) is most indicative of being on a transition path, and is used to identify the most reactive states, or “transition states”. The inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that this largest value of p(TP|Q<sub>C</sub>) is obtained for Q<sub>C</sub>∼0.3 for which p(TP| Q<sub>C</sub>)∼0.4.

We note, that for inertia-dominated processes, the theoretical maximum (in phase space) would be one; however, diffusion is expected to be relevant here for a process in condensed phase that involves the motions of large groups of atoms and solvent. We note further that, with Q<sub>C</sub> being a good reaction coordinate, as deduced from the high value of p(TP|Q<sub>C</sub>) at the transition state, and with dynamic corrections being small, the maximum of the free energy along Q<sub>C</sub> coincides nicely with the maximum of p(TP|Q<sub>C</sub>), leading to equivalent transition-state ensembles.</p><p>We selected all conformations from transition paths with Q<sub>C</sub> values in the interval [0.25;0.35] as representatives of the TS ensemble.

In the unbound state helix α<sub>A</sub> has a smaller fraction of native contacts (maximum at Q<sub>αA</sub>∼0.65) than in the bound state (maximum at Q<sub>αA</sub>∼0.95), consistent with a partial unfolding of helix α<sub>A</sub> in the I<sub>A</sub> intermediate. Interestingly, our simulations show that at the TS the structures resemble the unbound conformation, with helix α<sub>A</sub> partially folded, and helix α<sub>B</sub> mostly unfolded. At the TS, the distributions of the intramolecular contact fractions Q<sub>αA</sub> and Q<sub>αB</sub> are nearly identical to the respective curves for the unbound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>), and substantially different from the bound ones.</p><p>We also calculated the fractions of intermolecular contacts made by each helix (Q<sub>CA</sub>, Q<sub>CB</sub>) in the TS and bound states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000060-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>).

Our analysis of the transition states shows that structure is formed only after binding, which makes pKID binding to KIX more consistent with an induced-fit interpretation, with the interesting difference that here it is the ligand that changes conformation.</p><p>It is easy to see why a population shift mechanism is disfavored in the pKID/KIX transcription factor binding. Stabilization of the folded and bound conformation of pKID comes primarily from the large binding interface with KIX, rather than the relatively weak intramolecular interactions, making the folded conformation, as seen in the bound state, extremely improbable in the unbound state. Although both the induced fit and population shift models originally considered transitions between different conformations of already-folded proteins, the unbound conformations of folded proteins are frequently highly flexible and could be considered analogous to the unfolded peptide here.

Why would nature adopt such a model for molecular recognition? As mentioned above, there are many advantages to being unstructured, including the capacity to bind multiple targets and rapid termination of the signal <italic>via</italic> degradation of the peptide; since high affinity binding is not required, or even desirable for fast response, pre-existent structure may not be needed. This is also consistent with our finding that the bound complex is relatively loose and includes multiple bound structures.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite the acceleration of signal termination, one might imagine that the penalty for being unstructured would be a reduction in the rate of binding, and signal initiation. In fact, we find the opposite to be true: increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID slightly reduces the on rate. This slow-down can be understood in the context of the so called “fly-casting” mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Shoemaker1">[32]</xref>, in which the increased “capture radius” of an unfolded polypeptide enhances the rate of target binding relative to that of compact folded proteins.

Nevertheless, non-specific interactions were found to enhance the on-rate for binding, consistent with the results for binding of globular proteins and protein folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Schreiber2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Clementi1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Zhang1">[47]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results support a model for binding of pKID to KIX in which the structure of pKID is induced by binding, conferring several advantages.

The Gō-type model was constructed from the structure of the complex, as determined by NMR (PDB code 1KDX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Radhakrishnan1">[12]</xref>), following a standard procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Karanicolas1">[64]</xref>. Only residues shown by the NMR data to be structured were used in building the models. The resulting energy surface consists of a transferable dihedral potential, a harmonic potential for angles with a minimum at the native angle, an amino-acid-type dependent (Miyazawa-Jernigan) attractive term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Miyazawa1">[65]</xref> for interactions between pairs of residues which interact in the experimental structure (native contacts) and a repulsive potential for all other residue pairs. Each residue is represented by a single bead centered on its alpha-carbon (C<sub>α</sub>) position. To account for the charge of the phosphoserine, amino-acid contact potentials for a glutamic acid were used instead. We scaled the nonbonded interactions in order to have similar populations of bound and unbound conformations. In simulations in the absence of KIX, the α<sub>A</sub> helix of isolated pKID is only partially formed, and the α<sub>B</sub> region is mostly unstructured, consistent with previous NMR observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Radhakrishnan2">[13]</xref>.</p><p>To sample possible non-native complexes, we generated a model in which attractive potentials were added to all non-native residue pair interactions between pKID and KIX. We used a 12-6 potential with a minimum radius σ = 5.5 Å, and a well depth weighted by the same Miyazawa-Jernigan contact energies as in the Gō-type model, but scaled to 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% of the native value. The interactions of native residue pairs were left unchanged.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Simulations</title><p>A 1:1 complex of pKID/KIX was simulated in a 60 Å cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. Non-bonded interactions were smoothly cut off at 25 Å. The Langevin dynamics simulations were run in CHARMM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Brooks1">[66]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Pastor1">[68]</xref> with a time step of 15 fs. All bonds were fixed at their native lengths using SHAKE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Ryckaert1">[69]</xref>. The actual total simulation time is 195 µs (1.3×10<sup>10</sup> steps). The chosen friction coefficient of 0.1 ps<sup>−1</sup> is smaller than that used to mimic water (50–100 ps<sup>−1</sup>) to increase the rate of transitions in the equilibrium simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Best2">[70]</xref>. Although these simulations are not in the high friction limit, we can estimate, as a rough approximation, an upper bound for the times in water by scaling simulation times by a factor of 1000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000060-Best3">[71]</xref>, bringing the effective total simulation time to ∼200 ms. We note further that to enhance the sampling of binding events, the binding constant is smaller than the experimental value; however, we find that increasing the affinity by an order of magnitude through enhanced inter-molecular interactions does not affect the results. Simulations with the modified Gō model that includes non-native interactions were run in the same conditions as with the native model. In this case we ran 1.0×10<sup>9</sup> steps, equivalent to a simulation time of 15 µs, for each of the different potentials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000060.s001" mimetype="mage/tiff" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000060.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>2D free energy surface for different non-native interactions strength.
