<abstract>
<p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are important agents in the control of intracellular pathogens, which specifically recognize and kill infected cells. Recently developed experimental methods allow the estimation of the CTL's efficacy in detecting and clearing infected host cells. One method, the in vivo killing assay, utilizes the adoptive transfer of antigen displaying target cells into the bloodstream of mice. Surprisingly, killing efficacies measured by this method are often much higher than estimates obtained by other methods based on, for instance, the dynamics of escape mutations. In this study, we investigated what fraction of this variation can be explained by differences in peptide loads employed in in vivo killing assays. We addressed this question in mice immunized with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We conducted in vivo killing assays varying the loads of the immunodominant epitope GP33 on target cells. Using a mathematical model, we determined the efficacy of effector and memory CTL, as well as CTL in chronically infected mice. We found that the killing efficacy is substantially reduced at lower peptide loads. For physiological peptide loads, our analysis predicts more than a factor 10 lower CTL efficacies than at maximum peptide loads. Assuming that the efficacy scales linearly with the frequency of CTL, a clear hierarchy emerges among the groups across all peptide antigen concentrations. The group of mice with chronic LCMV infections shows a consistently higher killing efficacy per CTL than the acutely infected mouse group, which in turn has a consistently larger efficacy than the memory mouse group. We conclude that CTL killing efficacy dependence on surface epitope frequencies can only partially explain the variation in in vivo killing efficacy estimates across experimental methods and viral systems, which vary about four orders of magnitude. In contrast, peptide load differences can explain at most two orders of magnitude.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The immune system reacts to the presence of a viral pathogen within the host by the elicitation of an immune response. This response is characterized by the activation and proliferation of specific cell types, which, for instance, produce neutralizing antibodies or kill cells infected by the virus. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) function as an important protecting element of the system by recognizing and clearing infected viral target cells. Surprisingly, estimates of the killing efficacy of CTLs vary about four orders of magnitude across experimental methods and viral systems. In some studies, CTL killing efficacies were estimated by employing pre-treated cells that mimick virus infected cells. In general, cells signal their infection by a pathogen to the immune system by presenting viral peptides on their cellular surface. For the experimentally pretreated cells, these peptides were artificially loaded onto the surface at very high densities. In this paper, we study to what extent the variation in peptide densities can explain the variation found in killing efficacy estimates across methods and viral systems. We found that peptide densities explain only up to two orders of magnitude in killing efficacy variation. The remaining variation must originate from other sources, which might be specific to the viral study system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adaptive immune responses exert important selective pressures on viral infections through various mechanisms, such as neutralization of virus particles by antibodies or killing virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Efforts to quantify the ability of CTLs to kill infected host cells have yielded results with considerable variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref002">2</xref>]. In fact, estimates of the efficacy of CTLs at recognizing and clearing infected viral target cells <italic>in vivo</italic> vary by several orders of magnitude between experimental designs and viral study systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> CTL killing efficacy estimates exist for the following types of viral study systems: HIV/SIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref011">11</xref>], lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>], polyoma virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref016">16</xref>], HTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>], and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>]. The killing efficacy of CTLs in HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref006">6</xref>], SIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref010">10</xref>], HTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>], and bovine leukemia virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>] yield distinct, relatively low estimates. These estimates capture the rate at which a target cell is cleared by the total CTL response, and range from 0.1d<sup>−1</sup> to 10d<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>]. In contrast, polyoma virus and LCMV have been shown to yield high killing efficacy estimates of 20−500d<sup>−1</sup> for epitope-specific clones in either acute or chronic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref017">17</xref>]. Hence, compared to LCMV and polyoma virus, HTLV-1 and BLV yield much lower estimates.</p>
<p>The variation in these estimates might be primarily due to the viral study systems. The experimental methods employed to obtain the estimates for HIV/SIV, HTLV-1 and BLV rely on distinct approaches. HIV estimates are based on two approaches: the injection of CTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref005">5</xref>] and on the observation of viral escape mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref006">6</xref>], with an almost hundredfold difference between some estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>]. In contrast, the HTLV-1 and BLV estimates are based on assessing the decay rate of labeled cells, in a similar fashion as employed for LCMV and polyoma virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Estimates for LCMV and polyoma virus rely on an experimental technique referred to as <italic>in vivo</italic> killing assay. This technique involves the injection of target cells, loaded with viral peptides on their surface, into the bloodstream of mice. The subsequent tracking of their disappearance in relation to unpulsed control cells allows for the estimation of the effect of killing by CTLs. In most of these assays, the number of viral peptides that each target cell displays is unnaturally high, three orders of magnitude higher than on naturally infected cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Discussion</xref>).</p>
<p>In part, the discrepancy between the <italic>in vivo</italic> CTL efficacy estimates across experimental methods and study systems is likely to arise from the unnaturally high peptide loads on target cells in <italic>in vivo</italic> killing assays. The highest per CTL killing efficacies have been measured in LCMV in vivo killing assays with high peptide loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref014">14</xref>]. When reducing peptide loads to very low levels which make target cells unrecognizable by CTL, we accordingly expect a decrease per CTL killing efficacies to almost zero. Hence, peptide load variation could theoretically explain the entire variation in CTL killing efficacies.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate to what extent CTL killing efficacies depend on peptide load on target cells, and what proportion of the entire CTL efficacy variation can be explained by this effect. To this end, we conducted CTL <italic>in vivo</italic> killing assays in mice acutely or chronically infected with LCMV Docile. During chronic infections, CTLs are assumed to become dysfunctional or exhausted, displaying poor effector function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref018">18</xref>]. We estimated the killing efficacies of effector, memory and chronic-infection CTLs for different peptide loads using mathematical models that extend previous approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>]. The types of CTL were classified by the administered dose of the LCMV Docile and the time after infection (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>We find that the per cell killing efficacy first increases with peptide loads, and saturates above a peptide load of approximately 10<sup>−1</sup> <italic>μg</italic>/<italic>ml</italic>. For physiologically reasonable peptide loads however, which we estimate to lie around 10<sup>−3</sup> <italic>μg</italic>/<italic>ml</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Discussion</xref>), the CTL efficacy is only one order of magnitude lower than at saturation for all three CTL types. This leaves most of the differences in <italic>in vivo</italic> CTL efficacy estimates unexplained.</p>
<p>We also found that individual CTL during chronic infections kill cells with physiological peptide loads at a higher rate than effector or memory CTL. This result needs to be interpreted in the context of whether exhausted CTLs display reduced killing efficacies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref018">18</xref>]. As in studies with high peptide loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>], we found no evidence that CTL killing in chronic infections is impaired.</p>

<p>Following the Felasa-recommmendation 2002 for laboratory animals, C57BL/6 mice were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. Animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the animal experimentation law (SR 455.163; TVV) of the Swiss Federal Government.

<p>The employed LCMV Docile was obtained by propagation on MDCK cells at low multiplicity of infection. We employed methods described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref019">19</xref>] for the quantification of infectious virus titres.

<title>Cytotoxicity assay</title>
<p>LCMV Docile is known to cause acute or chronic infections depending on the inoculum size of viral particles infecting the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref020">20</xref>]. We infected four groups of four female C57BL/6 mice expressing the congenic marker Ly5.2 intravenously with LCMV-Docile at distinct times before injecting target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004178.g001">Fig 1</xref>.). The first group (acute group) was infected with an inoculum of 200 plaque forming units (pfu) eight days prior to transfer. Two further groups (chronic and memory groups) were infected with 10<sup>6</sup> and 200 pfu, respectively, 42 days prior to transfer. One group (naïve group) was used as negative control group. The terms used to denote the treatment groups were chosen to describe the most prevalent CTL type found in mice infected with a specific inoculum dose and at the time of the measurement. For each mouse, the transferred target cell pool was comprised of 1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> homozygous splenocytes (and therefore Ly5.1+ Ly5.2-) and Ly5.1 heterozygous splenocytes (and therefore Ly5.1/Ly5.2 double positive).</p>

<title>Experimental design of the <italic>in vivo</italic> killing assay performed on four treatment groups of four mice.</title>
<p>Mice in the control group (a) were not challenged with LCMV, and stayed naïve. Mice in the acute (b) and memory (d) groups were infected with 200 pfu, while the chronic group (c) received 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> pfu of LCMV Docile. After a delay of eight (acute group) and 42 days (chronic and memory groups) respectively, labelled target cells were injected intravenously into all mice including the naïve group. The transferred cells consisted of subpopulations of cells pulsed with different peptide loads, including a subpopulation of unpulsed cells. The subpopulations were pulsed with the indicated concentrations of GP33-epitope (5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells each). At the indicated time points, blood samples were taken and analysed for the proportions of the labelled cells by flow cytometry. Splenectomy was conducted on each mouse 4 hours after cell transfer and the splenocytes analysed for specific lysis of target cells and the proportions of epitope-specific CTLs. Note that in contrast to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>], this design uses an additional treatment group—the memory group, a larger number of target cells is transferred, and the time between infection and cell transfer is tuned to observe the desired effector, chronic and memory CTLs.</p>

<p>where as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>], <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> is used to correct for the different ratios that might arise in the inoculum.

<p>To estimate CTL efficacies and other quantities of interest in the killing assay data, a mathematical model that predicts the fraction of killed target cells at time <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> and peptide concentrations <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>; <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Results</xref>), is fitted to the data <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e011"><mml:math id="M11" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub> <mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. For such a mathematical model two assumptions need to be made for the killing. First, how peptide load <italic>λ</italic> affects the killing rate constant <italic>k</italic> of CTLs has to be specified. Here, we assume a model with two parameters <italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub> and <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e012"><mml:math id="M12" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>: <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e013"><mml:math id="M13" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">max</mml:mtext></mml:msub> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:msub> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Results</xref> for interpretation of these parameters).</p>
<p>Second, a further assumption is required as to how the total killing efficacy is affected by the presence of other CTLs within the same compartment. Here, a general model might describe the net effect of the overall epitope-specific CTL frequency <italic>g</italic>(<italic>C</italic>), where <italic>C</italic> denotes the proportion of CTLs specific to the pulsed epitope among all splenocytes. The total killing —usually denoted by <italic>f</italic>(<italic>k</italic>, <italic>C</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref003">3</xref>]— is captured by a mathematical expression incorporating both killing dependence on pulsing load and CTL saturation: <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e014"><mml:math id="M14" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo> <mml:mi>k</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">max</mml:mtext></mml:msub> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:msub> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>g</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo> <mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Fitting is realized by employing a least square algorithm on the arcsin-square-root transformed data and probabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref022">22</xref>].

<title>(c) Estimation of killing efficacy dependence on pulsing concentration</title>
<p>The measurement of the target cell frequencies relative to control cells contains information about how fast these target cells are cleared by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To extract this information, mathematical modeling is required to synthesize the migration of cells between the blood and secondary lymphatic tissues with the dynamics of killing by CTL. The mathematical model we used extends the previous model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>] by explicitly describing the dependence of the killing rate on the peptide load on the target cells.</p>
<p>To predict the proportions of killed target cells with a mathematical model, more detailed information is required as to how the target cells circulate in the blood and in which compartments they are killed. In previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>], we conducted experiments in naïve mice to determine at what rates target cells migrate to different compartments, such as the spleen, lung, liver and blood of mice. In these experiments, the total fraction of transferred target cells had been measured in all compartments over time. In a first step, we had observed that the target cells are likely to exclusively home to the spleen. For this reason, we assume that all target cells are killed in the spleen only. In a second step, we had calculated the net flux rate of target cells into the spleen, <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we use the the estimate of <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>]. The calculation of <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is based on the existence of two compartments, a risk compartment –the spleen– where target cells can be cleared, and a non-risk compartment where they are not actively cleared. The net flux <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) between these two compartments constitutes a simplification to fluxes employed for inference in earlier models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref013">13</xref>] and should not be equated to such fluxes.</p>
<p>How efficiently the target cells are killed in the spleen by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is determined by how abundant GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are in the spleen and the peptide load <italic>λ</italic>. These effects are mathematically captured in an expression for the total killing rate of the target cell population, <italic>f</italic>(<italic>k</italic>, <italic>λ</italic>, <italic>C</italic>). In this expression, <italic>k</italic> denotes the killing rate constant that describes the functional relationship between killing rate, CTL abundance <italic>C</italic>, and peptide load. The form of <italic>f</italic>(<italic>k</italic>, <italic>λ</italic>, <italic>C</italic>) will be specified below. We denote the proportion of killed target cells pulsed at concentration <italic>λ</italic> at time <italic>t</italic> by <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e018"><mml:math id="M18" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub> <mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mrow/></mml:msub> <mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p>

In principle, it is possible that the hierarchy of killing abilities between CTL population depends on the peptide load on the target cells. For example, the CTL population described by the blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004178.g005">Fig 5</xref>. is less sensitive to the peptide concentration on target cells than the other CTL populations and is therefore less efficacious, except for very high peptide loads.</p>

We found that the two parameters characterizing the killing rate in the mass-action killing model differed significantly between the acute, memory and chronic groups (F-test, <italic>p</italic> = 2 ⋅ 10<sup>−33</sup>).

<p>By using bootstrapping, we were able to calculate 95% confidence bands for the per-cell efficacy profile across all peptide loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004178.g008">Fig 8</xref>.).

<title>(c2) Estimates under saturation of CTL responses</title>
<p>According to the mass-action assumption the killing rate increases linearly with the frequency of CTL. At very high CTL frequencies, however, the killing rate will stop to increase and saturate. Recent studies based on cellular automata predict a threshold in CTL frequencies of 0.03, above which saturation effects in CTLs should not be neglected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref025">25</xref>]. Below this threshold, mass action dynamics is an appropriate approximation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref026">26</xref>]. In our data, the threshold is exceeded in the acute group (⟨<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>⟩ = 0.042) and slightly in the memory group (⟨<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>⟩ = 0.031), but not the chronic group (⟨<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>⟩ = 0.006).</p>
<p>For this reason, we relaxed the mass-action assumption and assumed that the killing rate saturates with increasing CTL frequencies. Saturation in CTL frequencies implies that the killing efficacy per CTL approaches an upper limit with increasing CTL numbers. The individual CTL killing efficacy is thus impaired by the presence of other CTLs in the same compartment.</p>
<p>If we incorporate the saturation in CTL frequencies into our model for killing, we obtain the following killing rate:

Here <italic>j</italic> ∈ {<italic>a</italic>, <italic>p</italic>, <italic>m</italic>} denotes the acute, chronic and memory groups, respectively. <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e044"><mml:math id="M44" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the CTL frequency, at which the saturation effects in <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> are half-maximal, and is sometimes confusingly referred to as the <italic>saturation threshold</italic>.</p>
<p>With the adoption of a saturation model, the meaning of the killing efficacy <italic>k</italic>, and with it of the parameter <italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub> changes. In the mass action model, <italic>k</italic> is the per cell killing efficacy induced by a peptide load <italic>λ</italic>. Therefore, <italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub> signifies the maximum per cell killing efficacy that can be attained by a CTL. However, in the saturation model, <italic>k</italic> and <italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub> have a less intuitive meaning. Here, <italic>k</italic> is the actual killing rate exerted by all peptide-specific cells at a particular peptide load <italic>λ</italic> accounting for CTL saturation effects. Hence, in the saturation model, <italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub> captures the maximum killing rate that can be reached by the entire CTL population specific to a particular peptide.</p>
<p>While it is conceivable that the half-maximum CTL frequencies <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e045"><mml:math id="M45" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> differ by group, we do not have the resolution in our experimental data to determine these parameters for each group individually. This is due to the very low variation of CTL frequencies in different mice within the groups. We therefore defined killing model variants of increasing complexity, starting with a variant in which all parameters are equal between groups, to variants in which increasing number of parameters differ. We refer to these model variants as Model A, B, C, and D. The choice of these models was biologically motivated, and represents a subset of all theoretically conceivable combinations of inequalities between group parameters.</p>
<p>We performed F-tests between these four models. In model A we assume all maximum killing efficacies within treatment groups to be equal <italic>k</italic><sub>max,<italic>a</italic></sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>max,<italic>p</italic></sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>max,<italic>m</italic></sub>, all sensitivities on concentration between groups to be equal, <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e046"><mml:math id="M46" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, as well as the saturation levels for CTLs, <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e047"><mml:math id="M47" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Model D adds further complexity to model C by relaxing the assumption of equal maximum killing efficacies: <italic>k</italic><sub>max,<italic>a</italic></sub> ≠ <italic>k</italic><sub>max,<italic>p</italic></sub> ≠ <italic>k</italic><sub>max,<italic>m</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>We found that model B provides a significantly better fit than model A (<italic>p</italic> = 3.53 ⋅ 10<sup>−9</sup>, by F-test). Model C provides a significant improvement of a fit over model B (<italic>p</italic> = 2.21 ⋅ 10<sup>−5</sup>). Intriguingly, model C (six parameters) does also lead to a better fit of the data than the combination of all group-wise fits of the mass-action kinetics model with killing efficacy dependence on pulsing concentrations (also six parameters, identical data). The mass action model leads to a residual sum of squares (RSS) of 3.43, whereas model C leads to an RSS of 3.33. Also when comparing these two models by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), model C is associated with a smaller information loss (AIC: 301) than the mass-action model (AIC: 308.14). Here, AIC was calculated as AIC = 2<italic>k</italic> + <italic>n</italic> log(RSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref028">28</xref>], where the number of parameters in the model is <italic>k</italic> = 6 and the number of observations is <italic>n</italic> = 240, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004178.s001">S1 Text</xref>. The fit of model C to the data is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004178.s002">S1 Fig</xref>. Lastly, model D does not significantly improve the fit compared to model C (<italic>p</italic> = 0.323).</p>
<p>In addition to models A, B and D, we tested several other alternatives to model C, and found that model C is statistically the best supported model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004178.s001">S1 Text</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004178.s003">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that model C comes out as the best model in our model selection scheme is consistent with biological observations and previous quantitative analyses. Studies which employed mass-action kinetics for low effector-target cell ratios, found no significant differences between the killing efficacy of CTLs in acute and chronic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>], as well as between effector and memory CTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref029">29</xref>]. This is in line with the assumption of model C that the maximum killing efficacies of CTLs in all mice groups are equal <italic>k</italic><sub>max,<italic>a</italic></sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>max,<italic>p</italic></sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>max,<italic>m</italic></sub>. The model assumption of unequal half-maximum CTL frequencies differ between memory and effector CTL is supported by the observation that memory CTL bind to target cells longer until they kill due to lower perforin and granzyme levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>We fitted function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004178.e019">3</xref>) under model C to the combined data of all treatment groups. Confidence intervals were obtained by bootstrapping. The estimated values of the model parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004178.t002">Table 2</xref>. Estimated maximum killing efficacies are smaller compared to the mass-action kinetics estimates, because of a different gauging under the new saturation assumption. The estimates for the peptide load sensitivities are very similar to those in mass-action estimates (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004178.t001">Table 1</xref>). For the saturation threshold in <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e050"><mml:math id="M50" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">effector</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, we obtain values around 0.015.

The saturation threshold estimate for memory CTL is substantially higher than for CTL in acute and chronic infections.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have estimated CTL-mediated killing efficacies using <italic>in vivo</italic> killing assays across a wide range of peptide loads. Assuming mass-action kinetics, a clear hierarchy emerged between acute, chronic and memory responses. The chronic group showed a larger killing efficacy per CTL than the acute group, which in turn was more effective than the memory group across the entire range of peptide loads. This clearly shows, consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref020">20</xref>], that CTL during chronic infections are not impaired in their ability to kill. Neither do these cells require more peptide on their targets to kill (<inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e061"><mml:math id="M61" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), nor do they have a lower killing efficacy for very large peptide loads.</p>
<p>In contrast to our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>], the estimates of the maximal per CTL killing efficacies were around one order of magnitude smaller for the acutely infected mice. This mismatch for the acute group is likely due to CTL frequency saturation effects. Saturation effects are likely to play a smaller role in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>], where due to later cell transfer times (15 days after infection) the average GP33-specific CTL frequency is about 0.01. In this study, the average GP33-specific CTL frequency in acutely infected mice was 0.042 (8 days after infection). As the frequencies of GP33-specific CTL increase, killing efficacies will inevitably enter a saturation regime. In the saturation regime, a further increase in CTL does not lead to more total killing, violating a core assumption of the mass-action model. Erroneously adopting the mass-action assumption under saturation will therefore lead to an underestimate of the per CTL killing efficacy.</p>
<p>In contrast, GP33-specific CTL frequencies for chronically infected mice in the experiments presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>] were very similar to those in this study, and no inconsistencies between killing efficacy estimates arise.</p>
<p>To account for possible saturation effects in CTL numbers we also investigated mathematical models accounting for the saturation in killing rates for high CTL levels. Such saturating effects arise when the duration of killing is the limiting factor in the dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref031">31</xref>]. By a variety of methods we estimate that GP33-specific CTL need to exceed a frequency of 1% among splenocytes for saturation in acute and chronic infection. This estimate is about two to three times lower than that obtained from cellular automata models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>The results for the estimated recognition sensitivities between groups are almost identical between mass-action kinetics and CTL saturation model fits. Irrespective of the mass-action assumption, we did not find significant differences in the recognition sensitivities between responses. These estimates are of the same order of magnitude as comparable estimates found for chronic infections of polyoma virus, but differ for acute infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>This study relies on estimates of the net unpulsed target cell migration into the spleen <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and target cell data from the blood obtained in previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>]. Hence, uncertainties regarding the migration of target cells into the spleen that are associated with the experimental approach will inevitably be inherited by our killing efficacy estimates.</p>
<p>There exist other models for CTL killing, such as the refractory model, epitope decay and CTL exhaustion models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref013">13</xref>] or a recently investigated double saturation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref032">32</xref>], that could have been used to fit the data. In this study, we limited the analysis to the standard mass-action kinetics and CTL saturation models. The refractory and exhaustion models were found to contradict biological observations in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref013">13</xref>]. The CTL epitope decay model accounts for the observation that peptide-MHC complexes have lifetimes on the order of hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref033">33</xref>], and could be lost over the course of our experimental study. However, in our previous study, this model did not provide significantly better fits to standard models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the model could not provide additional information as to the relative strengths of the responses in the different treatment groups. The double saturation model—which accounts for saturation in both target as well as CTL numbers– could capture the functional response of the killing in a variety of conditions simulated in a computer model of lymphoid tissue. However, the relatively low variance in the target cell numbers in the spleen (0.08−0.12 probability for a target cell to be in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>]) as well as the low variance of CTL frequencies do not permit to resolve the quantitative details of saturation in our data.</p>
<p>The main motivation for estimating CTL killing efficacies for lower peptide loads in the present study were the discrepancies between killing estimates in vivo across a broad range of study systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref016">16</xref>]. However, there are also inconsistencies across in vivo and in vitro studies. It is unresolved if CTL are equally able to kill during chronic and acute LCMV infection. Some studies report cytolytic impairment of CTLs in chronic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref036">36</xref>], while others find unchanged cytotoxic potential in chronic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref020">20</xref>]. These inconsistencies were thought to arise because the study systems employ either different peptide-MHC densities or different cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref020">20</xref>]. Our study shows that lower peptide-MHC densities by themselves cannot explain the impaired killing ability that some studies found: the killing ability during chronic LCMV infection is at least as strong as during acute infection across all peptide loads we tested in our study.</p>
<p>Our estimates do not completely resolve why there are discrepancies of many orders of magnitude in CTL killing efficacy estimates between HIV, SIV, BLV, HTLV-1 on one hand, and LCMV and polyoma virus on the other. The peptide loads on naturally infected cells correspond to a peptide pulse of approximately <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e062"><mml:math id="M62" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo> <mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup> <mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mtext></mml:mrow> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">ml</mml:mtext></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This number is estimated from a comparison of the T-cell stimulation by LCMV-infected or peptide-pulsed macrophages. An identical activation level of macrophages is attained for T-cells pulsed at <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e063"><mml:math id="M63" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo> <mml:mn>9</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup> <mml:mi>M</mml:mi> <mml:mo>≈</mml:mo> <mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo> <mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup> <mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mtext></mml:mrow> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">ml</mml:mtext></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The killing efficacies obtained in <italic>in vivo</italic> killing assays with for the commonly applied large pulses of <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e064"><mml:math id="M64" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mtext></mml:mrow> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">ml</mml:mtext></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and the physiologically more realistic pulse of <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004178.e065"><mml:math id="M65" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo> <mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup> <mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mtext></mml:mrow> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">ml</mml:mtext></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> differ by a factor 10. Thus, lower peptide loads explain only up to two orders of magnitude difference in CTL killing rates, and alternative explanations for the remaining large discrepancies need to be sought.</p>
<p>The discrepancies between the estimated killing efficacies could be due to specific differences between the host species and the viruses. For instance, differences in the distribution of MHC molecules on target cells between mice and primates could have important effects. Other important host features, such as size, might affect CTL killing. Virus features are also expected to impact CTL killing efficacy. For example, viral protein expression in infected cells might vary substantially between different viruses and the infected cell type. Additionally, epitopes from different pathogens might elicit differently strong immune responses, which could contribute to CTL killing efficacy variation.</p>
<p>Other studies have previously shown that the peptide concentration employed for target cell pulsing can affect the killing efficacies of CTLs in polyoma virus (PyV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref037">37</xref>]. As in our own study, killing efficacies declined with decreasing pulsing concentrations, indicating that the CTL’s ability to recognize and kill infected target cells depends on the number of peptide/MHC molecules presented on the target cell surface. In contrast to our results, fits of mass-action models do not show a clear hierarchy of killing efficacies between CTLs in acute and chronic infections. Rather, the hierarchy of killing abilities of CTLs in acute and chronic infections is reversed when pulsing concentrations are varied. Although this study differs in scope and in the viral system from the study of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref016">16</xref>], it can be regarded as an extension of it. Here, we have additionally investigated saturation models by employing statistical methods established in recent studies (arcsin transformations for adequate error minimization in frequency data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref013">13</xref>], estimation of net flux rates of target cells into spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref015">15</xref>]).</p>
<p>Compared to the primary response after encounter of a pathogen, memory T cells confer a faster and stronger immune response to the host upon re-encounter, granting increased protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref038">38</xref>]. As in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref013">13</xref>], we found that memory CTL do not kill at higher rates than CTL in acute and chronic infections, particularly at lower peptide loads. We therefore have no evidence for an increased sensitivity of memory CTL compared to acute or chronic CTL, as has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004178.ref039">39</xref>]. The increased level of viral control that is observed upon re-exposure is better explained by higher initial number or a higher proliferative capacity of memory CTL as compared to naïve CTL.</p>
