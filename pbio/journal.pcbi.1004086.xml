<abstract>
<p>Metabolism is the major output of the circadian clock in many organisms. We developed a computational method to integrate both circadian gene expression and metabolic network. Applying this method to zebrafish circadian transcriptome, we have identified large clusters of metabolic genes containing mostly genes in purine and pyrimidine metabolism in the metabolic network showing similar circadian phases. Our metabolomics analysis found that the level of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), an intermediate metabolite in de novo purine synthesis, showed significant circadian oscillation in larval zebrafish. We focused on IMP dehydrogenase (<italic>impdh</italic>), a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo purine synthesis, with three circadian oscillating gene homologs: <italic>impdh1a</italic>, <italic>impdh1b</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic>. Functional analysis revealed that <italic>impdh2</italic> contributes to the daily rhythm of S phase in the cell cycle while <italic>impdh1a</italic> contributes to ocular development and pigment synthesis. The three zebrafish homologs of <italic>impdh</italic> are likely regulated by different circadian transcription factors. We propose that the circadian regulation of de novo purine synthesis that supplies crucial building blocks for DNA replication is an important mechanism conferring circadian rhythmicity on the cell cycle. Our method is widely applicable to study the impact of circadian transcriptome on metabolism in complex organisms.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The circadian timing system gates cell cycle progression in various organisms from unicellular microorganisms to mammals. Although a number of factors have been implicated in linking the circadian clock with the cell cycle, little is known about the contribution of metabolic processes to this interaction. In this study, we have shown that cell cycle, metabolism and the circadian clock are intertwined through consistent circadian expression of genes in de novo purine synthesis in the zebrafish. Three gene homologs of a key enzyme in this pathway, <italic>impdh</italic>, show circadian oscillations in different tissues and have distinct molecular functions. In particular, one of the homologs, <italic>impdh2</italic>, contributes to the daily rhythm of S phase in the cell cycle. We suggest that de novo purine synthesis mediates circadian control of cell cycle, a mechanism that is likely conserved in mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The circadian clock represents a key time-keeping mechanism for many fundamental physiological processes such as cell cycle and metabolism. The cell cycle and the circadian clock are both well-studied periodic processes and their interaction has been a recent focus of circadian research. Until now, it has been observed that the circadian timing system gates cell cycle progression in various organisms from unicellular microorganisms such as <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and cyanobacteria [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to complex organisms such as humans [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], mouse [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] as well as in in vitro culture systems [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These findings implicate the cell cycle as being an evolutionarily conserved regulatory target of the circadian clock. The disruption of the circadian timing system leads to cell cycle disorders and subsequently can result in various types of cancers [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Key circadian clock regulatory targets have been identified as important molecular links between the circadian system and the timing of cell division [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The progression of each phase in the cell cycle is mediated by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)/Cyclins complexes and CDK inhibitors (CKIs), which are directly or indirectly controlled by key circadian transcriptional factors [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, there are substantial lines of evidence suggesting that a number of key cell cycle regulators, such as <italic>p21</italic>, <italic>p16</italic>, <italic>cyclinE</italic>, <italic>cyclinA2</italic>, <italic>wee1</italic>, <italic>cyclinB1</italic>, <italic>cdc2</italic> are rhythmically expressed and clock controlled in many species [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, recent studies showed that circadian and cell cycle oscillators were tightly coupled and synchronized in mouse fibroblasts in a 1:1 fashion at the single-cell level [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Zebrafish represents an excellent vertebrate model to study the interplay between the circadian clock and the cell cycle. Progression through S-phase and M phase is restricted to specific times of the light/dark (LD) cycle in a circadian-dependent manner in zebrafish larvae, adult tissues and even cell lines [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. More recently the circadian clock has also been demonstrated to regulate cell proliferation and the expression of core cell cycle regulators in the zebrafish intestine [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The detailed mechanism of how the circadian clock orchestrates cell cycle has been studied intensively. Light can serve as an environmental signal that regulates cell division via the circadian clock system [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Glucocorticoids have also been implicated in playing a key role in the circadian control of cell cycle [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, ADP, acting as a paracrine signal, has been associated with daily S phase cell activity in adult zebrafish retina [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Importantly, the direct clock control of mRNA expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors <italic>p20</italic> and <italic>p21</italic> also clearly plays a critical role in cell cycle timing in zebrafish [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, there has been considerable interest in how various metabolic processes are controlled by circadian clock [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the meantime, a wealth of circadian transcriptome data has been generated by microarray or RNA-seq studies in different species. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methods to gain insight of the functional consequences of circadian transcriptome on metabolism in the context of global metabolic network. It is well-known that metabolism exerts a strong influence on cell cycle [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, little is known about whether metabolic processes directly contribute to linking the cell cycle and circadian clock. Since the coordination of metabolic pathway activity is an essential prerequisite for major cellular events such as DNA replication during S phase [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we reason that circadian regulation of metabolism may represent a key control point for the cell cycle. In this study, we developed a new clustering method based on a distance measure incorporating both metabolic network and circadian phase information. We applied this method to the circadian transcriptome of zebrafish and systematically identified metabolic gene clusters showing coherent circadian gene expression. We found that the top gene clusters consist of mainly genes in purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathway. In this pathway, Inosine 5'-phosphate dehydrogenase (Impdh) catalyzes NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent oxidation of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP), which is the rate-limiting step in the de novo biosynthesis of GTP [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Interestingly, three homologous genes of <italic>impdh</italic> in zebrafish, namely <italic>impdh1a</italic>, <italic>impdh1b</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic>, all show robust circadian expression in both larval and adult zebrafish but reside in two different coherent circadian gene clusters. Consistent to this finding, we observed that the level of IMP also showed circadian oscillation in zebrafish larvae through metabolomics analysis. We showed that while <italic>impdh1a</italic> contributes to eye development and the synthesis and distribution of pigment, <italic>impdh2</italic> plays an important role in the circadian control of cell cycle. Furthermore, <italic>impdh1b</italic> function serves to delay embryonic development, contrary to <italic>impdh2</italic> function. The pharmacological inhibition of Impdh activity by mycophenolic acid (MPA) treatment attenuates the circadian control of cell cycle. Gene-specific knock down experiments revealed that the inhibition of <italic>impdh2</italic> function is mainly responsible for this phenomenon. Thus, we hypothesize that purine synthesis is circadian clock-controlled via <italic>impdh</italic> activity and contributes to the daily rhythm of S phase in the cell cycle. Finally, in the light of findings from the mouse, we proposed that de novo purine synthesis may also mediate circadian rhythm of cell cycle in mammals. Taken together, our study suggests that circadian control of de novo purine synthesis represents a novel mechanism linking the circadian clock, metabolism and the cell cycle.</p>

<title>Coherent circadian expression in zebrafish metabolism</title>
<p>Our previous study has revealed that zebrafish start to show robust circadian activity in the larval stage at 5 days post-fertilization (5 dpf) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We have identified 2,847 zebrafish circadian oscillating genes (ZCOGs) under both LD and DD conditions in larval zebrafish data. In this study, we focus on the circadian regulation of metabolism. Due to a lack of a global metabolic network in zebrafish as in the case of human and mouse [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we compiled a zebrafish metabolic network from the information of metabolic reactions, enzymes, and genes of zebrafish from KEGG database [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>). Such network provides global connectivity between enzymes or reactions through metabolites in an unbiased fashion. Considering one reaction usually contains multiple genes and one gene may be involved in multiple reactions, we combined both gene symbol and KEGG reaction ID to uniquely represent each reaction in the network. We mapped all ZCOGs in larval zebrafish onto zebrafish metabolic network. We obtained 317 ZCOGs coding for enzymes catalyzing 1034 reactions in total. These circadian oscillating enzymes are overrepresented among ZCOGs (p&lt;0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). As circadian phase of ZCOG can be used as the proxy for the peak of circadian activity of enzymes, we defined the distance measure <italic>D</italic> between reactions incorporating the phase information of ZCOGs together with the proximities of the reactions on the zebrafish metabolic network:

We then applied a hierarchical clustering of reactions based on these distances. We obtained a main cluster of 632 reactions together with 30 other isolated clusters of much smaller sizes. The tree structure of the main cluster is shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> when <italic>λ</italic> = 1. Five smaller isolated clusters with size larger than 10 are shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref> We defined coherent circadian gene clusters as the clusters obtained from truncating the tree at height with <italic>h</italic> = 12 so that the genes in each cluster showed coherent circadian phases. The summary of top 10 coherent circadian gene clusters is shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The genes in the same cluster tend to belong to the closely related metabolic pathways. In particular, we found the top three clusters are all enriched with genes in purine/pyrimidine metabolism. Furthermore, these three clusters showed coherent circadian gene expression around CT2 (circadian time 2), CT4, and CT15 respectively, where CT0 is subjective lights-on. Among them, we found that three <italic>impdh</italic> gene homologs, <italic>impdh1a</italic>, <italic>impdh1b</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> showing strong circadian rhythms of expression fall into two different coherent circadian gene clusters. The peaks of rhythmic expression of <italic>impdh2</italic> and <italic>impdh1a</italic> were observed at CT23 in cluster 1, while <italic>impdh1b</italic> exhibited peak expression at around CT12 in cluster 3. In summary, our method segregated ZCOGs in both metabolic pathways and circadian phases.</p>

<title>Circadian metabolome in larval zebrafish</title>
<p>We next measured the levels of water-soluble metabolites in 5dpf larval zebrafish collected every six hours during 24 hours (ZT0-ZT24) under LD condition using a hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) spectroscopy. A total of 173 peak signals were quantified based on their spectral intensities. 73 of them can be assigned to known metabolites including amino acids and nucleotides (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). We found that 18 of them showed significant circadian oscillation (cosine fitting p value&lt;0.05 and ANOVA p value&lt;0.05). These correspond to nine unique known metabolites as shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. IMP showed robust circadian rhythm with its peak time around ZT7. The rest of circadian metabolites include lactate (ZT9), glutamine (ZT23), glutamate (ZT13), threonine (ZT16), aspartate (ZT1), creatine (ZT5), carnitine (ZT0), and phosphocreatine (ZT20). We further identified ZCOGs that are linked to these circadian metabolites on our zebrafish metabolic network (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Lactate is connected with lactate dehydrogenase Bb (ldhbb) peaking at CT17. Creatine and phosphocreatine are connected with creatine kinase brain b (ckbb) peaking at CT4. Glutamine and glutamate are connected with glutamine synthase, glula and glulb, peaking at CT5 and CT6 respectively. In particular, IMP is directly connected with ten circadian enzymes including impdh homologs in de novo purine synthesis pathway. Therefore, the circadian oscillation of IMP further supports the circadian rhythm of de novo purine synthesis from their enzyme expression.</p>

<title>Circadian expression rhythms of three <italic>impdh</italic> gene homologs in adult zebrafish</title>
<p>We next investigated the circadian gene expression in adult zebrafish. We monitored the circadian behavior of adult zebrafish (6 months old males) under an infrared behavioral monitoring platform specially designed for adult zebrafish (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig.</xref>). Wild-type (WT) zebrafish were raised in 14h:10h light/dark (LD) cycle from birth. Adult zebrafish showed robust circadian changes in their locomotor activities under LD (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig.</xref>) while the amplitude of oscillation was significantly lower in dark/dark (DD) conditions (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig.</xref>). Such strong dependence of circadian activities on light has also been seen in larval zebrafish [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The circadian activity in adult zebrafish is more robust than that in larval zebrafish in terms of the baseline activity and the amplitude of the rhythm.</p>
<p>We next collected adult zebrafish whole brain every four hours during 48 hours under both LD and DD conditions. The locomotor activity of each adult fish was recorded before being sacrificed (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>). The whole-genome transcriptome profiles of adult brain in this time-series were assayed using Agilent zebrafish microarrays. We used a similar statistical method to identify zebrafish circadian genes (ZCOG) as our previous study in larval zebrafish. Under a False Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt;0.05, we identified 714 ZCOGs in adult brain under both LD and DD conditions (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). 283 ZCOGs were shared by both adult brain and larval ZCOGs (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Dataset</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) with many exhibiting a similar phase of rhythmic expression during zebrafish post embryonic development (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).

<p>We next collected five additional tissues (eye, intestine, liver, heart and muscle in addition to whole brain) from adult fish maintained under LD cycles at zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0) (where ZT0 is defined as lights-on and ZT14 is defined as lights-off) and ZT12. Using real-time PCR, we revealed that <italic>impdh1a</italic> was predominantly expressed in the eye, where the expression level at ZT0 was considerably higher than at ZT12 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). <italic>impdh1b</italic> exhibited expression in all tissues, with higher expression at ZT12 than ZT0 in each case (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Although the expression levels of <italic>impdh2</italic> in the heart, muscle and liver were much higher compared with other tissues, the most significant circadian oscillation appeared in the liver (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). These results validated and extended our microarray results. Thus, the circadian expression of three <italic>impdh</italic> gene homologs are conserved between larval and adult zebrafish. From their spatial and temporal expression patterns, we hypothesize that the three <italic>impdh</italic> gene homologs have different tissue-specific functions. While <italic>impdh1b</italic> may play a “housekeeping” role in most tissues, <italic>impdh1a</italic> is likely to have an eye-related function and <italic>impdh2</italic> may function in metabolically active tissues.</p>

<title>Distinct functions of the three <italic>impdh</italic> homologs in early development</title>
<p>To explore the functions of the three <italic>impdh</italic> gene homologs, we knocked down <italic>impdh1a</italic>, <italic>impdh1b</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> expression using morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) respectively. The phenotypes of the three <italic>impdh</italic> morphants (MO injected larvae) at 5 dpf are shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-5O</xref>. WT zebrafish possess three types of pigment: silver or reflective pigment produced by iridophores (red arrow in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), yellow pigment derived from xanthophores (yellow arrow in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) and black pigment derived from melanophores such as that in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (black arrow in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In WT zebrafish embryos, black pigment begins to form around the Prim-5 stage (24 hpf), xanthophores first appear on the fish head and iridophores are first present on the fish eye at the long-pec stage (48 hpf) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. When <italic>impdh1a</italic> was knocked down, pigmentation defects were visible and easily recognized starting from 72 hpf. At 5 dpf in WT embryos, the iridophore retinal ring is normally filled out and iridophores are densely packed in a dorsal stripe. In contrast, nearly all yellow and silver pigments were absent in <italic>impdh1a</italic> morphants (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G, I</xref>) and the area covered by melanocytes in the head region was much broader in <italic>impdh1a</italic> morphants than those in other <italic>impdh</italic> morphants and controls (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, F, I, L, O, and Q</xref> for quantification).</p>

<p>In addition to loss of pigment, <italic>impdh1a</italic> knock-down specifically led to microphthalmia, suggesting that <italic>impdh1a</italic> plays a crucial role in regulating eye growth. As shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5P</xref>, the retina size measured along the anterior to posterior axis was much smaller in <italic>impdh1a</italic> morphants than in the control groups. Therefore we dissected and sectioned the eyes into slices along the transverse axis to examine in more detail the eye anatomy. In histological imaging of the retina (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, E, H, K, N</xref>), none of three <italic>impdh</italic> homologs morphants showed alterations in the retinal cell types. Furthermore, there were no obvious differences in lens area or pigmentation of the RPE between <italic>impdh1a</italic>, <italic>impdh1b</italic>, <italic>impdh2</italic> morphants, control and WT except that the overall eye size was much smaller in the <italic>impdh1a</italic> morphants than in controls. In contrast, both <italic>impdh1b</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> morphants displayed normal eye morphology and pigmentation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the rate of growth of the <italic>impdh1b</italic> morphants was higher than controls while <italic>impdh2</italic> morphants developed more slowly. Thus at 32 hpf, <italic>impdh2</italic> morphants showed a 6–8 h developmental delay (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig.</xref>) and only hatched at 52 hpf. In contrast, the more rapid growth of <italic>impdh1b</italic> morphants was visualized by their longer body length measured between 52 hpf and 5dpf (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A, B Fig.</xref>). Therefore, our data suggest that while <italic>impdh2</italic> function tends to increase the rate of zebrafish embryonic development, <italic>impdh1b</italic> inhibits early growth.</p>

<title><italic>impdh2</italic> mediates the circadian control of cell cycle</title>
<p>Impdh is well known as a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides. As purines are basic building blocks of DNA and RNA that are needed in cell proliferation, we reason that the circadian rhythm of <italic>impdh</italic> may influence the rhythm of cell entry into S phase rhythm. To test our hypothesis, we first used MPA, a selective inhibitor of <italic>impdh</italic> protein, to treat larval zebrafish. We used BrdU to label S-phase nuclei in larvae at six circadian time points as shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>. In 5 dpf WT larvae, we counted the number of Brdu positive nuclei and found a strong daily S-phase rhythm across 11 somites of the fish trunk (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). We then treated 4 dpf larval zebrafish with MPA at different concentrations and sampled fish starting at ZT0 of 5 dpf at 4h intervals. Larval zebrafish did not show altered morphology or behavioral changes when MPA concentration was below 100μM. MPA treatment significantly reduced the amplitude of the S phase rhythm in a dose dependent manner. This reduction in rhythmic cell proliferation was rescued when 100μM guanosine was added to MPA-treated larval fish (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results suggest that MPA inhibits circadian rhythmicity of S phase by limiting the GTP required by DNA synthesis and that de novo purine synthesis plays an important role on the circadian rhythmicity of cell cycle.</p>

<p>Next, in order to examine which <italic>impdh</italic> gene homolog actually contributes to circadian control of cell cycle, we knocked down the three <italic>impdh</italic> homologs individually using MOs and studied the effect on the circadian rhythm of S phase. We failed to observe any effect of <italic>impdh1a</italic> MO or <italic>impdh1b</italic> MO on cell cycle rhythmicity. In contrast, the high-amplitude daily rhythm of S phase was significantly suppressed when <italic>impdh2</italic> was knocked down (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).

<title>Genome-wide effects of <italic>impdh</italic> homolog-specific knock-downs</title>
<p>Impdh has been well documented to serve as a key enzyme in the GTP biosynthesis pathway. In order to explore in more detail the mechanisms whereby changes in purine biosynthesis might generate the overt aspects of the morphant phenotypes, we measured global transcriptome changes in the whole body of <italic>impdh1a</italic>, <italic>impdh1b</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> morphants (32hpf) using RNA-seq. We identified 468, 331 and 1166 genes whose expression was significantly altered in the <italic>impdh1a</italic>, <italic>impdh1b</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> MO knock-down compared to controls (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig.</xref>). There was only limited overlap amongst these three groups, with only 36 genes showing altered expression in all three MOs (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig.</xref>). This indicates that the down-regulations of three <italic>impdh</italic> homologs have distinct impacts on global gene expression.</p>
<p>We next classified the genes affected by <italic>impdh</italic>-specific knock-downs into KEGG pathways and examined their tissue specific expression patterns based on annotations in the ZFIN database [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The expression of genes affected by the <italic>impdh1a</italic> knock-down is enriched in retina inner/outer nuclear layers (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Dataset</xref>) while those affected by <italic>impdh1b</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> knock-downs are enriched in the regulation of developmental process. Thus, <italic>rpe65a</italic> involved in visual pigment regeneration and <italic>ddt</italic> in melanin synthesis are significantly up-regulated upon <italic>impdh1a</italic> knock-down. Both <italic>rpe65a</italic> and <italic>ddt</italic> display circadian rhythms of expression with peaks at CT24 and CT7 respectively. Interestingly, mutations in RPE65 cause retinal pigmentosa similarly to IMPDH1 mutations [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. <italic>dhfr</italic> which synthesizes tetrahydrofolate essential for purine metabolism is down-regulated in both <italic>impdh1a</italic> and <italic>impdh1b</italic> morphants. In addition, metabolic enzymes including <italic>psat1</italic> and <italic>phgdh</italic> involved in serine synthesis and <italic>bcat1</italic> in the synthesis of branched chain amino acids were up-regulated in <italic>impdh2</italic> morphants. Both serine and branched chain amino acid metabolism have been implicated as key requirements for cell proliferation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

<p>In mouse retina, ChIP-seq analysis has revealed that <italic>Impdh1</italic> is regulated by <italic>Crx</italic>, a transcription factor specifically expressed in the eye and pineal gland [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our study, <italic>crx</italic> showed circadian expression peaking at CT17 preceding the peak of <italic>impdh1a</italic>. The circadian oscillation of <italic>impdh1a</italic> may be directly regulated by <italic>crx</italic> and indirectly driven by <italic>clock</italic>. Our functional analysis implicates <italic>impdh1a</italic> in melanogenesis and eye development. Our previous study has shown that melanogenesis exhibits a circadian rhythm with a peak around CT0 similar to rhythmic <italic>impdh1a</italic> expression. Therefore, the circadian oscillation of <italic>impdh1a</italic> may contribute to circadian rhythm of melanogenesis in zebrafish. In the promoter of <italic>impdh1b</italic>, we encountered a retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) response element (RRE), the binding site for ROR and NR1D family transcription factors. This result is consistent with the CT12 peak of rhythmic <italic>impdh1b</italic> expression since we observed previously that circadian oscillating genes with peaks around CT12 tend to contain RRE elements [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Taken together, we proposed that the three zebrafish homologs of <italic>impdh</italic> are regulated by different circadian transcription factors which lead to their different circadian phases and tissue distribution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previously, we have demonstrated that a functional circadian clock is already present at 5 dpf in larval zebrafish and we have identified more than 2,800 ZCOGs using whole larval RNA extracts and a high-throughput approach [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To examine the effects of these ZCOGs on metabolism, we developed a computational method to partition different metabolic processes according to time of day. Our clustering method is based on two assumptions. First, the enzymes similar in circadian phases of gene expression at the transcriptome level also tend to reach their activity peaks approximately at the same time of day. Second, the co-expressed circadian enzymes that are proximal in metabolic network form a module of common metabolic function. Under these assumptions, our method should be generally applicable to the integration of circadian transcriptome data and global metabolic network. Applying our method to zebrafish circadian transcriptome, we found that top clusters of ZCOGs with coherent circadian expression are enriched with genes in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. At a rate-limiting step of this pathway, three <italic>impdh</italic> gene homologs that have not been previously implicated in circadian clock function, all showed robust, high amplitude circadian rhythms. Furthermore, their circadian expression is developmentally conserved between larval and adult zebrafish. Subsequent functional analysis of these <italic>impdh</italic> homologs revealed that <italic>impdh1a</italic> is involved in pigment synthesis and eye development while <italic>impdh2</italic> is generally implicated in the control of cell proliferation. Expression of both <italic>impdh1a</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> oscillated with circadian peaks at CT23. In comparison, <italic>impdh1b</italic> was ubiquitously expressed and showed an opposite phase of rhythmic expression to <italic>impdh1a</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> in all tissues tested. Although the detailed functions of <italic>impdh1b</italic> are still unclear, it seems that it may have the function to delay growth in contrast to both <italic>impdh1a</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> which appear to accelerate growth. Our RNA-seq analysis of <italic>impdh</italic> homolog-specific morphants identified downstream genes that may be responsible for the different phenotypes. Our promoter analysis also suggested that the rhythmic expression of the three <italic>impdh</italic> homologs was controlled by different circadian transcription factors: <italic>impdh2</italic> was regulated by Bmal1/Clock, <italic>impdh1a</italic> by Crx, and <italic>impdh1b</italic> by Ror or Nr1d.</p>
<p>Fustin et. al (2012) have reported the circadian expression of genes involved in purine and pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism in mouse liver [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. They revealed that circadian rhythms of <italic>Ppat</italic> and <italic>Pnp</italic> expression contribute to rhythmic synthesis of guanine nucleotides but they fell short of linking this phenomenon to circadian control of the cell cycle. In mouse, <italic>Ppat</italic> shows strong circadian oscillation in multiple tissues with a peak at CT11, typical for Bmal1/Clock regulated circadian genes. Consistently, our previous larval study identified rhythmic expression of several <italic>pnp</italic> homologs in zebrafish [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our results showed that both MPA inhibition and impdh2 knockdown have significantly dampened the amplitude of circadian rhythm of S phase in proliferating cells of zebrafish. This is consistent with the earlier report that MPA and impdh2 have the same inhibitory effect on the sprouting of intersegmental blood vessels in early zebrafish larvae [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We found that IMP, the substrate for Impdh2, is peaking at ZT7, five hours ahead of the peak of S phase. This observation suggests that the peak of Impdh2 activity may be between ZT7 and ZT12 to deplete IMP level to provide purine for DNA synthesis. Thus the circadian oscillation of IMP together with <italic>impdh2</italic> can have an important regulatory role on the metabolic flux through purine synthesis pathway. From the microarray data for mouse tissues and cell lines in the BioGPS database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org" xlink:type="simple">http://biogps.org/</ext-link>), mouse <italic>Impdh2</italic> together with other de novo purine synthesis genes are highly expressed in embryonic stem cells. From the in situ data for the developing mouse embryo at E14.5 in Metscout database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metscout.mpg.de" xlink:type="simple">http://www.metscout.mpg.de</ext-link>), <italic>Impdh2</italic> is expressed in proliferating cells including those in the ventricular zone of the brain similar to other enzymes involved in de novo purine synthesis. It was shown that enzymes in de novo purine synthesis form reversible multi-enzyme complex in so-called “purinosome” in HeLa cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These observations suggest that the enzymes in de novo purine synthesis pathway are co-regulated both spatially and temporally to control metabolic flux. Karpowicz et al. (2013) have found that the circadian clock regulates stem cell regeneration in the fly intestine [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In mammals, there are also reports of circadian clock regulation in epidermal cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and hematopoietic stem cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, our results suggest that circadian purine synthesis may directly contribute to cell proliferation and stem cell regeneration regulation by the circadian clock in a highly conserved manner.</p>
<p>Our study has revealed that <italic>impdh1a</italic> is required for pigment synthesis and ocular development. Interestingly, the <italic>gart</italic> and <italic>paics</italic> mutants which affect two enzymes upstream of Impdh in de novo purine synthesis, display almost identical phenotypes in the zebrafish retina as our <italic>impdh1a</italic> morphant [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. From this previous study it was proposed that purine synthesis provides key precursors for three types of pigment cells in zebrafish: iridophores, xanthophores and melanophores [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Our results suggest that <italic>impdh1a</italic> is also involved in these processes. This is consistent with our previous finding that melanogenesis is under circadian clock control in zebrafish [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, it seems that <italic>impdh1a</italic> and <italic>impdh2</italic> along with other enzymes in de novo purine synthesis are involved in circadian regulation of two seemingly different processes that are both controlled by purine synthesis: pigment synthesis in pigment cells and cell growth in proliferating cells. This functional difference is also revealed by the distinct differential gene expression upon their MO knockdowns.</p>
<p>It is well known that circadian clock dysfunction is closely associated with metabolic disorders or diseases. Metabolism-based research in circadian rhythms represents a potentially important contribution to our understanding of circadian output functions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The mis-regulation of enzymes in nucleotide metabolism is especially prone to diseases. Only two IMPDH homologs, IMPDH1 and IMPDH2, exist in humans sharing 84% amino acid identity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The amino acid sequences of Impdh homologs are highly conserved between human, mouse and zebrafish [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thus, zebrafish Impdh1a shares 90% identity and Impdh1b, 91% identity with human IMPDH1 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig.</xref>). In addition, zebrafish Impdh2 shares 91% identity with human IMPDH2. Among the two IMPDH homologs that have been described in humans, IMPDH1 is linked to several types of severe retinal degeneration including retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, IMPDH2 contributes to cell proliferation in a variety of cell lines and tissues such as activated lymphocytes and tumor cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Thus, IMPDH has already become an important drug target for antiviral, cancer chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy. Immediately downstream of IMPDH, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) that also showed circadian expression similar to IMPDH2 in our study is implicated in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a neurological disease [<xref rid="pcbi.1004086.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Therefore, our study provides novel insight into whether enzymes in de novo purine synthesis, especially IMPDH, can be used as biomarkers for metabolic diseases which are linked with circadian clock disorders.</p>

<title>Analysis of zebrafish metabolic network</title>
<p>We downloaded all enzymatic reactions and their associated genes, i.e. Gene-Protein-Reaction (GPR) association, for zebrafish included in the KEGG database.

RNA-seq was performed by Partner Institute for Computational Biology Omics Core. mRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Illumina). Briefly, 1ug poly-A containing mRNA was purified using poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads and then fragmented. The cleaved RNA fragments were primed with random hexamers into first strand cDNA, and then the second-strand cDNA was synthesized. The ends of double-strand cDNA (ds cDNA) were repaired into blunt ends, after which an adenosine base was added to the 3’ ends of ds cDNA and adaptors with a single T base overhang on 3’ end were ligated. These adapter-modified cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR which was performed with a PCR primer cocktail that annealed to the ends of the adapters.

The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C and the supernatants were freeze dried. For <sup>1</sup>H-NMR measurement, the extracts were dissolved in a mixture of buffer (1.5 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>, 0.1% TSP in D<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.1) and D<sub>2</sub>O (1:9).</p>

<title><sup>1</sup>H-NMR analysis</title>
<p>Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II spectrometer using a <sup>1</sup>H-BBI double resonance probe (Bruker Biospin GmbH). 1D NOESY spectra were recorded with presaturation for water suppression and 256 scans at 300 K (26.9°C). A prescan delay of 4 s was used together with a mixing time of 10 ms. Pulse lengths were determined automatically by the Bruker AU program <italic>pulsecal</italic>. 64k complex data points corresponding to a sweep width of 12,345.68 Hz were recorded.</p>

<title>Processing of <sup>1</sup>H-NMR data</title>
<p>All spectra were treated identically using an exponential apodization function, introducing an additional linewidth of 0.3 Hz and automated phasing, baseline correction and referencing using the Bruker macro <italic>apk0</italic>.<italic>noe</italic>. Preliminary peak assignment was done using databases (Chenomx (Chenomx Inc.), BBIOREFCODE (Bruker BioSpin GmbH), The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)) and confirmed by spiking pure substances in the samples. Integration was done using AMIX (Bruker Biospin GmbH). Spectra were scaled to total intensity. Circadian oscillations were identified by fitting the mean intensities across 24 hours to a cosine function with periods between 20–28 and shifting phases. Statistical significance of differences between groups collected at different time points were assessed by ANOVA.</p>
