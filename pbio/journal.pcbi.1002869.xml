      <abstract>
        <p>Alpha-hemolysin (α-HL) is a self-assembling, channel-forming toxin produced by most <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains as a 33.2-kDa soluble monomer. Upon binding to a susceptible cell membrane, the monomer self-assembles to form a 232.4-kDa heptamer that ultimately causes host cell lysis and death. Consequently, α-HL plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections, such as pneumonia, mastitis, keratitis and arthritis. In this paper, experimental studies show that oroxylin A (ORO), a natural compound without anti-<italic>S. aureus</italic> activity, can inhibit the hemolytic activity of α-HL. Molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and mutagenesis assays were performed to understand the formation of the α-HL-ORO complex. This combined approach revealed that the catalytic mechanism of inhibition involves the direct binding of ORO to α-HL, which blocks the conformational transition of the critical “Loop” region of the α-HL protein thereby inhibiting its hemolytic activity. This mechanism was confirmed by experimental data obtained from a deoxycholate-induced oligomerization assay. It was also found that, in a co-culture system with <italic>S. aureus</italic> and human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells, ORO could protect against α-HL-mediated injury. These findings indicate that ORO hinders the lytic activity of α-HL through a novel mechanism, which should facilitate the design of new and more effective antibacterial agents against <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The mechanism controlling protein-ligand interactions is one of the most important processes in rational drug design. X-ray crystallography is a traditional tool used to investigate the interaction of ligands and proteins in a complex. However, protein crystallography is inefficient, and the development of crystal technology and research remains unequally distributed. Thus, it seems impractical to explore the structure of the α-hemolysin-ORO monomer complex by crystallography. Therefore, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the receptor-ligand interaction in the α-HL-ORO monomer complex. In this study, we found that oroxylin A (ORO), a natural compound with little anti-<italic>S. aureus</italic> activity, can inhibit the hemolytic activity of α-HL at low concentrations. Through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we determined the potential binding mode of the protein-ligand interaction. The data revealed that ORO directly binds to α-HL, an interaction that blacks the conformational transition of the critical “Loop” region in α-HL and thus prevents the formation of the α-HL heptameric transmembrane pore, which ultimately inhibits the hemolytic activity of α-HL. This mechanism was confirmed by experimental data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ORO could protect against α-HL-mediated injury in human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen in humans and other mammals that causes many different types of infections, including superficial abscesses, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, endocarditis, and sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Lowy1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Sutra1">[2]</xref>. The number of virulence factors secreted by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, including extracellular and cell wall-related proteins, determines its pathogenicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Aksimentiev1">[3]</xref>. The virulence factor α-hemolysin (α-HL) is one of the most important factors produced by the majority of <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains and recent studies have demonstrated that it plays a major role in <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Bhakdi1">[4]</xref>. Previous studies using a mouse model of <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia have shown that <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains that lack the <italic>hla</italic> gene (and thus do not secrete α-HL) cause less lung injury and inflammation than the <italic>hla</italic> positive strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Bartlett1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The α-HL protein, isolated from the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium <italic>S. aureus</italic>, is a well-studied model that has been used to elucidate mechanisms of membrane insertion by soluble proteins. Studies have shown that α-HL can self-assemble on the lipid bilayers of the membranes of susceptible host cells to form a wide heptameric pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Song1">[6]</xref>. The protein is toxic for a wide range of mammalian cells, particularly erythrocytes and epithelial cells and serves primarily as a tool that converts host tissue into nutrients for any bacteria that expresses it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Aksimentiev1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In an effort to increase our understanding of the function of α-HL, the structure of the heptameric pore was resolved by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 0.19 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Song1">[6]</xref>. Contained within the mushroom-shaped homo-oligomeric heptamer is a 10 nm long solvent-filled channel that runs along the seven-fold axis and ranges from 1.4 nm to 4.6 nm in diameter. The lytic transmembrane domain forms the lower half of a 14-strand antiparallel β barrel, to which each protomer contributes two 6.5 nm long β strands. Considering the essential nature of the heptameric crystal structure, Ragle et al. used a modified β-cyclodextrin compound, IB201, to prevent the α-HL-induced lysis of human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Ragle1">[7]</xref>. This protective effect does not result from the ability of β-cyclodextrin to impair formation of the oligomeric α-HL on the cell surface, supporting a role for this molecule in the blockade of the lytic pore. Previous investigations had demonstrated the use of unsubstituted β-cyclodextrin as an adapter molecule that is capable of lodging within the central pore of α-HL and can thus facilitate the use of the toxin as a biosensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Gu1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Gu2">[9]</xref>. The investigation of β-cyclodextrin using IB201 revealed that it blocks ion conductance through the assembled hemolysin pore, which supports the finding that β-cyclodextrin inserts into the pore itself. Although the inhibitory effect of β-cyclodextrin on ion conductance and red blood cell hemolysis were both observed in the low micromolar concentration range, this treatment strategy is passive. It is clear that prior to inhibition by β-cyclodextrin, the oligomeric α-HL on the cell surface has been formed and the cell has been damaged. Therefore, further research to identify new potent inhibitors is essential.</p>
      <p>In our previous study, we reported that baicalin (BAI), a natural compound could bind with α-HL directly and inhibit the hemolytic activity of by restraining the conformation change of the binding cavity, “triangle region” (residues 147–153) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Qiu1">[10]</xref>. In this study, we found that another natural compound, oroxylin A (ORO) could inhibit the hemolytic activity of α-HL stronger. Surprisingly, based on molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, a new mechanism of inhibition was obtained compared with baicalin (BAI), which is that ORO bind to new active sites (residues Thr12 and Ile14) of α-HL and inhibit the hemolytic activity of α-HL due to the binding of ORO to the critical “Loop” region of α-HL. All these results indicate that the “triangle region” (residues 147–153) is not the only active site of inhibitor bound with α-HL and “Loop” region of α-HL also plays an important role in the inhibition of hemolytic activity of α-HL. With these approaches, we identified that ORO, which binds to the active site (Thr11, Thr12, Ile14, Gly15 and Lys46) of α-HL, is a potent inhibitor of the α-HL self-assembly process. These results could provide useful in the design of novel drugs for α-HL.</p>

        <title>ORO inhibits the hemolytic activity of α-HL</title>
        <p>The studies that were performed to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed that the maximum concentration of ORO tested was not able to inhibit the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which indicates that ORO has no antimicrobial activity against <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Our previous study showed that many natural compounds could inhibit the hemolytic activity of the culture supernatant of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by decreasing the expression of α-HL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Qiu2">[11]</xref>. In the present study, we found that ORO cannot affect the production of α-HL in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g001">Figure 1</xref>). However, ORO attenuated the hemolytic activity of purified α-HL in a concentration-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Consequently, it is reasonable to deduce that ORO has a direct effect on α-HL.</p>

        <p>Based on the previous result, which showed that ORO inhibited the hemolytic activity of α-HL, we studied the binding of ORO to α-HL via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations using the AutoDock 4.0 and Gromacs 4.5.1 software packages, respectively. The initial structure of the monomeric α-HL was obtained from homology modeling, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Meesters1">[12]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The complex structure based on the docking results was used as the initial structure of the 200-ns molecular dynamics simulations and the preferential binding mode of ORO to α-HL was determined. The simulations show that ORO is a ligand that can bind to α-HL via hydrogen bonding and van der Waal interaction. Over the time course of the simulation, ORO localizes to the “Loop” region of α-HL, which is reported to participate in crucial protomer-protomer interactions during α-HL self-assembly and is therefore important in heptamer formation and cell lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Song1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Walker1">[13]</xref>. The predicted binding mode of ORO with α-HL is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and the electrostatic potentials of the residues around the binding site are mapped, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, using APBS software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Baker1">[14]</xref>. In detail, the binding model of ORO to the Loop of α-HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) revealed that the methyl group of the 4H-chromen-4-one moiety of ORO formed a hydrogen bond with the side chain of the Lys46 amino acid in α-HL. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the number of hydrogen bonds fluctuates mostly between 1 and 2 throughout the simulation time, which indicates that ORO and α-HL are always interacting via a hydrogen bond.</p>

        <p>Moreover, the neutral side chains of the Thr11, Thr12, and Ile14 residues of α-HL form Van der Waals interactions with ORO, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. Thr11 and Thr12 anchor the benzene ring of ORO, and Ile14 and Gly15 play an important role in stabilizing the 4H-chromen-4-one moiety of ORO. In addition, the methoxy of the 4H-chromen-4-one moiety forms strong interactions with Ser16 and Lys46, which will be confirmed by energy decomposition analysis.</p>
        <p>The root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the residues surrounding the ORO binding site of α-HL (residues 1–50) in the α-HL-ORO complex and in free α-HL were calculated to illustrate the flexibility of these residues. The RMSF of these residues are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g005">Figure 5</xref> and clearly depict the difference in the flexibility of the binding site of α-HL due to the presence or absence of ORO. All of the residues in the α-HL binding site that is bound with ORO show a smaller degree of flexibility, with RMSF values less than 0.3 nm, when compared with the RMSF values calculated for the free α-HL, which indicates that these residues become more rigid after binding to ORO. These results indicate that the stabilization of the α-HL binding cavity in this complex is mostly due to residues Thr11, Thr12, Ile14, Gly15 and Lys46, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g003">Figure 3B</xref>.</p>

        <title>The binding site in the α-HL-ORO complex</title>
        <p>The MD results provide an approximate binding mode of the protein-ligand interaction of the α-HL-ORO complex. However, the contribution of the residues surrounding the binding site of α-HL is not clear. Therefore, the electrostatic, Van der Waals, solvation and total contribution of the residues to the binding free energy were calculated using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Punkvang1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-SchaffnerBarbero1">[16]</xref>.

        <p>As shown, Lys46 has an appreciable electrostatic (<italic>ΔE<sub>ele</sub></italic>) contribution, with a value less than −2.3 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). Because Lys46 is close to the methoxy of ORO and an electrostatic interaction exists, strong H-bonds are formed between α-HL and ORO. In addition, residues Thr12 (with a <italic>ΔE<sub>vdw</sub></italic> of −1.2 kcal/mol) and Ile14 (with a <italic>ΔE<sub>vdw</sub></italic> of ≤−2.1) exhibit strong Van der Waals interactions with the ligand because of the close proximity between these two residues and the 4H-chromen-4-one moiety of ORO. The majority of the decomposed energy interaction, with the exception of the energy associated with Lys46, originates from Van der Waals interactions. The electrostatic contribution from these key residues does not appear to have a significant influence on the formation of the α-HL-ORO complex.</p>
        <p>The total binding free energy of the α-HL-ORO complex, <italic>ΔG<sub>bind</sub></italic>, and its detailed energy contributions, which were calculated using the MM-GBSA approach, are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002869-t001">Table 1</xref>. The <italic>ΔG<sub>bind</sub></italic> can be divided into polar (<italic>ΔG<sub>ele,sol</sub></italic>+<italic>ΔE<sub>ele</sub></italic>) and nonpolar (<italic>ΔG<sub>nonpolar</sub></italic>+<italic>ΔE<sub>vdw</sub></italic>) energies. As shown, the primary contributor to the free energy of the binding of ORO to α-HL is <italic>ΔG<sub>nonpolar</sub></italic>+<italic>ΔE<sub>vdw</sub></italic>, with a value of −11.2 kcal/mol, whereas <italic>ΔG<sub>ele,sol</sub></italic>+<italic>ΔE<sub>ele</sub></italic> have a minor contribution of −6.4 kcal/mol. This difference arises from the intermolecular Van der Waals energy, which is mainly achieved from the ORO-binding α-HL residues. After summation of the solute entropy term (5.1 kcal/mol), an estimated <italic>ΔG<sub>bind</sub></italic> of −12.5 kcal/mol was found, which suggests that ORO can strongly bind to and interact with the binding site of α-HL.</p>

        <p>The same procedure was followed with two α-HL mutants, T12A-HL and I14A-HL, to verify the accuracy of the binding site in the α-HL-ORO complex. A complex of each mutant with ORO was used as the preliminary structure for the MD simulations and the MD trajectories were analyzed using the MM-GBSA method. In addition, the T12A-HL and I14A-HL mutants were expressed and purified; the binding free energy and the number of binding sites between ORO and the two mutants were then determined using the fluorescence spectroscopy quenching method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Hu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Lakowicz1">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g006">Figure 6D and 6F</xref>, ORO differentially binds to the two mutants and the WT-HL, an observation that was confirmed by pair interaction decomposition analysis of the free energy, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g006">Figure 6C and 6E</xref>. The major contributions to the free energy of the complexes of ORO with the α-HL mutants were residues Thr115, Tyr118, Pro103, Phe120 and Ile142. Furthermore, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002869-t001">Table 1</xref>, the MM-GBSA calculation predicted that T12A-HL and I14A-HL bound more weakly to ORO than WT-HL, with estimated <italic>ΔG<sub>bind</sub></italic> values of −3.8 kcal/mol and −5.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Consequently, the calculations for T12A-HL and I14A-HL show that these mutants exhibited a decrease in the binding energy of approximately 7 to 8 kcal/mol compared to WT-HL. The experimental measurement of the binding free energy, shows that the interaction between ORO and WT-HL is highest, which means that WT-HL has the strongest ability to bind to ORO; the mutants exhibits the weaker ability, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002869-t002">Table 2</xref>. Importantly, because the calculated binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002869-t002">Table 2</xref>, we believe that the MD simulations generated a reliable model of the α-HL-ORO complex.</p>

        <title>The conformation change of the “Loop” in the complex</title>
        <p>ORO inhibits the hemolytic activity of α-HL and binds to the “Loop” cavity of α-HL, which has been shown to be critical to its hemolytic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Song1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Ragle2">[19]</xref>. Consequently, the conformations of the “Loop” region in the α-HL-ORO complex and in free α-HL were investigated using a MD simulated trajectory. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, the distance between the C<sub>α</sub> of Thr12 and the C<sub>α</sub> of Thr19 in the complex ranged from 0.9 to 1.15 nm over the time course of the simulation, with an average distance of 1.05 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). In the absence of ORO, the distance between these points ranges from 1.15 to 1.3 nm, with an average distance of 1.24 nm. However, the distance between the C<sub>α</sub> of Thr12 and the C<sub>α</sub> of Thr19 is 1.81 nm in the crystal structure of the α-HL heptamer, which is available in the Protein Data Bank under the accession number 7AHL. Dynamic fluctuations in the distance between the C<sub>α</sub> of Thr12 and the C<sub>α</sub> of Thr19 likely indicate that the conformation of the “Loop” region is restrained when ORO binds to these two residues. Through comparing the structure of the loop in α-HL-ORO complex with the crystal structure of α-HL monomeric observed in the X-ray structure of the oligomer (PDB code: 7AHL), it is indicated that ORO blocks the required conformational transition of the loop by binding to the loop, which is the mechanism of decreasing the lytic activity of α-HL. The RMSD values also reflect the variation in the conformation change of the “Loop” region during the simulation time. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g008">Figure 8</xref>, the RMSD values of the “Loop” region in free α-HL are ∼0.4 nm; these values are clearly higher than that of the α-HL-ORO complex, which is in the range of 0.323 nm. In addition, as shown by the RMSD trends displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g008">Figure 8</xref>, the RMSD data agreed with other types of measurements, reinforcing that the WT-HL and ORO complex displays very little variation in the conformation of the “Loop” during the MD simulation. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in the dynamics of the critical “Loop” region during the MD simulations of the wild type and free α-HL, which confirms the effect of inhibition of α-HL on cell lysis. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g009">Figure 9</xref>, our models predict a marked conformational transition in the “Loop” region for the wild type complex to the free α-HL.</p>

        <p>A comparative analysis of these MD simulations suggests that the inhibitory activity of ORO is highest for the wild type α-HL, followed by the T12A mutant and then I14A. This conclusion, which is also supported by the mechanism of hemolytic inhibition, is in good agreement with experimental results. Data from a deoxycholate-induced oligomerization assay shows that the site-directed mutagenesis of T12A and I14A has no influence on the assembly of the SDS-stable oligomer, α-HL<sub>7</sub>. However, the formation of α-HL<sub>7</sub> was inhibited when treated with 8 µg/ml of ORO. This inhibitory effect was decreased with either of the two mutants, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g010">Figure 10</xref>, with I14A showing a higher inhibition than T12A.</p>

        <title>ORO prevents α-HL-mediated A549 cell injury</title>
        <p>Human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells have previously been employed to investigate the influence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> on lung cell injury and α-HL has been found to be the major factor associated with their injury and death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Ragle1">[7]</xref>. Because our previous results show that ORO blocks the self-assembly of α-HL, we speculated that ORO may protect A549 cells from <italic>S. aureus</italic>-mediated death. Consequently, A549 cells were stained with a live/dead (green/red) reagent following co-culture with <italic>S. aureus</italic> 8325-4. The uninfected cells displayed the green fluorophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g011">Figure 11A</xref>), indicating their live status. A549 cells were significantly affected by their co-culture with <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as reflected by the increase in the amount of red fluorophore observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g011">Figure 11B</xref>). However, the addition of 8 µg/ml of ORO resulted in a significantly lower number of dead cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g011">Figure 11C</xref>). Consistent with a previous study, treatment of A549 cells with the <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain DU1090, which cannot produce α-HL, does not result in their death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g011">Figure 11D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Qiu2">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay was employed to quantitatively assess the influence of ORO on the protection of A549 cell injury and, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002869-g011">Figure 11E</xref>, the addition of 1 to 8 µg/ml of ORO affords a dose-dependent protection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>), which was calculated using OriginPro 8.0 (OriginLab, USA), was 3.09 µg/ml. These results highlight the potential therapeutic effect of ORO, which merits further investigation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Historically, vancomycin and linezolid have been the recommended empirical and definitive therapies for the treatment of methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia. However, the emergence of multi-drug-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>, such as vancomycin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>, makes <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection difficult to treat and increases its mortality rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Iwase1">[20]</xref>. Due to our increasing understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and intercellular cell signaling, several potential strategies have been developed for drug discovery, of which the anti-virulence strategy has the interest of most researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Rasko1">[21]</xref>. <italic>S. aureus</italic> can secrete numerous surface proteins and exotoxins, which are involved in the process of pathopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-McCormick1">[22]</xref>. One of the most important is α-HL, which often leads to tissue damage. Our previous research has also shown that several natural compounds can protect mice against <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia by decreasing the production of α-HL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Qiu2">[11]</xref>. Based on the results of all these studies, we theorized that α-HL can be used as a target for the development of new drugs against <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p>
      <p>The increasing interest in drug design based on the identification of novel virulence targets has created a demand for the structural characterization of protein-ligand complexes. X-ray crystallography is a traditional tool used to investigate the interaction of ligands and proteins in a complex, and many studies using this technique have been reported. In 1996, Song et al. discovered the crystal structure of the α-HL heptamer; however, to date, the monomeric structure of α-HL remains unknown, suggesting that crystals of the α-HL monomer may be very difficult to obtain. Thus, it seems impractical to explore the structure of the ORO-α-HL monomer complex by crystallography. In the literature, computational chemistry combined with experimental confirmation has proven an effective and reliable method for exploring the interactions between ligands and proteins. Accordingly, in this study, we used a complementary approach that includes molecular dynamics simulations (MD simulations), site-specific mutagenesis, and a fluorescence-quenching method to further explore ligand-protein binding sites. Specifically, we attempted to identify the mechanism by which ORO inhibits the biological activity of α-HL.</p>
      <p>Moreover, to explore the formation of the interaction between a protein and a ligand at the atomic level, we used the MM-GBSA method to determine the associated free energy profiles. It has been known for years, and was restated recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Reddy1">[23]</xref>, that free energy calculations from MD simulations can prove to be a powerful tool for exploring the process of ligand-protein binding when used in combination with mutagenesis experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Zhang1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Filomia1">[27]</xref>. In addition, MM-GBSA calculations were performed on a series of derivatives of TIBO (a substituted tetrahydroimidazole benzodiazepine thione) to explore their potential as inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Wang1">[28]</xref>. In the same study, the binding mode of a known drug was predicted with excellent agreement to the X-ray structure, which was discovered afterward. Other examples of studies with MD simulations include work by Biswa Ranjan Meher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Meher1">[29]</xref>, who examined the binding of the inhibitor darunavir to wild-type and mutant proteins using all-atom MD simulations and MM-GBSA calculations, and work by Lstyastono et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Istyastono1">[30]</xref>, whose study focused on the elucidation of molecular determinants of G protein-coupled receptor-ligand binding modes by combining MD simulations and site-directed mutagenesis studies. There are a number of other such examples of studies that employ MD simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Peng1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Savatier1">[36]</xref>. In this study, we discovered that Van der Waals interactions play an important role in the stabilization of the binding site of α-HL-ORO. The key residues, Thr11, Thr12, Ile14, Gly15 and Lys46, in the complex were also identified, using residue decomposition analysis and mutagenesis assays. The conformational transition of the critical “Loop” region from the monomeric α-HL to the oligomer was blocked by the binding of ORO, which resulted in the inhibition of the hemolytic activity of α-HL. These findings indicate that ORO hinders the lytic activity of α-HL through a novel mechanism. This was confirmed by inducing the formation of the α-HL heptamer by Deoxycholate, the results of which indicate that addition of ORO inhibits the formation of the α-HL heptamer.</p>
      <p>In summary, we found that oroxylin A (ORO), a natural compound without anti-<italic>S. aureus</italic> activity, can inhibit the hemolytic activity of α-HL. Based on the results of MD simulation, we confirmed that ORO could inhibit the hemolytic activity of α-HL by a new mechanism which is completely different compared with baicalin (BAI). Through the analysis of the binding free energy of the complex formation using MM-GBSA method, the results show that the residues Thr11, Thr12, Ile14, Gly15 and Lys46, which surround the binding site of the α-HL-ORO complex, are key ORO-binding residues. Due to the binding of ORO, the conformation transition of the critical “Loop” region from the monomeric α-HL to the oligomer was blocked, which resulted in inhibition of the hemolytic activity of the protein. This novel mechanism was confirmed by experimental data using a deoxycholate-induced oligomerization assay. The whole results mentioned above indicate that the “triangle region” of α-HL is not the only active site of inhibitor and “Loop” region of α-HL also plays an important role in the inhibition of hemolytic activity of α-HL, which could facilitate the design of new and more effective antibacterial agents.</p>

        <title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
        <p>All of the simulations and the analysis of the trajectories were performed with Gromacs 4.5.1 software package using the Amber ff99sb force field and the TIP3P water model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Hess1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Jorgensen1">[46]</xref>. The α-HL-ORO system was first energy relaxed with 2000 steps of steepest-descent energy minimization followed by another 2000 steps of conjugate-gradient energy minimization. The system was then equilibrated by a 500 ps of MD run with position restraints on the protein and ligand to allow for relaxation of the solvent molecules. The first equilibration run was followed by a 200 ns MD run without position restraints on the solute. The first 20 ns of the trajectory were not used in the subsequent analysis to minimize convergence artifacts. The equilibration of the trajectory was checked by monitoring the equilibration of quantities, such as the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) with respect to the initial structure, the internal protein energy, and fluctuations calculated for different time intervals. The electrostatic term was described with the particle mesh Ewald algorithm. The LINCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Ryckaert1">[47]</xref> algorithm was used to constrain all bond lengths. For the water molecules, the SETTLE algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Berendsen1">[48]</xref> was used. A dielectric permittivity, <italic>ε</italic> = 1, and a time step of 2 fs were used. All atoms were given an initial velocity obtained from a Maxwellian distribution at the desired initial temperature of 300 K. The density of the system was adjusted during the first equilibration runs at <italic>NPT</italic> condition by weak coupling to a bath of constant pressure (<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1 bar, coupling time <italic>τ<sub>P</sub></italic> = 0.5 ps) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Wang2">[49]</xref>. In all simulations, the temperature was maintained close to the intended values by weak coupling to an external temperature bath with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. The proteins and the rest of the system were coupled separately to the temperature bath. The structural cluster analysis was carried out using the method described by Daura and co-workers with a cutoff of 0.25 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Berendsen1">[48]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The ORO parameters were estimated with the antechamber programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Wang2">[49]</xref> and AM1-BCC partial atomic charges from the Amber suite of programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002869-Jakalian1">[50]</xref>.</p>

Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.2 mM IPTG when the OD600 of the culture reached approximately 0.6–0.8 in LB medium. The cultures were allowed to grow for further 20 h at 16°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000×g for 10 min at 4°C, resuspended in lysis buffer (1×PBS, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF) and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15, 000 rpm for 40 min at 4°C. The supernatant of each lysate was loaded onto a self-packed GST-affinity column (2 mL glutathione-Sepharose 4B) (GE Amersham). The contaminant proteins were washed away with wash buffer (lysis buffer with 200 mM NaCl). Cleavage of GST tag was achieved by PreScission protease (GE Amersham) overnight at 4°C. The proteins were eluted with lysis buffer with an additional five amino acid tag (GPLGS) at the N-terminus. The eluant was desalted using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare) with buffer A (25 mM MES, pH 6.0). The desalted proteins were purified using a Resource S column (GE Healthcare) with buffer A and buffer B (25 mM MES, 1 M NaCl, pH 6.0). For further purification, a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) was used with buffer A. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS. The fractions containing pure target protein were pooled and stored at −80°C for subsequent applications.</p>
