<abstract>
<p>Large-scale analyses of protein complexes have recently become available for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, yielding 443 and 116 heteromultimeric soluble protein complexes, respectively. We have coupled the results of these mass spectrometry-characterized protein complexes with the 285 “gold standard” protein complexes identified by EcoCyc. A comparison with databases of gene orthology, conservation, and essentiality identified proteins conserved or lost in complexes of other species. For instance, of 285 “gold standard” protein complexes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, less than 10% are fully conserved among a set of 7 distantly-related bacterial “model” species. Complex conservation follows one of three models: well-conserved complexes, complexes with a conserved core, and complexes with partial conservation but no conserved core. Expanding the comparison to 894 distinct bacterial genomes illustrates fractional conservation and the limits of co-conservation among components of protein complexes: just 14 out of 285 model protein complexes are perfectly conserved across 95% of the genomes used, yet we predict more than 180 may be partially conserved across at least half of the genomes. No clear relationship between gene essentiality and protein complex conservation is observed, as even poorly conserved complexes contain a significant number of essential proteins. Finally, we identify 183 complexes containing well-conserved components and uncharacterized proteins which will be interesting targets for future experimental studies.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Though more than 20,000 binary protein-protein interactions have been published for a few well-studied bacterial species, the results rarely capture the full extent to which proteins take part in complexes. Here, we use experimentally-observed protein complexes from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> or <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, as well as gene orthology, to predict protein complexes across many species of bacteria. Surprisingly, the majority of protein complexes is not conserved, demonstrating an unexpected evolutionary flexibility. We also observe broader trends within protein complex conservation, especially in genome-reduced species with minimal sets of protein complexes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Abundant genome sequencing revealed an astounding diversity among bacterial genomes. Even species that inhabit the same environment may only share a fraction of their genes. This raises the question how these organisms have adapted to their environments using only a limited number of genes. Here, we investigate the protein complements across bacterial genomes, how proteins are combined into protein complexes across species, and whether these complexes have been conserved across diverse branches on the prokaryotic tree of life.</p>
<p>Other studies have compared the interaction networks of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> made possible by systematic screens of genetic interactions and have found notable differences in their structure and content [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studies comparing baker’s yeast and fission yeast found that essentiality also varies between species [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This might be explained by functional redundancy and the importance of mechanism over structure. The extent of the differences might be unexpected but make sense when seen in the light of evolutionary flexibility [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
<p><bold>Numerous studies of protein-protein interactions</bold> have revealed the organization of proteomes into networks of interactions as well as protein complexes. Systematic surveys of protein complexes exist for only a few bacterial species, namely <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The list of binary protein-protein interactomes is clearly larger but has not been considered in this study. Based on this limited dataset, we investigated whether the complexes found in a few model organisms are sufficient to reconstruct <bold>homologous protein complexes in</bold> other species. This is a particular challenge in prokaryotes as the genomes of most species are highly divergent from the few model species used here. However, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> provide two important paradigms: <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is a generalist that can live under a variety of conditions while <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> is a specialized parasite that requires host cells to grow. With ~4,300 and ~700 genes, respectively, they represent <bold>medium-sized as well as minimal genomes</bold> and thus medium and minimal diversity of protein complexes.</p>
<p>Few studies have investigated the evolution and diversity of protein complexes across a wide range of taxa. This is not surprising given that large-scale experimental data has only become available in recent years. In combination with a large number of completed genome sequences we can use this data to evaluate <bold>the extent to which protein complexes are likely to be conserved across microbial species</bold>. Furthermore, we can evaluate the biological role of proteins and complexes of unknown function across many species.</p>
<p>Existing studies <bold>comparing sets of interactome data</bold>, including pure bioinformatics approaches [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have generally limited their comparisons to a few well-characterized protein-protein interaction networks, such as comparisons of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Methodological frameworks for predicting co-evolution on the basis of gene presence/absence [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] may also be employed to predict novel interactions in other species. In this study, we focus on eight distinct bacterial species, seven of which have been the subject of essentiality screens and two of which have comprehensive protein complex surveys available. We then expand the focus to a set of 894 bacterial genomes.</p>
<p>In order to compare genomes and protein complexes across species, we couple the results of mass spectrometry-characterized protein complexes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] with databases of gene orthology [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and essentiality [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to characterize interaction conservation within protein complexes. Furthermore, we use the perspective of genome reduction to evaluate patterns across levels of protein conservation. Comparing sets of protein complexes from divergent bacterial species (in this case, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>) alleviates some of the bias inherent in using a single species as a universal model. Rather, observing which protein complexes and their components are present in two otherwise distinct species allows us to draw conclusions about how critical these components are to microbial life.</p>

<title>Conservation of proteins across bacterial genomes</title>
<p>In general, small microbial genomes are enriched for proteins which are conserved across bacteria (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This trend is most noticeable when paralogy is eliminated, either by removing all but one in a paralogous group (PG) or by the natural effects of genome reduction, as is seen in many of the smallest bacterial genomes. In both cases, average protein conservation decreases as genome size increases. Genes of larger genomes, such as that of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, may be conserved across 20 to 30 percent of all other bacteria, on average. The most minimal genomes, including those of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species, may share their orthologous groups (OGs) with 60 to 80 percent of other bacterial species, on average. These results are reasonable and expected: reduced genomes, by definition, have lost sequence space but have not lost the loci most crucial to bacterial life itself. Furthermore, though most genomes show an increasing fraction of paralogs being conserved as their size increases (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), many of the most reduced genomes actually show greater average conservation when potential paralogs are removed. The paralogous protein-coding loci in reduced genomes may be enriched for accessory genes rather than broadly-conserved core genes.</p>

<p>Each point indicates a single genome and the average conservation of its loci or orthologous groups (OGs) as measured by its presence across 898 bacterial genomes. Representative genomes of the 8 species focused on in this study are indicated with vertical lines and the following labels: <italic>M</italic>. <italic>g</italic>., <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic>; <italic>M</italic>. <italic>p</italic>., <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae; H</italic>. <italic>p</italic>., <italic>Helicobacter pylori; S</italic>. <italic>s</italic>., <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis; C</italic>. <italic>c</italic>., <italic>Caulobacter crescentus; B</italic>. <italic>s</italic>., <italic>Bacillus subtilis; E</italic>. <italic>c</italic>., <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli; P</italic>. <italic>a</italic>., <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. See <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> for specific genome identities. Average gene conservation is specified as a percentage. Average gene conservation values are reduced by the fraction of their predicted protein-coding genes not present in eggNOG v.3 to account for genes without predicted orthology. To produce OG conservation instead of locus conservation, all but one locus of a set of potential paralogs (in this case, genes sharing the same OG) was removed prior to calculating averages. A logarithmic regression is fitted to both sets of values. Average OG conservation values are also shown for subsets of protein-coding genes present within protein complexes from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For these two species, values are representative of members in full complexomes while those for other species are predicted complexomes using each of the three data sets as models.</p>

<p>The presence of multiple members within a single orthologous group has an effect on average gene conservation. Here, we display this effect as the difference between average locus conservation and average OG conservation. (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, orange vs. blue dots). The difference between the values is an approximation of the level of paralogy across each genome; larger genomes appear to contain more paralogs than smaller genomes, especially as genome size falls below 1 Mb. The effect on average gene conservation is expected, as using orthology-based comparisons compresses paralogs into single OGs. Within our data set, 20 genomes (within 10 unique genera) under 3 Mb had greater average conservation among OGs than among individually-considered loci. The smallest genome in the set, that of the cicada endosymbiont <italic>Hodgkinia cicadicola</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] demonstrates no difference at all in average conservation between OGs and individual loci.

<p>In this study, we used the literature-curated set of EcoCyc <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> protein complexes and the protein complexes isolated by Hu et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as a set of experimentally-determined complexes for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The set of experimentally-determined <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> complexes identified by Kühner et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] was also included in the comparison as a distantly-related, minimal set. Though these datasets differ in content and approach, both <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> data sets contain about 300 complexes. Most complexes in the EcoCyc set contain from 2 to 4 unique proteins while the Hu set contains a comparatively higher number of complexes (more than 30) containing 5 or more unique protein components (i.e, unique proteins mapping to different orthologous groups). Note that some of the Hu et al. complexes appear to represent subsets of full complexes (i.e., the full ribosome constitutes a single complex in EcoCyc but is represented by several complexes in Hu et al.). Also, the EcoCyc set is partially redundant (i.e., each RNA polymerase holoenzyme is represented as a different protein complex, as are the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>0</sub> subregions of ATP synthase).</p>

<p>The size of the complexes within the data set produced by Kühner et al. appears to differ in distribution from those characterized by Hu et al. (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Specifically, most <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> complexes with two or more unique members contain just those two unique proteins. The cross-species discrepancy may also result from methodology, though Kühner et al. suggest it is representative of authentic biological differences between the two species. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> contains fewer unique proteins than <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> does and this difference limits the number of unique proteins seen in any single complex.</p>
<p>The exact protein complexes defined by each data set differ. Pairwise comparison of presence or absence of proteins in each complex is improved by mapping components to orthologous groups but few complexes appear to be present in an identical form across all three data sets. <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> provides four examples of the types of complex matches seen across the data sets. For instance, the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (EcoCyc: CPLX0–3803) contains 9 unique proteins as per EcoCyc but its closest match in the Hu set contains 7, including two proteins not found in any EcoCyc complex. The “missing” proteins from the EcoCyc complex are found in other Hu complexes. The Hsp70 chaperone complex (EcoCyc: HSP70-CPLX) provides another example: The <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> complexes provide a better match for the EcoCyc complex than the Hu set does. Topoisomerase IV (EcoCyc: CPLX0–2424) has a good match in all three data sets though the representative Hu complex contains an additional protein. Lastly, RecBCD serves as an example of a good <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli-</italic>specific match with no components present among the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> complexes.</p>
<p>In the aggregate, most EcoCyc complexes do not have reliable matches in the other experimental sets (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Using all 285 EcoCyc complexes as a guide, their best matches in the other sets are classified as “good” if they contain at least half of the same unique proteins (as members of orthologous groups) or “poor” if they contain a match of less than half of the EcoCyc complex’s components. No complex of a size greater than 4 unique proteins has a good match in both the Hu et al. and Kühner et al. complex sets. 28 complexes (9.8%) of the complexes of size 4 or less have good matches in both sets. The majority of the complexes in this size class (153 out of 246) contained at least one matching component in the Hu <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes but no match among the Kühner et al. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> complexes.</p>
<p>The set of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> complexes serves as a rough model for the complexes most commonly found across bacterial species (see <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Table</xref>) for the predicted conservation of each complex). It is an imperfect model: out of 116 complexes, only 28 are fully conserved (that is, each of their components are present as orthologs) in the 7 other model species in this study. 39 <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> complexes appear to share at least 2/3 of their components with all the other species, though 75 complexes share at least half. Just one complex contains components entirely specific to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (complex 87, composed of uncharacterized proteins Mpn036 and Mpn676, respective UniProt entries P75078 and P75116).</p>

<title>Using protein complexomes to predict complexes conserved in other species</title>
<p>The variability between the EcoCyc and Hu datasets has a direct impact on the usefulness of these complexomes as models for other bacterial species. In any case, the EcoCyc and Hu complex sets provide the most comprehensive complex set currently available for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. The intersection of the two sets (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) is indeed limited: just 576 unique orthologous groups are shared between the sets and just 132 complexes appear to be “good” matches between the sets. Using these 132 complexes as a model for those in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> shows that up to 120 of the complexes may be conserved based on orthologous components present in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> genome. If the yet-uncharacterized <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> complexome contains roughly the same number of complexes as those for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> then this prediction method misses more than half (that is, around 150) of the potential complexes unless we also use the unique complexes of each set. We used these results as evidence that the data sets should be used as independent models rather than as an intersecting set: losing more than half of the potential model complexes simply due to inconsistencies across data sets may be too limiting for a broad cross-species comparision.</p>

<p><xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> displays distributions of protein complex conservation across four bacterial species other than <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. (<italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> complexes were not used in this comparison.) These plots provide the median and interquartile range of protein complex conservation fractions in each species, using either EcoCyc or Hu et al. complexes as a model of the complex set. A comprehensive set of protein complexes has not been identified for any of these species as of yet. Following the results shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, however, we may predict that most bacterial protein complex component sets should share at least half of their OGs with all other bacterial genomes, on average. Basic biology also plays a role here: we expect a subset of crucial protein complexes like polymerases to be well-conserved across all species. The set of all EcoCyc complexes, appears to be highly-conserved in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> (the entire interquartile range lies between full and 75% complex conservation, showing the average EcoCyc complex is well-represented in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>) but shows a greater range of conservation across the three other species. The Hu complexes show lower complex conservation median values than EcoCyc for all but <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and lower variability for all but <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. Here, the median values are not as useful as the conservation ranges: the distance between the highest and lowest values includes every possibility from 0 to 100% conservation using either model of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes. We see that the two species most closely related to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in this set—<italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus—</italic>produce different median values and interquartile ranges between the sets across all protein complexes. Components of complexes in the two <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> sets, used as models, are clearly conserved differently across bacterial species. A higher-resolution comparison is necessary to determine which complexes are highly-conserved.</p>

<title>Protein complexes and their essentiality are poorly conserved in bacteria</title>
<p>Although the size distribution is different in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>, we hypothesized that homologous complexes should be very similar, both in size and composition. However, this is not true: few complexes share even half of their components across the data sets (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The majority of complexes shows less than 50% overlap between EcoCyc and Hu, but also between Hu and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>. This suggests that there are both technical (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli vs E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>) but also biological reasons (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> vs. <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>) for these differences.</p>
<p>To get a more global yet more detailed picture of protein complex conservation, we compared conservation across 8 bacterial species, including the two species for which full protein complex sets exist. The EcoCyc complex set was used as a standard to which all other species were compared. <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> provides three examples of the ways protein complexes may or may not be conserved across species. Conservation of protein complexes may be roughly grouped into three categories: well-conserved complexes, complexes with a core set of proteins conserved, and those in which no core set appears to be consistently conserved. As conservation and essentiality may be related to paralogy, we also compared the components of these complexes on the presence or absence of paralogs.</p>

<p>Complexes are identified using a common name and an EcoCyc ID. Each complex subunit has been assigned a COG ID.

Values within these spaces indicate the presence of potential paralogs in the corresponding species; proteins without specified values have no paralogs.

<p>It is commonly assumed that highly conserved proteins must be important and thus should be essential in many cases. Interestingly, this is often not true (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For example, the well-conserved <bold>succinate dehydrogenase</bold> components are essential in only 3 of the species shown. The four components of this complex (as defined by the default structure in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>) are present only in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> encode 3 out of 4 components and the other 3 species appear to have lost the entire complex. Similarly, the <bold>Bam outer membrane protein assembly complex</bold> (EcoCyc: CPLX0–3933) shows partial essentiality across the complex in 4 species though its components are well conserved in only 3 species. This complex has a similarly patchy pattern of conservation, with any number from zero to all 5 components conserved. In the case of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> Bam complex, what initially seems like a lack of conservation may be the result of component replacement by functionally similar proteins [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. By contrast, <bold>F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase</bold> is conserved in all species examined. These examples show that most complexes are less well conserved than their often important functions indicate (as measured by the presence of essential proteins in these complexes).</p>

In this case, fraction of essentiality (the number of protein components found to be essential out of all protein components present) is shown. <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> displays conservation fractions of all <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes with at least one protein conserved in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, though not necessarily present in a <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> complex. A complete survey of all EcoCyc complexes across these species in terms of conservation and essentiality is provided in <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>. and <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>., respectively. Conservation fraction was established as the fraction of unique proteins in a defined complex present in the target species. Notably, proteins of only 21 complete EcoCyc complexes are fully conserved across all 8 species, or just 15 complexes when subunits and alternate forms (i.e., RNA polymerase with different sigma factors) are removed. An additional 19 complexes are fully conserved across all species but the two <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species. The remaining complexes vary extensively in their degree and extent of conservation. A number of complexes are well conserved across <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>C</italic>., <italic>crescentus</italic>, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> but not <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sanguinis</italic> or the <italic>Mycoplasma (e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. succinate dehydrogenase, EcoCyc: SUCC-DEHASE). Overall, of the 176 EcoCyc complexes of 3 or more unique proteins (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.), 128 appear to have lost at least one unique protein component in one or more species. This demonstrates that protein complexes are far more flexible in evolutionary terms than previously assumed.</p>

<p>Protein complex function varies in a similar way as conservation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). As expected, many of the most highly conserved complexes are directly involved in DNA replication, transcription, or translation. Many protein complexes of varying conservation fractions are transport complexes—as bacterial membrane structures vary across species, some degree of transporter component evolution is also expected. At least six distinct complexes involved in DNA modification or repair demonstrate less than perfect conservation.</p>
<p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes serve as a “gold standard” for protein complexes across bacteria only in cases where most or all of the components of a complex are broadly conserved. This property is true of just a small fraction of complexes. <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> displays conservation fractions for all 285 <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes in the EcoCyc set, clustered by similarity of their conservation patterns across the 7 other species used in this study. Just 21 complexes appear to be fully conserved (that is, orthologs of each of their components are present) in all other species. This is a broad taxonomic range, so a more relaxed cutoff may be appropriate to predict a complex is conserved; even so, only 28 complexes contain at least 2/3 of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> components across all species. Lowering the cutoff to at least half of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> components still yields only 34 complexes. The lack of broad conservation is not, however, a matter of full complex presence or absence across species. Rather, many complex components appear to be conserved independently from other members of their complex. Similarly patchy conservation can be seen for essentiality (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), as the most broadly well-conserved complexes (far left) generally retain essentiality across species but less consistently-conserved complexes do not, though they may retain essentiality while appearing to lose complex components.</p>

<p>The species with the most overall conservation of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes are, unsurprisingly, those most closely related to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Roughly a third of the complex set is conserved across all species with the minimal <italic>Rickettsia</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> genomes, among others, serving as notable exceptions. The middle third shows the most difference in conservation between the Proteobacteria and all other species. The Lactobacillales show the most difference in conservation among these complexes, to the degree that they resemble <italic>Cyanobacteria</italic> more closely among this subset. The last third (far left of <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) of the complexes demonstrate the most variable conservation across all species. Many of these complexes are missing or partially conserved among the Proteobacteria yet are fully present in many Firmicutes species and even in extremophiles like <italic>Thermus</italic> or <italic>Thermotoga</italic> species. Overall, out of 285 EcoCyc complexes, 12 (~4%) have at least one component present in all 894 bacterial genomes in the set. None are perfectly conserved across all genomes but 14 complexes appear to be conserved across at least 95% of the genomes. If potential complex conservation is generously defined as conservation of at least half of the complex components, 3 EcoCyc complexes are potentially conserved across all 894 genomes, 25 are potentially conserved across 95% of the genomes, and 186 are potentially conserved across at least half of the genomes. Variance across the full set of complex conservation fractions is 0.189. Because conservation of these complexes follows the existing taxonomy well, some generally well-conserved complexes like RNA polymerases may be missing from entire genera.</p>
<p>The experimentally-determined protein complexes identified by Hu et al. were also used as a model of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexome (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>.). Most complexes appear to have partial conservation across nearly all species using this model.

Using the same 50% cutoff for potential complex conservation as used above, no Hu complexes appear to be conserved in all 894 genomes, 10 are potentially conserved across 95% of the genomes, and 182 are potentially conserved across at least half of the genomes. Though these Hu et al. complex values appear similar to those for the Ecocyc complexes, variance across the full set of Hu complex conservation fractions is 0.097, indicating less variability among the values than that seen for the EcoCyc complexes. This lesser variance can also be seen in the surprising consistency across taxonomic lines (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>.).</p>
<p>Both the literature-curated EcoCyc model and the Hu et al.-based experimental model were evaluated by comparision to a randomized version of their respective components. For the literature-curated model, Pearson correlation was 0.185, while for the experimental model, Pearson correlation was 0.293. The higher correlation value for the experimental model indicates it is closer to a random distribution of complex correlation fractions across the species set. We do not expect complexes to be conserved in a random pattern so this may indicate the Hu et al. complex set is less useful than the EcoCyc complex set for prediction across this wide range of genomes.</p>

<title>Essentiality of proteins in complexes and the impact of paralogy</title>
<p><italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species have highly reduced genomes and it is generally assumed that they have retained mostly essential proteins.

<p>One possible explanation for the lower fraction of conserved essential proteins in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is the presence of paralogs that renders duplicate genes non-essential, given the presence of an additional copy with a redundant function. We performed comparisons of the fraction of conservation of each complex and its <bold>sum of paralogy</bold> (that is, the total number of all copies of all genes coding for the complex components in the target species). As the number of paralogs for each gene was broadly defined using orthologous groups, these numbers are considered maximum possible values rather than specific counts of known paralogous regions. We observed an inverse trend between <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes vs. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>.) and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>.): the more paralogs they have in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> the less conserved these proteins were in <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>vice versa</italic>. More specifically, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes with a conservation fraction greater than 0.6 in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> all had total paralogy sums lower than 40 though more poorly-conserved complexes had paralogy sums between 2 and about 100. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> complexes with a conservation fraction greater than 0.6 in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> had a range of sums of paralogy between 2 and nearly 80.

<title>Proteins of unknown function</title>
<p>Protein complexes are attractive targets for functional analysis, given that proteins are embedded in a functional context. This is especially true for proteins of unknown function that are part of a complex (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A, B</xref>). Here, conservation is defined as greater than 0.5 conservation fraction and essential complexes are those with at least one essential component in the target species. Among the highly conserved components, many are essential in 4 or more of the 8 species. Using more than one species reduces the effect of noise and inconsistency across essentiality screens. Starting with 39 EcoCyc-defined complexes that contain unknown proteins, at least 15 appear to be conserved in all other species in this study but the <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>. <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref> displays example complexes for the Hu (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli)</italic> and Kühner <italic>(Mycoplasma pneumoniae)</italic> complexes, respectively. Unlike in parts A and B, the complexes shown are experimental results rather than literature-defined complexes. Each complex contains at least one component of unknown or unclear function, whether in the context of the protein complex or broader cellular function. For instance, complex 66 from Hu et al. (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>) consists of 6 unique proteins of which 3 are of unknown function (or remain without annotation). Of the 6 proteins, 3 are highly conserved and 1 of those three is frequently essential. The <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> protein MraZ, present in Hu complex 149, is shown here as a protein of unknown function but was recently found to be a transcriptional regulator involved in multiple pathways [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More than 149 Hu et al. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes and 34 Kühner et al. <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> (183 in total) complexes contain at least one component of unknown function. Of these, 109 Hu et al. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complexes and 19 Kühner et al. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> complexes contain components highly conserved as essential proteins.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The substantial variation among protein complexes across species supports the notion that these complexes are much more malleable than previously thought. A possible explanation of this is that the function of a complex is more important than its content. Complexes can serve the same role yet contain different proteins and when one function is lost, others can fill in the gap. Other studies have found that functional redundancy can lead to variation and that there is little overlap in terms of protein interaction among species [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While mutational change in a protein complex may have catastrophic potential, complexes are not immutable. In fact, several complexes that are essential in some species have varying composition in other species. For instance, 5 out of 9 components of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Sec translocation complex (EcoCyc: SEC-SECRETION-CPLX) are well-conserved across species from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>genitalium</italic>. One of these components, SecA, has been found to be essential in all species focused on in this work with the exception of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sanguinis</italic>; orthologs of this protein are present in all 894 bacterial genomes examined. The remaining 4 <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> components are more variable in conservation across species. For instance, YajC is present in 727 out of the same 894 genomes. Strong selection pressure seems to avoid mutations that render the entire complex ineffectual. This may explain why we have observed a higher level of conservation for protein complex components than for proteins in general (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The essential “core” components of protein complexes may be conserved across taxonomic levels while “accessory” components may not [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Given their multiple interactions, proteins within protein complexes should not only be more highly conserved than “un-complexed” ones, but should retain their essential roles if their fellow complex members are present [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Components of protein complexes are, on average, more likely to be present in other bacterial species than proteins not in complexes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is a result of high conservation among sets of large, essential complexes. 128 out of 285 literature-verified <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> protein complexes are fully present in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, 30 of which are also completely present in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>genitalium</italic>. For instance, all components of the ATP synthase complex (EcoCyc: ATPSYN-CPLX) are present in all species examined, though they do vary in essentiality. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> essentiality screens found no essential genes in ATP synthase, while those for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> found all but one component to be essential. Other complexes—predominantly those with transmembrane domains and/or transporter functions—are more variable in both conservation and essentiality, though they provide examples of how dispensable accessory proteins may be.</p>
<p>Some protein complexes with essential functions in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> may not be present in other species. The lipopolysaccharide transport complex (EcoCyc: CPLX0–7992) serves as an excellent example: all seven of the Lpt proteins in this complex have been found to be essential in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> though their conservation is limited to other Gram-negative species including <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. We found that most transmembrane protein complexes follow this pattern. Interestingly, species with partial complex component conservation vs. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> may highlight situations in which core elements of a complex are conserved but have been modified to carry out other functions or adapted to special physiological circumstances. For example, 3 out of 4 of the succinate dehydrogenase complex (EcoCyc: SUCC-DEHASE) components in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> are also present in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> but not at all in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sanguinis</italic>. This is an especially interesting example as two of the components, SdhC and SdhD, are inner membrane proteins, though only SdhC is present in the three-component <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> succinate dehydrogenase. We conclude that membrane proteins and their complexes are particularly malleable, given their role in signaling and transport which reflects adaptations to specific environments and the nutrients present in them.</p>
<p>Smaller and more reduced bacterial genomes (that is, relative to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>) appear to code for a greater fraction of highly-conserved protein complexes. This conservation is evident in comparisons of the <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> protein complexes. In an examination of these protein complex components across more than 800 bacterial genomes, we found that species such as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> offers a better model of the protein complexes most critical to bacterial life. Protein complexes observed in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> may not only have retained a core set of functions but also utilized a higher degree of multifunctionality among its metabolic enzymes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Surprisingly, many essential proteins are poorly conserved and essentiality itself is often not conserved across species (Figs. <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> through <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This suggests that many functions can be replaced by non-homologous displacement [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and that genomes are more malleable in evolutionary terms than previously expected. Clearly, this evolutionary flexibility has contributed much to the success of microbes to populate all possible environments on the planet. Variability in complex conservation highlights a limitation with this study: we are unavoidably limited by the availability of sequenced bacterial genomes. Newly-characterized genomes may reveal additional variation or consistency among protein complexes even if they are highly reduced in other respects.</p>
<p>As with their protein components, individual complexes reveal underlying evolutionary processes (<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>.). The most highly-conserved complexes are those with functions critical to microbial life, including transcription, translation, and transcript degradation. Though different RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzymes (that is, RNA polymerases with different sigma factors) were considered as distinct complexes in this study, all bacterial species unsurprisingly retained at least one type of RNAP. The ribosome (EcoCyc: CPLX0–3964) is also well-conserved though its size and high level of conservation may obscure cross-species differences.</p>
<p>Variable conservation of some complexes is visible even among the <italic>Escherichia</italic> genomes. CPLX0–7909 (the RnlA-RnlB toxin-antitoxin complex) only appears to be present in K-12 <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> but also in single species of <italic>Shewanella</italic> and <italic>Photobacterium</italic>. This toxin-antitoxin system has a role in bacteriophage resistance in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but it is unclear if this function may be retained in distantly related bacteria. CPLX0–2001 (the ferric dicitrate transport system) provides an example of more gradual change. This complex spans the membrane, suggesting its conservation should be membrane-dependent. This appears to be the case as it is well conserved across most Proteobacteria (except the Rickettsiales and <italic>Buchnera</italic> species) yet is poorly-conserved across most of the species traditionally considered Gram positive. A subset of complexes, including CPLX0–1163 (HslVU protease) and ABC-56-CPLX (aliphatic sulfonate ABC transporter), fit a strict co-conservation model: these complexes are almost always present in their full form rather than as a fraction of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> model complex. These complexes are exceptions rather than the rule. Using <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as a model, few complexes are conserved perfectly across a wide range of species; in fact, most complexes are fractionally conserved.</p>

<title>Orthologous groups</title>
<p>Each locus in each genome was assigned to a single orthologous group (OG) as in eggNOG v.3 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], such that all loci were assigned to a COG, a NOG, or a bactNOG, depending upon the most widely-conserved group assignment available (see Powell et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] for details regarding OG levels). Next, the presence of each locus was determined across the entire set of bacterial species; a locus seen in half of all bacterial species would be assigned a conservation value of 0.5. This presence was averaged across all loci to generate a value for average locus conservation for each genome. This value was adjusted based on locus coverage in eggNOG (i.e., if only 70 percent of the loci in a genome mapped to eggNOG OGs, the average value was reduced by 30 percent.) An identical set of comparisons were performed for all loci with predicted paralogs (that is, loci with the same OG assignment) removed prior to comparison. Subsets of selected species were also prepared such that they included only loci with the same orthologous groups as those seen in the Hu et al., EcoCyc, or Kühner et al. protein complex sets. Genome sizes were retrieved from NCBI GenBank and KEGG GENOME [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

<title>Comparing complex composition to a random model to observe the distribution of essentiality</title>
<p>The observed distributions of essential genes among those coding for protein complex components were obtained using protein complex sets [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], eggNOG (v. 3) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the Database of Essential Genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as defined above. For a single protein complex, an essentiality fraction was defined as the fraction of all genes in a complex found to be essential, out of the set of all unique protein-coding genes in the complex. The conservation scores were used to judge participation of a complex within a dataset, establishing a maximum for each species and dataset combination. Second, essentiality fraction was found by linking each essential protein to an OG. In instances where multiple proteins shared OGs but not essentiality, essentiality was considered as the primary case and the OG was counted as essential.</p>
<p>A random model was created for the purpose of comparing the data set to background noise. The random model, meant to represent a collection of randomly sized complexes, was populated by proteins that have been randomly assigned essential status. The complex sizes were randomly assigned a value from three to ten. Each complex was then assigned protein values of either essential or non-essential status. The probability of being essential was determined by the overall percent of essential genes within the organism, while the random model size is equal to the maximum of the species and dataset being compared. This random model was then put through the same binning process as the observed data. The mean of each bin was obtained after 10,000 replications. This results in s bins of a size that is no longer equal to the actual data set but demonstrates an appropriate background noise level for comparison purposes. The log<sub>2</sub>(Observed/Expected) values are plotted in <xref rid="pcbi.1004107.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> to show any significant difference between observed essentiality and expected.</p>

<title>Comparative proteome and complexome analysis</title>
<p>The general scheme for data analysis was as follows: (1) A list of all orthologous groups (OG) was produced for each of 894 bacterial species found in the large set defined above. (2) Presence or absence of each OG was determined for all species. (3) Repeated OGs were removed from each list and step 2 was repeated. (4) The list from step 1 was used to map OGs to the components of three sets of protein complexes. The complexes were compared to search for cross-data set complex matches. Gene essentiality was also mapped to each OG in a species-dependent basis. (5) A list of 8 taxonomically-divergent species was selected and used to define fractional conservation and fractional essentiality of each protein complex.</p>
<p>OGs were used as the basis of comparison for similarity between data sets. <bold>Complex size</bold> was defined as the number of unique proteins isolated from a complex; i.e. a complex may contain 3 unique OGs but 4 distinct protein components, yielding a complex size of 4. For each complex, the presence of each OG within the complex was assayed in the full proteome sets of the seven other representative species. The resulting binary presence/absence values were combined to produce a value for the percent complex conservation. This value intentionally disregards any gene context similarity (that is, an OG may be present in two genomes even if neighboring genes differ between the genomes) and simply expresses the fraction of complex components which a specific genome may code for. When a target proteome did contain a specified complex component, the number of paralogs of the component-coding gene was determined as the number of proteins in the list mapping to the same OG. While further verification, may be necessary to define any of these protein-coding genes as true paralogs, we simply used the OGs (including paralogs) as determined by eggNOG.</p>
<p>All protein complex components were also assigned binary <bold>essentiality</bold> values using published assays specific to the species listed above. These values were used to define the essentiality fraction of each potentially conserved complex, i.e. an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> complex for which 80% of the components appear to be conserved in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> but only 60% of the components may be essential in the latter species.</p>
<p>A broader comparison was prepared using the list of 894 species as defined above. Genome sizes for each species were retrieved from the KEGG GENOME Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/genome.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/genome.html</ext-link>, [<xref rid="pcbi.1004107.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). For each species, the total number of OG-mapped protein-coding loci was divided by the total number of loci to produce a value for percentage mapped. Using the list of all OGs in the species, each OG was compared with all other species to determine its conservation across Bacteria. Adjusted <bold>average locus conservation</bold> for a particular genome, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>AAL</italic></sub><italic>(g)</italic>, was calculated as:
