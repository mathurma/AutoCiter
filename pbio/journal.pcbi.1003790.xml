<abstract>
<p>Errors in sample annotation or labeling often occur in large-scale genetic or genomic studies and are difficult to avoid completely during data generation and management. For integrative genomic studies, it is critical to identify and correct these errors. Different types of genetic and genomic data are inter-connected by cis-regulations. On that basis, we developed a computational approach, Multi-Omics Data Matcher (MODMatcher), to identify and correct sample labeling errors in multiple types of molecular data, which can be used in further integrative analysis. Our results indicate that inspection of sample annotation and labeling error is an indispensable data quality assurance step. Applied to a large lung genomic study, MODMatcher increased statistically significant genetic associations and genomic correlations by more than two-fold. In a simulation study, MODMatcher provided more robust results by using three types of omics data than two types of omics data. We further demonstrate that MODMatcher can be broadly applied to large genomic data sets containing multiple types of omics data, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many human diseases are complex with multiple genetic and environmental causal factors interacting together to give rise to disease phenotypes. Such factors affect biological systems through many layers of regulations, including transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, and protein changes. To fully understand their molecular mechanisms, complex diseases are often studied in diverse dimensions including genetics (genotype variations by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays or whole exome sequencing), transcriptomics, epigenetics, and proteomics. However, errors in sample annotation or labeling often occur in large-scale genetic and genomic studies and are difficult to avoid completely during data generation and management. Identifying and correcting these errors are critical for integrative genomic studies. In this study, we developed a computational approach, Multi-Omics Data Matcher (MODMatcher), to identify and correct sample labeling errors based on multiple types of molecular data before further integrative analysis. Our results indicate that signals increased more than 100% after correction of sample labeling errors in a large lung genomic study. Our method can be broadly applied to large genomic data sets with multiple types of omics data, such as TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data sets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells employ multiple levels of regulation that enable them to respond to genetic, epigenetic, genomic, and environmental perturbations. With advances in high-throughput technologies, comprehensive data sets have been generated to measure multiple aspects of biological regulation, such as genetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and proteomics. To elucidate the complexity of cell regulation, diverse types of data from these different technologies must be integrated.</p>
<p>Sample errors, including sample swapping, mis-labeling, and improper data entry are inevitable during large-scale data generation. Some of these errors can be detected during quality control (QC) on each type of data; however, others are more elusive and may affect integrative data analysis, depending on the integration methods used. In some integrative analyses, signature sets are first defined by each data type individually, for example signatures for gene expression, methylation, or copy number variation (CNV). Then, the signatures are overlapped to identify high-confidence changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Selamat1">[1]</xref>. In such analyses, potential sample inconsistencies may have a limited effect on results. For example, assume that samples A and B are swapped in gene expression data. If both samples are involved in the same subgroup (e.g., normal control or disease), the derived signatures will not be affected by the sample mis-labeling error. In other integrative analyses, such as the genetic gene expression studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Schadt1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Morley1">[3]</xref>, in which the aim is to discover how DNA variations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) regulate gene expression changes, sample errors could have a larger effect. In one study, mis-matching of 20% of samples between genotype and gene expression data decreased the number of cis-eSNPs by 70% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Westra1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>To fully understand biological systems, it is necessary to elucidate how genetic and epigenetic perturbations lead to transcriptomic and proteomic changes, which in turn contribute to the disease phenotype. Simultaneously considering different types of biological data can result a better understanding of biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Schadt1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Chen1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Zhong1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>With recent advances in high-throughput technologies, multiple layers of molecular phenotypes have been measured in the same sample for comprehensive survey of biological systems. To maximally utilize these data, it is necessary to properly match different types of data pertaining to the same sample or individual before integrative analyses. Here we present a sample mapping procedure called Multi-Omics Data matcher (MODMatcher), which not only identifies mis-matched omics profile pairs, but also properly assigns them to the correct samples based on other omics data. We applied MODMatcher to two large-scale public multi-omics datasets: one from the Lung Genomic Research Consortium (LGRC) and one from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In both cases, adjustment for mis-matched samples improved data consistency and increased statistic power to identify biological regulations. All software programs and scripts are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.mssm.edu/integrative-network-biology/Software.html" xlink:type="simple">http://research.mssm.edu/integrative-network-biology/Software.html</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Application to LGRC data</title>
<p>The LGRC is a consortium for studying chronic lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical information and gene expression and methylation profiling data were obtained from the LGRC data portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lung-genomics.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.lung-genomics.org</ext-link>). Genotype data was provided by the LGRC consortium. The data set consists of gene expression profiles of lung tissues from 219 patients with COPD and 108 non-disease controls (CTRL), and methylation profiles of lung tissues from 173 COPD patients and 76 controls. First, the gender of each sample was inferred based on three types of data and compared to the gender annotated in clinical data. There was no ambiguity in gender prediction based on each individual type of data; the molecular profiles of different genders were clearly separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g003">3</xref>). However, we identified several mismatches between the predicted genders based on omics data and the clinically annotated genders. Among genders predicted by X-chromosome heterozygosity, we detected 4 mismatches in CTRL and 5 in COPD samples, corresponding to a mismatch error rate of 3.5% (9/256) for SNP genotype profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g001">Figure 1</xref>). While there was no gender mismatch in CTRL samples, as judged by the expression level of Y-chromosome specific gene <italic>RPS4Y1</italic>, we detected 5 gender mismatches in COPD, corresponding to a mismatch error rate of 1.5% (5/327) for gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Among genders predicted from the intensity of the Y-chromosome specific methyl probe close to <italic>FAM197Y2P</italic> (see Methods), we found 1 gender inconsistency in CTRL samples and 15 in COPD samples, corresponding to a mismatch error rate of 6.4% (16/249) for methylation profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, for 21 unique individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003790.s005">Table S1</xref>), the gender information inferred from different sources did not match either with one another or with clinical annotation, indicating sample alignment problems. According to the error rate of gender mismatches, gene expression profiling data was least likely to be mis-labeled, and methylation profiling data was most likely to be mis-labeled in the LRGC data set.</p>

<p>The inbreeding coefficient F, the X chromosome heterozygosity rate, is used to infer the gender of samples. F is around 0 in most female samples and around 1 in most male samples. For 9 samples, the inferred genders were inconsistent with clinically annotated genders (error rate 3.5%).</p>

<p>The log2 transformed values of <italic>RPS4Y1</italic> expression level are clearly separated between male and female samples both in CTRL and patients with COPD (&gt;10 in male samples and &lt;10 in female samples).

<p>The raw intensity of a Y-chromosome methyl probe corresponding to <italic>FAM197Y2P</italic> is clearly different between genders. One error was identified in the CTRL and 15 errors were identified in the COPD set (6 in females, 9 in males) (error rate of 6.4%).</p>

<p>Next, we iteratively matched SNP, gene expression, and methylation profiles using multi-omics identity similarity scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We started with three sets of profile pairs with consistent inferred gender information: 179 pairs (50 CTRL and 129 COPD) for genotype and gene expression data, 182 pairs (51 CTRL 131 COPD) for genotype and methylation data, and 209 pairs (61 CTRL and 148 COPD) for methylation and gene expression profiling data. Cis regulation pairs (i.e. cis-eSNPs, cis-mSNPs, and cis methy-mRNA probes) were identified separately for CTRL and COPD samples. Sample identity similarity scores <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> based on identified cis regulation pairs were calculated for all possible profile pairs. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were calculated from the distance between predicted and measured SNP genotypes. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was measured by correlation of rank-transformed methylation and gene expression levels in samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g005">Figure 5</xref>, see Methods). The similarity scores for matched profiles were 3.8, 3.2, and 1.8 standard deviations better than the mean similarity scores for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Thus, SNP-mRNA sample matches were more reliable than SNP-methylation or methylation-mRNA sample matches, perhaps because methylation data tends to be noisy due to intrinsic technical design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Aryee1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Siegmund1">[10]</xref>. Based on the gender-matching results, methylation profiles have a higher mis-label rate than other profile data, also contributing to the uncertainties of sample matching of methylation profiles.</p>

<title>Sample alignment with MODMatcher.</title>
<p>Initial labels of samples are used to determine cis pairs, which are then used to calculate similarity scores. Based on the similarity scores determined with three data types, the molecular data are matched with each other (1) by gender, (2) by cis-eSNPs, (3) by cis-mSNPs, (4) by cis mRNA-methylation pairs, and (5) by all trio mapping. Then, updated sample pairs are used to calculate new cis pairs for another round of alignment. Rounds of alignment are repeated until there are no further changes.</p>

<title>Sample similarity measurement based on cis methylation-mRNA pairs.</title>
<p>After cis methylation-mRNA pairs are identified, the methylation and gene expression levels were rank-transformed. In this figure, there are M samples and <italic>i</italic> cis pairs. Then Pearson correlation is calculated and used as sample similarity, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, between one methylation profile and all gene expression profiles. If both methylation and gene expression profiles are from the same individual, self-self correlation coefficient is expected to be significantly higher than correlation coefficients with other samples.</p>

(C) The distribution of similarity scores of one profile versus all profiles of other data type based on cis mRNA-methylation pairs. If two profiles pertain to the same sample (self-consistent), their similarity scores (red stars) are expected to be higher than those of cross-matched pairs.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.g006" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Next, we determined whether mis-aligned samples could be matched with other unmatched samples by reciprocal best matching, based on one type of identity similarity score. In other words, we tested whether mis-aligned genotype profile <italic>G<sub>i</sub></italic> had the highest similarity with an unmatched mRNA profile <italic>E<sub>j</sub></italic> among all mRNA profiles, and the unmatched mRNA profile <italic>E<sub>j</sub></italic> had the highest similarity with <italic>G<sub>i</sub></italic> among all genotype profiles as well. For the sample pair with a reciprocal best match, sample labels can be updated by comparison with mapping results based on other identity similarities.</p>
<p>When all three types of data are available, the source of any sample labeling errors can be identified. It is also possible to remove or identify additional matched profiles that may be ambiguous as judged from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> alone. Since cis-eSNPs pairs provided the best alignment signal, we started with sample matching by cis-eQTL. Then, samples were further matched by cis-mQTL and mRNA-methylation. For the SNP-mRNA profile match, we tested whether there was a methylation profile that matches well with both SNP and mRNA profiles in the matched pair.</p>
<p>After each round of sample matching, the quality of sample alignment was assessed by counting the number cis pairs identified. For all pairs among these three data types, sample mapping correction significantly increased numbers of cis pairs identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The number of cis-eSNPs stabilized within the first 5 rounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). However, the number of cis-mSNP pairs stabilized in much later rounds (about 15–17), as expected because of the higher mis-label error rate and greater noise in the methylation data. Nonetheless, the numbers of cis-pairs involving methylation profiles increased substantially with the improved sample matching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>). In COPD samples, the number of cis-eSNPs increased by ∼100% and the number of cis mRNA-methylation pairs increased by ∼200%. Consistently, fewer cis pairs were identified in the CTRL data set than in the COPD data set. This difference likely reflects disease biology. Although there were fewer CTRL than COPD samples and thus less statistical power, the trend of difference was the same when we sampled equal numbers of COPD samples to CTRL samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003790.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Using a series of simulated data sets, we demonstrated that trio alignment (considering three types of data simultaneously) resulted in better alignment than duo alignments (considering two types of data at a time) combined. From the sample alignment of the LGRC data as describe above, we identified 76 COPD samples with aligned genotype, gene expression and methylation profiles. Among these 76 samples, only 65 could be correctly matched when individual similarity scores such as cis mRNA-methylation pairs were used. For a fair comparison of trio and duo alignment, we simulated sample labeling errors by randomly assigning sample labels using only these 65 COPD samples. As in the empirical data, we kept low error rates in SNP and gene expression profiling data. We increased the number of mis-labeled methylation profiles from 0 to 24 (corresponding error rate 0% to 37%). At each error rate, we simulated 5 independent data sets and used the average for comparison. In both of duo and trio alignment, all three data types were used but in different ways. In duo alignment, we identified the sample pairs from each pair of data types independently and summarized them to have final pairs. For an example, a methylation profile can be matched with an mRNA profile directly based on the identity similarity score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or through a chain of matches, in which the methylation profile is matched to an SNP profile which matches the mRNA profile. In trio alignment, there is an additional three-way identity similarity score that considers all three data types simultaneously (as described in Methods). Both trio and duo alignment identified mis-matches and improved data quality. However, trio alignment was more robust and superior, especially when mis-labeling error rates were high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Trio alignment recovered more samples pairs and predicted sample pairs more accurately than alignments considering similarity scores independently. In trio alignment, the additional data type provided more bridging information for matching mis-aligned samples pairs. Thus, at the same mis-labeling error rate, trio alignment yielded a higher true positive rate and better coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g008">Figure 8</xref>). As error rates increased, the benefit of using trio alignment became clearer. Thus, in correcting sample mis-matches, sample alignment considering three types of data simultaneously in sample alignment may have advantages over combining three independent duo-alignments. These simulation results confirm that sample alignment using multi-omics data is a critical QC step. Alignment that considers three types of omics data simultaneously is strongly recommended if applicable. Nevertheless, duo alignment is still useful for identifying and correcting mis-aligned pairs.</p>

<title>Comparison of sample alignment procedures based on three or two data types in simulated datasets.</title>
<p>A total 65 COPD samples with all three types of data (gene expression, genotype, and methylation) were used. The mis-labeling error rates were fixed at 3% between gene expression and genotypes. The number of mis-aligned pairs was varied from 0 to 24 (corresponding error rate, 0% to 37%). Two sample alignment procedures were applied to the simulated data sets and final aligned pairs were compared with the true alignment. Triangles, duo-alignment results; circles, trio-alignment results. Numbers inside triangles or circles indicate the number of mis-aligned samples in each simulation. Coverage is defined as the number of correctly aligned pairs divided by 65 (the number of original pairs). The true positive rate is defined as the number of correctly aligned pairs divided by all aligned pairs.</p>

<title>1) TCGA BRCA samples</title>
<p>The same sample alignment approach was applied to another publically available dataset, TCGA breast cancer samples. There were 317 tumor samples and 20 adjacent normal samples with both gene expression and methylation profiles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003790-t001">Table 1</xref>). Genders of samples were inferred from molecular markers in gene expression and methylation profiles. We detected one tumor sample whose predicted gender was inconsistent based on gene expression and methylation profiles. After removal of the gender mismatched sample, cis methylation-mRNA probe pairs were redefined for both normal and tumor samples. At p-value&lt;0.01, 9195 pairs were identified for the tumor (FDR&lt;0.02 based on permutation tests) and 537 pairs for normal samples (FDR&lt;0.35). The identity similarity score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> based on these cis probe pairs were normally distributed; one outlier had a higher similarity score (red star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), indicating a match of profiles of the same patient. There were 8 mis-aligned profile pairs among the tumor samples. Three profile pairs were matched by reciprocal mapping. Two of them, “TCGA-BH-A18<bold>K</bold>-01”, and “TCGA-BH-A18<bold>T</bold>-01”, were cross-aligned to each other in methylation and gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Interestingly, the barcodes of two samples had only one difference (K vs. T), suggesting a sample swap in either the mRNA or methylation profiles. Further comparison with miRNA profiles of these tumor samples suggested that the swap was in the mRNA profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003790.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The updated sample alignment resulted in more cis pairs (9252 at p-value&lt;0.01) and also stronger statistical p-values for the cis-correlations. For example, the p-value for the cis correlation of methylation and gene expression levels of <italic>TMEM139</italic> was 1.6×10<sup>−67</sup> before alignment and 3.8×10<sup>−74</sup> after alignment.</p>

<title>2) TCGA GBM samples</title>
<p>TCGA glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the first cancer data set in TCGA consisting of CNV, gene expression, and methylation profiles. There were 470 GBM tumor samples with both CNV and mRNA profiles. We identified 24 mis-aligned profile pairs. Two of them were cross-aligned between CNV and gene expression profiles (TCGA-32-2632-01A, and TCGA-12-3652-01A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g010">Figure 10A</xref>).

Additionally, the two samples were self-aligned between CNV and methylation profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). These findings indicate that the sample labels of the two mRNA profiles were swapped. This example shows how sample alignment using three different molecular data sets can be useful for both correcting alignment errors in sample pairs and identifying the source of the errors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In large-scale genetic and genomic studies, errors in sample annotation or labeling are common and difficult to avoid completely. Identifying and correcting these errors is critical for statistical analysis, especially for integrative analysis. In this study, we introduce an iterative computational procedure, MODMatcher, that uses multiple types of molecular data (e.g., genotype, CNV, gene expression, and methylation profiles) for sample alignment by using cis regulation pairs of each pair of data types to calculate sample identity similarity scores. When applied to two large public data sets, LGRC and TCGA, MODMatcher not only identified mis-aligned profile pairs but also corrected and rescued mis-labeled samples. In a simulation study of COPD samples in the LGRC set, sample alignment with three types of data (trio matching) performed better than alignment with two types of data (duo matching). When applied to the GBM data set in TCGA, trio matching unambiguously identified the source of sample labeling errors. Thus, MODMatcher can rescue mis-aligned or mis-labeled samples to maximize statistical power in integrative analysis in large-scale genetic and genomic studies. Indeed, correction of mis-aligned samples increased both the number of cis pairs identified and the statistical significance.</p>
<p>Sample labeling errors are not unique to a few data sets, but are inevitable for any large data sets, despite intensive efforts in QCing each type of data individually. Our methods based on methylation profiles for gender inference and alignment with other omics profiles are novel and have not been included in standard data QC procedures. We applied our methylation-based gender inference method to more TCGA data sets and demonstrated that gender can be unambiguously inferred from methylation profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003790.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We identified 1, 4, 1, 2 gender mis-match errors in methylation profiles in data sets for colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), kidney renal papillary carcinoma (KIRC), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003790.s007">Table S3</xref>). We also applied our methylation-gene expression profile matching method to additional TCGA data sets, COAD and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and identified multiple mis-label errors (examples shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003790.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, checking sample alignment is a critical and necessary QC step before integrative analysis.</p>
<p>It is worth to note that the sample identity similarity scores, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, are calculated by using cis regulation pairs. Therefore, like the method of Westra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Westra1">[4]</xref>, MODMatcher depends on initial sample alignments to generate cis regulation pairs. However, MODMatcher is more robust and can tolerate extra noise, as shown in the simulation study. If the error rate of initial alignment is too high (e.g., &gt;30% mis-alignment), we may not be able to identify enough cis-regulation pairs to accurately align samples on the basis of a single identity score. But based on three-way similarity, more accurate matching pairs can still be identified.</p>
<p>MODMatcher has several features not found in existing sample alignment methods such as MixupMapper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Westra1">[4]</xref>. First, we proposed novel methods for methylation profile based gender inference and sample alignment, and MODMatcher can be applied to diverse types of data, including genotype, gene expression, methylation, and CNV. MixupMapper can only be applied to genotype and gene expression data. Second, by using more than two types of omics profiles, MODMatcher can not only identify potential mis-labeled omics profile pairs, but also pinpoint which profiles in the pairs are mis-labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g009">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g010">10</xref>), and do so more robustly than when only two types of omics profiles are used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g008">Figure 8</xref>)</p>
<p>Even though MODMatcher is not designed for matching two types of omics profiles, it can be applied to data sets consisting of only two types of omics profiles. MixupMapper and MODMatcher can only be compared for their ability to match genotype and mRNA profiles. We applied MODMatcher to 8 data sets examined by MixupMapper (downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genenetwork.nl/wordpress/mixupmapper/#additional" xlink:type="simple">http://genenetwork.nl/wordpress/mixupmapper/#additional</ext-link>) and compared alignment results based on the two methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003790.s008">Table S4</xref>). MODMatcher results completely agreed with MixupMapper results in 6 of 8 data sets. For the two datasets in which the MODMatcher and MixupMapper results are different, we further assessed sample alignment quality by counting cis-eQLs identified based on the final matching results. We input final matching pairs identified by each method and their corresponding profiles to the same program, MatrixEQTL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Shabalin1">[11]</xref>, to identify cis-eQTLs. In both cases, more cis-eQTLs were identified with MODMatcher results than with MixupMapper results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003790.s009">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>After labeling errors in omics profiles are identified and corrected by leveraging information from multiple omics profiles, the corrected profiles can be compared with clinical information to answer many biological questions, such as what genes' expression levels correlate with blood lipid level, and what genes' methylation levels correlate with survival of cancer patients. To accomplish these tasks, we assume that all clinical data are correct, which may not always be true. There could be errors in clinical data files, such as missing data, and row or column shifts. It is more challenging to identify and correct errors in clinical data files than it is to identify labeling errors in omics profiles. More research efforts are warranted for checking potential errors in the links between clinical data and omics profiles.</p>

<p>Comprehensive data sets generally consist of clinical or phenotypic data and multiple types of high-throughput data. For example, the LGRC data set consists of clinical, genotype, gene expression, and methylation data. The TCGA tumor data sets consist of clinical, genotype, gene expression, CNV, methylation, miRNA, and protein array data. Our procedure is applicable to data sets with clinical data and at least two different types of omics data. Here we illustrate our procedure on data sets with clinical data and genetic, gene expression, and methylation data.</p>

<title>1) cis-eSNP mapping</title>
<p>An eSNP is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) whose genotype associates with variation in the expression of a particular gene. If that gene and its corresponding eSNP are in proximity, the eSNP is called a cis-eSNP. Cis-eSNPs have been extensively studied for their association with disease risks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Schadt1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Emilsson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Montgomery1">[18]</xref>, and have been used to infer sample genotypes from gene expression profiling data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Westra1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Schadt2">[19]</xref>. To identify cis-eSNPs, we used an efficient eSNP mapping program, MatrixEQTL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Shabalin1">[11]</xref>. Assuming that genotype had an additive and linear effect on gene expression, we calculated the t statics for each SNP and gene expression pair to evaluate the significance of association. Cis-eSNPs are defined as SNPs within 1 Mb of the genome region of the associated genes. The FDR (False Discovery Rate) was estimated from p-values with the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Benjamini1">[20]</xref>.</p>

<p>After cis-mSNPs are identified, the genotype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the cis-mSNP for a particular sample <italic>i</italic> can be inferred from the associated probe methylation level <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as follows.

<p>Given sample genotypes measured by SNP and inferred from cis-mSNPs, the sample identify similarity between the two genotypes is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are observed and inferred genotype at the <italic>n</italic>th cis-mSNP for sample <italic>i</italic>, respectively, and <italic>N</italic> is the total number of cis-mSNPs.</p>

<title>3) cis methylation-mRNA mapping</title>
<p>DNA methylation is a common epigenetic signal that regulates gene expression levels. Increased methylation at CpGs sites near gene promoter region is associated with gene repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-DiNardo1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003790-Suzuki1">[24]</xref>. Transcript annotation of hg18 was fetched from UCSC database and further processed with the Bioconductor GenomicFeature package. Each methyl probe was mapped to a transcript whose starting site is within 10 Kb from the genomic position of the methyl probe. A methyl probe that is potentially mapped to multiple transcripts on the basis of the above criterion is assigned to the transcript whose start site is closest to the genomic position of the methyl probe. Methyl probes that can't be mapped to any transcript based on the above criterion were excluded from further analysis. To identify cis-regulation pairs, we calculated the Spearman correlation between the methylation level of a methyl probe and the expression level of the corresponding gene at p-value&lt;0.01. If multiple methyl probes were mapped to the same genes, the probe with the best p-value was selected. Therefore, in subsequent analyses, there was at most a single cis methylation-mRNA pair for each gene. Thus, any potential bias driven by a single gene was avoided.</p>
<p>Before aligning methylation and mRNA profiling data, we rank transformed both gene expression and methylation profiling data for each methyl probe or gene expression probe as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the rank transformation function and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003790.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>Copy number variations (CNVs) of genome regions are commonly associated with diseases and may be inherited or occur by <italic>de novo</italic> mutations.

<p>Multiple omics data surveying different molecular traits pertaining to the same set of samples were mapped according to the flow diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003790-g004">Figure 4</xref>. SNP genotype, gene expression, and methylation data are used for illustration purposes. Other types of data can be used as well. For example, CNV data was used instead of SNP data in the TCGA data sets. First, significant cis regulation (cis-eSNPs, cis-mSNPs, and cis methyl-mRNA) pairs were identified, and sample identity similarities were calculated based on these cis pairs as outlined above. Then, matches and mismatches between omics data were identified in the following steps (ordered by confidence of each test):</p>

If the z-score distribution of all top 1 similarity scores is statistically different (t-test p-value&lt;0.01) from the distribution of z-scores of all top 2 similarity scores, then “n” is set to 1. Otherwise, “n” is set to 2. In this fashion, we also compared the distributions of top 1 and top 3 similarity scores. For SNP-mRNA matching in the LGRC data set, top “n” was set as 1. For mis-aligned profiles, we further explored whether they could be matched with other unmatched samples by reciprocal matching, in which we determine whether a mis-aligned genotype profile <italic>G<sub>i</sub></italic> has the highest similarity with an unmatched mRNA profile <italic>E<sub>j</sub></italic> among all mRNA profiles, and the unmatched mRNA profile <italic>E<sub>j</sub></italic> has the highest similarity with <italic>G<sub>i</sub></italic> among all genotype profiles.

<p>After label mis-matches between different types of omics data are identified and sample labeling errors are corrected by comparing multiple identity similarity measurements, the quality of sample alignment is re-assessed by counting the numbers of cis regulation pairs according to the updated data annotation.
