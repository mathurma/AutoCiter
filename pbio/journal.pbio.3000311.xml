<abstract>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection (CDI) is a major nosocomial disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathology of CDI stems primarily from the 2 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>–secreted exotoxins—toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB)—that disrupt the tight junctions between epithelial cells leading to the loss of colonic epithelial barrier function. Here, we report the engineering of a series of monomeric and dimeric designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) for the neutralization of TcdB. The best dimeric DARPin, DLD-4, inhibited TcdB with a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 4 pM in vitro, representing an approximately 330-fold higher potency than the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-TcdB monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab in the same assay. DLD-4 also protected mice from a toxin challenge in vivo. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies revealed that the 2 constituent DARPins of DLD-4–1.4E and U3—bind the central and C-terminal regions of the delivery domain of TcdB. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies showed that the DARPins 1.4E and U3 interfere with the interaction between TcdB and its receptors chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) and frizzled class receptor 2 (FZD2), respectively. Our cryo-EM studies revealed a new conformation of TcdB (both apo- and DARPin-bound at pH 7.4) in which the combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPS) domain points away from the delivery domain. This conformation of the CROPS domain is in stark contrast to that seen in the negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) structure of TcdA and TcdB at the same pH, in which the CROPS domain bends toward and “kisses” the delivery domain. The ultrapotent anti-TcdB molecules from this study serve as candidate starting points for CDI drug development and provide new biological tools for studying the pathogenicity of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>. The structural insights regarding both the “native” conformation of TcdB and the putative sites of TcdB interaction with the FZD2 receptor, in particular, should help accelerate the development of next-generation anti–<italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> toxin therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is a gram-positive spore-forming anaerobic bacterium. Colonization of the gut with pathogenic <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> can lead to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection (CDI) with symptoms including diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref002">2</xref>]. In 2011, there were almost half a million reported cases of CDI and more than 29,000 CDI-associated deaths in the United States alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref003">3</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> is considered a major nosocomial pathogen because a significant percentage (7%) patients acquire CDI after hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref004">4</xref>]. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are considered a major culprit of CDI, because they disrupt the patients’ natural gut microflora that would otherwise keep the proliferation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> in check. The current standard of care for treating CDI is the administration of additional antibiotics, mainly vancomycin, metronidazole, and fidaxomicin. Although this approach is generally effective against primary CDI, in recent decades, the rate of CDI recurrence has significantly increased due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant and so-called hypervirulent strains (15%–35% CDI recurrence in patients after cessation of antibiotic treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The pathology of CDI mainly stems from the 2 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>–secreted exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), that target small GTPases within the host cells, leading to disruption of the tight junctions and loss of colonic epithelial barrier function. The anti-TcdB monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab (ZINPLAVA) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 for treating recurrent CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref007">7</xref>]. The CDI recurrence rate in patients receiving antibiotics together with IV infusion of bezlotoxumab, although lower than those receiving antibiotics alone (26%–28%), remains high at 15% to 17% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Our long-term goal is to develop highly efficacious antitoxin proteins as oral therapeutics that can directly neutralize the toxins in the gut for treating and/or preventing the recurrent of CDI. These antitoxin proteins are based on a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin), a small antibody-mimic binding scaffold that exhibits very high thermostability, resistance to proteases and denaturants, and a very low immunogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref010">10</xref>]. DARPins that bind a wide range of molecules with pico- to nanomolar affinity have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref024">24</xref>]. Furthermore, DARPins can be expressed at high levels in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (multigram quantities per liter of culture in fermenters) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref025">25</xref>], enabling DARPins to be produced at potentially very low cost on a large scale.</p>
<p>Combining phage panning and functional screening, a panel of dimeric DARPins with picomolar in vitro TcdB-neutralization potency were identified. The best dimeric DARPin, DLD-4, exhibited a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50)</sub> of 4 pM and 20 pM against TcdB from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> strains VPI10463 (ribotype 087) and M68 (ribotype 120), respectively, which is approximately 330-fold and approximately 33-fold more potent than the FDA-approved anti-TcdB monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab. DARPin DLD-4 was also efficacious in vivo in 2 mouse models against TcdB challenge, pointing to its potential as a next-generation antitoxin biologic for treating CDI and/or preventing its recurrence.</p>
<p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) was employed to elucidate the binding interfaces of TcdB and DLD-4. Guided by this structural information, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that the constituent monomeric DARPins of dimeric DLD-4, 1.4E and U3, interfere with the interaction between TcdB and its receptors chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) and frizzled class receptor 2 (FZD2), respectively. The ultrahigh toxin-neutralization potency of DLD-4 likely stems from its ability to simultaneously block both these receptors from associating with TcdB. Moreover, our cryo-EM study also revealed a novel conformation of DARPin-bound and apo toxin at neutral pH in which the combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPS) domain points away from the delivery domain. This is in contrast to that seen in the negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) structures of TcdA and TcdB at the same pH in which the CROPS domain extends toward and kisses the delivery domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref026">26</xref>]. We believe that our cryo-EM structures of TcdB, apo and DARPin-bound, represent the native aqueous conformations that will be invaluable for future antitoxin drug development.</p>

<title>Selection of monomeric TcdB-neutralizing DARPins</title>
<p>A library of approximately 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> DARPin variants was constructed via sequential PCR and ligation essentially as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref009">9</xref>]. Biotinylated TcdB (from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> strain VPI10463) was used as the target protein to enrich DARPins that could bind the toxin via 4 rounds of phage panning. The enriched DARPin library pool from the third round of phage panning were subcloned into the pET26b vector and transformed into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells for high-level DARPin expression and functional screening for those with toxin-neutralization ability. About 40% of the clones (299 clones) were able to rescue Vero cells’ viability from TcdB toxicity by &gt;50%. The top 40 hits were sequenced, and of these, 12 were determined to be unique clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s026">S1 Table</xref>). Most clones exhibited EC<sub>50</sub> values of approximately 10 nM, and the 2 best clones, 1.2E and 1.4E, displayed EC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.4 nM and 3 nM, respectively. The relative affinity of each of the top 9 DARPins for TcdB was assessed by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and was found to not directly correlate with their in vitro neutralization potency. For example, although 1.2E and 1.4E neutralized TcdB with similar potency, 1.4E appeared to be among the strongest toxin binders, whereas 1.2E was one of the weaker binders. The discrepancy between binding affinity and neutralization potency likely stems from the different epitopes engaged by the different DARPins. That is, a DARPin that weakly binds a region critical for toxin activity might exhibit a higher toxin-neutralization potency than another DARPin that binds strongly to a region of less importance.</p>

<title>Selection of dimeric TcdB-neutralizing DARPins</title>
<p>Fusion of multiple DARPins have been reported to significantly enhance the target-binding affinity via avidity effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref028">28</xref>]. We hypothesized that fusion of 2 DARPins that bind nonoverlapping epitopes on the toxin should yield enhanced binding affinity and thus a higher toxin-neutralization potency. A combinatorial library of DARPin dimers was created by joining individual monomeric DARPins (12 total) via a flexible linker (GGGGSx3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s026">S1 Table</xref>). A total of 1,504 individual clones were screened using a Vero cell toxin challenge assay, and 12 hits were identified. Of these, 10 were determined to be unique clones. The in vitro neutralization potencies of these 10 DARPins and their relative TcdB binding affinities are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The best DARPin dimer, DLD-4, exhibited a toxin-neutralization EC<sub>50</sub> of 4 ± 1 pM, which is approximately 600-fold lower than the best monomeric DARPin, 1.2E (EC<sub>50</sub> 2.4 ± 0.5 nM). As seen with the DARPin monomers, the relative TcdB binding affinities of the DARPin dimers were found to not directly correlate with their neutralization potency. Sequencing results also revealed that many of the dimers contained a new DARPin, U3 or U5, that was not present among the original 12 monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s026">S1 Table</xref>). U5 is identical to U3 except that it lacks the third randomized ankyrin repeat (AR) domain. U3 alone exhibits weak, but detectable, toxin-neutralization activity (EC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 25 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g003">Fig 3</xref>) in Vero cells and toxin-binding ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g004">Fig 4</xref>). U3 and U5 likely represent a minor constituent of the initial pool used to create the dimer DARPin library, and their discovery is highly serendipitous because (1) they bind to a neutralizing epitope and (2) the U3/U5 neutralization epitope is adjacent to the epitope targeted by the other DARPin hits such that the linker used is of sufficient length to accommodate simultaneous binding to both epitopes.</p>

<p>To understand the reason for the dramatic improvement in activity, we further characterized the 5 dimer DARPins with the strongest toxin-neutralization potency. We first compared the in vitro TcdB-neutralization potency of the DARPin dimers with their constituent monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g003">Fig 3</xref>). All these DARPin dimers significantly outperformed their individual constituent monomers as well as the combination of both monomers, indicative of synergistic activity. We further compared the relative binding affinity of DARPin dimers and monomers using ELISA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g004">Fig 4</xref>, except for DLD-6, all the dimeric DARPins yielded an increase in the ELISA signal relative to the constitute monomers. This observation is consistent with the binding of nonoverlapping epitopes on the toxin by the monomeric DARPins via an avidity effect. An exception is DLD-6, which appeared to bind the toxin more weakly than its constituent DARPin 3.5B at concentrations &lt;25 nM. This result is somewhat unexpected, considering that the toxin-neutralization potency of DLD-6 is &gt;100-fold higher than that of 3.5B (EC<sub>50</sub>: 12.5 pM for DLD-6 versus 13.3 nM for 3.5B). A sandwich ELISA assay confirmed that DLD-6 lacks the ability to crosslink 2 different TcdB molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), which would have been responsible for the difference between neutralization potency and binding result. We posit that the most possible cause of this discrepancy is that TcdB protein may exhibit less flexibility when immobilized on an ELISA plate, thus hindering the simultaneous interaction with both U3 and 3.5B.</p>

<title>Characterization of TcdB-neutralization potency of DARPins</title>
<p>All of our protein engineering work was conducted using TcdB from the laboratory strain of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> VPI10463 (ribotype 087). Because there is a significant amount of amino acid sequence heterogeneity between different strains of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref029">29</xref>], there is a need to develop broadly neutralizing DARPins. As a first step to address this need, we evaluated the activity of selected DARPin dimers (DLD-4, -7, -11, -12) against TcdB from 3 different strains of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>: VPI10463, M68 (ribotype 012), and UK1 (ribotype 027). All DARPins were effective against toxins from VPI10463 and M68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The best DARPin, DLD-4, was found to be approximately 330- and approximately 33-fold more efficacious than bezlotoxumab at inhibiting TcdB from VPI 10463 and M68, respectively, as quantified using the CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub>s of DLD-4 and bezlotoxumab were further measured using the conventional cell rounding assay and were found to be similar to that determined using CTG assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). However, these DARPins showed negligible activity against TcdB from the UK1 strain, which belongs to the hypervirulent 027 ribotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Bezlotoxumab also showed significantly weaker, albeit detectable, neutralization activity against this toxin (EC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 25 nM). We further tested all the other DARPins and found that 5 of them (3.9G, 1.2E, 8.1B, 1.8H, and 1.4E) showed weak but detectable neutralization against TcdB<sub>UK1</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s004">S4</xref> Figs). We are currently repeating our in vitro engineering using TcdB<sub>UK1</sub> as the target protein in order to identify DARPins efficacious against this toxin. To ensure that the specific activity of our bezlotoxumab is not compromised during production, we repeated the EC<sub>50</sub> measurement of our bezlotoxumab exactly following a published protocol by Orth and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref030">30</xref>] because it is not uncommon for different assays to give different EC<sub>50</sub> values for the same reagent. The EC<sub>50</sub> of bezlotoxumab was found to be 0.3 nM, which is nearly identical to that reported by Orth and colleagues using the authentic bezlotoxumab produced by Merck, confirming the integrity of our in-house–produced bezlotoxumab.</p>

<p>We further evaluated the ability of the most potent antitoxin DARPin, DLD-4, to protect mice from systemic toxin challenge in vivo using 2 murine TcdB challenge models. In the first model, a lethal dose of TcdB (1.5 μg/kg) was mixed with DLD-4 (0.25 or 2.5 mg/kg), bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg), or PBS and then injected intraperitoneally (IP) into CD1 mice (5–10 mice/group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref032">32</xref>]; 40% of the mice survived after injection with the mixture containing the toxin mixed with 2.5 mg/kg DLD-4 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<title>Cryo-EM structure of the full-length TcdB and its interaction with DARPin DLD-4</title>
<p>To understand how DLD-4 neutralizes TcdB, single-particle cryo-EM was used to elucidate the complex structure of TcdB and DLD-4. Purified full-length TcdB (VPI 10463) and DLD-4 were mixed and vitrified on the cryo-EM grids and then imaged under cryo-EM. A total of 3,902 super-resolution electron-counting movie stacks were obtained, from which 84,420 good image particles were used to reconstruct the final 3D density map with an overall resolution of 9 Å (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s007">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s008">S8</xref> Figs).</p>
<p>The overall structure of full-length TcdB is very similar to TcdA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref038">38</xref>], consisting of 4 functional domains: the glucosyltransferase domain (GTD), the autoprocessing domain (APD), the delivery domain, and the CROPS domain.

This conformation of the CROPS domain is strikingly different from that reported in the negative-stain EM structure of the full-length apo TcdA and TcdB at the same pH (pH 7.4), in which the CROPS domain extends toward and “kisses” the delivery domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref045">45</xref>]. This observation prompted us to determine the cryo-EM structure of apo TcdB. The CROPS domain of apo TcdB at pH 7.4 was found to adopt exactly the same conformation as those in complex with DARPin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). To resolve whether the 180° shift of the CROPS domain results from the difference between cryo-EM and negative-staining EM specimen preparations, we calculated the 2D class averages of the negatively stained apo TcdB particles at pH 7.4. In approximately 80% of the negatively stained TcdB particles, the CROPS domain extends toward the delivery domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), as seen in the negatively stained apo TcdA and TcdB. Only approximately 20% of the apo TcdB particles have the CROPS domain projecting away from the delivery domain similar to that observed in the cryo-EM TcdB structure. Unlike cryo-EM, in which the protein samples are preserved in a vitreous state with water molecules in and surrounding the specimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref046">46</xref>], negative-stain EM inevitably results in dehydration and flattening of the biological specimens, which may result in distortion of the molecule’s conformation. Thus, we believe that the TcdB conformation in which the CROPS domain projects away from, rather than extends toward, the delivery domain represents the native aqueous conformation of TcdB at pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The 2 constituent DARPins of DLD-4, U3 and 1.4E, bind around the middle and the C-terminal end of the delivery domain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g007">Fig 7A, 7B and 7C</xref>). DARPin 1.4E also interacts with the C-terminal region of the APD. The resolved protein secondary structures allowed us to model each domain of the TcdB and DLD-4 into the cryo-EM density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). The density of the 15-residue–long peptide linker between the C-terminus of U3 and the N-terminus of 1.4E was visible, enabling the assignment of each DARPin into its corresponding density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). The local resolutions of the cryo-EM density are not uniform throughout the complex, with lower resolutions around U3 of DLD-4 and the C-terminal tip of the CROPS domain. This is consistent with the observation that DARPin U3 binds relatively weakly to TcdB, and the tip of the CROPS domain exhibits relatively large flexibility, properties that contribute to lower local resolutions in single-particle cryo-EM reconstructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref047">47</xref>]. We further noticed that the protruding tip of the delivery domain in both DLD-4-bound and apo TcdB seems to bend more toward the center of the toxin than that seen in the crystal structure of apo TcdA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref038">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s029">S1 Movie</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s011">S11 Fig</xref>), which may reflect an intrinsic difference between TcdB and TcdA or compaction of TcdA in the crystal lattice.</p>
<p>Examination of the interface between TcdB and DLD-4 revealed detailed binding modes between the toxin and the 2 constituent DARPins, U3 and 1.4E, which are separated by approximately 30 Å and orientated perpendicular to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). The 2 DARPins are connected by a 15-residue linker (GGGGSx3), which lies along the side of the delivery domain of TcdB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). Each DARPin consists of 3 designed AR modules sandwiched between the N- and C-terminal capping ARs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref010">10</xref>]. Each designed AR and the C-terminal capping AR consist of a β-turn loop followed by 2 antiparallel α-helices, resulting in 3 variable loops and 1 fixed loop on each DARPin. These 4 loops are labeled as loops 1–4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g008">Fig 8</xref>. As anticipated, both DARPins have their variable loop regions contacting the TcdB and their helical scaffold regions exposed to the solvent. U3 grips onto the middle of the delivery domain (a β-sheet from residues 1,461–1,510 and a loop from residues 1,595–1,603, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), whereas 1.4E sits between the C-terminus of the delivery domain and the N-terminus of the CROPS domain (residues 1,800–1,834) and also interacts with a loop from the APD (residues 747–751; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). The sequence of TcdB from 1,800 to 1,834 lacks a high-resolution structural reference. However, both the shape of the EM density and the secondary structure prediction based on the protein sequence suggest that this region is a β-sheet (gray density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g008">Fig 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The cryo-EM structure revealed several protein residues with opposing charges at the binding interface between DLD-4 and TcdB. For example, arginine 66 on Loop 1 in U3 is within a Cα-Cα distance of 5 Å to glutamic acid 1,468 and aspartic 1,466, while arginine 130 (Loop 3) and lysine 163 (Loop 4) in U3 are facing aspartic acid 1,501 in the TcdB delivery domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). To study the effect of interacting residues, U3 and frizzled binding domain (FBD; amino acids 1,285–1,804) of TcdB<sub>VPI</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref048">48</xref>] mutants each harboring specific mutations were constructed and purified. Mutation arginine 66 alanine greatly impaired the ability of U3 to bind or neutralize TcdB<sub>VPI</sub>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g009">Fig 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). U3<sub>R66A</sub> also did not appreciably block FZD2 binding to immobilized TcdB<sub>VPI</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). Conversely, FBD with the mutation aspartic acid 1466 alanine (FBD<sub>D1466A</sub>) exhibited negligible binding to U3, whereas FBD<sub>E1468A</sub> showed significantly reduced binding affinity to U3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). These results indicate that both the negatively charged residues glutamic acid 1468 and aspartic acid 1466 on TcdB<sub>VPI</sub> may interact with the positively charged arginine 66 on U3, with aspartic acid 1466 playing a more dominant role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Similarly, FBD<sub>D1501A</sub> showed negligible ability to bind U3, whereas U3<sub>K163A</sub> showed significantly weaker affinity for TcdB<sub>VPI</sub>. Mutant U3<sub>R130A</sub> retained similar affinity for TcdB<sub>VPI</sub> relative to U3, but the double-mutant U3<sub>R130A/K163A</sub> showed further reduced binding affinity to TcdB<sub>VPI</sub> relative to the single-mutant U3<sub>K163A</sub>. The double-mutant U3<sub>R130A/K163A</sub> also exhibited a weaker ability to block the binding of FZD2 to immobilized TcdB<sub>VPI</sub> than either of the single mutants U3<sub>R130A</sub> and U3<sub>R163A</sub> via ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). These results indicate the presence of important ionic interaction between the negatively charged residue aspartic acid 1501 on TcdB<sub>VPI</sub> and the positively charged residues lysine 163 and arginine 130 on U3, with lysine 163 being the dominant contributor on U3. In TcdB<sub>UK1</sub>, the negatively charged glutamic acid 1468 and aspartic acid 1501 are occupied by the positively charged lysine and polar asparagine, respectively (residues labeled in orange in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s012">S12A Fig</xref>). The differences in change at these residues likely explains the weakened affinity of U3 toward TcdB<sub>UK1</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s014">S14 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>For DARPin 1.4E, the loops 1 and 2 span over a β-sheet region (residues 1,749–1,767) in the TcdB delivery domain, whereas loops 3 and 4 interact with part of the CROPS domain (residues 1,800–1834) and the APD (residues 747–751), respectively. Mutation of the charged residues glutamic acid 144 and lysine 168 in 1.4E to alanine had minor effect on the ability of 1.4E to interact with TcdB<sub>VPI</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s013">S13 Fig</xref>), indicating that charge interaction mediated by these residues likely does not play a significant role in 1.4E binding to TcdB. Unfortunately, the region on TcdB that interfaces with 1.4E, spanning residues 1,800 to 1,834, lacks a high-resolution structural reference, making it difficult to identify specific interactions with reasonable confidence. It is worth noting that the region of residues 1,753 to 1,851 was reported to be highly variable between TcdB from different ribotypes, and neutralizing epitopes within this region were found to be less accessible in TcdB of ribotype 027 (e.g., UK1) than that of ribotype 012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref049">49</xref>]. No detectable binding between 1.4E and the UK1 strain of TcdB was observed in our ELISA assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s014">S14 Fig</xref>). Thus, the lack of neutralization activity of 1.4E against TcdB from UK1 may be in part due to the occlusion of the neutralization epitope in this toxin.</p>

<title>Mechanism of TcdB neutralization by DARPin DLD-4</title>
<p>Both TcdA and TcdB enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref052">52</xref>]. The CROPS domain is historically thought to be the sole receptor-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref053">53</xref>]. However, 3 cell-surface receptors for TcdB have recently been reported: CSPG4, poliovirus receptor like 3 (PVRL3 or NECTIN3), and members of the frizzled protein family (FZD1, FZD2, and FZD7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref056">56</xref>]. The constituent monomer DARPins in the dimer DLD-4 are 1.4E and U3. The cryo-EM study revealed that 1.4E interacts with regions in TcdB between residues 747 and 751 and 1,800 and 1,834, whereas U3 interacts with regions between residues 1,461 and 1,510 and 1,595 and 1,603 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In vitro studies showed that, although 1.4E binds to the APD of TcdB, which has been implicated in inositol hexaphosphate (IP6)-induced autocleavage, the DARPin exhibits negligible impact on the IP6-induced toxin autocleavage activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). The overlap of the 1.4E-interacting regions with that of the binding site of TcdB receptor CSPG4 (between residues 1,756 and 1,852, designated D97) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref057">57</xref>] led us to hypothesize that 1.4E may exert its toxin-neutralization activity by interfering with the toxin–CSPG4 interaction. Similarly, alignment of our cryo-EM structure of TcdB–DARPin complex with the crystal structure of the TcdB and the frizzled receptor-binding domain revealed a complete overlap of U3 and FZD2 on TcdB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref048">48</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s016">S16 Fig</xref>), indicating that U3 likely neutralizes TcdB by interfering with its interaction with FZD1/2/7. We set about testing these hypotheses as well as investigating the potential disruption of the toxin’s interaction with other known receptors by DLD-4.</p>
<p>We first determined whether DLD-4 competes with CSPG4 for binding to TcdB using competitive ELISA. A GFP-tagged extracellular domain of CSPG4 (CSPG4-EC-GFP) was expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells and purified. For the ELISA experiments, MaxiSorp 96-well plates were first coated with purified TcdB and then incubated with CSPG4-EC-GFP (1 nM) in the presence or absence of DLD-4 or its constituent DARPins (250 nM) for 1 hour at room temperature. After thorough washing, the bound CSPG4-EC-GFP was detected using anti-GFP antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g010">Fig 10A</xref>, DLD-4 and one of its constituent monomers,1.4E, significantly reduced the binding signal from CSPG4-EC-GFP with DLD-4, producing a more pronounced signal reduction than 1.4E. No significant reduction in binding signal was observed for U3. This result indicates that the monomeric DARPin 1.4E, and by extension the dimeric DARPin DLD-4, interferes with the toxin–CSPG4 interaction.</p>

<p>We carried out a similar competition ELISA experiment to determine whether DLD-4 and FZD2 bind to overlapping epitopes on TcdB. After toxin immobilization, the plate was incubated with the Fc-tagged extracellular domain of FZD2 (FZD2-Fc) (1 nM) in the presence or absence of DLD-4 or its constituent DARPins (250 nM). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g010">Fig 10B</xref>, a significant reduction of binding signal was observed for DLD-4 and U3, whereas no reduction of FZD2-binding signal was observed for 1.4E. These data indicate that U3 competes with FZD2 for binding to TcdB. Because U3 interacts with TcdB between residues 1,461 and 1,510 and residues 1,595 and 1,603, our result provided further evidence of the reported binding site of FZD2 on TcdB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref048">48</xref>]. No signal reduction was observed for the extracellular domain of PVRL3 (PVRL3-EC) using the same assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s017">S17 Fig</xref>), suggesting that DLD-4 probably does not interfere with the interaction between PVRL3 and TcdB. Taken together, these studies suggest that the high toxin-neutralization potency of DLD-4 in Vero cells likely stems from its ability to simultaneously interfere with the interaction between TcdB and 2 of its cellular receptors, CSPG4 and FZD2.</p>
<p>Because Vero cells express high levels of CSPG4, FZD7, and PVRL3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref058">58</xref>], we sought further confirmation of the toxin-neutralization mechanism of DLD-4 in cells with different receptor expression levels. Caco-2 cells were selected because they are reported to express a high level of frizzled receptor 7 but a negligible level of CSPG4 or PVRL3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref059">59</xref>]. We anticipate 1.4E, which interferes with TcdB–CSPG4 interaction, to lack any protective activity in these cells, whereas U3, which blocks TcdB–frizzled receptor interaction, to be highly protective. As anticipated, only U3 and DLD-4 showed significant TcdB-neutralization ability in Caco-2 cells, whereas 1.4E showed no protective activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s018">S18A Fig</xref>). The mixture of U3 and 1.4E showed similar efficacy as U3 alone. This result is consistent with our speculation that 1.4E acts by blocking TcdB–CSPG4 interaction. We next tested the ability of these DARPins to neutralize TcdB in a HeLa-derived cell line, TZM, which expresses both CSPG4 and frizzled receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref055">55</xref>]. Both U3 and 1.4E partially protected HeLa cells against TcdB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s018">S18B Fig</xref>). A mixture of these 2 DARPins showed additive activity, whereas DLD-4 exhibited the strongest activity. This result indicates that both of CSPG4 and frizzled receptor mediate TcdB entry in HeLa cells. Finally, because U3 was one of the weakest TcdB inhibitors that emerged from our screening conducted in Vero cells, we decided to evaluate the neutralization ability of all the other monomeric DARPins in Caco-2 cells. Of these, only 8.1B showed significant TcdB-neutralization activity in Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s019">S19 Fig</xref>). This likely reflects an insignificant role of frizzled receptor in Vero cells for TcdB entry.</p>

<p>CDI represents a serious public health problem with more than US$6 billion in annual treatment-associated costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref060">60</xref>].

DARPins represent a versatile class of binding proteins that have been engineered to bind diverse targets with up to picomolar affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref024">24</xref>]. Furthermore, DARPins are also amenable to high-yield production in microbial-expression hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref010">10</xref>]. Given these attractive properties of DARPins, our long-term goal is to create DARPin-based oral therapeutics against CDI.</p>
<p>Combining phage panning and functional screening, we identified 12 DARPins that protected Vero cells against the TcdB-induced cytopathic effect at nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A secondary functional screening of dimeric DARPins yielded 10 dimers with &gt;100-fold improved toxin-neutralization potency relative to the constituent monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The best dimer DARPin, DLD-4 (comprising U3 and 1.4E), neutralized TcdB from VPI 10463 (ribotype 087) and M68 (ribotype 017) with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 4 and 16 pM, respectively, representing an approximately 330-fold and an approximately 33-fold higher potency than the FDA-approved bezlotoxumab in the same assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g005">Fig 5</xref>). DLD-4 effectively protected mice from a lethal IP TcdB toxin challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). However, due to the surprisingly poor resistance of DLD-4 against digestion by trypsin and chymotrypsin, no significant protection was observed in the mouse toxin cecum injection model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Ongoing work in the lab is aimed at improving the protease stability of DLD-4.</p>
<p>Cryo-EM analysis of the complex formed between TcdB and the most potent antitoxin DARPin, DLD-4, revealed that the constituent DARPins of DLD-4, 1.4E and U3, bind to 2 distinct regions of TcdB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Guided by this structural information, we carried out competitive ELISA studies and showed that 1.4E and U3 compete with receptors CSPG4 and FZD2, respectively, for binding to TcdB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000311.g010">Fig 10</xref>). No competition between DLD-4 and the third TcdB receptor PVRL3 was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s017">S17 Fig</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the ultrahigh neutralization potency of DLD-4 mainly derives from its ability to simultaneously interfere with the interaction between TcdB and 2 of its receptors—CSPG4 and FZD2.</p>
<p>Our cryo-EM studies further revealed a novel conformation of TcdB at pH 7.4 in which the CROPS domain points away from the delivery domain. This observation is in contrast to what has been seen in the negative-stain EM structure of TcdA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref038">38</xref>], as well as the major conformation of the negatively stained apo TcdB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Unlike negative-stain EM, the cryo-EM specimen preparation is less prone to structural artifacts from specimen preparation. Thus, we believe that our cryo-EM structure likely represents the native conformation of TcdB in an aqueous environment at pH 7.4.</p>
<p>In summary, we report the engineering of a panel of DARPins with superior in vitro toxin-neutralization potency against <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> toxin TcdB than the FDA-approved anti-TcdB monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab. These highly potent DARPin-based antitoxins possess the potential to be developed into therapeutics to treat CDI and/or prevent its recurrence. Efforts are ongoing to make the molecules from this study amenable to oral administration. Last but not least, cryo-EM structural studies, for the first time, revealed a novel and native conformation of the full-length toxin at pH 7.4 encompassing the CROPS domain, providing important structural insights into the toxin-neutralization mechanism of the most effective antitoxin DARPin in this study, DLD-4. These results should facilitate the design and engineering of new molecules that block the toxic action of TcdB.</p>

<title>DARPin library creation and phage panning</title>
<p>DARPins are composed of repeat modules of natural ankyrin protein and consist of an N-terminal capping repeat (N-cap), 3 (N3C) internal repeats, and a C-terminal capping repeat (C-cap) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref009">9</xref>]. In a DARPin library, each internal repeat contains 6 randomized positions, yielding a total of 18 randomized positions in each DARPin. We prepared such a DARPin library using sequential ligation and PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref016">16</xref>]. This DARPin library was positioned downstream of a DsbAss cotranslational translocation signal peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref067">67</xref>] and fused to the N-terminus of the bacteriophage M13 gIII minor coat protein. A DARPin library consisting of approximately 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> unique clones was created by transforming approximately 12 mL high-efficiency MC1061 electro-competent cells with approximately 250 μg of ligated and purified DNA.</p>
<p>Phage panning was carried out as described previously by Steiner and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref068">68</xref>]. TcdB (from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> VPI10463) was biotinylated via EZ-Link-Sulfo NHS-LC Biotin (Pierce, Waltham, MA) and used as the target protein. Four rounds of sequential phage panning were performed. The enrichment of TcdB-binding DARPin was confirmed by phage ELISA following a published protocol by Steiner and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref068">68</xref>]. A plateau in the level of TcdB binding was observed after round 3 of panning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s021">S21 Fig</xref>), indicative of successful phage panning.</p>
<p>To create a dimeric DARPin library, monomeric DARPin variants identified from the functional library screening were PCR-amplified using Taq DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) with 2 sets of primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s022">S22 Fig</xref>). Set 1 used primers Ran2-D-F and Linker-BSAi-D-R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000311.s027">S2 Table</xref>) to generate DARPins with a 3ʹ linker sequence ((GGGGS)x3), and set 2 used primers Linker-BSAi-D-F and Ran2-D-R to generate DARPins with a 5ʹ linker sequence. PCR products were digested with BsaI to generate sticky ends in the added linker region and ligated to form dimeric DARPins.

The concentration of TcdB was selected such that the viability of toxin-treated Vero cells was 10% to 20% that of naïve Vero cells after 6 hours of toxin contact time. Cell supernatants were replaced with fresh growth medium 6 hours later, and the cell viability was quantified 72 hours post toxin addition using CellTiterGlo reagent (Promega) and normalized to Vero cells treated with the equivalent amount of lysate from untransformed BL21(DE3) cells in the absence of TcdB.</p>

Each microscope is equipped with a Gatan K2 summit direct detection camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA); 2,255 (from Tecnai F20) and 1,647 (from JEM3200FSC) micrographs were collected using macro mode or manual mode of SerialEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref070">70</xref>] in the super-resolution electron-counting mode. Nominal magnifications of 25,000X (on Tecnai F20) and 30,000X (on JEM3200FSC) were used, yielding subpixel sizes of 0.75 Å and 0.615 Å, respectively.

<title>Image processing</title>
<p>Movie stacks, collected on both microscopes for the complex of TcdB and DLD-4, were first binned by 2 to yield pixel sizes of 1.5 Å and 1.23 Å.

Contrast transfer functions of the micrographs were estimated using CTFFind4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref072">72</xref>]. Batchboxer in EMAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000311.ref073">73</xref>] was first used to automatically pick all the particles from 1,272 sum images with a box size of 216 pixels<sup>2</sup>, or particles from 1,173 sum images with a box size of 280 pixels<sup>2</sup>, yielding 331,516 particles and 234,642 particles, respectively.

After thorough washing, biotinylated TcdB was added to the wells. Biotinylated TcdB captured by DARPins was detected using HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Only the construct linking DARPins binding to an overlapping epitope (i.e., 1.4E-L-1.2E) was able to bind to both immobilized and solution phase TcdB molecules simultaneously. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.
