<abstract>
<p>The spread of antibiotic resistance is always a consequence of evolutionary processes. The consideration of evolution is thus key to the development of sustainable therapy. Two main factors were recently proposed to enhance long-term effectiveness of drug combinations: evolved collateral sensitivities between the drugs in a pair and antagonistic drug interactions. We systematically assessed these factors by performing over 1,600 evolution experiments with the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in single- and multidrug environments. Based on the growth dynamics during these experiments, we reconstructed antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks as a new tool for characterizing the ability of the tested drug combinations to constrain bacterial survival as well as drug resistance evolution across time. Subsequent statistical analysis of the influence of the factors on ACE network characteristics revealed that (i) synergistic drug interactions increased the likelihood of bacterial population extinction—irrespective of whether combinations were compared at the same level of inhibition or not—while (ii) the potential for evolved collateral sensitivities between 2 drugs accounted for a reduction in bacterial adaptation rates. In sum, our systematic experimental analysis allowed us to pinpoint 2 complementary determinants of combination efficacy and to identify specific drug pairs with high ACE scores. Our findings can guide attempts to further improve the sustainability of antibiotic therapy by simultaneously reducing pathogen load and resistance evolution.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Bacterial infections are commonly treated with a combination of antibiotic drugs. However, not all combinations are equally effective, and success is variable. One reason for this variation is that we usually do not know to what extent bacteria are able to adapt to different types of drug combinations. If they can and do adapt, then antibiotic resistance can spread, potentially aggravating the current antibiotic crisis. In the current study, we therefore asked whether combination therapy can be improved by considering the evolutionary potential of the bacteria. To address this question, we systematically assessed the efficacy of antibiotic combinations using controlled laboratory evolution experiments with the opportunistic human pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> as a model. We found that 2 factors consistently increase treatment efficacy. First, synergism between the combined drugs (i.e., the 2 drugs enhance each other’s effects) increases the rate of bacterial population extinction and thus clearance rate. Second, evolved trade-offs such as collateral sensitivity (i.e., evolution of resistance to one drug increases susceptibility to the other drug) limit the ability of bacteria to adapt to the antibiotic pair. Our findings may help to optimize combination therapy by focusing on drug pairs that interact synergistically and also lead to evolved collateral sensitivities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rise of antibiotic resistance is reducing the arsenal of available drugs to treat bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref003">3</xref>]. Some infections are already nearly untreatable because the infecting pathogens are resistant to virtually all available drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref005">5</xref>]. The identification and establishment of new antibiotics has become a major focus of national and international health programs, and substantial investments have been directed towards drug discovery, for example, by the United States and the European Union [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref010">10</xref>]. Yet even if these attempts succeeded and dozens of novel compounds became available tomorrow, the antibiotic crisis would not subside. The evolution of resistance is inevitable, and new drugs will be incapacitated within short time periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref003">3</xref>]. So how can we hamper this evolutionary march towards resistance? To some extent, we cannot escape the open-ended arms race between compound discovery and resistance evolution. Nevertheless, we may still use evolutionary thinking to enhance treatment efficacy and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref011">11</xref>]. Combination therapy, the simultaneous deployment of 2 or more drugs, is commonly proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref012">12</xref>]. Indeed, WHO has endorsed it as the first-line strategy to treat diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref015">15</xref>]. However, the nature of the drug combination is crucial for treatment success because initially effective combinations may maximize selection for antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The approach of experimental evolution has proven highly informative on exploring the dynamics that shape the emergence and spread of drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref018">18</xref>]. Using this approach, drug pairs were previously suggested to be most effective at limiting bacterial adaptation if (i) antimicrobials display collateral sensitivity, such that bacteria that evolve resistance to one of the compounds immediately suffer exacerbated suppression by the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref022">22</xref>], or (ii) antibiotics interact antagonistically, such that they inhibit each other’s effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref024">24</xref>]. A mathematical model indicated that the latter empirical findings may not be generally applicable but depend on the exact conditions during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref025">25</xref>]. In particular, synergistic drug pairs generally favor bacterial clearance but only sometimes low adaptation rates. The strong reduction in population size by synergistic drugs decreases the likelihood of resistance mutations emerging and increases the chances of population extinction. However, these effects only correlate with low adaptation rates when resource competition is weak. When resource competition is high, resistance mutations have a strong selective advantage and may spread rapidly through the population due to competitive release. Under these conditions, antagonistic rather than synergistic drugs are most efficient in reducing adaptation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref025">25</xref>]. To date, few experimental data are available to explore these particular model predictions—and, moreover, test the role of evolutionary trade-offs, such as the evolved collateral sensitivities—on bacterial adaptation in multidrug environments.</p>
<p>In the current study, we performed a systematic analysis using an experimental evolution approach and the gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> as a model. We evaluated 38 drug pairs for their ability to effectively constrain bacterial adaptation in multidrug environments and calculated 2 antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks based on either the rate of adaptation or bacterial clearance (i.e., frequency of population extinction). These measures provide complementary information on treatment efficacy. First, population extinction represents the ultimate aim of any antibiotic intervention; its frequency is a highly informative indicator of treatment efficacy under our specific experimental conditions, in which antibiotics are always applied at sublethal doses. Second, for the surviving populations, we further evaluated increases in growth rates as a measure of the bacteria’s adaptive potential in antibiotic environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>]. We subsequently employed complementary statistical approaches, including an integrative Bayesian network (BN) analysis, to disentangle the relative impacts of drug interaction type and evolved collateral effects between individual drugs on the characteristics of the inferred ACE networks. For selected drug pairs, we additionally explored to what extent adaptation to the combinations is driven by the single-component drugs or by initial drug inhibitory levels.</p>

<title>Most tested antibiotics interact synergistically in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic></title>
<p>Antibiotic interactions are defined as synergistic, additive, or antagonistic when the drug pair has a stronger, equivalent, or weaker inhibitory effect on bacterial growth than the corresponding single drugs (i.e., monotherapies), respectively. Here, we determined this interaction quantitatively using an estimator denoted α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref017">17</xref>]. This estimator is obtained from a quadratic regression applied to growth measurements as a function of different drug proportions of 2 drugs. The concentration of each of the single drugs is chosen to fall onto the line of equal dose, in our case defined to inhibit 75% of growth (i.e., inhibitory concentration [IC] 75; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004356.t001">Table 1</xref>). The estimator α describes the shape of the resulting response in growth whereby positive values indicate synergism and negative values antagonism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This approach has two advantages: first, it provides a statistical framework for testing the significance of positive or negative α; and second, its inference is less laborious than alternative procedures, thus facilitating characterization of a larger number of drug interactions. Even though the approach was carefully evaluated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref017">17</xref>], we specifically validated its suitability for our model system. We compared the inferred α values for 8 selected combinations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s002">S2A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) to the corresponding results obtained with one of the commonly used alternative methods, based on Bliss independence and the checkerboard approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s016">S1 Data</xref> for a key to all datasets and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s017">S2 Data</xref>), as previously described for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref026">26</xref>]. This comparison demonstrated that α correlates significantly with the degree of synergy (<italic>S</italic>), irrespective of whether <italic>S</italic> is calculated from the average of all viable concentrations across a grid defined by the 2 drugs (AB<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = A<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> + B<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s002">S2B Fig</xref>) or from combinations for which the 2 individual drugs had the same level of inhibition (AB<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> for which IC50<sub>[A<italic>i</italic>]</sub> = IC50<sub>[B<italic>j</italic>]</sub>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). We thus conclude that the α estimator provides an informative, quantitative indicator of a 2-drug interaction.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic representation, adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref017">17</xref>], of the principle underlying the drug proportion parameter θ (line of equal dose; dashed lines), which is subsequently used to determine drug interactions, in comparison to different shapes of isobolograms (solid lines), as observed in synergistic (in red; top panel) or antagonistic (in blue; bottom panel) interactions. (B) Schematic illustration of the different interaction types as a function of the drug proportion parameter θ, ranging from synergism to antagonism. Drugs are combined in 9 different proportions (<italic>n</italic> = 9 for each combination), with each drug alone set to inhibit 75% of growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). After a fixed time (12 h), bacterial growth is measured, and a quadratic model is used to fit the observed data. The α test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref017">17</xref>] was used to determine significance of synergism or antagonism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s012">S1 Table</xref>). (C) The α parameter was inferred from measured data to reconstruct a drug interaction network including 52 different antibiotic combinations. Combinations were formed from 12 different drugs, here represented as the nodes of the network, spanning 5 different antibiotic classes (see outer ring). The drug interaction profile is shown through the links (lines) formed between the nodes, and its strength is highlighted by the thickness of the lines and color. Red, black, and blue lines correspond to synergistic, additive, or antagonistic interactions, respectively (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

<p>We subsequently evaluated the interactions among 12 different antibiotics representing 5 classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004356.t001">Table 1</xref>). We chose these drugs as representatives of the main classes of antibiotics, which are commonly used in combination to treat <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and to which most clinical <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> strains are still susceptible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref029">29</xref>]. Even though this choice could have introduced a bias in the overall pattern of inferred interaction types, these should nevertheless be representative of the clinically applied drug combinations. We characterized drug interactions for almost all of the possible combinations, resulting in a total of 52 measures that we summarized in an interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s012">S1 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s018">S3 Data</xref>). Overall, synergistic combinations were more common than other interaction types (synergistic = 24/52; additive = 14/52; and antagonistic = 14/52). Combinations between cell wall inhibitors (β-lactams) and aminoglycosides most often produced synergisms, whereas those including ciprofloxacin (CIP) had exclusively antagonistic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>ACE networks demonstrate substantial variation in the effect of combinations on adaptation rates and population extinction</title>

FCR ranges from 0 to 1, such that 0 indicates that all populations (12–20 populations per combination) were sensitive to the corresponding other drug, thus having complete reciprocal sensitivity, whereas 1 highlights that none of the populations with resistance to one of the antibiotics in a pair suffered exacerbated sensitivity against the other. For the graphical illustration, we divided the combinations into 4 groups: complete collateral sensitivity (FCR ≤ 0.25; dark purple lines), partial collateral sensitivity (0.25 &lt; FCR ≤ 0.5; light dashed pink lines), partial cross-resistance (0.5 &lt; FCR &lt; 0.75; light green dashed lines), and complete cross-resistance (FCR ≥ 0.75; dark green lines).

<p>Based on this choice of drugs, we evolved a total of 1,672 populations through serial transfers into fresh media containing the respective antibiotics using a transfer period of 12 h and a total of 10 transfers (total duration of 120 h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s019">S4 Data</xref>).

<p>We reconstructed the 2 ACE networks based either on adaptation rates of the surviving populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) or on population extinctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Below, we first describe the patterns seen in the ACE networks, while their statistical analysis is explained in the next section. In all cases but one (for carbenicillin [CAR] plus gentamicin [GEN], all populations went extinct), adaptation to the combination treatment was possible. However, the rates of adaptation varied substantially across the different drug combinations, with lower rates of adaptation (below the 50th quantile) predominantly, but not exclusively, seen among antagonistic combinations that included CIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s008">S8 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s009">S9 Fig</xref> show separate ACE networks for each drug interaction type and the 2 types of evolved collateral effects, respectively). Several synergistic drug pairs, combining an aminoglycoside with either a penicillin or carbapenem, led to similarly low rates of adaptation (below the 50th quantile, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Moreover, almost all cases of collateral sensitivity included in this study were associated with reduced adaptation rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). This was not the case for combinations with cross-resistance. Furthermore, when estimating clearance efficacy, we found that extinctions almost exclusively occurred with the synergistic combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). The synergistic combinations that did select for lower rates of adaptation did not necessarily have higher rates of extinction and vice versa (populations surviving synergistic combinations were not necessarily adapting more slowly; see azlocillin [AZL] plus streptomycin [STR], cefsulodin [CEF] plus CAR, or ticarcillin [TIC] plus GEN; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical ACE network analysis reveals complementary roles for synergism and collateral sensitivity in treatment efficacy</title>
<p>We next performed 2 types of statistical analyses to assess to what extent the overall characteristics of the 2 ACE networks are determined by the 2 considered predictors of combination efficacy: interaction type inferred from α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and collateral sensitivity profiles previously obtained from experimentally evolved resistant populations of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g002">Fig 2</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref030">30</xref>]). We first used a BN approach to assess the relationships among the considered variables (i.e., adaptation rate, extinction frequency, drug interaction, and frequency of collateral resistances [FCR]). The BN approach is based on a constraint-based interleaved incremental association algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref033">33</xref>] to dissect the relationships between our variables (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref> for details). The results are summarized in the BN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), in which nodes represent the different variables and arrows indicate the inferred dependencies. The BN analysis revealed that the type of antibiotic interaction strongly influenced the proportion of extinction, but not the rate of adaptation. Instead, the rate of adaptation was found to depend solely on the frequency of collateral sensitivities. No other dependency was inferred by the analysis.</p>

<p>Based on the BN structure, we calculated the conditional probabilities for the inferred dependencies between the frequencies of collateral sensitivity and the rates of adaptation as well as for the proportion of extinction and drug interaction type. In particular, we used the different types of evolved collateral effects (i.e., partial collateral sensitivity, partial cross-resistance, and cross-resistance; none of the combinations evaluated during evolution had complete collateral sensitivity between their components, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and calculated the conditional probability of obtaining the distribution of observed adaptation rates across 5 equal quantile bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, top panel). Similarly, given the different drug interaction types (synergism, additivity, and antagonism), we calculated the conditional probabilities of different extinction frequencies across 5 equal quantile bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, bottom panel). These 2 additional analyses describe more clearly the inferred dependencies within the BN. Antibiotic combinations for which at least half of the populations had collateral sensitivity against one or both of the individual drug components (i.e., partial collateral sensitivity; purple bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, top panel) have a higher probability of selecting for low but not high rates of adaptation. Conversely, combinations with partial or complete cross-resistance (green bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, top panel) have a higher probability of producing the top scores of inferred adaptation rates. In addition, high probabilities of extinction are associated with synergistic and additive combinations, whereas the reverse is found for antagonistic drug pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, bottom panel).</p>
<p>We further validated the inferred dependencies between variables using partial correlation analysis, following the approach previously established for a similar analysis of combination efficacy in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>]. This approach allowed us to control for drug pair membership using the average rate of adaptation towards the corresponding single drugs of a particular combination as a covariate (Materials and methods). Statistical significance was subsequently inferred using a permutation test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>]. This analysis revealed a significant correlation between the FCR and the rate of adaptation (ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.52, <italic>P =</italic> 0.038) and between the proportion of extinction and the drug interaction type α (ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.51, <italic>P =</italic> 0.043), but not between the FCR and the proportion of extinction (ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.39, <italic>P =</italic> 0.146) or the drug interaction α and the rate of adaptation (ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.3, <italic>P =</italic> 0.262). This analysis, based on a distinct statistical approach, thereby corroborated the findings of the BN analysis. We conclude that synergistic drug interactions enhance bacterial clearance, whereas collateral sensitivity limits the adaptive potential of the bacteria.</p>

<title>Adaptation to the strongest component influences adaptation to multidrug environments</title>
<p>We next assessed whether the ability of bacteria to adapt to the combination is mainly driven by adaptation to only one of the drugs rather than dependent on a unique property of the antibiotic pair. For our dataset, we related the inferred rates of adaptation in the combination treatments to those inferred for the corresponding single-drug environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). We first compared the 2 corresponding monotherapies of a given drug pair and defined the drug leading to lower rates of adaptation as the stronger component (i.e., higher ability to minimize resistance evolution) and the other as the weaker component (i.e., lower ability to minimize resistance evolution). Thereafter, we calculated the relative rate of adaptation of the combination by standardizing it against either the stronger or the weaker component of the pair. The resulting ACE networks are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>, respectively. Interestingly, the original ACE network for adaptation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) is more similar to that standardized by the weaker but not the stronger component drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g006">Fig 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s013">S2 Table</xref>). This suggests that the characteristics of the original ACE network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), and thus the efficacy of drug combinations to reduce adaptation rates, is primarily driven by adaptation to the stronger component, which—if accounted for by the standardizing scheme—removes important properties of the network (see as prominent examples the disappearance of the strong reduction in adaptation rate for doripenem [DOR] plus TIC, or DOR plus PIT [piperacillin + tazobactam]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>We assessed to what extent adaptation to one of the drugs of a pair determined the overall rate of adaptation to the combination treatment. The stronger component drug of each pair was identified as the one with lower adaptation rates in monotherapy. We subsequently standardized the adaptation rates towards the combination by those towards either (A) the stronger or (B) the weaker component drug, resulting in 2 weighted ACE networks. Orange thick lines indicate slower adaptation, while grey thin bands denote fast adaptation. (C) Results of the BN analysis on the original network versus the 2 standardized networks.

<p>We further evaluated influence of the component drugs by repetition of the BN analysis. We found that the dependency observed between the FCR and the rates of adaptation of the combinations disappeared when the latter is weighted by the stronger but not the weaker component drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). At the same time, the dependency between drug interaction and extinction frequency remained, while no additional relationship was revealed. Similar results were obtained when we repeated the correlation analysis with standardized adaptation rates. The originally identified correlation between the FCR and the rate of adaptation was no longer significant when the latter was standardized by adaptation to the stronger component drug (ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.33, <italic>P =</italic> 0.21), yet it still showed a statistical trend when we standardized by the weaker component drug (ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.45, <italic>P =</italic> 0.078). In these 2 analyses, drug interaction did not correlate significantly with the weighted adaptation rates (ρ<sub>s</sub> &lt; 0.47, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.09). These results consistently indicate that adaptation to the stronger component drug influences adaptation to the combination and that this is dependent on the evolved collateral effects.</p>

<title>Initial inhibition levels correlate with adaptation rates, while extinction events are almost exclusively restricted to synergistic combinations</title>
<p>We next performed a separate evolution experiment with 4 selected combinations to assess to what extent the inherently different starting levels of inhibition—imposed by each type of interaction during the first season of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s003">S3 Fig</xref>)—influenced both the number of extinctions and adaptation rates. We performed this evolution experiment with 4 selected combinations with different interaction profiles: 2 interacting synergistically (GEN plus CAR and STR plus PIT) and 2 antagonistically (GEN plus CIP and Tobramycin [TOB] plus CIP). For these combinations, we varied the initial inhibition level of the combination across 8 steps, ranging from IC50 to &gt;IC90. Populations were serially transferred into fresh media as explained before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s020">S5 Data</xref>; and for the obtained changes in growth rate <italic>r</italic>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s011">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>This separate evolution experiment revealed that initial inhibitory levels of the tested combinations are significantly related to the rates of adaptation, irrespective of combination identity or drug interaction type (GLM, F<sub>1,336</sub> = 37.735, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s014">S3 Table</xref>). In particular, increasing levels of inhibition are generally associated with higher rates of adaptation, suggesting that strong inhibition increases selection for an adaptive response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref035">35</xref>]. At higher levels of inhibition, the synergistic and antagonistic combinations produce clearly distinct responses, especially regarding population extinction. Here, the 2 synergistic pairs are associated with a significant increase in the number of extinct populations (logistic regression, <italic>F</italic><sub>12,336</sub> = 21.15, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g007">Fig 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s015">S4 Table</xref>), while antagonistic combinations produced almost no extinction at all. Moreover, at the very high initial inhibitory levels, antagonistic pairs showed a sudden drop in adaptation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), as expected from previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref024">24</xref>]. A similarly strong reduction is not observed for the synergistic combinations, possibly owing to the fact that only few populations survived and could be used to infer adaptation rates.</p>

<title>Influence of the initial inhibition level on adaptation rate and population extinction.</title>
<p>In a separate round of evolution experiments, we evaluated the consequences of the initial inhibition levels in synergistic and antagonistic combinations. The experiment was performed following the protocol of the main evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), with the exception that the starting doses of the combinations were fixed at different levels of inhibition for the combinations. (A) Inferred rates of adaptation as a function of initial inhibitory levels. We determined initial inhibition by measuring in the first season of the evolution experiment the AUC of growth over time (measured as OD as a proxy) for each replicate population and then standardized it against the average AUC of the no-drug control (x-axis, AUCi). The rate of adaptation (y-axis) was inferred as for the main evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g003">Fig 3</xref>). (B) Extinction was significantly more often observed in synergistic rather than antagonistic combinations, even at the same level of inhibition (results for logistic regression analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s015">S4 Table</xref>). Adaptation rates and extinction frequencies are inferred from growth characteristics during experimental evolution, provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s020">S5 Data</xref>.

<p>Taken together, the results from this separate evolution experiment suggest that the generally higher inhibition levels of the synergistic pairs in our main evolution experiment could potentially have contributed to higher adaptation rates for this type of combination (even though these were not found to be significantly increased compared to those for other interaction types; see above). This seems less likely the case for extinction events, which are generally more frequent in treatments with synergistic rather than antagonistic combinations, irrespective of the initial inhibition level.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study provides a systematic experimental analysis of the efficacy of antibiotic combination therapy in the opportunistic human pathogen <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. Based on evolution experiments with 38 distinct combinations, ACE networks were reconstructed for 2 complementary measures of treatment efficacy: the frequency of population extinctions and the reduction in adaptation rates. Subsequent statistical analyses identified the likely ACE determinants: Synergistic drug interactions enhanced the frequency of extinction, even at the same inhibitory level as antagonistic interactions, while reduced adaptation rates depended on the evolved collateral sensitivities among the drugs. The latter effect is likely driven by adaptation to the stronger component drug in a pair. Consequently, our findings suggest that treatment efficacy against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> can be optimized by drug combinations, which interact synergistically to increase bacterial clearance and which can evolve collateral sensitivity to each other to slow down the rate of adaptation.</p>
<p>The use of BN analysis enhanced dissection of the determinants of ACE. The BN approach has been widely applied across different fields of biology in recent years but not yet in studies on antibiotic resistance evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref039">39</xref>]. Its accessible graphical output and the underlying probabilistic theory facilitate the inference of causal relationships between different variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref032">32</xref>]. It further offers estimation of conditional probabilities that reflect the strength of the inferred dependencies; a strategy well suited for the stochastic nature of biological systems and their measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref040">40</xref>]. The latter is important for the analysis of antibiotic resistance evolution, for which we are mainly interested in anticipating bacterial adaptation based on distinct drug properties or deployment strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref043">43</xref>]. The suitability of the BN approach for analysis of drug resistance evolution was corroborated with a previously established statistical approach, based on partial correlation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>], which identified a significant relationship for the same pairs of variables.</p>
<p>Our analyses consistently revealed that synergistic drug interactions are an important ACE determinant, especially in terms of bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The particular importance of bacterial elimination as a component of treatment efficacy was previously considered in a mathematical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref025">25</xref>] but has not yet been evaluated empirically. The previous model assessed the effect of antibiotic interactions on treatment efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref025">25</xref>] by modifying a previous infection model based on data from mice infected with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref044">44</xref>]. The model is related to the design of our main evolution experiment in that the concentration of a particular drug in a combination is standardized by its inhibitory effect in monotherapy. The model predicted contrasting treatment outcomes for synergistic combinations: On the one hand, synergism enhances extinction, most likely because it strongly reduces population size, thereby decreasing the likelihood of new resistance mutations arising. On the other hand, if resistance emerges, synergism increases the selective advantage of the resistant mutants through competitive release, enhancing bacterial adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref025">25</xref>]. Our experimental results are consistent with both alternatives. Although synergism mainly favored bacterial extinction (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g007">7</xref>), it was in several cases associated with low adaptation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, in our study, the effect of drug interaction on adaptation rate was always insignificant, irrespective of the analytical approach.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found higher population extinction for synergistic rather than antagonistic combinations also at low initial inhibitory concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This finding cannot have resulted from the stronger reduction in population size (i.e., inhibitory levels were the same for the 2 interaction types) but must have depended on other properties of the synergistic drug pairs. A likely explanation may be found in the mechanism underlying synergism, which can rely on increased membrane permeability induced by one of the drugs, subsequently enhancing cellular uptake of the second drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref045">45</xref>]. Such mechanisms may have a cumulative effect across time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref045">45</xref>] and/or may generally be difficult to counter. This, in turn, limits the number of suitable resistance mutations and ultimately increases the likelihood of extinction. A detailed exploration of this effect clearly warrants further research.</p>
<p>Our experiments further identified the potential to evolve collateral sensitivity as a key determinant of low adaptation rates. This result is generally consistent with previous work on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref047">47</xref>], although this is the first time it has been shown for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. Adaptation rates are thus significantly influenced by evolutionary trade-offs, whereby adaptation to one of the drugs of a pair constrains adaptation to the other. Our findings and those of colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref047">47</xref>] thereby highlight that such trade-offs may not only improve treatment when drugs are applied sequentially, as originally proposed for evolved collateral sensitivities in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (i.e., collateral sensitivity cycling; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref022">22</xref>]). Instead, they can also optimize combination therapy. Our analysis further revealed that the involved dynamics are likely driven by adaptation to the stronger component drug of a pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This suggests that, if adaptation to the stronger component comes with a higher likelihood of collateral sensitivity to the second drug, adaptation to the combination is systematically slowed down, as, for example, for CIP plus STR or CIP plus CAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In contrast, when adaptation to the stronger drug is more likely to cause cross-resistance, then this can enhance adaptation to the combination, as seen for GEN plus STR or CAR plus CEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The further exploration of these trade-offs represents a promising avenue to improve treatment efficacy.</p>
<p>Our finding of the high clearance efficacy of synergistic combinations shows some consistency with clinical practice. For <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, we predominantly observed drug synergism between β-lactams and aminoglycosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These 2 antibiotic classes are also most commonly used in combination therapy against this pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref049">49</xref>]. Our results empirically confirm the potency of the β-lactam–aminoglycoside combinations, especially penicillin–aminoglycoside pairs, in causing higher numbers of extinct replicate populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). In some cases, the populations surviving these specific combinations also adapted more slowly (e.g., STR plus PIT or TIC plus TOB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the effectiveness of these combinations may not only be caused by drug synergism but additionally by reciprocal collateral sensitivity that can evolve among these pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref030">30</xref>]. Our systematic analysis performed under controlled laboratory conditions thus provides empirical support for the often experience-driven choice in clinical treatment. In the future, the clinical applicability of our results should be further explored. For example, we identified high clearance efficacy of certain combinations of penicillins and cephalosporins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) or low adaptation rates if fluoroquinolones (e.g., CIP) were combined with aminoglycosides or penicillins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). It would be of particular interest to corroborate these patterns for clinical isolates in laboratory experiments or under clinical conditions.</p>
<p>In summary, our systematic analysis of antibiotic combinations identified the role of drug interactions and evolved collateral effects in determining 2 complementary properties of treatment efficacy. The comprehensive dataset collected in our study may serve as a useful reference for further exploration of effective therapy, including more detailed statistical analyses such as those that use the potency of pairwise interactions to estimate higher-order drug effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref051">51</xref>]. Our approach and the specific results obtained may, moreover, help to improve the design of medical treatment with the 2-fold aim of minimizing pathogen burden and reducing resistance evolution. A similar combined assessment of the efficacy of drug interaction and evolved collateral effects may not only be applicable to other pathogens and infectious diseases. It could similarly help to improve cancer therapy, as previously evaluated for selected cancer types and drug interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref055">55</xref>].</p>

<title>Drug combinations and interaction profile</title>
<p>To classify the interaction between 2 drugs, we considered an environment in which each drug separately inhibits 75% ± 10% of bacterial growth (IC75). For each combination, we evaluated 11 treatments: 9 different proportions of a given pair of antibiotics, a control of uninhibited growth, and a control with only M9 medium. Nine replicates for all treatments were considered, except for the M9 control that consisted of only 6 wells. This resulted in 81 replicates per drug combination and 4,212 for all 52 antibiotic pairs. OD measurements were taken every 15 min for 12 h, resulting in a total of 48 data points per individual replicate and 202,176 for all combinations and replicates.</p>

<title>Experimental evolution of antibiotic combinations</title>
<p>Based on the interaction profile and the collateral sensitivity and/or resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref030">30</xref>] scores, we selected a total of 38 different combinations for a series of evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). For all combinations, we included 5 different proportions of the combined antibiotics, an uninhibited control, and an M9 control, resulting in 44 populations per combination, randomly distributed in a 96-well plate (2 combinations were included in a single plate), for a total of 1,672 populations. The concentration was set for each individual drug to inhibit bacterial growth by 75% (IC75). We considered 10 transfers (hereafter referred to as seasons) of 1% volume into fresh plates every 12 h (approximately 120 generations). For each season, OD<sub>600</sub> measurements were taken every 15 min, resulting in 48 measurements per replicate and season and a total of 781,440 measurements across all replicate populations. All plates were frozen at −80 <bold>°</bold>C with 1:4 (v/v) of 86% glycerol.</p>
<p>To validate our OD measurements as a proxy for bacterial growth during evolution, we replicated the conditions of the first season for 4 selected combinations (only the 1:1 proportion), 6 corresponding single-drug treatments, and a no-drug control. We focused on those combinations and the corresponding monotherapies for which we also evaluated the influence of initial drug inhibitory level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g007">Fig 7</xref>) and the evolution of resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Each treatment was replicated 8 times. After 12 h of evolution, we performed a dilution series and standard plating techniques to count viable colony-forming units (CFUs) for all replicates and treatments. The obtained CFUs were then correlated with the endpoint OD measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We found a significant correlation between our OD measurements and the CFU counts at the end of season 1 (Spearman rank correlation test, ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.782, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). To further validate the OD measurements, we performed a similar correlation analysis for the same combinations and corresponding monotherapies, using evolved bacteria from the final transfer of the separate, focused evolution experiment, in which the influence of initial drug inhibitory levels was assessed. The evolved material was thawed from the frozen stock cultures, then exposed to 1 full season of experimental evolution under the exact treatment conditions already experienced by populations during the evolution experiment. Thereafter, CFUs were counted using a dilution series on Agar plates, as outlined above, and then compared to the OD measures obtained during the above repetition of a full season. As before, CFUs were significantly correlated with the corresponding OD measurements (Spearman rank correlation test, ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.339, <italic>P =</italic> 0.002).</p>
<p>We further validated the suitability of changes in growth characteristics as a proxy for evolutionary adaptation and therefore genetically fixed alterations by re-assessing cryo-preserved material from the last transfer of experimental evolution.

<p>To determine to what extent adaptation to the drug combinations was determined by adaptation to each of the individual drugs, we measured which of the individual components in a drug pair led to lower and higher rates of adaptation. The single antibiotic in a pair that alone led to lower rates of adaptation was considered as the stronger of the components and the other as the weaker one. The adaptation rate of each combination was then standardized by the adaptation rate of either its weaker or stronger component drug. The 2 types of standardized adaptation rates were visualized in ACE networks and statistically evaluated (see below).</p>

To achieve this first step, the model first infers the graphical structure of the network by analyzing the probabilistic relations between all nodes and thereafter constructs the network by setting directions for the identified connections while satisfying an acyclicity constraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref058">58</xref>]. We implemented BN analysis employing a constraint-based interleaved incremental association–optimized algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref059">59</xref>] to reduce the likelihood of obtaining false positives and to obtain possible probabilistic dependencies between our variables: drug interaction type (categorical: synergism, additivity, or antagonism), FCR (categorical: complete collateral sensitivity, partial collateral sensitivity, partial cross-resistance, and complete cross-resistance), proportion of extinction (numerical), and rates of adaptation (numerical). We only included combinations with complete sets of data and then followed the algorithm’s default parameters. From the obtained dependencies, we estimated the conditional probabilities associated with the linked variables over an array of different values. All tests were performed in R using the “bnlearn” package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref060">60</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec018">
<title>Additional correlation and partial correlation analysis</title>
<p>To validate the inferred dependencies from the BN analysis, we additionally performed correlation analysis combined with permutation tests, following the approach previously established for a similar analysis of ACE in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>]. For each round of permutation, we calculated correlation coefficients, ρ<sub>s</sub>, between any two given variables x and y by permuting the values of x while keeping y constant, as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>]. For each test, we considered 10,000 permutations and estimated the <italic>P</italic> value as the proportion of the obtained distribution of correlation coefficients that had an absolute value larger than the absolute value obtained for the observed ρ<sub>s</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>]. This approach was used to correlate the measures of collateral effects and drug interaction to proportion of extinction and, later on, to the standardized adaptation rates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to account for the effect of adaptation to the single drugs (z) in the main analysis with nonstandardized adaptation rates, we performed a partial correlation analysis with z as a covariate, generally following the previously established approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>]. For this, we first obtained the residuals from the linear regression of x on z and those of y on z, such that y corresponds to the adaptation rates of the combination. Then, to estimate the correlation coefficient between x and y, with z as a covariate, we employed the permutation test as explained above using the residuals of the corresponding regressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004356.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

<title>Experimental evolution with fixed inhibitory levels of antibiotic combinations</title>
<p>To evaluate the effect of the starting inhibition level of the combinations, we considered a second round of evolution experiments as described above. This time, the level of inhibition of the combination was fixed instead of that of the individual drug treatments. Briefly, concentrations of each drug were mixed 1:1 so that each would inhibit between 50% and 75% of growth. These were then diluted to obtain a range of different inhibition levels and to evaluate their effect on growth in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> after 12 h of incubation at 37 °C. Evolution experiments were then initiated for 4 different combinations that included 11 different treatments: a no-drug control, the individual monotherapies, and 8 different inhibition levels ranging from approximately IC50 to &gt;IC90 of each combination. Each treatment was replicated 8 times and distributed randomly in 96-well plates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec020">
<title>Genetically fixed changes in growth characteristics</title>
<p>We used the focused set-up of the above separate evolution experiment to validate the suitability of growth measurements as a proxy for evolutionary adaptation. Evolutionary adaptation assumes that changes are genetically fixed rather than due to phenotypic (i.e., physiological) responses. To assess this, we studied cryo-preserved material from the last drug-free season of the evolution experiment and regrew them under defined antibiotic conditions. Purely phenotypic adaptations to antibiotics are unlikely to have persisted for this material, which was grown under antibiotic-free conditions for 12 to 16 h (equivalent to a minimum of 6 generations) and additionally subjected to a cryo-preservation step. Therefore, any persistent changes in growth characteristics under antibiotic exposure are likely based on genetic changes and thus indicate evolutionary adaptation.</p>
<p>For this analysis, we considered material evolved in the presence of 2 synergistic (i.e., GEN plus CAR and STR plus PIT) or 2 antagonistic combinations (i.e, CIP plus GEN and CIP plus TOB), in all cases set to either IC50 or &gt;IC90, and also included material from the corresponding monotherapies. A total of 4 replicate populations was studied for each of the various evolution treatments and compared to the ancestral PA14. Changes in growth characteristics were inferred from dose-response curves in a 2-fold dilution series of each of the antibiotics included in the pair. The evolved relative changes in resistance were calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) of the dose-response curve for each of the populations and then divided by that of the ancestral PA14. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s005">S5 Fig</xref>. They highlight a general increase in growth characteristics and thus resistance across the various treatment groups even if not significant in all cases (based on a 1-sample Wilcoxon test with μ = 1). We conclude that, overall, the observed changes in growth characteristics have a genetic basis and are not exclusively due to phenotypic responses. Therefore, we consider the recorded changes in growth characteristics to provide a meaningful proxy for evolutionary adaptation.</p>

<title>Validation of OD as a proxy for bacterial growth in the presence of antibiotics.</title>
<p>We used the ancestral PA14 strain to replicate the first season of evolution for 6 selected single-drug treatments, 4 corresponding antibiotic combinations, and a no-drug control (shown in the different colors) in a single 96-well plate. Antibiotic concentrations were set to IC75 for the single-drug treatments, and for the drug pairs, each antibiotic was set to IC75 and then combined in a 1:1 ratio, thereby following the same set-up used for the main evolution experiment. For each treatment, we included 8 replicates. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h under continuous shaking. At the end of the incubation period, a sample from each well was taken, plated on LB agar plates, and incubated for 16 to 20 h at 37 °C to count the number of viable cells as CFUs. We found a significant correlation between the obtained CFU counts and the endpoint OD measurements (Spearman rank test, ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.782, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).

<title>Changes in resistance upon experimental evolution in selected populations.</title>
<p>We determined changes in resistance for selected populations from the separate evolution experiment with different initial drug inhibitory levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004356.g007">Fig 7</xref>) that included 4 different combinations: (A) GEN plus CAR, (B) STR plus PIT, (C) CIP plus GEN, and (D) TOB plus CIP. For each of these combinations, we tested 4 populations adapted to each of the single drugs, 4 populations adapted to the combinations set to IC50, 4 populations adapted to those set to &gt;IC90, and the ancestor PA14. All populations were from the final season with antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance was assessed with dose-response curves using 2-fold dilution series of each of the antibiotics included in the tested combination. Results are given as changes in resistance (for the changes in IC90, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004356.s013">S2 Table</xref>), calculated as the AUC for each evolved population relative to that of the ancestral PA14.
