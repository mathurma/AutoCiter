      <abstract>
         <p>Rapid conduction of nerve impulses requires coating of axons by myelin. To function as an electrical insulator, myelin is generated as a tightly packed, lipid-rich multilayered membrane sheath. Knowledge about the mechanisms that govern myelin membrane biogenesis is required to understand myelin disassembly as it occurs in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Here, we show that myelin basic protein drives myelin biogenesis using weak forces arising from its inherent capacity to phase separate. The association of myelin basic protein molecules to the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer induces a phase transition into a cohesive mesh-like protein network. The formation of this protein network shares features with amyloid fibril formation. The process is driven by phenylalanine-mediated hydrophobic and amyloid-like interactions that provide the molecular basis for protein extrusion and myelin membrane zippering. These findings uncover a physicochemical mechanism of how a cytosolic protein regulates the morphology of a complex membrane architecture. These results provide a key mechanism in myelin membrane biogenesis with implications for disabling demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system.</p>

         <title>Author Summary</title>
         <p>Myelin is a specialized membrane that covers axons and serves as an insulator to enable the fast conduction of the action potentials. The importance of myelin membrane is highlighted in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, which lead to severe neurological disability. Here, we describe a physicochemical mechanism of how myelin is generated and assembled. We find that myelin basic protein (MBP) molecules undergo a phase transition into a cohesive meshwork at the membrane interface, which drives structural changes in the membranes. We provide evidence that the interaction of myelin basic proteins with the inner leaflet of the myelin bilayer results in charge neutralization and triggers self-association of the protein into larger polymers. Interactions between MBP molecules are mediated by hydrophobic phenylalanine residues and amyloid-like association. We propose that phase transition of MBP from a cytoplasmic soluble pool into a cohesive functional amyloid-like assembly is one of the key mechanisms in myelin membrane biogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Compartmentalization and spatial organization of molecules is essential to establish functionally specialized domains within a cell. Segregation of molecules can occur over several length scales ranging from the formation of complexes of few interacting molecules to the generation of micrometer-sized domains. Whereas structural biology has provided us with a wealth of knowledge of how specific molecular interactions occur within macromolecular complexes, little is known about the rules that drive segregation of molecules into large collectives. Phase separations, which constitute a well-recognized phenomenon in nonbiological system, are emerging as a powerful mechanism of how cells organize molecules over larger length scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Hyman1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-WeberStephanie1">[2]</xref>. One example is the formation of non-membrane-bound organelles within the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Brangwynne1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Kato1">[4]</xref>. Less is known about how phase separations structure lipid membranes. Here, we addressed this issue using myelin as a model membrane. Myelin is an insulating membrane of vital importance required for the fast conduction of action potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Emery1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Wu1">[9]</xref>. It is formed by oligodendrocytes that have the intrinsic capacity to wrap their plasma membrane multiple times around an axon to form a multilayered stack of compacted membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Lee1">[10]</xref>. The more loosely packed and structurally distinct paranodal loops are localized to the boundaries of compacted myelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Poliak1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Salzer1">[12]</xref>. One striking feature of compacted myelin is its unusual molecular composition. Even if myelin is continuous with the plasma membrane, its composition is very different. Around 78% of its dry weight are lipids, whereas only few proteins reside within compacted myelin of which myelin basic protein (MBP) is one of the two most abundant proteins. Its remarkable features include the intrinsically disordered polypeptide chain and the strong basic character with a charge of +20 at physiological pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Boggs1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Harauz2">[15]</xref>. One essential function of MBP is to bring the opposing cytoplasmic surfaces of the myelin membrane closely together <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Roach1">[16]</xref>. Within the cytoplasmic space MBP forms a size-selective barrier, which prevents the diffusion of most soluble and membrane proteins into the myelin sheath <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Aggarwal2">[17]</xref>. Here, we address the underlying principles of MBP assembly. We provide evidence that a phase transition into cohesive functional amyloid-like assemblies is one of the key mechanisms in myelin membrane biogenesis in the central nervous system. We propose that this phase transition is essential for protein and cytosol extrusion, and the control of myelin membrane zippering.</p>

         <title>MBP Drives Protein Extrusion from Membrane Sheets</title>
         <p>We have previously shown that most soluble and membrane proteins are excluded from myelin and MBP plays a role in this exclusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Aggarwal2">[17]</xref>. However, it is unclear how MBP forms such a size-selective barrier. To address this issue, we employed primary cultures of oligodendrocytes that polarise their plasma membrane into large, flat myelin membrane sheets and tubular processes. The molecular composition of myelin membrane sheets is very similar to in vivo compacted myelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Aggarwal2">[17]</xref>. To analyze the segregation of proteins from myelin membrane sheets, we followed the distribution of two proteins that are excluded from compacted myelin: the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a transmembrane protein, and 2′3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), a peripheral membrane protein. Surprisingly, sheet formation did not immediately trigger protein segregation. First, sheets formed, in which CNPase and MAG were uniformly distributed. Only later, at a time when MBP appeared and accumulated in multiple distinct regions within the sheets, was the exclusion of CNPase and MAG observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Next, we analysed the distribution of CNPase within myelin sheaths by immunoelectron microcopy in cryosections of optic nerves derived from postnatal day 14 (P14) and 21 mice in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that CNPase was distributed homogenously within the myelin lamellae at early stages of myelination, but with the compaction of myelin bilayer at P21, it was mainly restricted to the adaxonal region. These data suggest that proteins are extruded from the myelin sheath and thus raise the question concerning the underlying mechanisms.</p>

         <title>Oligomerization of MBP</title>
         <p>One possibility is that upon membrane binding, MBP polymerizes into a protein meshwork thereby squeezing other proteins out of the cytocortex. Indeed using a chemical cross-linking approach, we found that MBP forms large oligomeric complexes in primary oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To further validate these findings, we used photobleaching and photoconversion experiments to determine the diffusional mobility of MBP molecules. Since soluble MBP lost its function after fusion with a GFP (unpublished data), we designed a chimeric construct (MBP fused to the cytoplasmic domain of an integral membrane protein and containing a GFP in the N-terminus; see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) to be able to perform live experiments. The functionality of the chimeric protein was shown in primary oligodendrocytes prepared from <italic>shiverer</italic> mice lacking MBP, where it rescued the function of wild-type MBP in extruding CNPase from the membrane sheets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). Since the chimeric protein is transported through the biosynthetic pathway, in contrast to wild-type MBP, it also localizes to the processes and cell body of the oligodendrocyte. Consistent with MBP forming high-order oligomers, the diffusional mobility of the chimeric construct was dramatically decreased when MBP was present at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g002">Figure 2B–F</xref>).</p>

         <title>Reconstitution of Protein Extrusion</title>
         <p>If a network of cross-linked MBP molecules drives protein extrusion, mutant forms of MBP with impaired ability to self-associate should be nonfunctional. To obtain a rapid screening system, we analyzed whether the function of MBP could be analyzed in PtK2 cells, an epithelial cell line with flat morphology. When we expressed MBP as a chimeric construct (GFP-TM-MBP), micrometer-sized patches of MBP appeared and protein extrusion was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g001">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Surprisingly, surface staining revealed that GFP-TM-MBP generated these patches from intracellular membrane sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Co-labelling with the live-ER stain, ER-Tracker red, showed that GFP-TM-MBP was retained in the ER and formed domains at the ER-plasma membrane interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). When an ER-retention signal was added to GFP-TM-MBP, patches of similar morphology were generated, confirming that domain formation occurred from the ER (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). Domain formation was independent of the choice of the transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Next, we studied protein extrusion, which we could demonstrate in a series of different experiments. First, MAG and several other proteins with large cytoplasmic domains (PLP-GFP, CD9-GFP, CD81-GFP, MOG-GFP, and GFP-MAG) were extruded from the plasma membrane where MBP-patches formed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). Second and consistent with size-dependent protein extrusion, serial truncations of Tmem10 revealed that a size limit of more than 20 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain results in exclusion from the patches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). Finally, most glycoproteins were extruded from the surface of the cells in areas where MBP-positive domains appeared as demonstrated by staining with the lectins, concanvalin A (ConA), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>).</p>
         <p>The reversibility of protein displacement was shown by treating cells with ionomycin and sphingosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Alexander1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Yeung1">[19]</xref> to antagonize the electrostatic interactions of MBP with the plasma membrane (). Live imaging experiments with photobleaching and photoconversion revealed the cohesive nature of MBP domains as observed in primary oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g002">Figure 2G–K</xref>). In addition, when GFP-TM-MBP was imaged together with WGA, WGA-positive domains were sometimes observed within a MBP-positive domain, but were extruded with time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). Although domains usually remained separated, occasionally domain fusion was observed. Thus, MBP-mediated connection of the ER to the plasma membrane results in protein extrusion and generates micrometer-sized, cohesive, protein-poor domains that resemble compacted myelin in its protein composition.</p>

         <title>Self-Association of MBP Molecules Via Hydrophobic Interactions Is Required for Its Function</title>
         <p>Having established a simple assay system, we next probed for mutant forms of MBP with impaired ability to self-associate. Since the analysis of serial truncations mutants of MBP was uninformative (unpublished data), we assumed that the interactions may not be based on simple globular protein modules, but rather depend on multiple weak interactions typical of disordered protein domains. Recently, evidence has been provided that disordered protein domains play a role in phase transitions of proteins into cohesive hydrogels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Kato1">[4]</xref>. One prominent example is the nuclear pore proteins that contain FG-repeats, which are natively unfolded and serve as self-association domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Frey1">[20]</xref>. Thus, we created a mCherry-TM fusion construct of MBP, in which the hydrophobic phenylalanine residues had been exchanged to serines. When expressed in PtK2 cells, the protein localized to the ER in tubular structures, but in contrast to the wild-type fusion protein, domain formation was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Similar results were observed when the phenylalanines were exchanged to glycines, but not to the more hydrophobic isoleucines. The effect on domain formation was intermediate with tyrosine substitutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

         <p>One trivial explanation of these results could be the inability of these mutants to bind to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. This possibility was ruled out by a number of independent approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g003">Figure 3C–E</xref>). First, when wild-type and F→S MBP were expressed in cells, both proteins were found at the plasma membrane to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Second, purified recombinant F→S and wild-type MBP protein molecules bound to supported-lipid bilayers (with the inner myelin lipid composition) uniformly and could not be washed away as revealed by antibody staining against MBP molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Third, both proteins were able to pull-down liposomes (with inner myelin lipid composition) to the same extent, in contrast to recombinant GFP used as a control protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
         <p>We next examined the ability of the mutant MBP molecules to self-associate. A FRET assay using GFP-Tm10-MBP as a donor and mCherry-GypTM-MBP (Tm10 represents transmembrane domain of Tmem10 and GyPTM represents monomeric transmembrane domain derived from the glycophorin) as an acceptor revealed much higher FRET ratios between the wild-type MBP fusion proteins in comparison to the F→S mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, we measured interaction forces between MBP molecules located on a mica surface and the tip of a cantilever using atomic force microscopy as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Mueller1">[21]</xref>. The force versus distance measurements revealed dramatic differences when the F→S mutant was compared to wild-type MBP, in agreement with our conclusion that mutant MBP had lost its ability to self-associate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The functional consequences of impaired self-association were studied by a number of different assays. First, we employed a biomimetic model system, which examines the interaction of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) coated with MBP. In this system, MBP is sandwiched between a SLB and GUVs where it induces the spreading of GUVs onto the SLB. When the F→S mutant was analyzed, we observed that the mutant promoted the tethering of GUVs to the SLBs, but it was significantly less efficient in inducing the bursting and spreading of GUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). Next, we expressed soluble MBP and the F→S mutant in <italic>shiverer</italic> mice in vivo and in oligodendrocytes prepared from <italic>shiverer</italic> mice in vitro by using recombinant AAV vectors carrying the MBP promoter as an expression system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Chen1">[22]</xref>. We observed that myelin in <italic>shiverer</italic> mice injected with recombinant AAV-wild-type MBP virus was partially compacted and with slightly more wraps as compared to AAV- F→S mutant MBP injected animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s009">Figure S9</xref>). In cell culture we could show that both wild-type MBP and the F→S mutant entered into the membrane sheets of <italic>shiverer</italic> cells, but only the wild-type MBP was able to extrude CNPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). When we compared the targeting of MBP and the F→S mutant into myelin membrane sheets of wild-type cells, we found that only wild-type MBP localized to the mature myelin membrane sheets of cultured oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s010">Figure S10A</xref>). Thus, it appears that phenylalanine-mediated hydrophobic interactions are not only important for the function of MBP, but also for the targeting into MBP-positive domains. To challenge this conclusion, we tested whether MBP and the F→S mutant were able to route proteins with large cytoplasmic domains piggyback into MBP-positive domains in PtK2 cells. The integral membrane protein Tm10C50 with a 50 amino acid large cytoplasmic domain, which prevents membrane sheet localization, was used as a reporter. Indeed, only when wild-type MBP was fused to the C-terminus of Tm10C50 was the size barrier overcome and localization to MBP-positive domains triggered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s010">Figure S10B</xref>). Thus, intermolecular MBP-mediated interactions may drive proteins into the domains. This conclusion was further substantiated using a rapamycin-inducible molecular bridging approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Inoue1">[23]</xref>. Using this system, it was possible to immobilize and bridge mCherry into MBP-positive ER-plasma membrane patches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s010">Figure S10C</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that hydrophobic phenylalanine-mediated interactions are required to form a cohesive mesh-like network of MBP molecules between the cytoplasmic leaflets of two opposing membranes. Small proteins appear to diffuse freely through the pores, whereas large proteins are extruded unless they are bound to the meshwork.</p>

         <title>Phase Transition of MBP</title>
         <p>One possible mechanism to explain how MBP functions in forming a semipermeable interface would be through a phase separation. Hence, we analyzed whether phase transition of purified MBP molecules could possibly be triggered in solution. For this, a pH shift was used as a strategy to mimic the in vivo charge neutralization by the negatively charged membranes. Strikingly, beyond a critical concentration, MBP formed a cloudy solution in 20 mM NaOH. Mixing resulted in the fragmentation of initially bicontinuous interconnected phases into µm-sized droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Atto-488–labelled MBP revealed enrichment of the protein in droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Gradually, coalescence of droplets into larger droplets was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Together, this behaviour is consistent with a demixing phase transition in fluid. The phase transition was reversible as the droplets rapidly dissolved upon pH neutralization. Importantly, the solution remained clear and no droplets were formed when similar experiments were performed with the F→S mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001577.s011">Figure S11</xref>). These results show that MBP possesses the inherent capacity for phase transitions, a process which is critically dependent on hydrophobic phenylalanine-mediated interactions. This surprising observation is in line with recent findings showing phase transitions of soluble proteins in the cytosol that are involved in germline P granule biogenesis, assembly of signalling complexes in the cytocortex, or of cohesive FG domains forming the permeability barrier of nuclear pores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Brangwynne1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Frey1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Li1">[24]</xref>.</p>

         <title>Amyloid-Like Assembly of MBP</title>
         <p>To analyze the underlying secondary structural changes occurring after the phase transition, we used attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). An increase in β-sheet structure of purified MBP was observed at basic pH, suggesting its involvement in self-assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Next, we compared the structural changes in wild-type MBP and the F→S mutant upon membrane interaction. As previously shown, MBP in solution displayed very low proportion of ordered secondary structure, but upon addition to the SLBs, the amount of α-helices and β-sheets increased immediately. In a striking contrast to the wild-type MBP, the F→S mutant exhibited α-helical, but only very little β-sheet structure in solution and, importantly, no increase in β-sheet structure was observed after the addition to the SLBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Computer algorithms that predict aggregation-prone regions in unfolded protein chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Belli1">[25]</xref> revealed two stretches within the MBP sequence that have a high β-aggregation propensity. Interestingly, both these stretches harbour a pair of phenylalanine residues that were replaced with serines in the F→S mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). β-sheet structures are not only a key feature of irreversible protein aggregates seen in the form of amyloid fibres in neurodegenerative diseases, but also of functional and reversible amyloid-like protein interactions sometimes found in normal tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Fowler1">[26]</xref>. We thus speculated that an amyloid-like aggregation process may underlie the self-assembly of MBP. We designed peptides containing the two aggregation-prone regions of MBP. Indeed, after a few days of incubation at 37°C, both peptides assembled into twisted-sheet-like and straight fibres as shown by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Similar results were obtained with full-length wild-type, but not the F→S mutant of MBP, when incubated for extended times (up to 3 wk) at 37°C under fibrillating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001577-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Previously, fluorescent dyes, which stain amyloids, have been shown to label the white matter in the sections of adult mice brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Stankoff1">[27]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Myelin is an essential and highly abundant membrane of the vertebrate brain. To obtain its insulting properties, most soluble and membrane proteins have to be depleted to generate a lipid-rich sheath. We find that one underlying mechanism is the phase transition of MBP molecules into a condensed network that drive protein segregation from the cytoplasmic leaflets of two opposing membranes. Hydrophobic phenylalanine-mediated interactions were required for the formation of the mesh-like network of MBP molecules. Small molecules appear to diffuse freely through the pores of the protein network, whereas larger proteins are extruded unless they are bound to MBP.</p>
      <p>What are the molecular properties that define such transitions? Whereas molecular interactions in macromolecular complexes depend on specific modular protein interfaces, which are often sensitive to singe point mutations, phase transition appears to follow different rules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Hyman2">[28]</xref>. One important feature appears to be the presence of multivalent interaction domains, which often contain low complexity sequences, a typical attribute of many intrinsically disordered proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Kato1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Li1">[24]</xref>. Thus, single point mutations are unlikely to disrupt the phase transition of proteins. A characteristic signature of some proteins undergoing phase separations are repeats of disordered protein domains containing the hydrophobic amino acid phenylalanine and the flexible amino acid glycine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Updike1">[29]</xref>. Consistent with this general conceptual framework, we find that MBP loses its intrinsic capacity for phase transitions after multiple phenylalanine mutations.</p>
      <p>Strikingly, several intrinsically disordered proteins have been implicated in the formation of pathological amyloid formation in neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Uversky1">[30]</xref>. Recently, evidence has been provided that many intrinsically disorder proteins with low complexity sequences have the capacity to form amyloid fibrils in phase-separating hydrogels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Kato1">[4]</xref>. Here, we show that self-assembly of MBP may also share some features with amyloid-like fibril formation. However, unlike classical pathological amyloid fibrils, which form extremely stable and rigid structures, amyloid-like interactions in physiological assemblies have weaker and reversible connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Fowler1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Chiti1">[31]</xref>. Such dynamic amyloid-like interactions have also been described for the permeability barrier of the nuclear pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Ader1">[32]</xref> and RNA granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Kato1">[4]</xref>. Amyloid-like interactions do not depend on specific motifs, but are often seen in structurally disordered protein domains and can even occur between single phenylalanine amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-AdlerAbramovich1">[33]</xref>. Another interesting example of reversible functional amyloid assemblies is the self-association of hormones in amyloid-like aggregates—a phase transition that is regulated by the low pH inside a vesicle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Maji1">[34]</xref>. Thus, the control of a phase transition represents a powerful mechanism to generate sharp transitions between physically and functionally distinct states of a pool of molecules. Here, we propose that the binding of MBP to two membrane surfaces triggers a phase-transition. The interaction to the negatively charged membrane may neutralize the positive charge in MBP and induce self-assembly by loss of electrostatic repulsion. Since phase transitions require critical concentrations of molecules, control of MBP expression level, which has recently been shown to depend on neurons, is likely to be relevant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-White1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Wake1">[37]</xref>. Thus, a phase transition of MBP might be coupled to neuronal activity in order to coordinate myelin assembly.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to compare the protein meshwork formed by MBP with the permeability barrier of the nuclear pore. FG-repeats of the nuclear pore proteins mediate the assembly of a dense protein meshwork forming a hydrogel-based barrier for nucleocytoplasmic transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Frey1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-HlsmannBastian1">[38]</xref>. Whereas small proteins diffuse freely through the pores of the barrier, larger proteins require the interaction with receptors to open and enter the meshwork. The barrier formed by MBP may also behave like a selective phase. We found that proteins with large cytoplasmic domains were excluded from protein extrusion when bound to the MBP meshwork. It is conceivable that tight interactions with MBP result in the trapping of proteins within the mesh, whereas proteins that do not interact are forced out of the myelin sheets. In the future it will be interesting to determine the precise structural and energetic requirements that determine whether proteins are recruited into, move through, or are expelled from the meshwork of MBP molecules.</p>
      <p>How do phase transitions contribute to the spatial organization of a cell? One example is the generation of non-membrane-bound compartments within the cytosol. Another possibility is that phase transition structure lipid membranes. Indeed, we are able to show that the phase transition of MBP alters membrane composition by propelling protein extrusion. At the same time, the formation of the condensed MBP fluid phase could drive a phase separation in the myelin membrane bilayer. By this means a phase transition in the cytosol may trigger a rearrangement and a condensation of membrane lipids in the forming myelin sheath. A phase transition of proteins impelling a segregation of membrane lipid is an attractive concept that can now be tested with the experimental system established in this study.</p>
      <p>In addition, our work may help to understand the mechanism of myelin disassembly in vascular or autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. A possibility that needs to be addressed in the future is whether a phase transition in the reverse direction induces breakdown and degradation of myelin in demyelinating diseases.</p>
      <p>In summary, our findings provide a physicochemical mechanism of how protein self-assembly can provide the forces for long-range segregations within the cytosol at the membrane interface. Such sharp phase transitions might be a general phenomenon of how cells employ physical principles for the compartmentalization of the cytosol ranging from the nuclear pore to germline P granule and the assembly of signalling complexes in the cytocortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Hyman1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Kato1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Frey1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Li1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001577-Ader1">[32]</xref>.</p>

The cells were also stained with fluorophore-conjugated concanavalin A (ConA) to visualize surface glycoproteins. While MBP F→S and F→A fail to form the domains, F→Y shows an intermediate phenotype with reduced tendency to form domains. In a striking contrast, F→I mutant forms domains similar to wild-type MBP.
