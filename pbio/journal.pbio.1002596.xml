<title>Mllt10/Af10 co-immunoprecipitates with Tcf4 in the mouse small intestinal crypt.</title>
<p>(A) Cell lysates from purified crypt fractions were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against endogenous Tcf4, β-catenin, and (B) Mllt10/Af10 as indicated and analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (C) Western blot analysis of mechanically fractionated crypt and villus from mouse small intestine using antibodies directed against a gene expressed specifically in the crypt (c-Myc), villus (Keratin 20), Tubulin as control, as well as Mllt10/Af10 and Dot1l. (D) Mllt10/Af10 antibody staining on mouse small intestinal epithelium. Arrow indicates expression in the crypt proliferative compartment. (E) Confocal image for MLLT10/AF10 (green), E-Cadherin (red), and the nuclei counter stained with DAPi (blue). MLLT10/AF10 is expressed in nuclei of normal colon epithelium in a gradient concentrated at the crypt bottom and in colorectal cancer cells.</p>

<p>Cell lysates from Ls174T CRCs were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against endogenous MLLT10/AF10 (A) and DOT1L (B) complexes and analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (C) MLLT10/AF10 interaction with TCF4 is mediated by β-catenin. Western blot analysis of β-catenin depletion in Ls174T cells expressing doxycycline (Dox)-inducible β-catenin shRNA. Immunoprecipitated TCF4-protein complexes from untreated or Dox-treated cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (D) Schematic representation of the human <italic>AXIN2</italic> locus and amplicons scanned in Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments by qPCR. ChIP in Ls174T CRCs uninduced or induced with Dox using antibodies specific for TCF4 (E), β-catenin (F), MLLT10/AF10 (G), DOT1L (H), H3K79 dimethyl (I), and H3K79 trimethyl (J). The immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR using primers specific for the <italic>AXIN2</italic> locus as indicated.
