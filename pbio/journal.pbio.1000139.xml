<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants are continuously exposed to a variety of microorganisms. In order to successfully avoid infection, they have evolved a series of defense mechanisms that work in concert to limit pathogen invasion and multiplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Chisholm1">[1]</xref>. Unlike vertebrates, plants lack an adaptive immune system and rely on their innate immune system to recognize and restrict pathogenic microbes. Conceptually, there are two primary branches of plant innate immunity. One branch employs extracellular receptors to recognize conserved microbial features termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), resulting in PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). The second branch uses intracellular plant resistance (R) proteins to recognize pathogen effectors delivered inside host cells during infection, resulting in effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Despite the importance of plant innate immunity, how pathogen perception activates immune responses and signaling overlap between PTI and ETI remain elusive.</p>
<p>PAMPs are conserved microbial features, such as bacterial flagellin or fungal chitin, which fulfill a function crucial to the lifestyle of the organism. PAMPs are perceived by pattern-recognition receptors resulting in PTI. The activation of PTI leads to the induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, transcriptional reprogramming, production of reactive oxygen species, and callose deposition, which serves as a physical barrier at infection sites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Nurnberger1">[2]</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to colonize plants, virulent microorganisms need to overcome PTI. Plant pathogenic bacteria use the type III secretion system to deliver 20–30 effector proteins into the plant cell during pathogenesis. Collectively, these effectors are required for virulence and individual effectors have been shown to inhibit PTI through a variety of mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Zhou1">[3]</xref>. The most well-studied bacterial effectors come from <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>), the causal agent of bacterial speck on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato. In susceptible plant genotypes effectors enhance pathogen virulence and can inhibit PTI and ETI; in resistant plant genotypes effectors are recognized, culminating in an inhibition of pathogen growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Dangl1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Shan1">[5]</xref>. Despite the wide range of pathogens recognized, the majority of R genes can be grouped into one large family encoding proteins with a nucleotide-binding site (NB) and C-terminal leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Meyers1">[6]</xref>. Several plant R proteins can detect effectors indirectly by monitoring for effector-induced perturbations of key host proteins.</p>
<p>To date, RIN4 (At3g25070) is the only known protein that can regulate both branches of the plant immune system. <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression lines exhibit decreased callose deposition after PAMP treatment as well as enhanced growth of virulent and type III secretion-deficient <italic>Pst</italic>, indicating a reduction in PTI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Kim1">[7]</xref>. <italic>rin4</italic> knockout lines exhibit increased callose deposition after PAMP treatment and decreased <italic>Pst</italic> growth, consistent with enhanced PTI signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Kim1">[7]</xref>. These data indicate that RIN4 is a negative regulator of PTI. In addition, two R proteins, RPM1 (At3g07040) and RPS2 (At4g26090), monitor RIN4. RPM1, RPS2, and RIN4 are all localized to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Axtell1">[10]</xref>. In the absence of pathogen perception, RIN4 acts as a negative regulator of RPM1 and RPS2. When the <italic>P. syringae</italic> effectors AvrRpm1 or AvrB are delivered to the plant cell, RIN4 is hyper-phosphorylated, which in turn leads to the activation of RPM1-mediated resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">[8]</xref>. Another <italic>P. syringae</italic> effector, AvrRpt2, is a protease that directly targets RIN4, leading to the activation of RPS2-mediated resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Axtell2">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Coaker1">[14]</xref>. Investigation of the <italic>Arabidopsis–P. syringae</italic> interaction has identified RIN4 is a point of convergence for the regulation of both PTI and ETI. However, a mechanistic understanding of how RIN4 negatively regulates PTI remains elusive.</p>
<p>Many pathogenic bacteria can proliferate as epiphytes on the plant leaf surface, but in order to infect a plant they must colonize host tissues. Bacterial pathogens gain entry inside plant leaves through wounds or natural openings like stomata. Stomatal pores, located on the aerial epidermis, permit gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. A pair of guard cells surrounds stomatal pores. Guard cells respond to diverse stimuli in order to regulate stomatal apertures including: blue light, temperature, humidity, CO<sub>2</sub>, plant hormones, and pathogen inoculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Hetherington1">[17]</xref>. Stomatal pores operate as osmotic machines that open when the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase of guard cells is allowed to be active. The activity of this proton pump generates a large transmembrane electrochemical gradient that drives the uptake of charged solutes and, as a consequence, water, which in turn causes the cells to swell and the pore between them to open. Stomatal closure is initiated upon depolarization of the guard cell plasma membrane by inhibiting the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>
<p>Historically, stomata were thought to be passive ports of entry, but recent evidence reveals that stomatal closure is induced by both PTI and ETI in an attempt to restrict bacterial invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Gudesblat1">[19]</xref>. Upon perception of PAMPs, stomata will close within 1 h. However, virulent bacteria are able to re-open stomata after 3 h, facilitating their entry into the plant leaf. For example, virulent <italic>Pst</italic> secretes the polyketide toxin coronatine, which stimulates the plant to re-open their stomata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Bender1">[20]</xref>. Several other pathogenic microorganisms also act to regulate stomatal apertures during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Gudesblat1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Allegre1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Farrell1">[23]</xref>. One particularly well-characterized example is the toxin fusicoccin, produced by the fungal pathogen <italic>Fusicoccum amygdali</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Marre1">[24]</xref>. Fusicoccin is a strong activator of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and rapidly induces stomatal opening, presumably in order to facilitate fungal penetration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Baunsgaard1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Oecking1">[27]</xref>. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of stomatal pores and guard cell signaling during pathogen infection.</p>
<p>In this study, we report the identification and characterization of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RIN4 protein complex. We were able to purify several associated proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography and identify them by mass spectrometry. We identified the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases AHA1 (At2g18960) or AHA2 (At4g30190), whose interaction we characterized in greater detail. The C-terminal regulatory domain of AHA1 and AHA2 interact with RIN4 by yeast two-hybrid and we can detect a specific interaction between AHA1/AHA2 and RIN4 in planta using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression enhanced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, while the <italic>rin4</italic> knockout line exhibited decreased PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Importantly, we demonstrate that the <italic>rin4</italic> knockout cannot re-open its stomata in response to virulent <italic>Pst</italic>. We also show that <italic>RIN4</italic> is expressed in guard cells along with other PTI and ETI signaling components. Our findings are consistent with a model in which RIN4 associates with the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase to regulate leaf stomata in response to PAMPs.</p>

<title>Purification and Identification of the RIN4 Protein Complex</title>
<p>In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the proteins involved in plant immune signaling, we investigated the components of the RIN4 protein complex in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. We used affinity-purified antibody recognizing RIN4 to purify associated proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The <italic>rps2-101c</italic> mutant complemented with the RPS2 transgene containing a C-terminal fusion to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was used for RIN4 purifications. This line is biologically relevant because RPS2:HA is expressed from its native promoter, can complement the <italic>rps2-101c</italic> mutation, and confers resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> expressing AvrRpt2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Axtell2">[11]</xref>. RPS2 associates with RIN4 in planta, and we used this association to troubleshoot purification conditions. Because the <italic>rin4</italic> knockout is lethal in the presence of RPS2, we used the <italic>rps2/rin4</italic> double mutant line to control for nonspecific protein binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey2">[13]</xref>. Multiple purification protocols were tested in order to identify conditions that would enable us to detect the presence of both RIN4 and RPS2 by mass spectrometry. We found that wash conditions containing more than 150 mM NaCl eliminated most nonspecific protein binding, but also eliminated our ability to copurify RPS2 in the positive controls. Protein complex purifications were also conducted after plasma membrane fractionation, but this eliminated our ability to copurify RPS2 (unpublished data). Therefore, we used whole leaf protein extracts and mild wash conditions to purify RIN4 associated proteins across three biological replicates. Proteins from each sample were analyzed directly using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Proteins were identified using the MASCOT algorithm to search the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. All experiments captured native, biologically relevant levels of RIN4 and associated proteins.</p>
<p>We reproducibly identified RIN4 and RPS2 as well as six novel RIN4-associated proteins across three biological replications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000139-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s006">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s007">S2</xref>). In order to be classified as a RIN4-associated protein, the protein had to be identified by a minimum of two unique peptides and be present in all three replications of the positive control, but never identified in the negative control <italic>rps2/rin4</italic>. Although we were able to identify RPS2 and RIN4 by mass spectrometry, we did not identify two additional proteins that are known to interact with RIN4: NDR1 (At3g20600) and the R protein RPM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Day1">[28]</xref>. Both proteins have been demonstrated to interact by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation. Our inability to detect RPM1 could be because only a small percentage of RPM1 interacts with RIN4 in the plant, indicating that these two proteins may transiently interact during ETI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">[8]</xref>. Alternatively, our mass spectrometry analysis may have only identified the most abundant RIN4 associated proteins. In contrast to RIN4, which is easily detected by western blot, RPM1 and NDR1 are expressed at very low levels, making them difficult to identify by mass spectrometry.</p>

<title>The PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Interacts with RIN4 by Yeast Two-Hybrid and In Planta</title>
<p>In order to validate the RIN4 AHA1/AHA2 association detected by mass spectrometry, we subjected them to BiFC and yeast two-hybrid analyses. AHA1 and AHA2, which are negatively regulated by their C termini, possess multiple transmembrane domains (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Palmgren1">[36]</xref>). Therefore, we employed the hydrophilic C-terminal regulatory domain of AHA1 and AHA2 in our yeast two-hybrid analyses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, we detected an interaction between RIN4 and the C termini of both AHA1<sub>837–950</sub> and AHA2<sub>837–949</sub>, when compared with the negative control T-antigen/Lamin-C using the Matchmaker system. We were unable to detect any interaction between RPS2, AHA1<sub>837–950</sub>, or AHA2<sub>837–949</sub> by yeast two-hybrid (unpublished data). We verified that RIN4, AHA1<sub>837–950</sub>, and AHA2<sub>837–949</sub> are expressed in yeast and do not autonomously activate His auxotrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s002">S2</xref>). We also tested beta-galactosidase activity, but could only detect a faint blue color (unpublished data). These results indicate that RIN4 can weakly interact with the C terminus of AHA1 and AHA2 by yeast two-hybrid.</p>

<p>To provide additional evidence for the AHA and RIN4 interaction, we investigated the association between AHA1, AHA2, and RIN4 in planta using a BiFC approach to directly visualize protein interactions in living cells. A specific interaction between either AHA1 or AHA2 and RIN4 was detected in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g001">Figure 1B, a, b</xref>). The yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fluorescence was clearly localized to the plasma membrane, where RIN4, AHA1, and AHA2 have been previously shown to be located. The background fluorescence of chloroplasts in the green channel is due to the excitation at 488 nm. Meanwhile, we were unable to detect any YFP fluorescence between AHA1 or AHA2 and RPS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g001">Figure 1B, d, e</xref>). As a negative control we co-expressed each protein with the auxin influx carrier AUX1 (At2g38120), an integral plasma membrane protein. None of the proteins were able to induce YFP fluorescence in the presence of the negative control, indicating a specific interaction between AHA1/AHA2 and RIN4 in planta. In order to ensure that the proteins used as negative controls indeed were expressed, expression of AUX1 was detected by western blotting employing the His tag included in the construct (unpublished data) and expression of RPS2 was tested by observation of cell death 48 h after infiltration (unpublished data).</p>

<title><italic>RIN4</italic> Overexpression and Knockout Lines Exhibit Differential H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activities</title>
<p>RIN4 can interact with the C-terminal regulatory domains of AHA1 and AHA2. Therefore, we investigated the hypothesis that RIN4 can regulate H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Because it is not possible to measure the biochemical activity of single PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoforms in planta, we analyzed PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity as a whole, even though RIN4 may only affect a subset of ATPases. Plasma membrane vesicles were purified from Col 0, dexamethasone (Dex) inducible <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Kim1">[7]</xref>, <italic>rpm1/rps2</italic>, and <italic>rpm1/rps2/rin4</italic> leaf tissue by aqueous two-phase partitioning.

PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity was subsequently measured on inside-out plasma membrane vesicles as described by Palmgren and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Palmgren2">[38]</xref>. In this assay, the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase hydrolyzes ATP and pumps H<sup>+</sup> into vesicles, which creates a pH gradient across the membrane. The pumping activity was measured by quenching of the ΔpH probe acridine orange at an absorbance of 495 nm. H<sup>+</sup> transport measured from plasma membrane vesicles purified from wild-type Col 0 leaves demonstrated that these vesicles were both transport competent and highly enriched for plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In <italic>rpm1/rps2/rin4</italic> leaves, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity was 30% lower than Col 0 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g002">Figure 2A and 2C</xref>). In <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression lines, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity was 65% higher than Col 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g002">Figure 2B and 2D</xref>). We also noticed that the <italic>rpm1/rps2</italic> double mutant exhibited slightly higher H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity than Col 0 (7%–13%) across independent plasma membrane isolations (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g002">Figure 2A and 2C</xref>). Because both RPS2 and RPM1 interact with RIN4, this line may possess more RIN4 protein that can interact with the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, thus increasing its activity. <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression was induced by spraying the Dex:<italic>RIN4</italic> line with 20 µM Dex and harvesting tissue 48 h later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). We also found that Dex treatment itself slightly inhibited the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase enzymatic activity in Col 0. This is not surprising, because previous studies have revealed that Dex treatment alone can lead to significant changes in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-McNellis1">[39]</xref>. Nevertheless, when comparing to Col 0 and Dex:<italic>RIN4</italic> lines after treating with Dex, it is clear that <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression leads to enhanced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that RIN4 can act to regulate H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity at the plasma membrane. On the basis of these results, RIN4 acts as a positive regulator of AHA1/AHA2, as <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression lines exhibit enhanced AHA activity and the <italic>rin4</italic> knockout exhibits decreased AHA activity.</p>

We were unable to detect any obvious morphological or altered disease phenotypes in either knockout line (unpublished data).

However, the 35S:<italic>AHA2</italic><sub>1–837</sub> line did not have a constitutively open stomata phenotype like <italic>ost2-1D</italic> and <italic>ost2-2D</italic> mutants (unpublished data). The pleotropic phenotypes generated by overexpressing <italic>AHA2</italic><sub>1–837</sub> in Col 0 are not surprising because strong constitutive activation of plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase(s) can result in a nonspecific expression in different cell types, profound changes in plasma membrane potential, and will affect multiple biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Gevaudant1">[43]</xref>.

<p>The <italic>ost2-1D</italic> and <italic>ost2-2D</italic> mutants were previously reported as lesion-mimic mutants and displayed salicylic acid-induced necrosis on leaflets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Merlot1">[35]</xref>.

However, we were able to visualize leaflet necrosis on both lines when they were grown under conditions to promote flowering (140 µmol/sec/m<sup>2</sup>, 16-h days, 23°C). The phenotypes of lesion-mimic mutants can be variable and sensitive to variations in growth conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Clough1">[44]</xref>.

The stomata of <italic>rpm1/rps2</italic> lines were open after 3 h, indicating that this phenotype is solely due to the lack of <italic>RIN4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>Previously, the <italic>rpm1/rps2/rin4</italic> triple mutant was shown to be more resistant than <italic>rpm1/rps2</italic> after spray inoculation with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Kim1">[7]</xref>.

In order to test this hypothesis, we inoculated <italic>rpm1/rps2</italic> and <italic>rpm1/rps2/rin4</italic> plants grown under the same conditions by both spray inoculation and syringe infiltration.

<title><italic>RIN4</italic> Is Expressed in Both Guard Cells and Mesophyll Cells</title>
<p>Our observation that virulent <italic>Pst</italic> cannot re-open stomata in <italic>rin4</italic> knockout lines led us to investigate what cell types express <italic>RIN4</italic>.

These data are consistent with the model of RIN4 acting in concert with the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2 to regulate stomatal apertures in response to pathogen attack in resistant genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Model of PAMP-induced stomatal closure.</title>
<p>RIN4 acts in concert with AHA1 and/or AHA2 to regulate stomatal apertures in response to pathogen attack during PTI. (A) Virulent pathogens are able to overcome PTI and induce stomata to re-open 3 h after pathogen perception. Activation of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase can lead to hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and subsequent induction of inward K<sup>+</sup> channels. These events lead to an increase in guard cell turgor and stomatal opening. (B) RIN4 is a negative regulator of plant innate immunity. In resistant genotypes, pathogens are not able to overcome PTI and stomata remain closed after pathogen perception. Pathogen PAMPs are detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the induction of PTI induces stomatal closure. Posttranslational modification of RIN4 (elimination or possibly phosphorylation) inhibits the association between RIN4 and AHA1/AHA2, resulting in inactivation of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>

<p>Stomata are surrounded by a pair of two guard cells, whose turgor controls opening and closure of the aperture. Changes in the turgor of guard cells are strongly influenced by the activity of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Activation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase can lead to hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and subsequent induction of inward K<sup>+</sup> channels resulting in an increase in turgor due to concomitant entry of water and stomatal opening. In contrast, inhibiting the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and anion channel activation initiate plasma membrane depolarization, resulting in the activation of outward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Schroeder2">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Brault1">[51]</xref>. These ion effluxes result in a loss of guard cell turgor and stomatal closure. A number of secondary messengers are important for initiating membrane depolarization, including reactive oxygen species and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that the RIN4 protein acts in concert with PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to regulate stomatal apertures during PTI. Importantly, the <italic>rin4</italic> knockout line does not re-open its stomata in response to virulent <italic>Pst</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This result solidifies the importance of RIN4 in regulating stomatal apertures in response to pathogen attack. Previously, RIN4 was found to be a negative regulator of both PTI and ETI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Kim1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Axtell2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey2">[13]</xref>. Our results were consistent with these findings and suggest that RIN4's association with AHA1 and AHA2 is an important component of RIN4 function. Autoactive <italic>AHA1</italic> mutants display increased susceptibility to virulent <italic>Pst</italic>, because of the bacteria's enhanced ability to gain access to the plant interior via open stomata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g005">5</xref>). <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression lines exhibit enhanced disease susceptibility and increased PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Conversely, <italic>rin4</italic> knockout lines exhibit decreased disease susceptibility and lower PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g006">6C</xref>). These results can now explain how RIN4 acts to regulate plant innate immunity at the level of pathogen invasion.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of <italic>RIN4</italic> in plant innate immunity, the pattern of <italic>RIN4</italic> expression remained unknown. Using a combination of RT-PCR, western blotting, and microarray analyses we were able to demonstrate that <italic>RIN4</italic> is expressed in guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These results highlight the importance of <italic>RIN4</italic> in PTI-induced stomatal closure. We were also able to detect the expression of multiple PAMP receptors, R genes, and innate immune signaling components in guard cells at the RNA level, emphasizing the importance of this cell type in the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Inhibition of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is one of the first steps required to induce stomatal closure. These data are consistent with a model in which RIN4 acts in concert with AHA1 and/or AHA2 to regulate stomatal apertures in response to pathogen attack during PTI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000139-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Perception of the flagellin flg22 peptide during PTI was found to inhibit both inward and outward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Zhang1">[52]</xref>. Therefore, flagellin perception can not only induce stomatal closure, but can inhibit stomatal opening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Zhang1">[52]</xref>. Because stomata serve as points of entry for multiple bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens, it is not surprising that several different classes of pathogens have evolved to manipulate stomatal apertures during pathogenesis. For example, the polyketide toxin coronatine, produced by several strains of <italic>P. syringae</italic>, can induce stomatal opening after PTI-mediated closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto1">[15]</xref>. Coronatine can reverse the inhibition of inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels, leading to stomatal opening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Zhang1">[52]</xref>. <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> employs a small diffusible signal molecule, which can also induce stomatal opening on compatible hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Gudesblat1">[19]</xref>. The most well-characterized example of stomatal manipulation by a pathogen is the toxin fusicoccin, produced by the fungal pathogen <italic>F. amygdali</italic>, the causal agent of almond and peach canker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Marre1">[24]</xref>. Fusicoccin is a potent activator of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and strongly induces stomatal opening by binding to and stabilizing an activated H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase/14-3-3 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Baunsgaard1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Oecking1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Piotrowski1">[53]</xref>. These studies highlight the importance of stomatal regulation during plant innate immunity, as components of the signaling pathways controlling stomatal apertures can be regulated by the plant immune system as well as by virulent pathogens.</p>
<p>What is the mechanism RIN4 uses to regulate PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity? PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase regulation has been well studied over the last 20 years (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Duby1">[54]</xref>). Both crystallographic data and homology modeling of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase indicate that it possesses a similar structure to other P-type ATPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Pedersen1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Ottmann1">[56]</xref>. The PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase also possesses an extended C terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Palmgren4">[57]</xref>, which is lacking in other P-type ATPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Palmgren4">[57]</xref> and is involved in negative regulation of pump activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Axelsen1">[58]</xref>. Activation of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase can be achieved by phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine residue. Phosphorylation of this residue leads to subsequent binding of regulatory 14-3-3 proteins, which displace the autoinhibitory C-terminal domain. This apparently induces the formation of a dodecamer consisting of six H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and six 14-3-3 molecules in the PMA2 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform from <italic>N. plumbaginifolia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Duby1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Ottmann1">[56]</xref>. Additional phosphorylated residues have recently been identified that can contribute to both positive and negative regulation of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, highlighting the complexity of this pump's regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Niittyla1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Duby2">[61]</xref>.</p>
<p>Data presented in this manuscript are consistent with RIN4 being a positive regulator of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2. Previous studies have demonstrated that RIN4 is phosphorylated in planta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Nuhse1">[62]</xref>. It will be interesting to test if the phosphorylation status of RIN4 plays a role in regulating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Future research investigating if RIN4 is transcriptionally or posttranslationally modulated during the guard cell response to PAMPs and <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 may help elucidate the mechanism employed by RIN4 to regulate the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. In addition, <italic>RIN4</italic> homologs can be detected in many plants where substantial DNA sequences are available. In the future, it will be important to determine the role of <italic>RIN4</italic> as well as RIN4-associated proteins across different species. For example, stomatal closure in response to PTI occurs in multiple plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto2">[18]</xref>. Does the association of RIN4 with PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases act to regulate stomatal apertures in other species?</p>
<p>It will also be important to elucidate how innate immune complexes change in response to pathogen attack and if complex constituents are the same between different cell types. It is plausible that components of the innate immune complexes exist in distinct pools within each cell, with each pool controlling different aspects of PTI and ETI. There is evidence for RIN4 existing in different cellular pools within plant leaves based on data obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Axtell2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey2">[13]</xref>. In this study, we were able to elucidate members of the RIN4 complex in the absence of pathogen infection. An in-depth investigation how the RIN4 complex assembles and changes during PTI, ETI, and after pathogen-induced modification in different cell types (e.g., guard cells and mesophyll cells) and plant genotypes will greatly facilitate our understanding of innate immune signaling.</p>
