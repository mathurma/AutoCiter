<p>Production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by injured zebrafish skin cells promotes the regeneration of nearby somatosensory axon terminals, thus coordinating wound healing of the skin with sensory reinnervation.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Functional recovery from cutaneous injury requires not only the healing and regeneration of skin cells but also reinnervation of the skin by somatosensory peripheral axon endings. To investigate how sensory axon regeneration and wound healing are coordinated, we amputated the caudal fins of zebrafish larvae and imaged somatosensory axon behavior. Fin amputation strongly promoted the regeneration of nearby sensory axons, an effect that could be mimicked by ablating a few keratinocytes anywhere in the body. Since injury produces the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) near wounds, we tested whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> influences cutaneous axon regeneration. Exposure of zebrafish larvae to sublethal levels of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> promoted growth of severed axons in the absence of keratinocyte injury, and inhibiting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production blocked the axon growth-promoting effects of fin amputation and keratinocyte ablation. Thus, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling helps coordinate wound healing with peripheral sensory axon reinnervation of the skin.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Touch-sensing neurons project axonal processes that branch extensively within the outer layers of skin to detect touch stimuli. Recovering from skin injuries thus requires not only repair of damaged skin tissue but also regeneration of the sensory axons innervating it. To study whether skin wound healing is coordinated with sensory innervation, we compared the regeneration of severed sensory axons innervating larval zebrafish tail fins with and without concomitant injury to surrounding skin cells. Severed axons regenerated more robustly when nearby skin cells were also damaged, suggesting that wounded skin releases a short-range factor that promotes axon growth. The reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is known to be produced by injured cells, making it a candidate for mediating this signal. We found that adding exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> improved the regeneration of severed axons. Conversely, blocking H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production prevented the axon growth-promoting effect of skin injury. Thus, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> promotes axon growth after skin damage, helping to ensure that healing skin is properly innervated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Successful wound repair and regeneration requires coordination between the various cell types that make up the injured tissue. For example, following injuries that damage both epidermis and sensory endings, wounded epidermis promotes the regeneration of nerve fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Harsum1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Reynolds1">[2]</xref>. Conversely, complete epidermal wound healing requires the presence of sensory axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Harsum1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Barker1">[3]</xref>. In amphibians, innervation of the wound epidermis by nerve fibers is also essential for limb regeneration and correlates with the establishment of signaling centers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Singer1">[4]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Endo1">[6]</xref>. These observations imply that coordination between wound epidermis and sensory axons during healing and regeneration is regulated by molecular interactions between these cell types.</p>
<p>In mammals, peripheral axon regeneration is generally more robust than axon regeneration in the central nervous system. Nonetheless, reinnervation in the periphery can be slow or incomplete, depending on the extent of axonal injury and on interactions with surrounding cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Navarro1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Verdu1">[8]</xref>. Because nerve injury is often associated with damage of not only the nerve but also neighboring tissues, it has been difficult to separate autonomous and non-autonomous factors influencing axon regeneration in vivo. Recent studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and zebrafish have utilized laser axotomy to precisely damage single axons in the peripheral nervous system, making it possible to assess the influence of non-neuronal tissues on axonal regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Yanik1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-OBrien1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Tissue damage triggers a complex cascade of signals that activate inflammatory responses and promote tissue repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Gurtner1">[11]</xref>. In fruit flies and zebrafish, the recruitment of immune cells to wounds is mediated by the small reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which emanates from the injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Moreira1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Niethammer1">[13]</xref>. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in oxidative stress has been well studied, as high levels can have deleterious effects on the maintenance of cell homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Rojkind1">[14]</xref>. In the nervous system, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can induce neurodegeneration through activation of pro-apoptotic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Marzocco1">[15]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Chen1">[17]</xref>. More recently it has come to be appreciated that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can act as a signaling molecule with specific developmental and physiological functions. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is thought to signal by oxidizing cysteine residues on target proteins, most notably phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Chiarugi1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Bedard1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>The larval zebrafish tail fin provides an accessible setting for investigating how peripheral axon regeneration is coordinated with the healing of injured tissue and for testing whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plays a role in these interactions. During larval stages, zebrafish fins consist of a folded two-layered epithelium, surrounding muscle cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Zebrafish tail fins regenerate after amputation, both during larval development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Kawakami1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Yoshinari1">[21]</xref> and in adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Akimenko1">[22]</xref>, but sensory reinnervation of regenerated fins has not been explicitly assessed.</p>
<p>Somatosensation at larval stages in zebrafish is accomplished by two populations of neurons: trigeminal neurons, which are located in ganglia outside the hindbrain and innervate the skin of the head, and Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons, which are located in the dorsal spinal cord and innervate the skin of the trunk and tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The peripheral axons of somatosensory neurons arborize between the two epithelial layers that make up the larval skin, the outer periderm and inner basal cell layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-LeGuellec1">[23]</xref>. Precisely severing a trigeminal peripheral axon after arborization is complete (âˆ¼36 h post-fertilization, hpf) promotes some regenerative growth, but regenerating axons avoid their former territories and undamaged neighboring axons never sprout into these newly denervated areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-OBrien2">[24]</xref>.</p>

<p>We have investigated the relationship between tissue damage and peripheral axon regeneration, using injury to the larval zebrafish tail fin as an experimental paradigm. Amputating the fin promoted peripheral sensory axon growth, allowing the robust reinnervation of the newly regenerated fin. This axon regeneration-promoting effect could also be elicited by ablating a few keratinocytes anywhere in the body. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure mimicked the axon growth-promoting effect of keratinocyte damage, and morpholino-mediated knockdown of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-generating enzyme Duox1 inhibited axon growth-promotion by fin amputation. Thus, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by damaged keratinocytes promotes the reinnervation of healing skin by sensory axons.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<p>The caudal fins of larval zebrafish regenerate completely within a few days after amputation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Kawakami1">[20]</xref>, implying that RB peripheral axons must also regenerate to provide sensory function to the new fin. To directly assess whether RB axons in the tail can regenerate, we imaged GFP-labeled RB arbors in the islet2b:GFP transgenic line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Pittman1">[25]</xref> after caudal fin amputation at 3 d post-fertilization (dpf). Amputation caused immediate degeneration of axon branches near the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, brackets), creating a denervated zone that regenerating axons would need to traverse to fully innervate the regenerating fin. Despite this potential barrier, the fin was always reinnervated by RB arbors at 120 h post-amputation (hpamp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Three days after fin amputation, there was no detectable difference in the total amount of sensory axons in regenerated fin tips and fin tips of age-matched animals (6 dpf) that were never injured, indicating that reinnervation of regenerated fins was complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Sensory reinnervation of regenerated fins was functional, since 6 dpf fish with regenerated fins responded to touch at the tip of the tail as often as uninjured control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>The observation that RB axons robustly reinnervate larval fins within a few days after amputation, despite the fact that trigeminal axon regeneration is limited after precise axotomy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-OBrien2">[24]</xref>, could be explained in either of two ways: (1) fin injury and healing promote peripheral axon growth or (2) RB neurons innervating the tail possess greater structural plasticity than trigeminal neurons. To assess the intrinsic plasticity of RB axon arbors, we monitored axon behavior after precise laser axotomy with time-lapse imaging for 12 h (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s001">Figure S1B</xref> for experimental procedures) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-OBrien1">[10]</xref> and traced the position of individual axon tips every 30 min. Axotomy of RB neurons induced a 2-fold increase in axon activity (axon tip displacement, including both growth and retraction) compared to uninjured axons (54.92Â±2.72 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š24 versus 32.47Â±2.53 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š13 axon tip displacement, * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g003">3A</xref>; quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s009">Videos S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s008">S1</xref>, respectively), but, like trigeminal axons, regenerating RB axons avoided denervated territory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-OBrien2">[24]</xref>. Notably, axon growth was balanced by retraction, so that total arbor size did not substantially increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g003">Figure 3F</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s009">Video S2</xref>). Like trigeminal axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-OBrien2">[24]</xref>, the ability of RB axons to reinnervate former territory in the fin was improved by inhibiting Rho kinase (unpublished data). Thus, the ability of RB axons to regenerate after fin amputation is likely not due to intrinsic regenerative capacity but is probably a specific response to tissue damage.</p>

<title>Signals from injured fins promoting axon regeneration function at short range.</title>
<p>(Aâ€“C) Time-lapse sequences from 78â€“90 hpf. The rightmost panel shows axon tip trajectories (red) over the course of the time-lapse. (A) Axotomy (arrow) without amputation (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s009">Video S2</xref>). Axotomy increased axon activity, but axons were unable to reinnervate denervated territory (shaded area) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s002">Figure S2</xref>). (B) The ability of an axotomized arbor (arrow) to reinnervate denervated territory (shaded area) was improved by fin amputation (dotted line) (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s011">Video S4</xref>). (C) Axotomized arbors distant from the amputation plane did not regenerate (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s012">Video S5</xref>). (D, E) Comparison of axon activity (growth and retraction) (D) and linear growth distance (E) in uninjured arbors, after axotomy alone, after amputation alone, or after axotomy and amputation, both in close proximity (adj) or at a distance of greater than 50 Âµm. (F) Comparison of growth and retraction between axotomized axons, and axotomized axons in larvae whose fins were also amputated. Amputation in addition to axotomy promoted a shift from balanced growth and retraction toward growth. Sample size for each group is indicated by the number in the bar. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. For statistical analyses, we performed one-way ANOVA and either Dunnett's post-test to compare individual groups to uninjured controls (asterisks above bars indicate significance compared to control) or Bonferroni's post-test to compare individual groups with each other (as indicated by brackets, <italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š<italic>ns</italic>&gt;0.05, * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, *** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). hpax, hours post axotomy; amp, amputation.</p>

<p>To further investigate the influence of tissue injury on RB axon regeneration, we compared the behavior of uninjured axon arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), precisely axotomized arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), and injured arbors in amputated fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Fin amputation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s010">Video S3</xref>) increased total axon activity (growth and retraction) more than axotomy alone (77.40Â±4.03 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š26, *** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Measuring the linear distance between an axon tip's position just after amputation and its position 12 h later revealed that fin amputation promoted productive axon growth, since axon tips traveled farther after amputation than after precise axotomy (29.62Â±2.50 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š8, versus 8.42Â±3.09 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š8, ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Combining fin amputation with subsequent laser axotomy of a nearby RB axon branch increased the axon activity (83.74Â±3.09 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š26, ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and total growth (46.54Â±4.92 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š13, *** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) even further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g003">Figure 3B,D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s011">Video S4</xref>), but the amount of retraction was not dramatically altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Amputating fins significantly improved the ability of regenerating axons to innervate denervated areas (14.11Â±7.02 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š8 versus 60.24Â±13.06 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š10, * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which is likely important for allowing regenerating arbors to traverse the denervated zone that forms just proximal to the wound after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, brackets). Thus, fin injury increases sensory axon activity, promotes growth (but not retraction), and allows axons to overcome their avoidance of denervated territories.</p>
<p>To determine the effective range of axon growth-promoting signals from injured tissue, we axotomized axons distant (&gt;50 Âµm) from the amputation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s012">Video S5</xref>). These axons did not grow significantly better than precisely severed axons in uninjured tissue, since neither axon activity nor linear growth distances were increased by distant amputation (axon activity: 38.67Â±2.85 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š10, <italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š<italic>ns</italic>&gt;0.05; linear distanceâ€Š=â€Š15.63Â±4.42 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š9; <italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š<italic>ns</italic>&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g003">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Thus, growth-promoting signals emanating from injured tissue likely function at short range. To define the time window during which axons can respond to regeneration-promoting signals, we axotomized RB arbors at different time points after amputation. Axon activity was most enhanced when arbors were axotomized at 3 h post-amputation (114.6Â±7.04 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š10, ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), but axotomy at 6 h post-amputation did not increase axon activity (61.20Â±6.45 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š10, <italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š<italic>ns</italic>&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), as compared to axotomy alone. This observation suggests that axon growth-promoting signals are transiently emitted from the wound, rather than continuously from regenerating fin tissue. To assess whether the size of the severed arbor fragment influenced the amount of axon activity induced by amputation, we traced degenerated fragments in three dimensions to measure their total length and plotted length as a function of axon activity. Size of the axotomized arbor did not correlate with axon activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the origin of axon growth-promoting signals, we ablated individual muscle cells or keratinocytes in the fin of larvae expressing cell type-specific reporter transgenes that highlight each tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Distel1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Gong1">[27]</xref>.

<p>To test whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can promote axon regeneration, we added 3 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.01%) to the larval media (the highest concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at which most embryos survived and developed normally, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s004">Figure S4</xref> for survival rates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s013">Video S6</xref>). The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to uninjured larvae significantly promoted some axon activity (untreated, uninjured: 32.47Â±2.53 Âµm versus H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> uninjured: 72.30Â±1.94 Âµm, *** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

<p>To test whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is required for injury-induced axon growth, we blocked H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and monitored axon regeneration after fin amputation by downregulating the primary enzyme generating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the larval fin, Dual oxidase 1 (Duox1), using a previously characterized morpholino (<italic>duox1</italic>-MO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g005">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s005">S5A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Niethammer1">[13]</xref>. Injecting this morpholino into embryos prevented the promotion of axon activity by fin amputation (23.89Â±3.29 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š11, ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g006">Figure 6B,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s014">Video S7</xref>). Interestingly, fin regeneration was also compromised in <italic>duox1</italic> morphants, potentially reflecting a role for axon innervation in fin regeneration, similar to limb regeneration in amphibians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Singer1">[4]</xref>. Treating amputated morphant larvae with 1.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 12 h rescued the deficit in axon reinnervation observed in the morphants (102.3Â±5.6 Âµm, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š5, ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g006">Figure 6C,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s015">Video S8</xref>). Due to the toxicity of prolonged H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, we unfortunately could not assess whether such rescued morphants also regenerated their fins. Blocking H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production with the <italic>duox1</italic>-MO did not affect growth and retraction induced by axotomy alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that cell-intrinsic mechanisms through which axotomy induces axon activity may be regulated by different pathways. To minimize the possibility that <italic>duox1</italic>-MO toxicity inhibited axon growth following axotomy, we repeated this experiment with co-injection of a morpholino targeting <italic>p53</italic>, which inhibits apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Langheinrich1">[28]</xref>, as was done in a previous study with the <italic>duox1</italic>-MO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Niethammer1">[13]</xref>. Like in larvae injected with <italic>duox1</italic>-MO alone, axon growth promotion by amputation was blocked in larvae injected with both <italic>p53</italic>-MO and <italic>duox1</italic>-MO, compared to larvae injected with <italic>p53</italic>-MO alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g006">Figures 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s005">S5Bâ€“D</xref>), supporting the idea that the <italic>duox1</italic>-MO's effect on regeneration is not due to cellular toxicity. Together these results indicate that Duox1-mediated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is necessary for the promotion of injury-induced axon growth.</p>
<p>To determine where Duox1 is required to promote axon regeneration, we created genetic chimeras by transplanting cells at the blastula stage from donor embryos injected with <italic>duox1</italic>-MO into uninjected host embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

<p>The promotion of axon growth by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could in principle result from the direct activation of axon growth or the repression of axon growth inhibitors, such as those that arise after initial growth stages to stabilize axonal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-OBrien2">[24]</xref>. To address this issue, we examined regeneration at 30 hpf, when axons are developing and repellants are presumably not present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Axotomy at this stage increased axon activity (** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), but the addition of 3 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to developing 30 hpf larvae did not further increase activity when compared to untreated larvae.

These results support the notion that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts by blocking axon growth inhibition, since it only influences regeneration at stages when inhibitors are present.

<p>In summary, we have found that wounded epidermis promotes somatosensory axon regeneration in zebrafish larvae and that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a critical mediator of this effect. Since this effect does not require the presence of leukocytes, we propose that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plays two independent roles during wound healing: promoting axon growth and mediating leukocyte recruitment. Thus, one signaling molecule emitted from injured tissue helps coordinate wound healing with functional recovery of skin.</p>

<title>Fin amputation</title>
<p>Fin amputations were performed according to methods in Kawakami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-Kawakami1">[20]</xref>. Briefly, before amputation larvae were anesthetized in 0.01% Tricaine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and placed in a petri dish coated with 1.5% agarose. The distal one-third of the fin (posterior to the notochord) was amputated using a sterile syringe needle.</p>

<title>Axotomy</title>
<p>Two-photon laser axotomy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope system with a Chameleon laser. Details are described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-OBrien1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<title>Time-Lapse Microscopy</title>
<p>Zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in 0.01% Tricaine and mounted in a sealed chamber in 1.2% low-melting agarose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Details of the mounting and imaging techniques are described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000621-OBrien1">[10]</xref>. Larvae were imaged for 12 h using a 20Ã— air objective. Stacks were scanned every 30 min in 3 Âµm intervals. Imaging was performed with 6â€“10 larvae per session on an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with an automated stage and Multitime software. Larvae were maintained at 28.5Â°C using a stage heater. Maximum intensity projections of confocal stacks were compiled using Zeiss software and further processed using Adobe Photoshop, NIH open source software Image J 1.34S (Abramoff, NIH Open Source software ImageJ, 2004), and Quick Time Player 7 Pro. For time-lapse imaging of peripheral sensory axon regeneration in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution, 0.005%â€“0.01% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (1.5â€“3 mM) was added to the larval media 1 h prior to axotomy. Larvae were maintained in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution for 3 or 12 h of time-lapse imaging.

<title>Determination of Optimal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Concentration for Larval Experiments</title>
<p>To determine the sublethal concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fisher Biotech, 30% in water) to use in larval experiments, we identified the maximum concentration at which 100% of larvae were viable for a minimum of 12 h. Groups of five larvae were incubated in serial dilutions of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from 0.003% to 30% and viability was assessed 12 h later. The EC50 was determined to be âˆ¼0.03% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Larvae survived without any morphological abnormalities at 3 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.01%) or less. For rescue experiments, we used a lower concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (1.5 mM) to maintain optimal viability.</p>

<title>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Detection</title>
<p>To detect the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> after amputation or ablation, 5 ÂµM of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensor pentafluorobenzenesulfonyl fluorescein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added 1 h prior to injury.

<title>Measurement of Axon Activity, Linear Growth Distance, and Reinnervation of Denervated Tissue</title>
<p>Axon activity was measured by tracing the movements of the 10 axon tips that grew most over a 12 h time window using Image J 1.34S and the Image J Manual Tracking software plugin (F. Cordelires, Institut Curie, Orsay, France). Projected images were adjusted for movement of the specimen, using the Image J StackReg plugin (P. ThÃ©venaz, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland). Measurements were made from projections of 24 time points recorded at 30 min intervals, assuming that axon tips move in a two-dimensional plane. A minimum of 10 axon tips per arbor and specimen were traced. The linear distances of axon growth were quantified using the Zeiss LSM 510 software and ImageJ analysis tool by measuring the distance between the growth cone position in the first (1 h) and last (12 h) stack. To quantify reinnervation of denervated territory, NeuroLucida software (Microbrightfield, Williston, VT) was used to generate tracings of individual Rohon-Beard axons in the fin skin from confocal stacks at 30 min (first recorded time point) and 12 h (last recorded time point). These tracings were overlaid and length measurements were used to quantify the percentage of the axon that entered denervated territory. To minimize distortion caused by developmental growth, images were aligned at the closest shared branch point proximal to the site of axotomy. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Unpaired, two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for comparisons of two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000621-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000621.s002">S2</xref>). One-way ANOVA and Dunnett's (comparing groups to a control group) or Bonferroni's (comparing groups to one another) post-tests were performed as indicated in each figure. Significance was set to <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05. All graphs show the standard error of the mean.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3m">
<title>Axon Density Calculations</title>
<p>Confocal images were loaded into ImageJ software and converted to 8-bit images. A binary image was created and the mean pixel values in a 50Ã—50 Âµm field in the distal fin portion measured to determine the axon density.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3n">
<title>Quantification of Growth and Retraction</title>
<p>Images were exported as tiff files from the LSM software (Zeiss) and loaded into the ImageJ software. Axon tips were traced as described above and individual movements were designated as growth or retraction within each 30 min interval. The total length of growth and retraction for each arbor was calculated for a 12-h period and a mean value of all traced axon tips derived (<italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š4 axon tips/4 axonsâ€Š=â€Š16 tracings total).</p>
</sec><sec id="s3o">
<title>Quantifying Degenerating Axon Fragment Size</title>
<p>The detached distal portions of axotomized axons were traced using Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience) to determine the total combined length of all the branches in the detached arbor. The length was plotted against axon activity of the parent axon during the regeneration phase (12 h).</p>
</sec><sec id="s3p">
<title>Quantification of Escape Behavior</title>
<p>Larvae were placed in a petri dish and tapped with an insect pin at the distal tip of the caudal fin and escapes were recorded. Two groups were compared: wildtype uninjured larvae at 6 dpf and age-matched wildtype larvae whose fins were amputated 3 dpf.</p>
