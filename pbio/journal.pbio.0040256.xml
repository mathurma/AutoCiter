				<article-title>Mapping Evolution: Linking Adaptive Traits to Genomic Location</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Understanding the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptation is limited by our ability to efficiently identify the genomic locations of adaptive mutations. Here we describe a method that can quickly and precisely map the genetic basis of naturally and experimentally evolved complex traits using linkage analysis. A yeast strain that expresses the evolved trait is crossed to a distinct strain background and DNA from a large pool of progeny that express the trait of interest is hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays that detect thousands of polymorphisms between the two strains. Adaptive mutations are detected by linkage to the polymorphisms from the evolved parent. We successfully tested our method by mapping five known genes to a precision of 0.2–24 kb (0.1–10 cM), and developed computer simulations to test the effect of different factors on mapping precision. We then applied this method to four yeast strains that had independently adapted to a fluctuating glucose–galactose environment. All four strains had acquired one or more missense mutations in 
					<italic>GAL80,</italic> the repressor of the galactose utilization pathway. When transferred into the ancestral strain, the 
					<italic>gal80</italic> mutations conferred the fitness advantage that the evolved strains show in the transition from glucose to galactose. Our results show an example of parallel adaptation caused by mutations in the same gene.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Characterizing the genetic changes that underlie evolutionary adaptation is important for understanding the emergence of new phenotypes. Experimental evolution makes it possible to follow the evolutionary history of populations exposed to known selective pressures. Moreover, the reproducibility of evolutionary paths can be explored by comparing identical, independent experiments. Such studies are beginning to shed light on the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b004">4</xref>], but many questions remain open, such as how rare gain-of-function mutations are relative to loss-of-function ones, and how often similar phenotypic adaptations are the result of similar genetic changes. A major challenge is finding the adaptive (beneficial) mutations without having to make prior assumptions about their type or site.
			</p>
      <p>Several strategies have been used to search for mutations associated with evolved traits. These include sequencing candidate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b007">7</xref>], tracking the insertion sites of mobile genetic elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b010">10</xref>], partial- or whole-genome sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b001">1</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b013">13</xref>], gene expression profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b002">2</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b014">14</xref>], identifying large chromosomal rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b008">8</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b015">15</xref>], and linkage analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b018">18</xref>]. Some of these approaches rely on the assumption that mutations found repeatedly in several independently evolved populations are likely to be beneficial. Ultimately, the effects of the mutations on the evolved phenotypes have to be verified experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b003">3</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b004">4</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b019">19</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Linkage analysis is the least biased and most general method for finding adaptive mutations in a background of neutral ones. It relies on linkage between the mutations that produce the phenotype of interest and neutral genetic markers (DNA polymorphisms) that can be easily followed, and thus makes no assumptions about the nature or locations of the adaptive mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b020">20</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b021">21</xref>]. Such analyses are often applied to progeny (segregants) from a cross between two strains that differ for both the selected trait and the genetic markers. Advances in genome technology have enabled simultaneous genotyping of thousands of DNA polymorphism markers by hybridizing genomic DNA to oligonucleotide arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b022">22</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b023">23</xref>]. This has led to better genome coverage and mapping resolution, as demonstrated on several traits in budding yeast, including growth at high temperature and sporulation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b022">22</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b024">24</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b025">25</xref>]. However, such quantitative trait mapping methods are laborious and expensive for mapping multiple traits or multiple strains (e.g., strains evolved in parallel experiments), as they usually require the genotyping of multiple individual segregants for each strain or trait being mapped. One solution is to mix DNA from many individuals expressing the trait of interest, and genotype it as a pool (selective DNA pooling; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b026">26</xref>]). A variety of pooled DNA genotyping methods have been used in association studies in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b030">30</xref>], as well as in quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in plants and animals, where experimental crosses are possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b036">36</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Here we map mutations in the budding yeast, 
				<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> which we use as a model organism to study the genetic basis of experimentally evolved traits ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b037">37</xref>]; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b004">4</xref>]). To overcome the limitations described above, we used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to genotype a single large pool of segregants that express the trait of interest, an approach also used in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b033">33</xref>]. This strategy reduces the number of microarrays needed for mapping, and increases mapping resolution due to the wide variety of recombination breakpoints present in a large pool of segregants. We tested and optimized our method on five known genetic loci and developed computer simulations to test the effect of various factors on mapping precision. We then applied it to four yeast strains that have been evolved in an environment where they were exposed to a regular alternation of carbon sources. The adaptive phenotype was mapped to the same locus in all four strains. We identified the adaptive mutations in the mapped regions and experimentally verified their contribution to the evolved trait.

        <title>A Bulk Segregant Mapping Method</title>
        <p>A schematic description of the mapping method is presented in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Briefly, a haploid yeast strain that expresses the trait of interest (the target strain) is crossed to a reference strain that lacks the trait and differs from the target strain at thousands of polymorphic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The hybrid diploid is then sporulated (undergoes meiosis), giving rise to a diverse pool of recombinant haploid progeny (segregants) that contain different combinations of their parents' genomic DNA. A large pool of segregants that express the trait of interest is selected from the progeny (the selected pool); as a control, a random pool of similar size is collected without selecting for the trait (the control pool). DNA from each pool is hybridized to an oligonucleotide microarray that detects the polymorphic sites. If it is difficult to select simultaneously for multiple segregants that express the trait, single progeny can be screened individually for the phenotype and later pooled for the linkage analysis. For each locus, the extent of hybridization reveals the fraction of the DNA that is derived from the target strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g001">Figure 1</xref>B); regions where the target strain's genotype is overrepresented in the selected pool relative to the control pool are predicted to contain mutations that contribute to the trait of interest (target loci).

            <title>Schematic Description of the Pooled Mapping Method Applied to a Single Pool of Segregants in Budding Yeast</title>
            <p>(A) A strain expressing the trait of interest (target strain) is crossed to a highly polymorphic strain that lacks the trait (reference strain). The DNA polymorphisms between the strains, represented by yellow squares for the target strain's genotype and blue squares for the reference's genotype, are the genetic markers used for the linkage analysis. After mating, the hybrid diploid is sporulated, yielding a pool of haploids (segregants) that are genetically diverse due to random recombination along the chromosomes. A large pool of segregants that express the trait of interest (cells with red background) is selected, enriching for segregants that carry the alleles that give rise to the trait of interest (target locus; represented by red circle). As a control, a pool of segregants of comparable size is randomly collected. For simplicity, only a single chromosome is shown.</p>
            <p>(B) The location of the target locus is inferred by a genome-wide comparison of the fraction of the target strain's genotype (yellow squares) within the selected pool to that within the control pool. The genomic DNA of the selected and control pools are extracted and their patterns of polymorphisms along the genome are analyzed. At polymorphic sites that are unlinked to the target locus, half of the segregants in the selected pool are expected to display the target strain's genotype and half the reference strain's genotype. However, at linked polymorphic sites, the fraction of selected segregants that carry the target strain's genotype (black line) should be higher than 50% and inversely proportional to the distance between the polymorphic site (squares) and the target locus (red circle). For the control pool, the genotype of both parental strains should be equally represented throughout the entire genome (orange line). The target loci lie in chromosome regions where the target strain's genotype is significantly overrepresented in the selected pool relative to the control pool.</p>

        <title>Genetic Map Construction for Linkage Analysis</title>
        <p>The first step in mapping is finding loci that are polymorphic between the target and reference strains. We identified these by hybridizing the genomic DNA of the target and reference strains separately onto high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Oligonucleotides (features) that hybridized significantly more strongly to DNA of the target strain than to that of the reference strain were the polymorphic features considered in this study (single-feature polymorphisms [SFPs]). We identified SFPs with a detection algorithm that uses a one-tailed two-sample 
					<italic>t</italic> test (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and estimated its sensitivity and specificity using two strains (S288c and YJM789) whose genomic DNA sequences are known (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We identified 4,438 S288c/YJM789 SFPs out of 12,602 true SFPs at a 
					<italic>p</italic> value of 10<sup>−6</sup>, yielding a true-positive rate of 35.22% (fraction of the true polymorphic features that are scored as polymorphic) at an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of 6.74% (fraction of detected SFPs that are not truly polymorphic) (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). At this 
					<italic>p</italic> value, we detect 45% of the SFPs where the sequence difference between the two strains lies in the central 15 bases of the 25-base oligonucleotide on the array. We chose a 
					<italic>p</italic> value cutoff of 10<sup>−6</sup> for SFP identification as it gave the highest true-positive–to–false discovery rate ratio of the cutoffs tested.

        <title>Mapping Method Tested on Five Known Genes</title>
        <p>We asked whether we could use pools of segregants from single crosses to map known genetic loci. We chose W303 and SK1 as the target and reference yeast strains as they are widely used in laboratory studies and a high level of polymorphism was reported between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b023">23</xref>]. Using our SFP detection algorithm, we identified 10,330 W303/SK1 SFPs at an estimated FDR of 2.9%, resulting in an average marker density of 1 SFP per ̃1.1 kb or ̃0.4 cM (the distribution of distances between SFPs is shown in 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). These SFPs made up the genetic map used for the linkage analyses in this work.
				</p>
        <p>We tested the performance of our method by mapping one metabolic and four drug resistance genes whose chromosomal locations are known (details in 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The target strain was a derivative of W303 that carries alleles that confer resistance to four drugs, canavanine

					</italic> we selected a second pool of approximately 10<sup>7</sup> segregants in liquid medium containing geneticin, hygromycin, and nourseothricin (Clonat). A control pool of segregants of comparable size was isolated in rich medium without drugs. The genomic DNA of each selected and control pool was hybridized to four identical arrays. The hybridization intensities of the selected and control pools and the target strain at the W303/SK1 SFPs were converted into a linkage map score (LMS) by analyzing the intensities across a moving window along the genome that included 50 SFPs (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This score reflects the probability that a given chromosomal region is linked to the selected trait (for further discussion, see 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). We used simulations to estimate the minimum LMS that we considered significant. The order of the SFPs was scrambled 1,000 times, for each ordering we recorded the highest LMS found across the genome, and we considered peaks in the unpermuted data significant only if they exceeded the 99th percentile of the ranked maximum scores from the permuted simulations (see

        <p>A total of six peaks were found above the cutoff: two for the 
					<italic>can1, LYS5</italic> pool and four for the 
					<italic>KAN<sup>R</sup>, HYG<sup>R</sup>,

					<italic>NAT<sup>R</sup>
					</italic> pool. Of the six peaks, five corresponded to the five selected genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We used mapping deviation, the distance between the center of a mapped peak and the center of the linked target gene, as a measure of mapping precision. In addition, we estimated 95% confidence intervals for each mapped locus using computer simulations (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The mapping deviations of the five genes, 0.2, 1.7, 8.3, 9.5, and 24 kb (̃0.1–10 cM) for 
					<italic>KAN<sup>R</sup>, can1, HYG<sup>R</sup>, LYS5,
					</italic> and 
					<italic>NAT<sup>R</sup>,
					</italic> respectively, all fell within their 95% confidence intervals, which ranged from ±10 to ±44 kb (±4 to ±18 cM). The mapping deviations are robust to the array preprocessing method used (see 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Tables S1</xref> and 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">S2</xref>, and 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>). This test case demonstrates that genes proximal to the centromere or telomere 
					<italic>(can1</italic> and 
					<italic>KAN<sup>R</sup>)
					</italic> can be mapped at high resolution, and that two genes on the same chromosome arm can be easily separated from each other 
					<italic>(HYG<sup>R</sup>
					</italic> and 
					<italic>NAT<sup>R</sup>).
					</italic> The LMS is influenced by several factors, including SFP density, local recombination frequency, and the variance of the hybridization to individual probes on the array. As a result, the differences between the LMSs of the different peaks do not reflect the quantitative contribution of the different loci to the selected phenotype (see 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).
				</p>
        <p>Aside from one potential false-positive peak found on Chromosome 10 at position 146.3 ± 30 kb, the signal-to-noise levels of the LMS was high (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figures S3</xref> and 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">S5</xref>). One possible interpretation for the extra peak is that it has uncovered real DNA differences between the target (W303) and reference (SK1) strains that contribute to the resistance to one or more of the drugs used for the selection. The failure to observe this peak in the 
					<italic>can1, LYS5</italic> pool supports this hypothesis, although we found no obvious candidates for genes whose polymorphisms might contribute to drug resistance in the 95% confidence interval on Chromosome 10.
				</p>
        <p>To assess the consistency of our mapping precision, 
					<italic>KAN<sup>R</sup>, HYG<sup>R</sup>,
					</italic> and 
					<italic>NAT<sup>R</sup>
					</italic> were mapped in two additional selected pools derived from different initial W303/SK1 hybrid diploids, yielding a total of three completely independent mapping experiments (unpublished data). The genes' mean mapping deviations and their standard deviations are 7.5 ± 6.4 kb, 4.1 ± 3.6 kb, and 14.9 ± 8.6 kb, respectively, with a total mean mapping deviation of 8.8 kb.
				</p>
        <p>For some organisms or phenotypes, selecting for 10<sup>7</sup> segregants that express the trait of interest is impractical. We therefore asked whether we could map the 
					<italic>KAN<sup>R</sup>, HYG<sup>R</sup>,
					</italic> and

					</italic> alleles with 10<sup>4</sup> or 100 segregants. Even with 100 segregants, the three drug-resistance genes were mapped to within 50 kb of their correct locations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040256-t001">Table 1</xref>; see 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref> for whole-genome maps). No significant correlation was seen between the mapping precision of the three genes and pool size (100, 10<sup>4</sup>, and 10<sup>7</sup> segregants) (

        <p>A variety of factors could cause alleles that contribute to a trait to be absent from some members of a pool that had been selected to express the trait strongly. To examine the robustness of our method to such deviations, we tested whether three drug-resistance genes could be mapped when their enrichment level in the selected pool is close to 70%–75% instead of 90%–100% as with our test case. Thus, we mixed equal amounts of DNA from a pool of segregants selected for resistance to geneticin, hygromycin, and nourseothricin and a control, unselected pool, yielding an approximately 3:1 ratio of target strain polymorphisms to reference polymorphisms in regions linked to the drug resistance genes. Although the LMSs were greatly reduced, we still observed three peaks that corresponded to the three selected genes, demonstrating that we can map alleles that are absent from a substantial fraction of the selected pool (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>J). In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio of the LMSs was still substantially high (

        <title>Computer Simulations of the Mapping Process</title>
        <p>We developed a computer model that simulates the whole mapping process (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) to assess the effect of experimental design (e.g., number of arrays), intrinsic genetic factors (e.g., recombination rate), and adjustable statistical parameters (e.g., 
					<italic>p</italic> value cutoff for SFP detection) on mapping precision. 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g003">Figure 3</xref> presents the effect of the number of array replicates, noise levels between replicate intensities (coefficient of variation, the standard deviation divided by the mean), SFP FDR, SFP density (number of SFPs per 1 kb), and recombination rate on mapping deviation. Aside from the factor being varied, the parameters for the simulations were taken from our mapping experiments. The mapping deviations obtained with simulations are consistent with the experimentally observed mapping deviations for the five test case genes. Of the factors tested, SFP density and recombination rate displayed the strongest effect on mapping precision, with higher SFP density and higher recombination rate improving mapping precision. Even in regions with a ten-fold lower SFP density than average (̃99% of SFPs lie in denser regions; 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>) or a four-fold lower recombination rate than average, our simulations suggest that a gene can successfully be mapped, albeit with lower resolution. We tested the effect of SFP density in our experiments by excluding varying fractions of the SFPs that lay near 
					<italic>KAN<sup>R</sup>
					</italic> from our analysis, to create an SFP density that ranged from 1.8 to 0.2 SFPs/kb. The negative trend of mapping deviation as a function of SFP density seen in simulations (Pearson's correlation coefficient 
					<italic>R<sup>2</sup>
					</italic> = −0.96 for mapping deviation versus logarithm of SFP density) corresponded closely to that observed in this manipulation of our experimental data (
					<italic>R<sup>2</sup>
					</italic> = −0.95). As increased SFP FDR has little impact on mapping precision, especially in our observed experimental range (3%–7%), choosing a more liberal cutoff for identifying SFPs might help to map genes located in regions with low SFP density. In contrast, the number of array replicates and coefficient of variation between replicate intensities show only a weak effect on mapping precision, in particular in the ranges relevant for our study (two to four arrays, and coefficient of variation of 8%–15%). The simulations suggest that duplicate arrays for the selected and control pools suffice, which is in agreement with our mapping results of the test genes (see

The LMS is plotted as a function of chromosome position in 100-kb units for Chromosome 13, where a significant peak was detected in all four strains. The predicted peak centers and estimated 95% confidence intervals are: Ev2, 185.8 ± 27 kb (orange); Ev14, 165.8 ± 39 kb (red); Ev42, 169.8 ± 40 kb (green); and Ev43, 171.8 ± 36 kb (black).

            <p>(A) A schematic depiction of the regulation of the galactose utilization pathway. In the absence of galactose, Gal80 inhibits the transcriptional activator, Gal4, by binding to Gal4 in the nucleus. When galactose is present it enters the cell through Gal2 transporters and binds Gal3, a coinducer of the pathway, which in turn binds Gal80 in the cytoplasm, sequestering Gal80 away from the nucleus. This relieves the repression of Gal4 allowing it to induce the transcription of genes required for galactose uptake and catabolism (
							<italic>GAL</italic> genes), including 
							<italic>GAL2, GAL3, GAL80,</italic> and the genes encoding the enzymes of galactose catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b038">38</xref>]. A similar phenotype is obtained through loss-of-function of the repressor,

						</p>
            <p>(B–E) The 
							<italic>gal80</italic> mutations confer a fitness advantage in transfers of exponentially growing haploid cells from glucose- to galactose-containing medium, but not in transfers in which the carbon source does not change (
							<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Three different sets of 
							<italic>gal80</italic> mutations in the coding region were transformed into the ancestral 
							<italic>GAL80</italic> gene in an ancestral haploid strain (A0) (Ev2 indicates the mutation is from evolved culture 2, etc.). Ev42 and Ev43 have the same mutation in the coding region. Cell density (OD) was measured for each of these strains and for the ancestor and a 
							<italic>GAL80</italic> knockout strain following transfer from glucose- to galactose-containing medium.
						</p>
            <p>(F–I) The four evolved strains are more fit than their ancestor (A0) when transferred from glucose- to galactose-containing medium. Cell density (OD) was measured for the haploid evolved strains Ev2, Ev14, Ev43, and Ev42, and their ancestor, following transfer from medium containing only glucose to medium containing galactose.</p>

        <p>We used

For each of the four evolved strains, about 10<sup>4</sup> Ev/SK1 segregants that expressed high levels of Gal3 fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) were selected using flow cytometry (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The genomic DNA of the control and selected pools were hybridized onto two or three replicate arrays each and the LMS was calculated for the entire genome (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg006">Figure S6</xref>). In all four strains, the adaptive phenotype was mapped to the same region on Chromosome 13 with a mean peak center of 173.3 kb and a mean 95% confidence interval of ±36 kb (±14 cM; 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). An additional peak linked to

					<italic>GAL80,</italic> which encodes the key repressor of the galactose utilization pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b039">39</xref>], lies within 1 kb of the mean center of the linked intervals. We therefore sequenced this gene in the four evolved strains and in the ancestor. One or two missense mutations were found in 
					<italic>GAL80</italic> in all four strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Two of the strains carry the same mutation. One of the mutations, Q392H, has been recently identified in a screen for 
					<italic>GAL80</italic> mutations that cause loss of the Gal80 inhibitory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b040">40</xref>]. Three other mutations, I361M, Q392H, and H36Y, lie in nuclear localization sequence regions of Gal80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b041">41</xref>]. The transcriptional regulation of the galactose utilization pathway, including the role of Gal80, is depicted in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g005">Figure 5</xref>A.
				</p>
        <p>To test whether these mutations account for the adaptive phenotype, the endogenous 
					<italic>GAL80</italic> gene of the ancestral cells was replaced with the three different mutant genes, and the growth curves of these haploid strains were compared to those of the ancestor and a 
					<italic>gal80Δ</italic> strain. Compared to the ancestral allele, all the mutations in 
					<italic>GAL80</italic> conferred a growth advantage during the transition from using glucose as the sole carbon source to galactose (̃2-fold increase at 6 h; 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g005">Figure 5</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g005">5</xref>D). However, no significant growth differences were observed for cells transferred from glucose- to glucose-containing medium or from galactose- to galactose-containing medium (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg007">Figure S7</xref>A–
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg007">S7</xref>H). The ancestral strains carrying the evolved 
					<italic>gal80</italic> mutations behaved similarly to the 
					<italic>gal80Δ</italic> strain, suggesting that the mutations in 
					<italic>GAL80</italic> cause a partial or complete loss-of-function of Gal80′s repressive activity on the galactose utilization pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). Hence, the 
					<italic>gal80</italic> mutations explain the growth advantage observed for the four evolved stains relative to the ancestor following transfer from glucose to galactose (̃1.2–1.9-fold more evolved cells than ancestral cells 6 h after transfer; 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g005">Figure 5</xref>F–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g005">5</xref>I). The slower growth observed for the ancestor compared with the evolved strains in the transition from glucose to galactose is likely the result of a growth delay while the ancestral cells repress Gal80′s inhibitory effect and induce the genes required for galactose uptake and catabolism.
				</p>
        <p>We compared the effects of the mutations in 
					<italic>GAL80</italic> in two strains: the evolved strains and the strains produced by transforming these mutations into the ancestral strain. Ancestral cells carrying only the evolved 
					<italic>gal80</italic> mutations have a larger growth advantage relative to the ancestral 
					<italic>GAL80</italic> strains than do the evolved strains from which these mutations were rescued (compare 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g005">Figure 5</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g005">5</xref>D to 5F–5H). This difference is probably due to one or more other mutations that accumulated in the evolved strains and have a fitness cost under the conditions of our experiment. The slight decrease in fitness observed for the evolved strains (Ev2 and Ev42) relative to the ancestor when transferred from one glucose-containing medium to another supports this hypothesis (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg007">Figure S7</xref>E–

				</p>
        <p>During each cycle of the evolution experiment, diploid evolving cells were transferred from glucose- to galactose-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). This selection prompted us to ask whether a single copy of the 
					<italic>gal80</italic> mutations conferred any advantage on a diploid background. We compared the growth curve of ancestral diploids heterozygous for one of the three sets of 
					<italic>gal80</italic> mutations to that of an ancestral diploid, a

					<italic>gal80Δ</italic> diploid

					<italic>GAL80</italic>/
					<italic>Ev-gal80</italic> diploid and the 
					<italic>GAL80/gal80Δ</italic> diploid compared with the ancestor and the 
					<italic>gal80Δ/gal80Δ</italic> diploid show that all three sets of 
					<italic>gal80</italic> mutations, similar to 
					<italic>gal80Δ,</italic> are phenotypically semidominant. In a molecular sense, this argues that the 
					<italic>GAL80</italic> gene is weakly haploinsufficient, most likely because of its need to titrate Gal4, the transcriptional activator. In an evolutionary sense, our observations suggest that the 
					<italic>gal80</italic> mutations could have been initially selected for when only one copy of the mutation/s was present in the diploid.

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b024">24</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b025">25</xref>]. One advantage of our method is the capacity to predict where the linked locus is most likely to lie within a mapped region, which helps prioritize sequencing and candidate gene testing. Therefore, even though our estimated 95% confidence intervals (20–88 kb [8–35 cM]) are comparable with mapping intervals identified in previous SFP-based methods that analyze ̃20 segregants individually in yeast (8–72 kb [3–29 cM]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b022">22</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b024">24</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b025">25</xref>], the centers of our mapping predictions are typically much closer to the actual mutations. By pooling at least 10,000 segregants from a single cross, we obtained mapping deviations of test genes that ranged from 0.2–24 kb (0.1–10 cM). In four independently evolved populations, mutations in the same gene 
				<italic>(GAL80)</italic> were mapped with a mean mapping deviation of 5.7 kb, and the average position of the four predicted positions was 1 kb from the center of the 
				<italic>GAL80</italic> gene. Furthermore, pooling makes mapping easier and cheaper than analyzing single segregants. We can analyze more than 10<sup>7</sup> selected segregants simultaneously using fewer arrays (a minimum of four) than are needed to individually analyze ̃20 single segregants (20 arrays). In both methods, additional arrays (at least two) are needed for the initial, one-time prediction of SFPs. If necessary, our method can be applied to pools that contain as few as 100 segregants. This is important for organisms that produce few progeny, or for phenotypes that must be assessed by assaying individually selected segregants, which are then assembled into pools, rather than directly selecting on pooled meiotic progeny.
			</p>
      <p>Since our method can simultaneously map multiple genes with high efficiency, including genes lying on the same arm 
				<italic>(HYG<sup>R</sup>
				</italic> and 
				<italic>NAT<sup>R</sup>)
				</italic> and genes affecting a quantitative phenotype 
				<italic>(GAL80),</italic> our method could be useful for multigenic or QTL mapping. This combination of high-throughput genotyping with oligonucleotide arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b022">22</xref>] and pooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b027">27</xref>] has also been applied in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b033">33</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b034">34</xref>], and should accelerate QTL detection compared with traditional single-segregant mapping methods in a wide variety of organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b020">20</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b021">21</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b042">42</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b043">43</xref>]. Our method has advantages and disadvantages compared to other forms of QTL mapping. We do not make assumptions on the number of contributing QTLs or the type of interactions between them, as multiple QTL and composite interval mapping methods must do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b021">21</xref>]. By selecting and genotyping pools with extreme phenotypic values, we gain mapping power, but we cannot estimate the relative effect of individual QTLs on a trait. Previous studies show that QTL effect can be estimated by genotyping pools with broader phenotypic values from the lower and upper tails of the phenotypic distribution and associating the differences in phenotypic means of the two pools to differences in their marker allele frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b035">35</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b044">44</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b045">45</xref>]. Another issue is that pools lack information on the phase between genetic markers (e.g., haplotypes) and QTLs, making it hard to learn about the type of interactions between QTLs (e.g., additive or epistatic) or to recognize distinct subsets of QTLs that can independently give rise to the same trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b027">27</xref>]. Since pool genotyping is commonly used in human association studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b027">27</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b030">30</xref>], it would be interesting to explore whether our method and its statistical framework could be extended to such studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b046">46</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>We developed a computer model that simulates the mapping process to better understand the effects of various factors on mapping precision, and to improve our experimental protocols. The parameters of the model can be adjusted so that the simulations can be applied to other experimental designs, such as backcrosses, and to different organisms. Our simulations suggest that marker density and recombination rate are the major factors affecting mapping precision. While we have generated a very dense genetic map of about 10,300 DNA markers (on average ̃1 SFP/kb), the model predicts that with tighter genetic marker spacing (two to four markers per kb) our method could reach even higher mapping resolutions, corresponding to a few genes in yeast (̃1–2 cM). Tiling arrays that contain oligonucleotides that cover the whole genome and that are available for some organisms (recently including yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b047">47</xref>]) will provide such high SFP coverage. Alternatively, different reference strains with different polymorphism distributions compared with the target strain can be used to increase genome coverage and marker density.

      <p>We showed that four independently evolved strains found the same genetic solution to repeated transitions from glucose- to galactose-containing medium and two of the strains independently acquired the same mutation. All three sets of mutations in 
				<italic>GAL80</italic> reduced its ability to repress genes involved in galactose metabolism. Thus, we observed parallel evolution at the genetic level, as has been seen in viruses, bacteria, and yeast that have been experimentally adapted to stressful conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b001">1</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b002">2</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b004">4</xref>], and in fish with pelvic and armor plate reduction, and albinism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b017">17</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b048">48</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b049">49</xref>]. Mutations in 
				<italic>GAL3</italic> or 
				<italic>GAL4</italic> have been shown to lead to constitutive expression of the galactose utilization pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b050">50</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b051">51</xref>]. We did not find gain-of-function mutations in these genes, most likely because the target size for loss-of-function mutations in 
				<italic>GAL80</italic> is much larger than that for gain-of-function mutations in 
				<italic>GAL3</italic> or 
				<italic>GAL4.</italic> All the missense mutations we found in 
				<italic>GAL80</italic> lie in residues that are highly conserved across yeast species from 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> to 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Kluyveromyces lactis</named-content> (
				<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg008">Figure S8</xref>). Our results, together with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b002">2</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b017">17</xref>], support the notion that mutations in regulatory genes may lead to large benefits in populations subjected to changing environments.
			</p>
      <p>Although much effort has gone into studying evolutionary changes in experimental and natural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b003">3</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b052">52</xref>], many questions remain. Is there correlation between the number, effect, and nature of the adaptive mutations and the molecular pathways that are subjected to the selective pressure? To what extent do evolutionary paths overlap at the genetic level between populations subjected to identical selective pressures and how does such overlap depend on the underlying network? The high-throughput and high-resolution aspects of our mapping method (freely available at 
				<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cgr.harvard.edu/MutationMapping" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cgr.harvard.edu/MutationMapping</ext-link>) make it amenable for such large-scale studies in yeast or higher eukaryotic organisms, as well as for studying the genetic basis of quantitative traits.

The evolved strains originated from strains isogenic with W303 (JYL243 and JYL246).

        <p>To map known genes, the target and reference strains were mated and single, manually isolated diploids were grown overnight in YEP (yeast extract peptone) + 2% potassium acetate (KAc) and then sporulated in 2% KAc for 3 d. Haploid segregants from this cross were grown overnight in one of three liquid media: (1) synthetic medium lacking arginine, lysine, and containing canavanine (complete synthetic media [CSM] − lysine − arginine + 60 μg/ml L-canavanine [Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States]) to select for Lys<sup>+</sup>, Can<sup>r</sup> cells; (2) rich medium containing geneticin, hygromycin, and nourseothricin (YPD [1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose] + 400 μg/ml geneticin [G418; Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, California, United States] + 300 μg/ml hygromycin B [Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States] + 100 μg/ml nourseothricin [Clonat; Werner BioAgents, Jena, Germany]) to select for Kan<sup>r</sup>, Hyg<sup>r</sup>, Nat<sup>r</sup> cells; or (3) rich medium (YPD) to produce the control pool. To select for 100 segregants, the asci of the sporulated hybrid diploid were digested and the spores were immediately plated on selective medium. Colonies (100) representing individual segregants were picked and mixed in equal amounts.

        <title>Evolution experiment.</title>
        <p>The four evolved populations originated from the same ancestral strain in four separate, replicate experiments. In each cycle of evolution, haploid cells were grown in glucose-containing media for 4 d, mated on YPD plates and transferred to galactose-containing media for 2 d, and then put through a sporulation cycle. There were 36 such cycles for each population. The primary motivation of this experiment was to evolve mating discrimination (described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b037">37</xref>]). The evolving and ancestral cells were genetically designed so that cycles of exposure to glucose and galactose would contribute to the selection for an altered mating preference in the evolving population. During the whole procedure, the effective population size was maintained at more than 10<sup>5</sup> cells.

A local median was calculated for each feature as the median intensity of an invariant set of PM features (nonpolymorphic between the target and reference strains) that fell within a window of 30 by 30 features centered around the given feature.

We hybridized the genomic DNA of S288c and YJM789 onto eight arrays each and SFPs were predicted using the array preprocessing and normalization, and SFP identification algorithms described above. The false-positive rate calculated for S288c/YJM789 can be used to estimate an FDR between any two strains at a given significance level and given number of array replicates. For this, an estimated number of false-positive SFPs between the two strains, calculated as the S288c/YJM789 false-positive rate times the estimated number of nonpolymorphic features between the two given strains, is divided by the total number of features scored as polymorphic.

No shuffling was done between replicate array intensities or between the intensities of the selected and control pools. For each shuffling, the LMS was calculated across the entire genome and the maximum LMS value was recorded. This process was repeated 1,000 times, and the maximum LMS values from each shuffling were ranked. The 99th percentile of the ranked values was taken as the significant peak threshold.

        <p>To estimate the 95% confidence intervals for a predicted linked region, a simulated target locus was positioned at the predicted center, and the 95th percentile of the ranked mapping deviations from 1,000 simulation runs was recorded. The distribution of SFP positions observed in our mapping experiments for a given chromosome was used for the simulations, as well as the observed mean intensities and coefficients of variation of the target strain and control pool at the corresponding SFPs. The estimated 95% confidence intervals are rough estimates, as a uniform mean recombination rate is assumed across the whole genome due to lack of detailed data on the local variation in recombination rate. As a result, when local recombination rates are higher than average, the 95% confidence intervals are placed too far away from the predicted position of the target locus, and when local rates are lower than average the intervals are placed too close to the predicted position.</p>

True-positive rate refers to the fraction of features that are truly polymorphic that are scored as polymorphic; false-positive rate refers to the fraction of nonpolymorphic features that are scored as polymorphic; and FDR refers to the fraction of features that are scored as polymorphic that are not truly polymorphic. The true S288c/YJM789 SFPs were determined by blasting the Affymetrix probe sequences that were derived from the S288c genome, against the YJM789 genome. Of the 120,050 Affymetrix probes tested, 107,448 were found to be nonpolymorphic between the strains, and 12,602 were found to be polymorphic (SFPs). The rates presented here were calculated using a one-tailed two-sample 
						<italic>t</italic> test between eight replicate arrays for each strain. When considering only the SFPs whose polymorphisms lie in the central 15 bp of the 25mer probe (7,588 SFPs), the true-positive rate of SFP identification increased by 15%–30% compared with using all SFPs (third column). The true-positive rate is plotted as a function of false-positive rate (B) and FDR (C) in percentages over a

						<italic>p</italic> = 10<sup>−6</sup> gave the maximum true-positive–to–false discovery rate ratio (labeled in red in panels [A], [B], and [C]). We used the FDR and not the false-positive rate to evaluate the specificity of our SFP identification, as the fraction of SFPs that are false is more relevant for mapping.

To increase mapping sensitivity, a control pool could be made up of segregants from the opposite extreme tail of the phenotype distribution to that of the selected pool (i.e., segregants that do not express the trait of interest or that express it to a low extent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b045">45</xref>] instead of segregants randomly sampled from the phenotype distribution (as was done in this work). This should be especially useful for target loci that have an approximately additive effect. Furthermore, our simulation model can be used to estimate significant peak cutoffs given different projected levels of enrichment of the target alleles in the selected pool.

          <p>W303/SK1 segregants that expressed high levels of Gal3-GFP were selected using flow cytometry and mapped. The LMS is plotted across all 16 yeast chromosomes for each of the four evolved strains: Ev2 (A), Ev14 (B), Ev42 (C), and Ev43 (D). The horizontal dashed lines mark the significant peak cutoffs estimated for each selected pool of Evolved/SK1 segregants at 99% confidence. The peak on Chromosome 13 is strongly linked to 
						<italic>GAL80,</italic> in which we subsequently found missense mutations that were confirmed experimentally to be adaptive in all four strains. The peak on Chromosome 4 found only in Ev2 coincides with the 
						<italic>GAL3</italic> locus that was fused to a GFP. This peak did not appear in the other three strains, since only the initial Ev2/SK1 hybrid diploid had one copy of 
						<italic>GAL3-GFP</italic> in the evolved strain's chromosome copy and not in the reference strain's copy (SK1). In the other Ev/Sk1 diploids, 
						<italic>GAL3-GFP</italic> was present on both copies of Chromosome 4. A sliding window of 50 SFPs was used for all plots. The 
						<italic>x</italic>-axis labels are the numbers of the chromosomes, which are shown to scale.

          <p>We tested the effect of the LMS smoothing window size on mapping precision, using simulations where target loci positioned in the middle of a representative yeast chromosome of length 700 kb were mapped. The mapping deviation is the absolute difference of the predicted target locus position from its simulated position in kb. Each datapoint is averaged over the mapping deviations of 11 different target loci positioned in 10-kb increments from positions 300 kb to 400 kb along the chromosome. For each window size the standard deviation between the mapping deviations of the eleven loci is represented with error bars. Aside from the smoothing window size variable, parameters were set according to those used or observed in our mapping test case (for more details see the Mapping Simulations section in 
						<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Mapping deviation decreases as a function of smoothing window size in the range of 10–30 SFPs per window, while in the range of 30–50 SFPs, mapping deviation is at best weakly dependent on window size.

          <p>We tested the effect of different array preprocessing methods on mapping precision and found that our method is fairly insensitive to the method used. The mapping deviations of the predicted positions of the five test case genes from their real centers are given in kb. The 10,330 W303-SK1 SFPs identified using the PM-MM preprocessing method at a 
						<italic>p</italic> value cutoff of 10<sup>−6</sup> were used for the comparison. The mean mapping deviations and standard deviations for 
						<italic>KAN<sup>R</sup>, HYG<sup>R</sup>,
						</italic> and 
						<italic>NAT<sup>R</sup>
						</italic> were calculated from three separate mapping experiments. To calculate a local background (b1, b2, b3) we divided the array into 10 × 10 squares and subtracted the following values from each PM: (1) median of the MM values lying in the square encompassing the given PM (b1); (2) mean of the lower 5% of ranked PM and MM values in the corresponding square (b2); and (3) mean of the lower 2% of ranked PM values in the corresponding square (b3). These methods are similar to those used by the Affymetrix GeneChip software (

All intensities were normalized by a median of a spatially local set of invariant PM values. For log<sub>10</sub> PM the logarithm of PM was divided by the median log<sub>10</sub> PM of the local invariant probes, similar to the approach used in previous single segregant mapping methods in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b022">22</xref>,

						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040256-b025">25</xref>]. In the software of our mapping method, the user will have the option of choosing between different array preprocessing methods, including those that do not use the MM, and will be able to adjust tunable parameters, such as the percentile of ranked intensities used for background subtraction (
						<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cgr.harvard.edu/MutationMapping" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cgr.harvard.edu/MutationMapping</ext-link>). This will allow users to find the optimal method for their mapping system.

          <title>The Effect of Using Different Array Preprocessing Methods for Identifying SFPs on Mapping Precision</title>
          <p>The mapping precision of our method is robust to the array preprocessing method used for calling features polymorphic (SFPs) at a 
						<italic>p</italic> value cutoff of 10<sup>−6</sup>. Different probe preprocessing methods were used to identify SFPs, and the linkage analysis was then done using the PM-MM preprocessing method. This allowed us to isolate the effect of the preprocessing method used to find SFPs on mapping precision. The mapping deviations of the predicted positions of the five test case genes from their real centers are given in kilobases. Although the true-positive–to–false discovery rate ratios may vary between the different methods (unpublished data), this does not appear to have a significant effect on the final outcome of the mapping. This is in accordance with the prediction of our simulations, that false SFPs do not have a significant effect on mapping precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040256-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The local backgrounds (b1, b3) are defined in
