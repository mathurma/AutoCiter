</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Asymmetric segregation of damaged proteins at cell division generates a cell that retains damage and a clean cell that supports population survival. In cells that divide asymmetrically, such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, segregation of damaged proteins is achieved by retention and active transport. We have previously shown that in the symmetrically dividing <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> there is a transition between symmetric and asymmetric segregation of damaged proteins. Yet how this transition and generation of damage-free cells are achieved remained unknown. Here, by combining <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of Hsp104-associated aggregates, a form of damage, with mathematical modeling, we find that fusion of protein aggregates facilitates asymmetric segregation. Our model predicts that, after stress, the increased number of aggregates fuse into a single large unit, which is inherited asymmetrically by one daughter cell, whereas the other one is born clean. We experimentally confirmed that fusion increases segregation asymmetry, for a range of stresses, and identified Hsp16 as a fusion factor. Our work shows that fusion of protein aggregates promotes the formation of damage-free cells. Fusion of cellular factors may represent a general mechanism for their asymmetric segregation at division.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During their lifetime, cells accumulate damage that is inherited by the daughter cells when the mother cell divides. The amount of inherited damage determines how long the daughter cell will live and how fast it will age. We have discovered fusion of protein aggregates as a new strategy that cells use to apportion damage asymmetrically during division. By combining live-cell imaging with a mathematical model, we show that fission yeast cells divide the damage equally between the two daughter cells, but only as long as the amount of damage is low and harmless. However, when the cells are stressed and the damage accumulates to higher levels, the aggregated proteins fuse into a single clump, which is then inherited by one daughter cell, while the other cell is born clean. This form of damage control may be a universal survival strategy for a range of cell types, including stem cells, germ cells, and cancer cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A dividing cell can deal with damaged material in two different ways. First, the damaged material can be segregated asymmetrically during division, such that it is concentrated in one of the two newborn daughter cells, while the other cell is born clean. The damage is then removed from the population when the cell retaining the damaged material dies. Second, in phases of rapid growth, damaged material can be segregated randomly, leading to less asymmetric segregation of damage between daughters. In this case, accumulation of damage within any cell is prevented by rapid divisions that dilute the damaged material.</p>
<p>Protein aggregates are a type of damaged material, composed of insoluble and dense protein particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Eichner1">[1]</xref>. These aggregates, instead of being degraded, accumulate in the cell during stress and aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Aguilaniu1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-BenZvi1">[4]</xref>. Once formed, aggregates can interfere with cell cycle progression and cell function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Olzscha1">[5]</xref> and correlate with cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>. To deal with protein aggregates during cell division, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, as well as stem cells, use asymmetric segregation, where aggregates are retained by one cell, generating a clean sister cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Aguilaniu1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Lindner1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Rujano1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Liu2">[10]</xref>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, protein aggregates accumulate at the cell poles and often segregate with the old cell pole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Lindner1">[3]</xref>. In the case of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, asymmetric segregation of aggregates is achieved through a combination of retention in specialized compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Liu1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Spokoini1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Specht1">[14]</xref>, active transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Liu1">[8]</xref>, and limited diffusion through the bud neck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Zhou1">[9]</xref>. However, the mechanisms underlying aggregate segregation in eukaryotic cells that divide symmetrically are unclear.</p>
<p>We have recently shown that the symmetrically dividing fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> does not show aging under favorable conditions, which suggests that aggregates are segregated symmetrically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>. After stress, however, the cells inheriting large aggregates do age and eventually die, while their sisters with small or no aggregates do not age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>. How a large aggregate arises after stress, and how the generation of aggregate-free cells is achieved, remained unknown.</p>
<p>Here we study the mechanism underlying the transition from symmetric to asymmetric aggregate segregation. By combining <italic>in vivo</italic> quantification of aggregate nucleation, movement, fusion, and segregation with a mathematical model, we show that under favorable conditions aggregates fuse rarely and segregate symmetrically at division. Using the total amount of aggregates, measured as the total fluorescence intensity in puncta of the GFP-tagged Hsp104 disaggregase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>, to identify different levels of aggregation in response to stress, our experiments show that an increase in fusion facilitates asymmetric segregation of aggregates and production of aggregate-free cells. These results are consistent with the predictions of our model, which provides support for the conclusion that the formation of damage-free cells is promoted by aggregate fusion.</p>

<title>Protein Aggregate Dynamics <italic>in Vivo</italic>: Nucleation, Movement, and Fusion</title>
<p>We monitored protein aggregates using the Hsp104 disaggregase, a chaperone that binds and separates aggregated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Parsell1">[15]</xref>, labeled with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s001">Figure S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s008">Text S1</xref>). We have shown before that Hsp104 from <italic>S. pombe</italic> is active as a disaggregase <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref> and that the puncta of Hsp104-GFP observed in the cytoplasm represent endogenous aggregates. We also observed diffuse Hsp104-GFP in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and in the cytoplasm (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s002">Figure S2F</xref>), as shown previously in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Tkach1">[16]</xref>. While the lower disaggregase activity of Hsp104 from <italic>S. pombe</italic>, when compared to its <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homolog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>, likely accounts for the presence of aggregates under favorable conditions, deleting hsp104 resulted in increased aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s001">Figure S1F</xref>–I) and increased cell death after stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>, while labeling the endogenous Hsp104 with GFP has no effect on stress recovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>.

<p>To study aggregate dynamics during the cell cycle, we followed Hsp104-associated aggregates with wide-field fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Aggregates nucleated equally often in each of the two respective cytoplasmic regions (compartments) between the nucleus and the old cell pole, and the nucleus and the new cell pole, generated in the previous division (1.3±0.2 nucleation events/cell cycle, <italic>n</italic> = 162 cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). After nucleation, aggregates typically remained in the same compartment (only 3.2±1.5% of aggregates moved between the compartments, <italic>n</italic> = 126 cells). Aggregates moved and contact between them resulted in their fusion (94/100 contacts resulted in fusion; 0.40±0.06 fusion events/cell cycle, <italic>n</italic> = 200 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s005">Movie S1</xref>). Fission of aggregates was rare (0.006±0.005 events/cell cycle), and disappearance of aggregates was not observed (<italic>n</italic> = 498 cells). We tracked individual aggregates on time scales from milliseconds to tens of minutes and observed dynamics suggesting diffusive motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s002">S2C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s006">Movie S2</xref>). To test whether aggregate movement was diffusive and not linked with the movement of other subcellular components, we performed a combination of tests, which confirmed that aggregates (1) move according to Stokes diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, inset), (2) do not co-localize with the cytoskeleton (actin or microtubules) or a wide range of lipid structures (cellular membrane, endosomes, Golgi, vacuoles, and nuclear membrane) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s002">Figure S2G and S2H</xref>), and (3) still undergo diffusion and fusion when the cytoskeleton is depolymerized (Figures S2I–K; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s008">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We next studied how aggregates are segregated between cells at division. Because aggregates nucleate and move randomly, we hypothesized that sister cells arising from a morphologically symmetrical division inherit the same number of aggregates on average. Indeed, the aggregates did not segregate specifically to a cell inheriting the new or the old pole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s002">Figure S2B</xref>; the small bias can be a consequence of the displacement of aggregates towards the old pole by the nucleus during anaphase). In the wild type, the two equally sized sister cells inherited on average the same number of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). Because asymmetric cell division may lead to biased segregation of aggregates towards the larger sister cell, we enforced asymmetry in cell division by using a Δ<italic>pom1</italic> mutant, in which the division plane is displaced off-center, resulting in two cells of different size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Bahler1">[17]</xref>. We observed that cells were up to 70% larger than their smaller sisters, and larger cells retained correspondingly more aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s007">Movie S3</xref>). These results show that aggregate segregation in <italic>S. pombe</italic> is unbiased. We conclude that aggregate nucleation and movement is random, resulting in random aggregate segregation at division.</p>

<title>The Stochastic Aggregation Model Predicts Unbiased Aggregate Segregation at Cell Division</title>
<p>Based on our experimental observations, we developed a stochastic aggregation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) that allows for the simulation of aggregate size distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which can be compared with the experimentally observed size distributions (measured by the intensity of Hsp104-GFP in each puncta, a.u.).

<p>(A) The model. Smallest size aggregates (gray) are generated (<italic>gen</italic>) and fuse, resulting in nucleation (<italic>nuc</italic>) of an aggregate of size ≥ <italic>ν</italic> (green, <italic>ν = </italic>visibility threshold), fusion events (<italic>fus</italic>) between aggregates of size ≥ <italic>ν</italic>, and growth (<italic>gro</italic>) of an aggregate of size ≥ <italic>ν</italic> due to fusion with an aggregate of size &lt; <italic>ν</italic>. Aggregates are randomly assigned to one of the two new compartments at division. (B) Aggregate size distribution (a.u.) averaged across the cell population. Aggregate amount from the experiment was compared with aggregate sizes from the model by scaling, with a scaling parameter <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s003">Figure S3A</xref>).

<p>Three key processes operate on size distributions of aggregates in each of the two compartments of a cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g002">Figure 2A</xref>): (1) generation of the smallest size aggregates at rate <italic>r</italic>; (2) fusion of aggregates of sizes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> at rate <italic>K</italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>) to create an aggregate of size <italic>i</italic>+<italic>j</italic>; and (3) random segregation of aggregates to two new compartments at division. We use the Brownian kernel:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001886.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001886.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic> = <italic>K</italic>(1,1) is a parameter to be determined. This well-established kernel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Drake1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Aldous1">[22]</xref> can be derived from Brownian diffusion of aggregates with Stokes friction, a fusion rate increasing in proportion to the sum of the aggregates' radii, and aggregate packing such that size (volume) is proportional to radius cubed. In this manner, the effect of spatial diffusion on fusion rate is incorporated into the model, without explicitly simulating spatial diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Zhou1">[9]</xref>. We introduce a visibility threshold <italic>ν</italic> below which aggregates cannot be detected by wide-field fluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). A visible nucleation event occurs when two nondetectable aggregates fuse, forming a detectable one.</p>
<p>Generation and fusion of aggregates within compartments were simulated with a stochastic aggregation algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Laurenzi1">[23]</xref>, which in turn was embedded within another algorithm that implemented random aggregate segregation among compartments at division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s008">Text S1</xref>). The testable predictions of our model are (i) large aggregates are rare, while small ones are more abundant; (ii) an increase in the number of aggregates at cell birth gives rise to a decrease in aggregate nucleation and (iii) to an increase in fusion; (iv) at cell division, the pattern of aggregate segregation into the daughter cells is between a completely symmetric and a random one; and (v) aggregate fusion increases their segregation asymmetry at cell division and promotes the birth of aggregate-free cells. These model predictions are general features of the model behavior and are not dependent on specific parameter values. We will now compare predictions i–iv with our experimental results. Prediction v will be tested in the response-to-stress extension of the model described below.</p>
<p>The experimentally measured size distribution of aggregates shows that small aggregates are found more frequently than large ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), confirming prediction i. Whereas the experimentally measured number of fusion events increases with the total number of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), the number of nucleation events shows the opposite trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), confirming predictions ii and iii. The model therefore shows that in the presence of a high number of visible aggregates, an invisible aggregate is increasingly likely to fuse with a visible aggregate rather than fusing with another invisible aggregate to create a visible aggregate, which is observed as nucleation. Parameter values were then fitted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) to obtain quantitative as well as qualitative consistency for these three predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s008">Text S1</xref>). The parameter values were additionally corroborated by theoretical arguments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s008">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>The parameterized model predicts a pattern of aggregate segregation at cell division by aggregate number that is between completely symmetric segregation, where the difference in the aggregate number is the minimal possible, and fully random segregation, where each aggregate can segregate to either of the two newborn cells, corresponding to the model without compartmentalization. The experimentally measured segregation pattern closely matches that predicted by the model, thereby confirming prediction iv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, our results do not support a biased segregation (by compartment) of aggregates in fission yeast.</p>

<title>Aggregates Fuse Before Segregating Asymmetrically Under Stress Conditions</title>
<p>If the average aggregate amount formed per cell cycle is substantially less than the amount which affects cell growth (death threshold “<italic>d</italic>”, 5 a.u.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>, symmetric segregation at division is sufficient to dilute the aggregates and allow survival, but if the average amount is more than what would be required to kill both daughter cells, asymmetric segregation may be necessary for one of the daughter cells to survive.</p>
<p>We tested the effect of a range of aggregate levels on segregation dynamics and on cell viability. To increase the aggregate amount, we used stress conditions such as oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and transient or continuous heat stress (T = 40°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Both types of stress increased the number of aggregate nucleation and fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). As in the control situation, aggregate movement after heat stress was consistent with Stokes diffusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>) and 97 out of 103 aggregate contacts resulted in fusion. During recovery from stress, aggregates did not co-localize significantly with actin structures or microtubules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). As under control conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s002">Figure S2J</xref>), nucleation and fusion of aggregates after stress occurred also in the absence of actin or microtubule structures (for cells treated with Lat.B or MBC, 94/102 or 90/97 contacts resulted in fusion, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). Remarkably, fusion converted the aggregates into a single large one within the first few cell cycles after stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This single aggregate was asymmetrically segregated to one of the sister cells at division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), while the other sister cell was born without aggregates (segregation was not biased towards the old or the new cell pole; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4E</xref>). Cells with an aggregate amount greater than <italic>d</italic> typically died (28/49 cells), whereas their sisters survived (48/49 cells), indicating that the clearance of aggregates through asymmetric segregation is important for viability. To address whether the aggregate number has an effect on the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Rujano1">[7]</xref> of cells born with similar aggregate amounts, we compared the division time of cells inheriting only one aggregate with that of cells inheriting two or more aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4F</xref>). We observed no significant difference in the division time of cells containing one or more aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4F</xref>), which agrees with our previous observation that the total aggregate amount correlates more strongly with cell death than aggregate number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>.</p>

<p>To test whether the transition to asymmetric segregation could be reproduced theoretically, we introduced stress into the model, using the parameters fitted for control conditions. We raised the aggregate generation rate <italic>r</italic> to obtain the experimentally observed aggregate nucleation upon heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) in one simulated cell cycle, and then returned <italic>r</italic> to the control value and simulated for another cycle before the first cell division (<italic>r</italic> values are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), to account for the duration of the experimental stress recovery. The experimentally observed size distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4G</xref>), dependence of fusion on the number of aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4H</xref>), and aggregate segregation patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4I</xref>) were consistent with the model including stress, indicating that the model is robust. The model shows a 10-fold increase in the number of fusion events compared to the control situation, which is explained by the increased aggregate number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4H</xref>). Fusion causes a shift toward large aggregate sizes after stress, and faster recovery to the control size distribution for small aggregate sizes at division 2, in both model predictions and experimental results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4G</xref>). Thus, the stochastic aggregation model is consistent with the observed aggregate behavior after stress.</p>
<p>To understand which segregation modes maximize daughter cell survival for a given total aggregate amount, we model the effect of the segregation asymmetry on cell survival by assuming that, as observed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>, a cell dies if it has a total aggregate amount at birth above the death threshold <italic>d</italic>. This leads to three distinct optimal segregation regimes that maximize the number of surviving cells: (1) any segregation asymmetry when the total aggregate amount at division is below <italic>d</italic>, (2) low segregation asymmetry when the amount is between <italic>d</italic> and 2<italic>d</italic>, and (3) high asymmetry when the amount is above 2<italic>d</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, scheme and corresponding gray regions in graph).</p>
<p>The model predicts that fusion facilitates asymmetric segregation in response to different levels of stress, where high asymmetry is optimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, filled circles). This behavior was also observed experimentally for a range of stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, filled squares). We observed that in divisions 2 and 3 after stress, the percentage of cells born without aggregates was higher for stress conditions that originated in a higher aggregate amount (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4J</xref>). This phenomenon can be explained by the higher number of fusion events observed for high stress levels (e.g., heat stress as opposed to oxidative stress; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), which can result in the faster generation of a single large aggregate. Once large aggregates are formed, nucleation of aggregates decreases in favor of the growth of the large aggregates: as observed for unstressed cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4C</xref>), the nonvisible aggregates have a higher probability to fuse with large preexisting aggregates. We conclude that in response to increased aggregate amount, an increase in fusion leads to fewer aggregates and thus more asymmetric segregation, which promotes the formation of aggregate-free cells.</p>

<title>Hsp16-Mediated Aggregate Fusion Facilitates Asymmetric Segregation</title>
<p>The model predicts that reducing fusion decreases segregation asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, empty circles). To test the prediction, we needed to identify a molecular factor that would reduce fusion. Small heat shock proteins are a special class of chaperones, which bind and sequester misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Haslbeck1">[24]</xref>. The fission yeast small heat-shock protein 16 (Hsp16) was described to co-aggregate with misfolded proteins during stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Hirose1">[25]</xref>; therefore, we hypothesized that Hsp16 has a role in the fusion of aggregated proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, we observed that when we deleted Hsp16, the number of aggregate contacts resulting in fusion decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4A and 4E</xref>) and aggregate fusion per cell cycle also decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), which correlated with an increase in the number of cells containing aggregates in the population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4M</xref>). Aggregate nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) per cell cycle was not significantly altered in the absence of Hsp16. The total amount of aggregates was unaffected by the deletion of Hsp16 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4L</xref>), which argues against the possibility that in the absence of Hsp16 there are generally more damaged proteins. Thus, Hsp16 is primarily an aggregate fusion factor.</p>
<p>The decrease in fusion efficiency was specific to Hsp16 deletion, as deleting Hsp40 or Hsp70, molecular chaperones that participate in protein disaggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Glover1">[26]</xref>, did not interfere with fusion or fission significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4A, 4B, and 4D</xref>). Contrary to Hsp16 deletion, deleting Hsp40 or Hsp70 caused an increase in aggregate nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and total amount per cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4L</xref>), whereas an increase in total aggregate number per cell was observed in all three deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s004">Figure S4M</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the increase in the number of aggregates in Δhsp16 cells compared to the wild type is a consequence of reduced fusion.</p>
<p>We proceeded to test the prediction of the model in the strain deleted for Hsp16. We observed that decrease in fusion resulted in a decrease in the segregation asymmetry of aggregate amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>), as expected from the model where, as a qualitative approximation, aggregates were not allowed to fuse after stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The model including aggregate fusion also precisely predicted the fraction of cells born without stress-induced aggregates at each division after stress in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Remarkably, in spite of the fact that 10 aggregates on average were formed after stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), by the second and third division, ∼15% and 50% of the cells were born clean of aggregates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Importantly, when the aggregates were not allowed to fuse in the model including stress, the fraction of cells born free of aggregates was halved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Parameter sensitivity analysis shows that the fraction of cells born clean after stress is highly sensitive to the strength of the fusion process during recovery (k), and is also decreased by a faster generation of aggregates (r) during stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), as would be intuitively expected. The average number of aggregates per cell immediately after stress is increased by generation during stress (r) and decreased by fusion combining aggregates together (k) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Both the fraction of cells born clean and the number of aggregates after stress are insensitive to the generation rate and fusion rate before stress was applied, as well as to the number of aggregates with which the first cells in the simulations were initialized.</p>
<p>As predicted by the model without fusion, we observed in the experiments a ∼50% decrease in the fraction of aggregate-free cells in Δhsp16 compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4H</xref>), which correlated with an increase in the fraction of dead cells after heat stress (17±2% in Δhsp16 versus 9±1% in wild type, mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 123 and 140 cells, respectively). We conclude that fusion facilitates asymmetric damage segregation and accelerates the generation of cells clean of stress-induced aggregates, as stated in prediction v described above.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show that fusion of aggregated proteins into a single large unit is sufficient to establish asymmetric segregation of damage, thereby generating a cell clean of aggregates. Below we explore how fusion compares to other mechanisms described to establish asymmetric segregation at cell division, and how fusion might represent a general strategy for asymmetric segregation of cellular components.</p>

<title>Asymmetry in Response to Damage</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that the symmetrically dividing cells of <italic>S. pombe</italic> undergo a transition to highly asymmetric segregation of protein aggregates, which is facilitated by aggregate fusion. As we observed that aggregates occur in the absence of Hsp104, both under favorable and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s001">Figure S1F</xref>–H), fusion is likely occurring for aggregated proteins in general, and is not specific of Hsp104-associated aggregates.</p>
<p>In response to increased aggregate nucleation, two distinct mechanisms—stochastic movement and chaperone-mediated fusion of aggregates—combine to generate a single large unit of damage, which has to be segregated asymmetrically, resulting in the birth of a damage-free cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001886-g004">Figure 4I</xref>). Creation of a single large unit requires extensive fusion, which is promoted by an increase in the number of aggregates and a higher Hsp16 chaperone level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001886.s001">Figure S1F</xref>), as a consequence of heat stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Chen1">[27]</xref>. It is possible that fusion has a cytoprotective effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Arrasate1">[28]</xref> by merging the aggregates in a single unit, such as during the first two cell cycles following stress recovery, before a clean cell is born. However, irrespective of the number of aggregates, if the cell is born with a total aggregate amount above the death threshold, this cell is likely to die <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Due to the geometry of cell division in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the asymmetry in segregation can only be established at the second division after stress. This becomes clear when considering the extreme scenario where all aggregates fuse into a unit in both cell compartments within the first cell cycle after stress. In this case, each sibling receives one large aggregate after the first division. In the second division, 50% of cells inherit this single aggregate, while their sisters are born clean. This, however, occurred only in a smaller percentage of the cells. The cells took, on average, one extra cell cycle to generate an aggregate-free cell, at the third division. This delay may be because the frequency of aggregate fusion events decreases over the first and second division, as the total number of aggregates is reduced. It is likely that the activated stress response promotes survival of cells with a high total aggregate amount for more than two divisions after stress, to ensure survival until cells with nonlethal amounts of aggregates are generated.</p>

<title>Fusion as a General Mechanism for Asymmetry</title>
<p>Fusing a number of molecules/components in a cell represents an opportunity to segregate asymmetrically. In mathematical terms, fusion increases the difference between the number of aggregates inherited by daughter cells at segregation. While low numbers of a component that is randomly segregated at division assures a higher variability in individual cells in the population, the formation of a unitary component assures a complete asymmetry in segregation that might be important when minimizing damage or maximizing resources. Fusion might also be a mechanism to establish asymmetry in the localization of aggregated functional molecules within the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Caudron1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Lee1">[37]</xref>, as an increase in the size of the aggregate will lower its diffusion or cause it to be physically trapped between large organelles.

Under favorable conditions, 99.7% of cell complete mitosis successfully <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Coelho1">[6]</xref>. Strains were constructed using a PCR-based gene targeting technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Bahler2">[43]</xref>, where the label was inserted in the C-terminal region of the target gene in the native genomic locus, keeping it under the control of native expression regulators.</p>

<title>Imaging Protein Aggregates Labeled with Hsp104-GFP</title>
<p>Cells were imaged in a DeltaVision core microscope, with a motorized XYZ stage (AppliedPrecision, USA). An Olympus UPlanSApo 100× 1.4 NA Oil (R.I. 1.516) immersion objective was used (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The illumination was provided by a LED (transmitted light) and Lumicore solid-state illuminator (SSI-Lumencore, fluorescence), and the images were acquired with a Cool Snap HQ2 camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA) and the SoftWorx software (AppliedPrecision, USA), using 2×2 pixel binning, to minimize light exposure (pixel size = 0.1288 µm). For long-term time lapse imaging, Z-stacks for 6–12 nonoverlapping imaging areas in the sample were acquired every 10 min (total time = 20 h) and in short time-lapses every minute (total time = 1–3 h). For single Z-stacks cells were imaged with exposure = 0.05–0.20 s, 2%–50% transmission, depending on the protein and fluorescent label. As a control for photo-toxicity, cell cycle duration and protein aggregate number were measured and found similar in the presence and absence of continuous illumination.</p>
<p>To quantify the total number of aggregates and to visualize small fast-moving aggregates and fusion events, we used highly inclined and laminated optical sheet microscopy (HILO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Tokunaga1">[44]</xref> with a high laser power, on a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy setup. Whereas TIRF illuminates up to 200 nm from the surface of the coverslip, HILO allowed us to image deeper in the cytoplasm, up to a depth of about 1.5 µm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Tokunaga1">[44]</xref>. An Olympus-IX71 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) inverted microscope was used. Incidence angle of a DPSS 491 nm laser was changed to allow for excitation of the fluorophores in the sample up to 1 µm deep (1/3 of the cell volume was illuminated). Cells close to the glass surface of a MatTek dish (MatTek, Ashland, USA) were imaged, one at a time, with continuous excitation and laser power of 80% for fast imaging (200 frames/s, duration 20 s) and 10% for slow imaging (10 frames/s). An Olympus PlanApo 100×1.45 NA TIRFM objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and an Andor iXon EM+ DU-897 BV EMCCD (Andor, Belfast, UK) camera were used. Images were acquired while incubating the cells in EMM at 25°C, in order to decrease autofluorescence.</p>

<title>Co-Localization Between Protein Aggregates and Subcellular Structures</title>
<p>Protein aggregates and subcellular structures were imaged simultaneously to test for co-localization and coordinated movement using bright field, a complementary set of fluorescent proteins (GFP, RFP, or mCherry) and dyes (Phalloidin and FM-464). We labeled protein aggregates indirectly with Hsp104-GFP or Hsp104-mCherry. Bright field was used to directly visualize cell poles and the division plane. Actin was indirectly labeled <italic>in vivo</italic> by expressing a calmodulin domain coupled to an N-terminal GFP (GFP-CHD) and directly labeled <italic>ex vivo</italic> in formaldehyde fixed cells with 2.5 µM phalloidin. Microtubules and the microtubule nucleating center (the spindle-pole body, SPB) were directly labeled using two structural components, atb2-mCherry and sid4-RFP, respectively. The nuclear membrane was directly labeled with bqt4-mCherry, an integral nuclear membrane protein. Incubating cells in 1 mM FM-464 for 10 h resulted in the direct labeling of several lipid structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001886-Bolte1">[45]</xref> (cellular membrane, vacuoles, endosomes, and the Golgi complex).</p>
