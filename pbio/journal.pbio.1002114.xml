<abstract>
<p>Protein quality control is essential for clearing misfolded and aggregated proteins from the cell, and its failure is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we identify two genes, <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic>, that when inactivated, synergistically and robustly suppress neurotoxicity associated with misfolded proteins in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Loss of human orthologs ubiquitination factor E4 B (UBE4B) and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), respectively encoding a ubiquitin ligase and a lysine-specific demethylase, promotes the clearance of misfolded proteins in mammalian cells by activating both proteasomal and autophagic degradation machineries. An unbiased search in this pathway reveals a downstream effector as the transcription factor p53, a shared substrate of UBE4B and LSD1 that functions as a key regulator of protein quality control to protect against proteotoxicity. These studies identify a new protein quality control pathway via regulation of transcription factors and point to the augmentation of protein quality control as a wide-spectrum antiproteotoxicity strategy.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>To function properly, proteins must assume their correct three-dimensional shapes. There are numerous mechanisms within the cell, collectively referred to as protein quality control (PQC), that verify proper folding. If abnormal folding is detected, PQC can either help the protein to refold or target it for degradation. Failures in protein folding and PQC lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which often self-associate into large aggregations that are thought to be the underlying cause of several neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we use the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as a model to understand how cells handle disease-associated misfolded proteins. In a large-scale genetic screen, we discovered two suppressor genes, <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic>, which encode a ubiquitin ligase and a lysine-specific demethylase, respectively. When these two proteins are inactivated, we observe a marked reduction in the toxicity of several misfolded proteins. <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-</italic>5 are conserved in humans (UBE4B and LSD1, respectively), as are their effects on misfolded proteins. We show that UBE4B and LSD1 regulate the activity of protein degradation machineries including the proteasome and autophagosomes. Using microarrays and biochemical analyses, we identify p53 as a key downstream transcription factor that mediates the action of UBE4B and LSD1 on protein clearance. This work establishes p53 as a regulator of proteome integrity and uncovers a new protein quality control pathway that could potentially be exploited to increase the degradation of misfolded proteins in diseased cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Living organisms endure environmental stress and metabolic errors that inflict damage on macromolecules, including DNA and protein, which are either repaired or removed by quality control programs in the cell. Toxicity resulting from protein misfolding and aggregation, known as proteotoxicity, underlies many degenerative diseases, including those affecting the nervous system, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To guard against proteotoxicity, the cell coordinates several major quality control systems, including molecular chaperones, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and autophagy [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The regulation of these systems occurs on different scales, from individual proteins to the whole organism [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is tantalizing to envisage enhancing the protein quality control systems to defend against proteotoxicity associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However, how the protein quality control might be harnessed in the cell to alleviate proteotoxicity-associated neurodegeneration is not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>Mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), linked to ~20% of familial ALS, represents a simple molecular model for protein misfolding and aggregation. The wild-type (WT) SOD1 protein has a stable β-barrel structure with a two-state folding process, whereas mutant SOD1 proteins show a heightened propensity to aggregate in vitro and in vivo [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that heightened propensity to misfold and aggregate is a common feature of ALS/FTD-associated proteins, including TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Identifying mechanisms that suppress the toxicity of protein misfolding and aggregation may help elucidate the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and provide potential targets for correction.</p>
<p>Here we took advantage of a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> model that expresses neuronal ALS-linked SOD1 mutant proteins and develops robust movement defects to perform an unbiased genetic screen for potent suppressors of the behavioral defects. We identified mutations in two genes, <italic>ufd-2</italic>, encoding a ubiquitin ligase, and <italic>spr-5</italic>, encoding a lysine-specific demethylase, that synergistically attenuate the neurotoxicity of mutant human SOD1 proteins. The actions of the suppressor genes are conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and they protect against proteotoxicity initiated by diverse mutant proteins, including TDP-43, FUS, and the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. Furthermore, we found human orthologs of these modifiers to be part of a pathway regulating protein quality control in mammalian cells. Further analysis showed that this pathway acts through the transcription factor p53, which mediates cellular stress responses. Together, these results identify a new mechanism involving previously unrecognized players, which the cell utilizes to augment protein quality control.</p>

<title>Isolation of Suppressors of Mutant SOD1-Induced Neurotoxicity in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic></title>
<p>To better understand the regulatory mechanisms that mitigate an increased load of misfolded proteins, we conducted a forward genetic screen for cellular factors that alleviate such stress and relieve cells from proteotoxic insults. This screen took advantage of a <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> model of ALS, in which the neuron-directed expression of the ALS-linked, G85R mutant human SOD1 (SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>) protein leads to its aggregation into misfolded soluble oligomers and larger insoluble aggregates [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Misfolded SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein is highly toxic, leading to age-dependent synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and severely impaired movement in the worms [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This severe locomotor defect allowed us to perform a large-scale screen for genes that suppress neurodegeneration and improve worm locomotion. In these experiments, we treated homozygous transgenic SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) to induce genomic mutations, and the mutagenized P<sub>0</sub> hermaphrodites were allowed to self-reproduce for two generations (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Next, in the F<sub>2</sub> offspring, which contain both heterozygous and homozygous suppressor mutations, we selected individual <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> based on a salient improvement in the locomotion on a background of poorly moving populations. The potential suppressor clones were bred through until 100% of progeny showed phenotypic improvements and were then subjected to further analysis (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>After screening &gt;10<sup>5</sup> haploid genomes, we isolated hundreds of independent strains with markedly improved locomotion. Most of these strains were dismissed upon closer examination because they showed a reduction in the expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene that had been coinjected as an internal reference and expressed independently in the pharynx, suggesting silencing of the transgene cassette. Among the few remaining suppressor strains that survived this test, one designated M1 showed potent suppression of the locomotion defect when compared with the parental SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> line, reaching ~76% of the locomotion robustness of the SOD1-WT transgenic line (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002114.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Movie</xref>). Such strong recovery of locomotion was apparently not a consequence of diminished SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> transgene expression because SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> mRNA and protein levels were unchanged between the parental and M1 mutant strains (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Further segregation analysis of M1 indicated that more than one genetic locus, in addition to the SOD1 transgene on chromosome IV, was linked to the suppressor phenotype, suggesting a rare multigenic suppressor underlying the suppressor phenotype.</p>
<p>To map and identify genes responsible for the suppression of the locomotor defect, we carried out single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. SNP mapping localized the M1 suppressor mutations to two linkage regions: a 2.2-Mb interval on chromosome I and an 8-Mb interval on chromosome II (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Next, we performed two rounds of deep sequencing on the M1 strain genomic DNA [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], attaining a 27-fold coverage. When the M1 genomic DNA sequencing data was aligned with the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> reference genome, we found over 200 variants in the two linkage regions. Next, we performed deep sequencing of the parental strain carrying only the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> transgene, with 7.5-fold coverage. Comparison of the parental and M1 genomic sequences indicated that most of the nonreference variants existed prior to the EMS mutagenesis and thus were not responsible for the suppressor phenotype. Our analysis pinpointed two variants as likely candidates for the suppressor mutations in M1: in the chromosome I linkage region, there is only one missense mutation, G1937A, resulting in a single amino acid change (R646Q) in the gene <italic>suppressor of presenilin 5</italic> (<italic>spr-5</italic>); and on chromosome II, among the few remaining variants is one nonsense mutation, G2472A, which results in a premature stop (W824X) in the gene <italic>ubiquitin fusion degradation 2</italic> (<italic>ufd-2</italic>) (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D and 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the role of the double mutations <italic>ufd-2(W824X)</italic> and <italic>spr-5(R646Q)</italic> in the suppression of mutant SOD1-mediated neurotoxicity, we performed a series of genetic, biochemical, and behavioral analyses. <italic>ufd-2</italic> encodes a U-box type ubiquitin ligase, and the W824X mutation results in a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal U-box (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). <italic>spr-5</italic> encodes a lysine-specific demethylase, and the R646Q substitution occurs at a highly conserved residue in the C-terminal portion of an amine oxidase-like (AOL) domain (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). While either <italic>ufd-2(W824X)</italic> or <italic>spr-5(R646Q)</italic> alone did not lead to the strong locomotor defect-suppressing phenotype in the M1 strain, the double mutation <italic>ufd-2(W824X)</italic> and <italic>spr-5(R646Q)</italic> segregated perfectly with the M1 phenotype, recapitulating the full rescuing effect of the suppressor.</p>
<p>To confirm <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic> as the suppressor genes, we obtained independent null alleles of the two genes: a deletion mutation, <italic>ufd-2(tm1380)</italic>, that lacks 80% of the protein at the C-terminus [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and a nonsense mutation, <italic>spr-5(by134)</italic>, that lacks the C-terminal half of the protein (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When crossed to the mutant SOD1 strain, the single allele of <italic>ufd-2(tm1380)</italic> provided a moderate, 2-fold locomotor improvement, and less improvement was seen for the single allele of <italic>spr-5(by134)</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). However, combining the alleles of <italic>spr-5(by134)</italic> and <italic>ufd-2(tm1380)</italic> completely recapitulated the strong locomotor-defect-suppressing phenotype observed in the M1 strain (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Total levels of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein were similar among the WT, single-, and double-mutant strains (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>.). However, further analysis after fractionation by solubility revealed that the insoluble level of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>, which accounts for less than 2% of total proteins, was decreased by the <italic>spr-5(by134);ufd-2(tm1380)</italic> mutations, while the soluble level of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> remained unchanged (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Finally, we found that restoring the function of either <italic>ufd-2</italic> or <italic>spr-5</italic> alone by expressing transgenic wild-type <italic>ufd-2</italic> or <italic>spr-5</italic> under a neuron-specific promoter from the synaptobrevin (<italic>snb-1</italic>) gene completely blocked the protection in the M1 strain (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), indicating that it was the loss of function in these two genes and not any other background mutation that was responsible for the suppressor phenotype. Taken together, these results establish that the synergistic loss of <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic> creates a potent novel suppressor of the neurodegenerative phenotypes in the SOD1 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> model of ALS, which we have termed the <italic><underline>s</underline></italic><italic>pr-5</italic>– and <italic><underline>u</underline></italic><italic>fd-2</italic>–dependent <underline>n</underline>eurodegeneration <underline>s</underline>uppressor (SUNS).</p>

In transparent <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> models, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusions of several disease-relevant, aggregation-prone proteins, such as SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], TDP-43<sup>c25</sup>-YFP [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and PolyQ-YFP [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], have been used to facilitate the visualization of their protein aggregation. These fusion proteins form fluorescent protein aggregates readily visible in live <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, and, when present in neurons, these protein aggregates correlate with the toxicity to the animals as manifested in their locomotor defects [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To determine whether the SUNS mutant reduces the toxicity associated with these protein aggregates, we introduced the double-null mutations <italic>ufd-2(tm1380);spr-5(by134)</italic> into the strains that pan-neuronally express SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP, TDP-43<sup>c25</sup>-YFP, or PolyQ-YFP. Indeed, loss of <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic> function resulted in a marked reduction in the neuronal protein aggregation when compared with controls. Reduction in the number and intensity of protein aggregates was evident in the change in the fluorescent inclusions in the head and ventral cord regions of the SUNS-mutant <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A–2C</xref>). Consistently, the locomotor phenotypes in these <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> strains were significantly improved by the introduction of the SUNS mutations, <italic>ufd-2(tm1380);spr-5(by134)</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A–2C</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the biochemical states of the misfolded proteins in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> models, we performed a protein solubility assay by differentially extracting and sedimenting worm lysates into soluble supernatants and insoluble pellets. The worm pellet fraction is enriched with sedimentable large SOD1 protein aggregates, whereas the supernatant fraction contains smaller aggregates and oligomeric species (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>.) [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Western blot analysis of both supernatant and pellet fractions displayed a significant decrease in the levels of misfolded SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP, TDP-43<sup>c25</sup>-YFP, and PolyQ-YFP in the <italic>ufd-2(tm1380);spr-5(by134)</italic> double mutant when compared with controls (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A–2C</xref>). Compared with the untagged SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> (the soluble level of which was unchanged, <xref rid="pbio.1002114.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>.), SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP was significantly reduced in its soluble fraction by <italic>ufd-2(tm1380);spr-5(by134)</italic>. This suggests that soluble SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP proteins were degraded more rapidly than the untagged SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>, consistent with the notion that the YFP tag may increase the misfolding of fusion proteins and therefore decrease their total protein levels (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>.). Taken together, these data indicate that the <italic>ufd-2;spr-5</italic> double mutations are capable of reducing the proteotoxicity of various misfolded proteins associated with neurodegeneration, suggesting a wide-spectrum effect of the suppressor.</p>
<p>To investigate whether this effect was evolutionarily conserved, we assessed the actions of <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic> in transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> models expressing known ALS disease-causing human TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> or FUS<sup>R521C</sup> proteins. These models have been previously shown to cause photoreceptor degeneration and rough-eye phenotypes [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We found that knockdown of <italic>CG9934</italic>, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans ufd-2</italic> and human ubiquitination factor E4 B (UBE4B), rescues the TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>-induced degenerative rough-eye phenotype, resulting in a smoother eye appearance (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, left) and restoration of pigmentation (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Similarly, knockdown of the <italic>ufd-2</italic> homolog <italic>CG9934</italic> corrected the ommatidial defects (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, middle) and pigmentation loss induced by FUS<sup>R521C</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Additionally, we observed that knockdown of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Su(Var)3-3, the homolog of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans spr-5</italic> and human lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), rescued the degenerating eye phenotypes induced by FUS<sup>R521C</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, right, and <xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Neither of the suppressors changed the protein expression levels of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> or FUS<sup>R521C</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>.).

<title>Knockdown of Mammalian UBE4B and LSD1 Enhances Clearance of Misfolded Proteins</title>
<p>Homologs of <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic> are present in all eukaryotes. UBE4B and LSD1 are the human orthologs of <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic>, respectively. UBE4B and LSD1 share 32% and 29% sequence identity with <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic>, respectively, and all the major protein domains are conserved (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). To determine whether UBE4B and LSD1 affect protein aggregation in mammals, we used a protein solubility assay that was established to characterize the aggregation of mutant SOD1 in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>.) [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This assay utilizes the aggregation-prone SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein, which migrates faster on SDS-PAGE than its WT counterpart, as a reporter of protein aggregation, with WT SOD1 serving as an internal control. We knocked down UBE4B and/or LSD1 with multiple RNA interference (RNAi) oligonucleotides and analyzed the levels and solubility of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein in HEK293T cells. Cell lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation to separate insoluble pellets, which contain large and sedimentable SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> aggregates, from soluble supernatants, which contain correctly folded native proteins, misfolded proteins, and small oligomeric aggregates (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>.). The WT SOD1 protein remained in the supernatant (S) in all tested conditions, but a significant portion of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein (25%–30%) was enriched in the insoluble pellet (P) fraction (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Knockdown of both UBE4B and LSD1 significantly decreased levels of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> in both supernatant and pellet fractions (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), consistent with reduction of total SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig. and S2C Fig</xref>.). The UBE4B/LSD1 knockdown did not affect the protein levels of WT SOD1. These results were consistent with the notion that the mutant SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> had a much larger fraction of misfolded and aggregated proteins that were sensitive to UBE4B- and LSD1-dependent clearance than the WT SOD1 protein. In agreement with the observations in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the effects of UBE4B/LSD1 knockdown on enhanced protein clearance was not specific to mutant SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> but also occurred with other aggregation-prone proteins, including TDP-43<sup>Q331K</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig. and S2E Fig</xref>.), indicative of a general effect on protein quality control. Additionally, single knockdown of either LSD1 or UBE4B also resulted in decreased steady-state levels of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>, with the UBE4B knockdown producing a stronger effect than LSD1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, the double knockdown produced an even more pronounced decrease in the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> levels, indicating an additive effect between UBE4B and LSD1.</p>

<p>To determine whether this decrease in the levels of misfolded and aggregated proteins was a consequence of increased degradation of proteins, we performed cycloheximide chase experiments. Cells were transfected with SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> together with either nontargeting control small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or a mix of UBE4B and LSD1 shRNAs, and the clearance of the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein was quantified. Cycloheximide was used to block de novo translation, and the amount of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein remaining in the supernatant at the indicated time points after the translation block was determined by SDS-PAGE and western blotting (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The UBE4B and LSD1 double knockdown decreased the half-life of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> from 8.5 h to 5 h, indicating that increased clearance of the mutant protein underlies the reduction of the protein aggregates (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D and 3E</xref>). Similarly, the reduction of TDP-43<sup>Q331K</sup> by knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 was also attributable to increased protein clearance, as shown by cycloheximide chase experiments (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2F Fig. and S2G Fig</xref>.), further suggesting that a general enhancement of protein quality control is the consequence of the loss of function of the suppressor genes.</p>

<title>Knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 Activates p53-Mediated Transcription</title>
<p>To identify the downstream effectors of UBE4B and LSD1 in the antiproteotoxicity pathway, we performed a comprehensive transcriptional analysis using the cell-based SOD1 misfolding model. We treated HEK293T cells with shRNAs targeting either UBE4B or LSD1 alone or UBE4B and LSD1 simultaneously in the presence of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins. Upon confirmation of reduction in UBE4B and LSD1 protein levels, total RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray profiling of the whole human transcriptome (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>.). In triplicate samples of the three knockdown conditions and nontargeting controls, differentially regulated genes and pathways were analyzed in unbiased approaches to identify those that convey the UBE4B/LSD1-mediated activation of protein quality control systems.</p>
<p>The most intriguing observation in our unbiased microarray analysis did not concern individually regulated genes but instead related to the upstream regulators that elicited characteristic pattern of mRNA level changes in a whole pathway or network. By employing the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) algorithm to compare the predicted pattern of changes and the actual changes in these genes in our microarray profiles, we identified a number of upstream regulators whose downstream targets are significantly changed (z-score ≥ 2.0) in UBE4B and LSD1 single or double knockdowns (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Among these upstream regulators, only a few were shared by more than one experimental condition, and remarkably, p53 was the only upstream regulator common to all three conditions (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002114.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). In the UBE4B and LSD1 double-knockdown condition, a large number of p53 target genes were affected, and importantly, a large fraction were changed in the directions that statistically suggest an activation of the p53 transcription factor (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002114.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig., S3C Fig</xref>., <xref rid="pbio.1002114.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). We examined a sample of 11 p53 target genes in HEK293T cells and confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) that their expression levels were consistent with the microarray dataset (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Since UBE4B is a ubiquitin ligase that decreases the stability of p53 [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we examined the total protein levels of p53 in the UBE4B and LSD1 double-knockdown cells.

<p>To further confirm that the single or double knockdowns of UBE4B and LSD1 were activating p53-mediated transcription, we used a firefly luciferase (p53RE-luc) reporter construct carrying p53-responsive elements in its promoter. Knockdown of either UBE4B or LSD1 increased p53 transcriptional activity. However, the simultaneous knockdown of both UBE4B and LSD1 resulted in an even higher p53 transcriptional activity (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), consistent with the synergistic antiproteotoxicity effects of knocking down both UBE4B and LSD1. To examine if the increased luciferase activity reflected p53-dependent transcriptional activation, we expressed MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and negative regulator of p53, or β-galactosidase as a control, together with the p53 activity reporter. The introduction of MDM2 significantly reduced p53-dependent transcriptional activation of the luciferase reporter under the UBE4B and LSD1 double-knockdown condition (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref>.), confirming the specificity of the regulation of p53 by UBE4B and LSD1.</p>
<p>LSD1 demethylates the p53 protein, and loss of LSD1 increases K370-p53 dimethylation, an activating post-translational modification specifically recognized by 53BP1 [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To determine whether the activation of p53 resulted partially from its enhanced interaction with 53BP1, we co-immunoprecipitated p53 and 53BP1 from HEK293T cells in which LSD1 and UBE4B were previously knocked down. An increased amount of 53BP1 was pulled down by an equal amount of p53 protein in the double-knockdown cells when compared with the control, indicating an increased interaction between p53 and its coactivator, 53BP1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). To confirm directly that the dimethylation on the p53 protein is increased, we performed western blotting using a dimethyl K370-p53-specific antibody, and detected an increase in the level of dimethylated p53 in the double-knockdown samples compared with the control and compared with the total p53 (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>.). In sum, these data demonstrate that p53, as a transcription factor, is significantly elevated and activated by the knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1.</p>
<p>Among the genes that were up-regulated by the UBE4B and LSD1 double knockdown in our microarray data set, there were a few that had been reported to be important for protein quality control, including forkhead box O3 (FOXO3a), FOXO4, and proteasome 26S subunit non-ATPase11 (PSMD11) (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C Fig</xref>. and <xref rid="pbio.1002114.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). FOXOs are a family of transcription factors invoked in protein quality control [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the 19S proteasome component PSMD11 is a critical regulator of proteasome activity [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is notable that FOXO3a is transcriptionally up-regulated by p53 [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and PSMD11 is transcriptionally induced by FOXOs [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We confirmed through RT-qPCR that FOXO3a, FOXO4, and PSMD11 were all transcriptionally up-regulated when UBE4B and LSD1 were knocked down (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), linking these positive regulators of protein quality control downstream of p53 to the UBE4B- and LSD1-dependent antiproteotoxicity activity.</p>
<p>Since FOXO3a is a transcription factor downstream of p53 and positively regulates protein quality control, we examined the FOXO3a-mediated transcriptional activity by employing a previously established luciferase reporter that is driven by the forkhead-responsive element (FHRE) [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A constitutively active form of FOXO3a, FOXO3a-TM, was co-expressed with the FHRE-luciferase reporter in HEK293T cells to measure the transcriptional activity of this particular FOXO member. Consistent with the p53 activation, we found that the FOXO3a activity is induced most strongly when both UBE4B and LSD1 are simultaneously knocked down (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). Similar results were observed with another FOXO-family member, FOXO1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Fig</xref>.). The <italic>daf-16</italic> gene is the sole <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> ortholog of the mammalian FOXO family [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

<title>Knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 Activates Proteasomal Degradation and Autophagy</title>
<p>To determine whether the enhanced clearance of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> upon the knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 reflects an increase in proteasome-mediated degradation, we examined abundance of several proteasomal subunits. Consistent with our transcriptome analysis that demonstrated an increase in the level of PSMD11 RNA, the PSMD11 protein level was significantly increased in the double-knockdown cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Both PSMD11 and PSMD4 (proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase, 4) are resident to the 19S regulatory proteasome particle, and we found that the PSMD4 protein level was also significantly increased. Moreover, components of the 20S core proteasome particle, including 20Sα3, 20Sβ1, and 20Sβ5, were also significantly increased.</p>

<p>To determine whether the increase in the quantities of proteasome subunits corresponds to augmented proteasomal activity, we measured the chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in lysates derived from HEK293T cells with single or double knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 using a luciferase assay (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>.). The proteasomal activity was increased in LSD1 or UBE4B single-knockdown cells, but the highest activity was observed in double-knockdown cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This finding is consistent with the results of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> suppressor studies and protein solubility assays in mammalian cells, in which both UBE4B and LSD1 are required for the maximal effects of the suppressors. Consistent with the activation of proteasomal activity by the double knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1, inhibition of the proteasome by treating cells with MG132 blocked the degradation of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> conferred by the UBE4B and LSD1 knockdown (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig. and S5C Fig</xref>.). Thus, the knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 significantly increases both the subunit quantity and the activity of proteasomes.</p>
<p>In addition to the activation of the proteasome, we asked whether autophagy is also up-regulated in the UBE4B and LSD1 double-knockdown cells. To measure autophagic activity, we employed a <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase (GLuc) release assay [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] that reports the autophagy-dependent ATG4B cleavage of an actin-tethered actin-LC3-GLuc-fusion protein and its subsequent release from the cell into the medium (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5D Fig. and S5E Fig</xref>.). HCT116 cells, which are amenable to this assay, were transfected with shRNA constructs to knock down UBE4B and LSD1, with the LC3-GLuc plasmid used to measure the cleavage of LC3 and the constitutively secreted control (cytomegalovirus-secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase [CMV-SEAP]) for transfection/secretion normalization (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5D Fig. and S5E Fig</xref>.). The LC3-dependent GLuc activity, measured over a period of 72 h, showed a 2-fold increase in ATG4B proteolytic activity at the end of the time course demonstrating the activation of autophagy by the knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The cells transfected with the noncleavable, LC3-less fusion, the Act-GLuc construct, showed only background levels of Gluc activity, similar to the levels observed in nontransfected cells.</p>
<p>To confirm that autophagy was activated by the UBE4B and LSD1 double knockdown, we measured LC3-II accumulation by western blotting in cells. Double knockdown samples showed increased levels of LC3-II compared with controls, even when LC3-II was elevated by treatment with 3-MA (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that a UBE4B- and LSD1-dependent protein quality control pathway similar to that in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> also operates in mammalian cells, since a reduction in these two enzymes promotes the removal of aggregating proteins through enhanced post-translational quality control systems involving the proteasome and autophagy.</p>

<title>p53 Regulates Protein Quality Control</title>
<p>Until now, p53 has not been associated with antiproteotoxicity activity. p53 has been shown to regulate autophagy, but in opposing directions [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our microarray analysis and subsequent studies establish a correlation between the activation of p53-mediated transcription and enhanced protein quality control conferred by the knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). It has been demonstrated that p53 is a target of polyubiquitination by UBE4B and demethylation by LSD1, and each of these functions decreases the p53 activity [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, p53 has emerged as a potential effector that mediates the synergistic action of UBE4B and LSD1 in the antiproteotoxicity pathway.</p>
<p>To determine whether p53 directly protects against proteotoxicity, we first used small molecule activators of p53 in the cell-based SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein aggregation assay. Tenovin-1 activates p53 by inhibiting the SIRT1/2 deacetylase and therefore promoting p53 acetylation, thereby increasing its stability and activity [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. CP-31398 is another drug that activates p53 by stabilizing the p53 DNA-binding domain in an active conformation and inhibiting its ubiquitination [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Both p53 activators significantly reduced the amount of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein in the supernatant and pellet fractions (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002114.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig., and S6D Fig</xref>.) at various concentrations of Tenovin-1 (0.4–1.2 μM) and CP-31398 (2–4 μg/ml). Furthermore, to confirm that Tenovin-1 and CP-31398 acted through the activation of p53, we reduced p53 levels via shRNAs while testing the clearance of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein with the drug treatment. The p53 reduction blocked the effect of either Tenovin-1 or CP-31398 on promoting SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> clearance, indicating that the drugs act through p53 (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6G Fig</xref>.).</p>

<p>To investigate the mechanism by which the activation of p53 by Tenovin-1 and CP-31398 reduced the levels of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins, we asked whether autophagy was activated by these drug treatments. In agreement with a previous report that CP-31398 activates autophagy [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we observed that increasing concentrations of either Tenovin-1 or CP-31398 up-regulated LC-II protein levels (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6H Fig</xref>.), consistent with the activation of autophagy. To further validate that Tenovin-1 and CP-31398 act post-translationally to promote the clearance of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins, we performed cycloheximide chase experiments and confirmed the increase in the degradation of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins upon treatment of either of the p53 activator drugs (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig., S6C Fig., S6E Fig., and S6F Fig</xref>.).</p>
<p>Conversely, we asked whether reducing p53 activity would negatively affect the clearance of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins. First, we performed the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein solubility assay in cells in which p53 was reduced by RNAi. We found that partial removal of p53 in HEK293T increased SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein levels in both the supernatant and pellet fractions (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Next, using a human HCT116 cell line in which p53 was knocked out, we asked how the complete removal of p53 affected the clearance of misfolded SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>. Unlike the WT SOD1 protein, whose level was not affected by the absence of p53, the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> mutant protein was significantly increased in the p53 knockout cells when compared with the controls, indicating that endogenous p53 promotes the clearance of misfolded proteins (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether p53 mediates the UBE4B- and LSD1-dependent clearance of the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins, we knocked down UBE4B and LSD1 with or without the removal of p53 and then examined the levels of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>. We applied both transient and stable shRNA knockdown by creating an inducible, stable HEK293T cell line expressing tetracycline-regulated shRNAs against UBE4B, LSD1, and p53. Both transient and stable knockdown of p53 significantly reversed the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein clearance conferred by the UBE4B and LSD1 knockdown (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002114.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A Fig</xref>.). This result was confirmed with an independent set of shRNAs against UBE4B and LSD1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7B Fig</xref>.) and by knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 in HCT116 cells with or without the p53 gene knocked out (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7C Fig</xref>.). Notably, unlike HEK293T cells, HCT116 cells do not express SV40 large T-antigen (LT-Ag), a regulator of p53 stability [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], suggesting that the action of UBE4B and LSD1 does not require LT-Ag. Taken together, these results demonstrate that p53 is required for the UBE4B- and LSD1-dependent clearance of the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins, and it acts downstream of UBE4B and LSD1 to positively regulate the clearance of misfolded proteins.</p>

<p>To confirm that p53 can modulate proteotoxicity in vivo, we used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> neurodegeneration model as described earlier (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Either knockdown of p53 by RNAi or expression of a dominant negative form of <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 (p53.R155H) [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with the GMR-Gal4 driver exacerbated the TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>-induced eye phenotype (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). This aggravation of the phenotype was evident in increased loss of pigmented ommatidia and, in p53 RNAi flies, the appearance of necrotic patches, which were observed at low penetrance (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Expression of the dominant negative p53.R155H transgene on its own, in a wild-type background, did not cause any eye phenotype. Together, these results indicate that endogenous p53 plays a role in reducing TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> proteotoxicity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye.</p>
<p>We further tested whether p53 activation would alleviate SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-induced neurotoxicity. We employed a previously characterized SOD1 neurotoxicity assay [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], in which spinal cord primary motor neurons were prepared from rat embryos, maintained on astrocyte monolayers supplemented with neurotrophic factors, and stained with a mature motor neuron marker, the neurofilament H (NF-H) antibody SMI-32. Expression of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> via a neuron-specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector reduced the survival of motor neurons significantly by approximately 50% in contrast to the HSV-LacZ control over 5 days (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). When treated with the p53 activator Tenovin-1, the motor neurons showed protection from SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-induced proteotoxicity, as compared with the vehicle control. Among the various concentrations tested, 0.8 μM of Tenovin-1 completely blocked the neurotoxicity of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>, with minimal toxicity from the drug itself (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study uncovers a previously unknown pathway that mitigates the toxicity of misfolded proteins by boosting protein quality control systems. Using a <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genetic screen for suppressors of neurotoxicity induced by mutant SOD1, we have identified the SUNS pathway, which is mediated by two conserved genes, <italic>ufd-2</italic>/UBE4B and <italic>spr-5</italic>/LSD1. From <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> to human cells, inactivation of the highly conserved lysine-modifying enzymes <italic>ufd-2</italic>/UBE4B and <italic>spr-5</italic>/LSD1 is shown to enhance the clearance of misfolded proteins. In mammalian cells, the pathway mediated by UBE4B and LSD1 acts to improve the cellular protein quality control by increasing proteasomal and autophagic activities (<xref rid="pbio.1002114.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Although it was initially surprising that loss of ubiquitin ligase UBE4B and lysine-specific demethylase LSD1 protects against proteotoxicity, further results reveal positive downstream effectors, including transcription factors, with a novel implication of p53 in antiproteotoxicity activities. Together, these results demonstrate the capacity of a cell to reprogram its protein quality control through transcriptional regulation to defend against proteotoxicity.</p>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>A Protein Quality Control Pathway Regulated by the Lysine-Modifying Enzymes UBE4B and LSD1</title>
<p>We isolated the SUNS <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> mutant based on the potent suppression of SOD1-induced neurotoxicity. The suppressor was found to significantly enhance the removal of misfolded proteins, underscoring the critical role of protein misfolding in SOD1-mediated neurodegeneration. The enhanced clearance also applies to other misfolded proteins, such as TDP-43, FUS, and polyglutamine-containing proteins, indicating a general improvement in protein quality control. This rare but strong suppressor requires modulation of only two genes, suggesting that it provides a major protein quality control program with a readily accessible switch. Furthermore, the synergistic cooperation of two genes, <italic>ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic>, points to a common downstream pathway with integrative regulation.</p>
<p>Consistent with the observation that the loss of function of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans ufd-2</italic> and <italic>spr-5</italic> promotes the clearance of misfolded proteins, inactivation of their <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian orthologs reduces the toxicity of aggregation-prone proteins, indicating the existence of a protein quality control regulatory mechanism that is functionally conserved across species. Interestingly, both mammalian genes encode lysine-modifying enzymes: UBE4B is a U-box type ubiquitin ligase, and LSD1 is a lysine-specific protein demethylase. Both UBE4B and LSD1 are highly expressed in neurons and essential for early development in mammals [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast to the conventional notion that ubiquitin ligase promotes protein degradation, our studies indicate that UBE4B negatively affects the clearance of misfolded proteins, and its down-regulation protects against severe proteotoxicity. In line with our observation that the down-regulation of UBE4B protects against proteotoxicity in the nervous systems of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mice with elevated levels of UBE4B show autophagy defects with accumulation of ubiquitin- and p62-positive aggregates in the brain [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. UBE4B forms a complex with an AAA-ATPase p97/VCP to ubiquitinate and degrade specific client proteins [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. p97/VCP plays an essential role in handling unfolded proteins, such as in endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and it was recently linked to familial ALS [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Our findings thus provide a new link between p97/VCP and protein quality control, which is regulated by UBE4B.</p>
<p>The fact that both UBE4B and LSD1 are enzymes catalyzing post-translational modifications suggests that their effects on protein quality control can be timely, energy-efficient, and integrative. The synergistic interaction between the two lysine-modifying enzymes, UBE4B and LSD1, also suggests that their downstream pathways converge to influence protein quality control. Consistent with recent studies showing enhancement of protein quality control [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the identification of the strong antiproteotoxic effects mediated by UBE4B and LSD1 demonstrates that plasticity of the cellular protein quality control programs can be substantially augmented to yield overall protection to an organism.</p>

<title>p53 as a Key Switch in Protein Quality Control</title>
<p>Unbiased transcriptome analysis points to p53 as a central regulator of the transcriptional reprograming that mediates the effects of UBE4B and LSD1 on protein quality control. Consistent with this observation, p53 has been found to have a number of direct transcriptional targets functioning in protein quality control and neuroprotection, and it also activates additional stress-response transcription factors such as FOXOs [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interestingly, p53 is elevated in the central nervous system of patients with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease and ALS [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Our observation that the transcription factors mediate the effects of this strong suppressor is reminiscent of other signaling pathways governing protein homeostasis. For example, the heat shock response activates the expression of molecular chaperones and other protein quality control machinery via the master transcription regulators, the heat shock factors [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Also, the unfolded protein response promotes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control programs through the activation of a set of the transcription factors, including XBP1, ATF4, and ATF6 [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In recurring themes, the post-translational regulation by UBE4B and LSD1 activates the p53 transcription factor, which is then capable of eliciting a systematic protective program against proteotoxic stress.</p>
<p>p53 has a well-established role in regulating responses to DNA damage [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and recently, a neuroprotective role of an activated DNA damage checkpoint has been demonstrated in a tau-dependent neurodegeneration model [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Here we propose that p53 is a versatile transcriptional switch that guards against both genotoxicity and proteotoxicity. The specific activity of p53 may be fine-tuned at the post-translational level by upstream regulators such as UBE4B and LSD1. In addition, it is known that p53 promotes apoptosis in cells with irreversible genotoxic damage [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. p53 may also function as a dual regulator in proteotoxicity: it promotes the repair and survival of moderately damaged cells but turns on cell death pathways in cells whose damage is irreparable. Such duality has been observed for other protein quality control systems, such as the ER stress responses [<xref rid="pbio.1002114.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Thus, p53 could serve as a critical regulator of cellular responses to proteotoxicity by repairing or removing damaged cells.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized pathway that systematically antagonizes the proteotoxicity associated with neurodegenerative diseases, and they point to potential targets for harnessing the protective capacity of the cells’ reprogrammed protein quality control to develop a wide-spectrum antiproteotoxicity therapeutic strategy.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic for protein misfolding and aggregation in relation to protein solubility and quality control. For an aggregation-prone protein, there is a dynamic equilibrium among correctly folded native proteins, its misfolded forms, oligomeric aggregates, and large aggregates.

In a protein solubility assay, large aggregates can be sedimented into the insoluble fraction via extraction and centrifugation, while smaller oligomeric aggregates and other misfolded proteins are retained in the soluble fraction. The misfolded and aggregated proteins are targets of cellular protein quality control machineries including molecular chaperones, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and autophagy.

Protein aggregation assays were performed to evaluate the levels of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins in the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions. The reduction of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> aggregation in cells treated with Tenovin-1 or CP-31398 is dependent on p53, as the knockdown of p53 abolishes the ability of the drugs to remove aggregates. (<bold>H</bold>) p53-activating drugs activate autophagy as indicated by LC3 protein levels. HEK293T cells treated with Tenovin-1 or CP-31398 for 24 h were lysed in 1% SDS buffer, and LC3-I and LC-II levels were analyzed by western blots. For both Tenovin-1 and CP-31398, the LC-II levels are augmented with increasing drug concentrations. Both panels were from the same gel and western blot with identical imaging settings.

<title>p53 mediates improved protein clearance induced by the knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stable knockdown of p53 partially blocks the improved clearance of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins conferred by the knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1. A stable cell line with inducible knockdown of p53 via an integrated shRNA (in a pR4R3-TET-PURO vector) is used to conditionally remove p53 upon the induction of doxycycline (DOX). The protein solubility assay was used to analyze the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein levels in supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions. The knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 substantially enhances the clearance of misfolded SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins, but this effect is partially reversed by the DOX-induced knockdown of p53 (+DOX). The western blots for the S and P fractions are from the same gels. (<bold>B</bold>) Transient knockdown of p53 blocks the improved clearance of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins conferred by the knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1. The protein solubility assay was performed as in (A), except with the knockdown of p53 achieved through shRNA transient transfection and with LSD1 and UBE4B shRNAs in a pR4R3-NEO vector targeting their respective 3′ UTRs (see <xref rid="sec012" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). (<bold>C</bold>) Loss of p53 blocks increased SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein clearance conferred by the knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 in HCT116 cells. HCT116 cells with either the p53 knockout or WT genotype were treated with the UBE4B and LSD1 shRNAs or nontargeting controls. Left: western blot analyses of the insoluble SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> proteins show that loss of p53 increases the levels of the mutant SOD1 proteins, and GAPDH is a loading control. Right: quantification of the western blots indicates that p53 is required for the effect of UBE4B and LSD1 on SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> protein clearance (<italic>n</italic> = 3).

<title>Upstream regulator analysis of microarray transcriptional profiles upon LSD1 and UBE4B single or double knockdowns.</title>
<p>The human transcriptome microarray analysis was carried out in triplicates of four conditions, control shRNA (CTRL), LSD1 knockdown alone, UBE4B knockdown alone, and UBE4B+LSD1 double knockdown, all in the presence of misfolded SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>, as described in the Results and the Materials and Methods. This table contains six sheets (A–F) that summarize the upstream regulator analysis. (<bold>A</bold>) Activated upstream regulators with z-score ≥ 2.0 for each of the three knockdown conditions, LSD1 alone, UBE4B alone, and (UBE4B+LSD1), as compared with the control. A z-score over 2.0 indicates that the particular upstream regulator is significantly activated because its target genes are differentially regulated accordingly in the experimental dataset. Note that the expression levels of the upstream regulators are often not changed. (<bold>B</bold>) Upstream regulators in the double UBE4B+LSD1 knockdown cells, with stringent <italic>p</italic>-values of overlap (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) but any z-score. Activation/inhibition of upstream regulators with z-score between -2.0 and +2.0 is considered statistically nonsignificant and therefore not predicted. Upstream regulators with z scores ≥2.0 and ≤–2.0 are considered in an “activated” or “inhibited” state, respectively. (<bold>C</bold>) Expression analysis of 130 p53 target genes that are differentially regulated in the UBE4B and LSD1 double knockdown compared with the control. 49 “activated” genes are those whose actual changes are in agreement with the predicted direction in the event of p53 activation. 35 “inhibited” genes are those whose actual changes are opposite to the predicted direction in the event of p53 activation. Another 44 “affected” genes are those that are differentially regulated in the experiment but without IPA-predicted directions. (<bold>D, E, F</bold>) Lists of all upstream regulators in each of the three knockdown conditions, LSD1 alone, UBE4B alone, and both, as compared with the control.</p>
