<abstract>
<p>Ribosome-binding proteins function broadly in protein synthesis, gene regulation, and cellular homeostasis, but the complete complement of functional ribosome-bound proteins remains unknown. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified late-annotated short open reading frame 2 (Lso2) as a ribosome-associated protein that is broadly conserved in eukaryotes. Genome-wide crosslinking and immunoprecipitation of Lso2 and its human ortholog coiled-coil domain containing 124 (CCDC124) recovered 25S ribosomal RNA in a region near the A site that overlaps the GTPase activation center. Consistent with this location, Lso2 also crosslinked to most tRNAs. Ribosome profiling of yeast lacking <italic>LSO2</italic> (<italic>lso2Δ</italic>) revealed global translation defects during recovery from stationary phase with translation of most genes reduced more than 4-fold. Ribosomes accumulated at start codons, were depleted from stop codons, and showed codon-specific changes in occupancy in <italic>lso2Δ</italic>. These defects, and the conservation of the specific ribosome-binding activity of Lso2/CCDC124, indicate broadly important functions in translation and physiology.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Translation, or the production of protein from messenger RNA (mRNA), is catalyzed by a universally conserved macromolecular machine known as the ribosome. Ribosome-binding factors are also required for all substeps of translation, from initial recruitment of mRNA to peptide chain elongation to release of the mature polypeptide. However, many ribosome interactors have been identified whose effects on translation and physiology are unknown. Here, we show that the uncharacterized yeast protein late-annotated short open reading frame 2 (Lso2) crosslinks to a region of the ribosome that underlies accurate progression through all substeps of translation, the GTPase activation center. This specific binding activity is conserved in the human ortholog of Lso2, coiled-coil domain containing 124 (CCDC124). Null mutants of <italic>lso2</italic> also show severe translation defects during recovery from extended starvation, including failure to initiate on most mRNAs and a general block to peptide chain elongation. We propose that these defects could arise from a function for Lso2 in modulating the activity or integrity of the ribosome GTPase activation center during challenging growth regimes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ribosome is a universally conserved, multi-megadalton machine that carries out protein synthesis in all organisms. Accurate and efficient translation in eukaryotes requires the interaction of nearly 30 translation factors with the ribosome to ensure orderly execution of the translation cycle, including initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling of ribosomal subunits. Structural and biochemical studies have elucidated the interactions of these factors with the ribosome, and in many cases, their molecular functions are well understood. An intriguing and growing number of ribosome-associated proteins have been added to this core class, but their roles and mechanisms are generally less well characterized.</p>
<p>The known functions of ribosome-binding proteins underscore the broader connections of protein synthesis to homeostasis in all domains of life. Some examples include factors for quality control of defective mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref003">3</xref>] and nascent peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref005">5</xref>], regulators of gene-specific translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref007">7</xref>], signaling effectors of nutrient status at the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref009">9</xref>], and modulators of ribosome activity in response to nutrient status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref013">13</xref>]. Detailed functional characterization of these proteins has been illuminating in two ways. First, it has reinforced our understanding of the core translation cycle, for example, by demonstrating structural and mechanistic parallels between premature termination by quality control proteins and normal termination by release factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref015">15</xref>]. Second, ribosome-associated proteins have revealed new links between global adaptive responses and their specific effects on the ribosome. This point is particularly well illustrated in bacteria, in which stress-induced proteins affect each stage of the translation cycle by direct ribosome binding. For example, initiation is broadly inhibited by the ribosome hibernation factors YfiA (protein Y), hibernation promoting factor (HPF), and ribosome modulating factor (RMF), which sterically occlude translation ligands from their binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition, the status of elongation is monitored by RelA, which synthesizes the alarmone (p)ppGpp upon interaction with deacylated tRNA in the A site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref009">9</xref>]. Activation of the stringent response by (p)ppGpp then reprograms metabolism and gene expression by causing large changes to the translatome, the available amino acid pools, and the fidelity of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref018">18</xref>], which together promote adaptation to starvation. Finally, toxins that cleave mRNA in the A site of the ribosome elicit premature termination by quality control factors as a form of gene expression regulation during stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Unicellular eukaryotes such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> experience equally extreme shifts in nutrient status as do bacteria, and all cells need to adapt to acute stresses. Posttranslational modifications of core initiation factors and their regulators are the best-characterized mechanisms for widespread translational control (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref021">21</xref>]), but changing the composition or modification state of ribosomal complexes may also play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref023">23</xref>]. Improvements in mass spectrometry have now expanded our ability to identify proteins in mature ribosomal complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref027">27</xref>]. In mammalian cells, these include enzymes involved in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) modification, posttranslational protein modification, and carbon metabolism, with a potential moonlighting function for pyruvate kinase in translational control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref026">26</xref>]. A proteomic analysis of mature ribosomes in rapidly dividing yeast also identified dozens of previously uncharacterized translation machinery–associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref024">24</xref>], some of which are now known to play conserved roles in translation initiation and ribosome-associated quality control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref028">28</xref>]. However, the compositions of eukaryotic ribosomal complexes in other growth states and cell types remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a novel and conserved ribosome-bound protein, late-annotated short open reading frame 2 (Lso2). By quantitative proteomics, Lso2 associates with yeast ribosomes in glucose-rich and glucose-starved conditions. We used transcriptome-wide crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (IP) to show that Lso2 interacts with tRNAs and with a specific region of the 25S rRNA near the A site. This inter-subunit binding site was validated by biochemical evidence that purified Lso2 promotes subunit association in vitro. Notably, Lso2's crosslink cluster in the 25S rRNA overlaps the universally conserved GTPase activation center (GAC) of the large subunit, a binding activity that we show is conserved in its human ortholog coiled-coil domain containing 124 (CCDC124). Lso2 is required for global translation during recovery from stationary phase, with <italic>LSO2</italic> nulls (<italic>lso2Δ</italic>) accumulating monosomes to abnormally high levels. Ribosome profiling in this condition revealed that both empty monosomes and translating 80S stalled at the start codon are increased in <italic>lso2Δ</italic>, with other elongation defects evident in gene bodies. These data suggest that Lso2 has a broadly required function in modulating the activity of eukaryotic ribosomes.</p>

<title>Quantitative proteomics of ribosomes from two growth states identifies ribosome association of Lso2</title>
<p>Glucose withdrawal alters the transcription, translation, and translational efficiencies of the majority of genes in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref031">31</xref>]. However, despite the magnitude of the translational response to glucose withdrawal, these translation changes do not depend on the canonical cap-binding or general control pathways that target functional levels of initiation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref029">29</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that the composition of the ribosome itself might be altered. To test this, polyribosomes were isolated from glucose-starved and replete conditions and compared by quantitative mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, Materials and methods). To increase the purity of ribosome complexes, polysomal fractions were digested with limited RNase and fractionated on a second gradient to obtain 80S monoribosomes. Peptide digests of equal mass of purified monosomes from glucose-starved and replete conditions were then differentially labeled with nonisobaric mTRAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref032">32</xref>] amine-labeling reagents prior to analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).</p>

<title>Lso2 associates with yeast ribosomes in two growth conditions.</title>
<p>(A) Overview of method for purifying yeast ribosomes from glucose-replete and glucose-starved conditions for analysis by mass spectrometry. (B) Abundance changes in the ribo-proteome upon glucose starvation. Each axis, which represents 1 of 2 biological replicates, shows the log<sub>2</sub> fold change in protein abundance at 2 hours of glucose starvation versus during log phase. The core RPs as a cohort are clustered at the origin, which enables quantification of changes in the stoichiometry of other proteins relative to the ribosome. The dashed lines demarcate abundance changes greater than 2-fold. (C) A Myc-tagged <italic>LSO2</italic> strain was grown to log phase in YPAD (+glucose) or to log phase in YPAD and then shifted to YPA (lacking glucose) for 2 hours (2 hr -glucose). Cells were harvested for fractionation through a sucrose gradient, and fractions were probed for the Myc epitope and for the core 40S protein Asc1 as a loading control.

<p>Two hundred ninety-eight proteins met the requirements for quantitative comparison between samples, based on identification by ≥2 unique peptides and quantification of ≥2 peptide ratios. Protein abundance changes were reproducible overall between independent biological replicates (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.49; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Seventy-eight of 79 core ribosomal proteins (RPs) were quantified, including 22 of 38 RP paralogs that differ by at least 1 amino acid. As expected based on 1:1 mixing of total protein from each condition, RPs were equally abundant in starved and replete samples. Initiation factors were mostly absent, which is consistent with their unstable association with ribosomes in the absence of crosslinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref033">33</xref>]. Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A [<italic>TEF2</italic>]), eukaryotic elongation factor 1Bγ (eEF1Bγ [<italic>TEF4</italic>]), eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2 [<italic>EFT2</italic>]), and eukaryotic elongation factor 3 (eEF3 [<italic>YEF3</italic>]) were recovered at lower levels from starved polysomes. Forty-four ribosome biogenesis factors, which are known to associate with complexes larger than 80S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref035">35</xref>], were also quantified. These generally showed reduced abundance in starved samples, consistent with decreased ribosome biogenesis under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref031">31</xref>]. Other proteins that were reduced in glucose-starved samples include glycolytic enzymes that are abundant in replete conditions. These are likely contaminants, although we cannot exclude a moonlighting function for these proteins in translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref036">36</xref>]. Thus, our gradient purification and mass spectrometry achieved high coverage of core RPs and recovered known translation factors within ribosomal complexes.</p>
<p>We also identified several previously uncharacterized proteins as novel ribosome-binding factors. Notably, Lso2 and suppressor of degenerative death 3 (Sdd3) reproducibly showed greater relative enrichment in starved polysome samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Lso2 is a small basic protein predicted to contain a coiled-coil domain (92 amino acids, 10.5 kDa, pI = 10.78) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref038">38</xref>]. Polysome western blots confirmed the comigration of Lso2 with ribosomes in both rich medium and glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Strikingly, the entire cellular population of Lso2 is ribosome associated and enriched in the monosome fractions. In starved cells, the abundance of Lso2 in small polysomes was increased relative to the core 40S protein Asc1, which is consistent with our mass spectrometry results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). However, there was no change in Lso2 abundance relative to total protein during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Addition of EDTA to dissociate polysomes and 80S monosomes caused Lso2 to shift to the free pool and subunit fractions, consistent with the behavior of a ribosome-associated protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Lso2 is expressed at one-tenth the level of core RPs in rapidly dividing cells, based on our ribosome profiling data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref030">30</xref>], which is comparable to the estimated abundance of Lso2 from mass spectrometry–based proteomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus, it is plausible that most monosomes, which account for &lt;15% of all ribosomes in growing yeast, contain Lso2 in glucose-grown cultures.</p>
<p>In contrast to Lso2, only a small minority of cellular Sdd3 comigrated with ribosomes in rich medium or starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). We subsequently focused on characterizing Lso2. This protein is conserved, with 63 predicted orthologs in 57 higher eukaryotes, including humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref040">40</xref>]. In budding yeast, the paralog Lso1 (Yjr005c-a) shares 79% similarity with Lso2 but is induced 1.5- to 20-fold by different iron starvation treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref042">42</xref>], in contrast to the constitutively expressed Lso2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref041">41</xref>]. Consistently, the <italic>LSO1</italic> but not <italic>LSO2</italic> promoter contains binding sites for the iron-responsive activating transcription factors 1/2 (Atf1/2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref042">42</xref>]. Semiquantitative plate growth showed that <italic>lso2Δlso1Δ</italic> nulls are synthetically sick during iron starvation, suggesting their functions could overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref041">41</xref>]. However, in replete growth, Lso1 is one-tenth the abundance of Lso2, as determined by western blotting of S288C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref041">41</xref>], the yeast strain used in these previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref042">42</xref>]. This is corroborated by the ribosome profiling of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref043">43</xref>], in which <italic>LSO1</italic> had 13.8 reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKMs) of expression, while <italic>LSO2</italic> had 299.4 RPKMs. Replete expression of <italic>LSO1</italic> is even lower in the Sigma1278b background used in this report. We found by western blot that Lso1 is undetectable in replete Sigma1278b, even in severely overexposed blots, and up-regulated by a functional inducer of iron starvation as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s001">S1E Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref042">42</xref>]. Similarly, ribosome profiling of replete, wild-type (WT) Sigma1278b captured approximately 250 RPKMs for <italic>LSO2</italic> but 0.6 for <italic>LSO1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref030">30</xref>]. While we cannot rule out that Lso1 is expressed beneath this detection threshold, we conclude that Lso2 is the dominant paralog under standard growth conditions. Thus, Lso2 is a novel ribosome-associated protein and likely to have a nonredundant, broadly required function in translation.</p>

<title>Lso2 crosslinks to 25S rRNA near the A site and to tRNAs</title>
<p>We next sought to validate Lso2's ribosome association and to identify its ribosomal binding site with higher resolution. We used photoactivatable ribonucleoside crosslinking and IP and an enhanced method of CLIP library preparation (ePAR-CLIP) to identify RNAs genome-wide that crosslink to Lso2 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, Materials and methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref044">44</xref>]. Briefly, yeast strains expressing Myc-tagged Lso2 at endogenous levels (Lso2-Myc) were grown with 4-thiouracil and irradiated at 365 nm. We verified that these manipulations do not affect Lso2's pattern of ribosome co-sedimentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Cells were then lysed and digested with limited RNase I, followed by IP of Lso2-Myc and crosslinked RNA. Lso2-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes from 2 independent biological replicates were further purified by SDS-PAGE in parallel with a size-matched input (SMI), which was processed identically except for omission of the IP step, and with an anti-Myc IP of a strain lacking the Myc epitope (hereafter called the untagged). Previous work has shown that comparison to SMI and untagged negative controls eliminates the majority of CLIP peaks as false positives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref045">45</xref>]. Following deep sequencing, reads were collapsed to remove PCR duplicates and mapped to a modified version of the yeast genome containing single copies of the rDNA locus and each unique tRNA gene. We used a previously published peak identification algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref046">46</xref>] and stringent criteria to identify clusters reproducibly enriched in the IP versus both control libraries (Materials and methods).</p>

<p>A single 95-nucleotide cluster in the 25S rRNA, U1188 to G1282, was the only region of the transcriptome to be reproducibly enriched &gt;4-fold (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We also observed a peak of T-to-C mutation frequency at U1253, which was reproducible in both IPs and absent from the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). These transitions reflect bona fide crosslinking of 4-thiouridine leading to preferential misincorporation of dG during reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref050">50</xref>]. Our mutation analysis also demonstrates the utility of SMI and untagged controls, which allowed identification of crosslink residues that are recovered nonspecifically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). The region U1188 to G1282 overlaps the GAC, composed of helices 42, 43, and 44 of the 25S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In an effort to further narrow the crosslink cluster, a second set of libraries was prepared using 10-fold more RNase. However, under these conditions, no subregions of rRNA met the enrichment criteria, suggesting that increased RNase digestion depleted larger and more labile rRNA fragments from the IP samples. Instead, about 90% of all reads in each of these Lso2-Myc IP replicates mapped to tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). Consistent with this read distribution, the prominent band (approximately 60 kDa) visible in <sup>32</sup>P-labeled Lso2-Myc RNP IPs was of the expected size for a complex containing Lso2-Myc bound to an intact tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, right). We verified that RNPs crosslinked to a canonical tRNA-modifying enzyme, pseudouridine synthase 1 (Pus1), show a similar upshift of about 25 kDa compared to the protein alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). Together with the fact that Lso2 is undetectable in subribosomal gradient fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), these results suggest that Lso2 associates with tRNA-bound ribosome complexes in vivo.</p>
<p>Given that the length of an entire tRNA gene is the size of subfeatures typically identified as peaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref046">46</xref>], we looked for tRNAs with ≥4-fold enrichment of read density in both IPs versus the SMI and untagged. Eighty of 101 total tRNA genes met the minimum read cutoff (64 reads in all 4 libraries) for this analysis. Of these, 70 were enriched ≥4-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s009">S2 Table</xref>). The read densities of tRNAs were well correlated between IP replicates (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.996, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), and the relative abundances in each IP were positively correlated with those in the SMI (Pearson r &gt; 0.7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2E Fig</xref>), indicating a broad capacity for Lso2 to interact with tRNAs on the ribosome. The 25S binding site of Lso2 is within 30 Å of a classical A site tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2H</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref049">49</xref>], which easily positions a protein the size of Lso2 to interact with A site tRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref051">51</xref>]. Depending on its shape or multimerization status, Lso2 could also reach to the P site tRNA of a ribosome with an empty A site. Taken together, these data suggest that Lso2 is able to associate with tRNA-bound ribosomes by binding in the tRNA channel on the A site side of the 60S subunit.</p>
<p>To validate the ribosomal binding site of Lso2, we tested whether it is able to stabilize ribosomal subunit association in vitro. This biochemical function was previously demonstrated for the bacterial ribosome hibernation factors, a class of ribosome-binding proteins with sizes similar to Lso2 and which likewise bind directly in the tRNA channel. For the gradient association assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref052">52</xref>], individual ribosomal subunits were isolated from <italic>lso2Δ</italic>, and recombinant His-tagged Lso2 (6XHis-Lso2) was purified from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). 40S and 60S subunits were mixed in an equimolar ratio, to which equimolar Lso2 or the equivalent volume of buffer was added before fractionation on sucrose gradients to quantify the distributions of monosomes versus free subunits (Materials and methods). At near-physiological magnesium concentrations (3 mM), we observed a characteristic distribution of free ribosomal subunits and 80S monosomes. Inclusion of equimolar Lso2 reproducibly increased monosome formation by 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). These data validate direct ribosome binding by Lso2 and are consistent with binding near the tRNA channel, as shown by ePAR-CLIP.</p>

<title>The specific ribosome-binding activity of Lso2 is conserved to humans</title>
<p>We identified putative orthologs of yeast Lso2 in multiple eukaryotes, suggesting a conserved function.

Although CCDC124 has not been characterized as ribosome-associated, an interactome survey of 1,125 mammalian proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed in HeLa cells found interactions between CCDC124 and two 60S RPs, RPL10 (human) and Rpl35 (mouse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref056">56</xref>].</p>

This 80S subpopulation shifts entirely to the subribosomal, 40S, and 60S fractions in the presence of EDTA, as expected for a ribosome-associated protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Given that CCDC124, like <italic>LSO2</italic>, is expressed at levels substoichiometric to core ribosomes (HeLa ribosome profiling data of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref057">57</xref>]), total abundance alone fails to explain this difference in its distribution compared to yeast Lso2. We conjecture that the human protein, which is 131 amino acids longer than Lso2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), is regulated in a more complex manner vis-à-vis its extraribosomal versus monosome-bound subpopulations. Alternatively, CCDC124 may have additional and independent roles off the ribosome. These observations demonstrate that a subset of CCDC124 is ribosome-bound in human cells and suggest a conserved function in translation.</p>
<p>As additional evidence that the ribosome-binding activity of Lso2 is conserved, CCDC124 expressed in yeast associated with ribosomes in a manner similar to native Lso2. When yeast chromosomal <italic>LSO2</italic> was replaced with V5-tagged <italic>CCDC124</italic>, the human protein sedimented exclusively with 60S and 80S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). A putative shorter isoform of CCDC124 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref058">58</xref>] that contains 31 amino acids beyond the coiled-coil domain similarly comigrates with yeast ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). To identify the human CCDC124 binding site on yeast ribosomes, we performed ePAR-CLIP on Myc-tagged CCDC124 expressed from the yeast <italic>LSO2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). We observed a peak of internal enrichment at 25S U1188 to G1282 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), which is where Lso2 reproducibly crosslinked to rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), and an IP-specific peak of T-to-C mutation frequency at 25S U1253 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s003">S3D Fig</xref>), as was observed with Lso2. CCDC124 also crosslinked to a broad range of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g003">Fig 3E</xref>): of 80/101 tRNA genes meeting the read cutoff, 66 were enriched in the CCDC124 IP relative to both controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Of these, 65 are also targets of Lso2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s009">S2 Table</xref>). These results suggest that CCDC124 and Lso2 share a specific ribosome-binding activity.</p>

<title>Translation is globally depressed in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> recovering from starvation</title>
<p>The binding site of Lso2 near the GAC suggests its potential to affect multiple stages of the translation cycle. We therefore tested whether loss of Lso2 perturbs overall growth or global translation in various conditions. Bulk polysomes were normal in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> under replete conditions and after 3 hours of glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Growth was also normal at various temperatures and on different carbon sources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Next, we examined <italic>lso2Δ</italic> during translational recovery from stationary phase, a challenging condition in which a reduced number of cellular ribosomes must rapidly resynthesize the growth-promoting proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref060">60</xref>]. WT and <italic>lso2Δ</italic> strains were grown to nutrient exhaustion by culturing without dilution for 4 days and then transferred to fresh medium for 30 minutes before gradient profiling. <italic>lso2Δ</italic> showed a 3-fold accumulation of monosomes at the expense of polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), with polysome levels partially recovered after 100 minutes of upshift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Both WT and <italic>lso2Δ</italic> required 5 hours before the first cell division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4C Fig</xref>), which is consistent with <italic>lso2Δ</italic>’s attenuated defect by 100 minutes. To determine where Lso2 sediments during recovery, we probed for V5-tagged Lso2 in sucrose gradient fractions after 30 minutes of upshift. The enrichment of Lso2 in 80S fractions was similar to that in replete conditions (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">4D</xref>), although Lso2 is required for bulk translation only during recovery.

<p>The 80S fraction can include nontranslating monosomes, translating monosomes engaged on mRNA, and monosomes generated by endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA during no-go and non-stop decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref063">63</xref>]. To distinguish between these species and to examine other translation defects in recovering <italic>lso2Δ</italic>, we performed ribosome footprint profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref064">64</xref>]. At 30 minutes of stationary phase upshift, yeast cells were harvested by rapid filtration and freezing without pretreatment with cycloheximide (Materials and methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref065">65</xref>], which is known to distort specific codon pauses and lead to artefactual accumulation of ribosomes at start codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref067">67</xref>]. RNase-digested HeLa lysate was added in fixed proportion to the number of yeast ribosomes in each sample as an internal standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, Materials and methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref068">68</xref>]. Subsequent normalization of yeast to human coding sequence (CDS) counts thereby enabled absolute comparisons of mRNA abundances between samples. To improve quantification, a randomized barcode was introduced at the 5′ end of each read for PCR duplicate collapsing. Two independent biological replicates of both WT and <italic>lso2Δ</italic> were profiled with reproducible results (Pearson r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.97, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4D Fig</xref>), yielding translation data for 4,593 yeast genes that had sufficient reads across all libraries.</p>
<p>Normalizing the bulk count of yeast to human CDS-mapping reads revealed a 5-fold decrease in overall translation in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). To determine how this reduction affected genes individually, we applied a global scaling factor to the yeast RPKM values in each library, which was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of human RPKMs from that library versus the normalizing library (fixed as <italic>lso2Δ</italic> replicate 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4E Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref069">69</xref>]. Overall, the absolute number of translating ribosomes was substantially reduced for most genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). Given that the total number of cellular ribosomes was unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4G and S4H</xref> Fig), this global reduction in translating ribosomes shows that the increased 80S peak in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> is comprised mainly of nontranslating monosomes. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that most of the 80S peak dissociates in high salt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4F Fig</xref>), which preferentially disrupts monosomes devoid of mRNA and translation ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref070">70</xref>]. Because ribosomal subunits must complete the multistep initiation pathway to be stably engaged on mRNA, the abnormally high fraction of empty subunits suggests a bottleneck to one or more steps of initiation in <italic>lso2Δ</italic>. Together, these results reveal a critical role for Lso2 during translational recovery.</p>
<p>Given the global depression of translation observed in recovering <italic>lso2Δ</italic>, we considered the possibility that increased expression of Lso1 might compensate for loss of Lso2 under other conditions in which there was no phenotype. We therefore examined <italic>LSO1</italic> expression in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> under replete conditions, after 3 hours of glucose starvation, and during recovery from stationary phase. Each of these regimes showed ≤1 read count from the paralog <italic>LSO1</italic> despite coverage of &gt;82% of the transcriptome. While we cannot rule out that some Lso1 may be expressed beneath our detection limit, Lso1 is unlikely to be at sufficient levels to compensate for the absence of <italic>LSO2</italic>. For comparison, in the matched WT libraries from these conditions, <italic>LSO2</italic> was above the ≥65th percentile of expression based on RPKM normalization of ≥422 raw reads, whereas ≤1 read mapped to <italic>LSO1</italic>. Thus, Lso2 is specifically required for normal cellular translation during recovery from stationary phase.</p>

<title>Stored ribosomes are defective for translational recovery in <italic>lso2Δ</italic></title>
<p>A previous high-throughput screen of synthetic genetic interactions in yeast identified several ribosome biogenesis factors as among the strongest negative interactors with <italic>lso2Δ</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref071">71</xref>]. We therefore considered whether the observed translation defects in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> might be downstream of a failure to make new and functional ribosomes by 30 minutes of upshift. According to this model, the polysomes in WT cells would consist primarily of newly synthesized ribosomes, whereas newly synthesized ribosomes in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> fail to enter the translation cycle. Quantification of rRNA per cell in WT and <italic>lso2Δ</italic> at 0 and 30 minutes, however, showed that neither strain increased its mature rRNA content during this time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4G Fig</xref>). Thus, stored ribosomes carry out the observed translation program, which indicates that the translation defects in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> are likely not downstream of a failure to produce functional new ribosomes.</p>
<p>We also examined the bulk integrity and quantity of rRNA stored in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> after 4 days of stationary phase, which appeared normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4H Fig</xref>). However, we cannot rule out subtler defects in the stored ribosomes. Indeed, after stationary phase, 60S subunits from <italic>lso2Δ</italic> sedimented aberrantly following the RNase I digestion step of ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4I Fig</xref>), which is consistent with the possibility that lack of Lso2 affects the proper storage of ribosomes. If so, the mechanism is likely to be indirect, since Lso2 remains substoichiometric to ribosomes during stationary phase. The observed genetic interactions between <italic>lso2Δ</italic> and biogenesis factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref071">71</xref>] may reflect synthetic effects of reducing ribosome number and compromising their function (Discussion).</p>

<title>Absence of Lso2 perturbs early elongation</title>
<p>To gain molecular insight into the translation defects of <italic>lso2Δ</italic>, we analyzed the distributions of ribosome-protected footprints within mRNAs. We captured footprints ranging from 15 to 34 nucleotides in order to examine a broad range of ribosomal complexes, including quality control intermediates (15–18 mers) and those from elongating ribosomes in different states (20–22 mers versus 28–34 mers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref073">73</xref>]. Analysis of 28–30 mer footprints showed a 5-fold increase in monosomes stalled at the start codon in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), which was determined by averaging the expression-normalized ribosome occupancy across all transcripts. Consistently, most genes showed an increased fraction of start codon versus ORF body reads, with a median increase of approximately 4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This shift lay well outside the variability of start-to-body ratios between biological replicates (plotted as replicate error in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Start codon accumulation was also specific to long footprints, as 20–22 mers did not show higher start codon occupancy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). The magnitude of long footprint accumulation was comparable to the effect of depleting eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A; median increase of approximately 4-fold, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), an essential factor that promotes peptide bond formation through pause-prone codons at the +2 position and elsewhere in the gene body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref075">75</xref>].

<p>To understand why long versus short footprints accumulate at start codons and why some genes are preferentially affected, we looked for determinants of start pausing. We first compared nucleotide usage at positions −13 to +16 in the top quartile of genes with the largest start pause change in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> versus in all genes. The bias in nucleotide frequency was quantified using the log-likelihood ratio (G-statistic, Materials and methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref077">77</xref>]. Genes with increased start pausing are strongly biased toward T at +4 and C at +5, with weaker biases downstream and at −9 in the transcript leader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). We then extended this analysis by computing single codon occupancies for all +2 codon identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Consistent with the increased +4 T and +5 C representation in <italic>lso2Δ</italic>-sensitive genes, serine codons showed the greatest increase in pausing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>). However, AGC and AGT Ser codons also led to increased pausing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s005">S5C Fig</xref>), indicating that the effect of serine is driven by the identity of the amino acid. Additional significant <italic>lso2Δ-</italic>sensitive pauses were seen at proline, glycine, alanine, glutamine, asparagine, aspartate, and threonine +2 codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). This defect was strongly position-dependent: plotting the change in pause score across the first 10 positions revealed a sharp decline from codon 2 to 3, and in all cases, pausing was attenuated by codon 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Furthermore, pause changes at these codons within ORF bodies were smaller than and uncorrelated with those in the early ORF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). These results suggest that start pausing is unlikely to be caused by decreased tRNA charging, whose effects would also extend to ORF bodies. Instead, the start-paused ribosomes may be slow to form the first peptide bond, generating a footprint size characteristic of this substep of elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref073">73</xref>]. It is currently unclear whether early pausing and empty 80S accumulation arise from a common mechanism, such as defective 60S joining, or from distinct perturbations. However, the difference between early versus ORF-body behavior suggests that peptide bond formation at some codons is most affected immediately downstream of initiation in <italic>lso2Δ</italic>.</p>
<p>Importantly, we note that the identities of the most affected +2 codons and the specific accumulation of ribosomes at the start codon are distinct from those in eIF5A depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref065">65</xref>], in which ribosomes accumulate in the broader, approximately 100-codon window beginning at start. Therefore <italic>lso2Δ</italic>’s start-pausing behavior is not a consequence of insufficient eIF5A. Finally, <italic>lso2Δ</italic>-sensitive codons account for 60% of second codons in the genome and 76% in the WT translatome under these growth conditions. Thus, the lack of Lso2 leads to a widespread and codon-specific defect in late initiation or early elongation.</p>

<title>Absence of Lso2 leads to pervasive changes in global elongation and termination</title>
<p>In addition to these perturbations observed in long (28–30 mer) footprints, there was a dramatic shift toward short (20–22 mer) footprints in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In contrast to those from WT, short footprints from <italic>lso2Δ</italic> align to a specific frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This suggests that a change in translation elongation underlies their production and not merely the absence of Lso2 as a steric barrier to RNases accessing the mRNA channel during footprinting. More specifically, the increased ratio of short versus long footprints in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> suggests a global shift in the distribution of ribosomes between distinct functional states during the elongation cycle. Twenty to 22 mers were previously proposed to originate from rotated ribosomes in the post-peptidyl transfer, pre-translocation state based on footprinting with or without various elongation-inhibiting antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref073">73</xref>].

This suggests that 20–22 mers in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> arise from an increased fraction of ribosomes in a state that occurs in WT ribosomes. Given that Lso2 is monosome bound and substoichiometric to RPs, this change in ribosome state is unlikely to come from a direct function of Lso2 in modulating every elongation cycle. Instead, because Lso2 binds near the base of the ribosomal stalk, we propose that loss of Lso2 could compromise the function of the stalk in interacting with core elongation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref078">78</xref>]. This defect may be further compounded by insufficient levels of core elongation factors such as eEF2 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, ribosome occupancy at stop codons was markedly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), suggesting that termination and recycling proceed more efficiently. Given its 80S enrichment, Lso2 is unlikely to be a direct inhibitor of termination. Instead, assuming that the protein levels of release factors are normal in <italic>lso2Δ</italic>, this result would be consistent with a globally reduced number of translating ribosomes and a higher ratio of release factors to ribosomes at stop codons. Together, these ribosome profiling data indicate that Lso2 is globally required for elongation during this recovery regime.</p>

<title>Decreased relative translation correlates with start codon pausing in <italic>lso2Δ</italic></title>
<p>We next asked whether these specific initiation and elongation defects could underlie perturbations to the relative translation of mRNAs in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> versus WT. Differential gene expression analysis of footprint counts (DESeq2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref079">79</xref>] identified 635 genes with (relatively) increased and 638 genes with (relatively) decreased translation (<italic>p</italic>-adjusted &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) against the backdrop of a global 5-fold decrease in ribosome loading on mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). These hypersensitive (decreased) and relatively insensitive (increased) gene sets were enriched for distinct Gene Ontology categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s011">S4 Table</xref>): Among the increased set, RP mRNAs drove enrichment of “cytoplasmic translation,” while functions related to amino acid biosynthesis dominated the decreased set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The down-regulated categories are likely due to strong repression of <italic>GCN4</italic>, the master regulator of amino acid biosynthetic gene transcription (absolute decrease of 20-fold in <italic>lso2Δ</italic>). Indeed, the transcriptional targets of general control nonderepressible protein 4 (Gcn4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref080">80</xref>] are overrepresented among the decreased genes (74/638) versus in the transcriptome (377/5,498 genes, Fisher’s exact test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The log-phase translational efficiency of a gene, which is particularly high for the RP mRNAs, was not predictive of its relative translation in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> (Pearson r = 0.0297, <italic>p</italic> = 5.2E-2). Nor was the presence of an upstream AUG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Instead, we saw a modest but significant contribution from ribosome pausing at the start codon: DESeq-decreased genes showed higher levels of start codon accumulation in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) and were enriched for <italic>lso2Δ</italic>-sensitive +2 codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5F</xref>) relative to all genes analyzed (Fisher's exact test <italic>p</italic> = 5.7E-3). However, the overall correlation between the change in start codon pausing versus the change in footprints was weak (Pearson r = −0.107), suggesting that it is not the main driver of gene expression levels globally. Unexpectedly, the RP mRNAs also maintained high relative expression despite their overrepresentation of +2 serine codons. We conjecture that other <italic>cis</italic> features promote their translation and/or that their expression is increased as an adaptive response to inadequate ribosome function. In summary, increased pausing at the start codon explains some but not all changes to the relative translation of mRNAs in <italic>lso2Δ</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we present the discovery and characterization of a conserved ribosome-bound protein that we show is required in yeast for translation during recovery from extended starvation. Through genome-wide identification of RNA crosslinks, we mapped a ribosome binding site for Lso2 to the universally conserved GAC, located within 30 angstroms of the A site on the 60S subunit. Consistent with this location, Lso2 crosslinks to tRNAs in vivo and stabilizes ribosomal subunit association in vitro. Additionally, Lso2’s ribosome-binding activity is conserved between yeast and humans: a subpopulation of human CCDC124 comigrates with 80S ribosomes in HeLa cells, while CCDC124 expressed from the yeast <italic>LSO2</italic> locus interacts with the same region of the 60S subunit. Loss of Lso2 during recovery from extended starvation causes initiation and elongation defects on virtually all genes in the transcriptome. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential to uncover new roles in translation and physiology for uncharacterized ribosome-associated proteins.</p>
<p>Following detection of Lso2 in ribosomal complexes using proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and in vivo crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), we demonstrated its direct interaction with ribosomes using an in vitro approach. Specifically, purified recombinant Lso2 was shown to stabilize the association of empty ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2I</xref>), which is a known property of small proteins binding in the inter-subunit face. However, we also observed in vivo that the absence of Lso2 during starvation recovery causes an increase in empty 80S monosomes rather than an accumulation of free ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This phenotype thus suggests that the cellular function of Lso2 is more complex than its activity toward empty subunits in vitro. We note key functional distinctions between Lso2 and 2 other proteins that also bind in the tRNA channel, the conserved prokaryotic GTPase upstream of Leader peptidase (LepA) and the eukaryotic ribosome preservation factor suppressor of Tom1 (Stm1). Whereas LepA is required for ribosome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref081">81</xref>] but only subtly affects global elongation as measured by ribosome profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref082">82</xref>], elongation in gene bodies is severely perturbed in recovering <italic>lso2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Lso2 is also not required for maintaining bulk levels of cellular ribosomes during stationary phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4H Fig</xref>), a function previously demonstrated for Stm1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
<p>Using a refined protocol for ribosome profiling (without drug treatment and with internal standards), we comprehensively characterized the 80S accumulation and other defects in recovering <italic>lso2Δ</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">4F–4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g007">7</xref>). These include a 5-fold decrease in global initiation, a 4-fold accumulation of long footprints from translating monosomes stalled at a subset of start codons, and a strong shift in footprint read lengths from long (28–34 nt) to short (20–22 nt). Given the binding site of Lso2, we suggest a mechanism whereby compromised interaction of GTPases with the GAC underlies perturbations to multiple stages of the translation cycle (see below).</p>
<p>It has previously been observed that removing rRNA or protein components of the GAC reduces ribosome binding and the GTP hydrolysis rates of initiation and elongation factors in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref083">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref084">84</xref>]. The <italic>lso2Δ</italic> ribosome profiling signature parallels these defects. The reduced number of mRNA-bound ribosomes and increase in start-paused monosomes could reflect dual consequences of a failure to correctly join 60S subunits to the 43S preinitiation complex, which requires the GTPase eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref085">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref086">86</xref>]. Whereas failure to recruit eIF5B generally leads to destabilized 43S and an accumulation of empty ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref085">85</xref>], the 80S that do engage on mRNAs may be impaired in transitioning to elongation. Here, the bottleneck could arise from slow eIF5B GTP hydrolysis and dissociation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref086">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref087">87</xref>]. It is also conceivable that defective initiation further disrupts the first round of peptide bond formation, which is typically slow because of the absence of a rigidifying nascent chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref088">88</xref>]. In support of this latter hypothesis, the magnitude of start pausing varied according to +2 amino acid identity, with codons for small and polar amino acids being more challenging to translate in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). In addition to these initiation and early elongation defects, broad changes to codon occupancies in ORF bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s005">S5D Fig</xref>) and the strong accumulation of 20–22 mer footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) also indicate perturbed general elongation. The high correlation between 20–22 mer codon occupancies in <italic>lso2Δ</italic> and those observed in untreated WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref073">73</xref>] suggests that <italic>lso2Δ</italic> ribosomes spend uniformly more time in an elongation state found in WT cells. The initial proposal of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref073">73</xref>] points to decreased eEF2 recruitment as one explanation. Alternatively, changes in association of other core elongation factors could also affect elongation speed and the relative abundance of different footprint lengths. Finally, these primary defects may lead to insufficient synthesis of new translation factors during recovery, which would further compound their magnitude.</p>
<p>How might Lso2 affect the function of the GAC? Given that Lso2 is monosome enriched and only one-tenth the abundance of all ribosomes, any functional model must rationalize the magnitude and persistence of <italic>lso2Δ</italic> defects throughout translation without invoking direct interaction with all ribosomes. We consider that its rRNA crosslink cluster is located at the base of the ribosomal stalk and directly contacts the essential RP P0. P0 in turn scaffolds interaction with the heterodimers P1A/B and P2A/B, the lateral constituents of the stalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref089">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref090">90</xref>]. Together, this pentameric complex recruits translational GTPases including eIF5B, eEF1, and eEF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref091">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref092">92</xref>]. We tested whether loss of Lso2 reduces the stoichiometry of P-stalk proteins during starvation recovery; however, their 80S ribosome occupancy was unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), suggesting that Lso2 affects GAC function other than via binding of its protein constituents. The increased sensitivity of <italic>lso2Δ</italic> 60S subunits to RNase digestion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4I Fig</xref>) raises the possibility of structural changes to the GAC. How these changes might affect GAC interaction with different elongation factors awaits further investigation.</p>
<p>Although Lso2 is constitutively expressed, it is only required for global translation during starvation recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). One explanation for this condition-specific role is metabolic shifts that cause biochemical changes to the ribosome. Quiescent cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation for their energy requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref093">93</xref>], which leads to an increase in free radicals that can oxidize RNA. Furthermore, quiescent cells show increased proteolytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref094">94</xref>] and have degraded bulk cellular ribosomes to a small fraction of log-phase levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref094">94</xref>]. This increased catabolism could also damage the structure and function of the remaining ribosome pool. However, the low ratio of Lso2 to ribosomes during starvation recovery also suggests that any protective function must be dynamic as opposed to stoichiometric binding by the classic ribosome preservation factors.</p>
<p>Given that the GAC is structurally conserved across kingdoms and that CCDC124 and Lso2 crosslink to the same location on yeast ribosomes, a subset of CCDC124 likely also binds the GAC of human ribosomes. It remains to be determined in human cells whether CCDC124 is required for efficient initiation and elongation under conditions that challenge the integrity of the GAC, a function that would justify the conservation of putative Lso2 orthologs throughout eukaryotes.</p>

<p>Downstream processing for mass spectrometry was as follows. Proteins were digested in parallel reactions using trypsin and lysC, respectively. Prior to trypsin digestion, peptides were partially modified with propionic anhydride to block lysines and thereby produce longer peptides in an attempt to increase sequence coverage. Peptide digests were differentially labeled with mTRAQ nonisobaric amine reagents (mTRAQ<italic>Δ</italic>0 and mTRAQ<italic>Δ</italic>8, Sciex 4440015 and 4427700). The labels were flipped between biological replicates.

<p>Mass spectrometry followed the method of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref098">98</xref>] with modifications. All peptide samples were separated on an online nanoflow HPLC system (Agilent 1200) and analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Approximately 1 μg of sample was injected onto a fused-silica capillary column (New Objective, PicoFrit PF360-75-10-N-5 with 10 μm tip opening and 75 μm inner diameter) packed in-house with 14 cm of reversed phase media (3 μm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ media, Dr. Maisch GmbH). The HPLC setup was connected via a custom-made nanoelectrospray ion source to the mass spectrometer. After sample injection, peptides were separated at an analytical flowrate of 200 nL/min with a 70-minute linear gradient (about 0.29%B/min) from 10% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 30% solvent B (0.1% formic acid/90% acetonitrile). The run time was 140 minutes for a single sample, including sample loading and column reconditioning. MS1 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 and a mass range from 300 to 1,800 m/z.

The maximum inject time was 50 ms, and maximum ion count was 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> counts. mTRAQ samples were analyzed with Top12 methods. We used an isolation window of 3 Th for isolation of ions prior to MS/MS. Ions selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 20 seconds after fragmentation.</p>

<title>Quantification and identification of peptides and proteins</title>
<p>Mass spectrometry data were analyzed by the methods of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref098">98</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref100">100</xref>] with modifications. All mass spectra were processed using the Spectrum Mill software package v4.0 beta (Agilent Technologies), which includes a module developed by us for iTRAQ and mTRAQ-based quantification. Precursor ion quantification was done using extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for each precursor ion. The peak area for the XIC of each precursor ion subjected to MS/MS was calculated automatically by the Spectrum Mill software in the intervening high-resolution MS1 scans of the LC-MS/MS runs using narrow windows around each individual member of the isotope cluster. Peak widths in both the time and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> domains were dynamically determined based on MS scan resolution, precursor charge, and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, subject to quality metrics on the relative distribution of the peaks in the isotope cluster versus theoretical. Similar MS/MS spectra acquired on the same precursor <italic>m/z</italic> in the same dissociation mode within +/− 60 seconds were merged. MS/MS spectra with precursor charge &gt;7 and poor-quality MS/MS spectra, which failed the quality filter by not having a sequence tag length &gt;1 (i.e., minimum of 3 masses separated by the in-chain mass of an amino acid), were excluded from searching.</p>
<p>For peptide identification, MS/MS spectra were searched against protein sequences from reference Sigma1278b MIT_2009_ACVY01000000 on <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database. All ORFs were included except the following: those with ≥1 N, those whose CDS length was not divisible by 3, those that did not begin with methionine, those that did not contain a stop codon at the end, and those that contained ≥1 stop codon. For each of these cases except the presence of ≥1 N, the S288C protein sequence was substituted unless it was also erroneous. Search parameters included ESI–Linear-Ion-Trap (CID or ETD) scoring parameters, trypsin or LysC enzyme specificity with a maximum of 3 missed cleavages and KP or RP cleavages allowed, +/− 20 ppm precursor mass tolerance, +/−0.7 Da product mass tolerance, and carbamidomethylation of cysteines and mTRAQ labeling of lysines and peptide n-termini as fixed modifications. Allowed variable modifications were oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues with a precursor MH+ shift range of −18 to 177 Da. For propionylated samples, propionylation of lysine was searched as a fixed modification. Identities interpreted for individual spectra were automatically designated as valid by optimizing score and delta rank1-rank2 score thresholds separately for each precursor charge state in each LC-MS/MS while allowing a maximum target decoy–based false discovery rate (FDR) of 1.0% at the spectrum level. This yielded a final overall FDR at the peptide level of &lt;1%.</p>
<p>In calculating scores at the protein level and reporting the identified proteins, redundancy was addressed in the following manner: The protein score is the sum of the scores of distinct peptides. A distinct peptide is the single highest scoring instance of a peptide detected through an MS/MS spectrum. MS/MS spectra for a particular peptide may have been recorded multiple times (i.e., as different precursor charge states, modified by oxidation of Met) but are still counted as a single distinct peptide. When a peptide sequence &gt;8 residues long is contained in multiple protein entries in the sequence database, the proteins are grouped together, and the highest-scoring one and its accession number are reported. In some cases when the protein sequences are grouped in this manner, there are distinct peptides that uniquely represent a lower scoring member of the group (isoforms or family members). Each of these instances spawns a subgroup, and multiple subgroups are reported and counted toward the total number of proteins.</p>
<p>mTRAQ ratios were obtained from the protein summary details export table in Spectrum Mill. To obtain mTRAQ protein ratios, the median was calculated over all distinct peptides assigned to a protein subgroup in each biological replicate.</p>
<p>We note that a common peptide was assigned to both Sdd3 and Ygr110w and used to compute their mTRAQ ratios. Given that Ygr110w is the bona fide mitochondrial protein cardiolipin-specific deacylase 1 (Cld1) and was previously shown to localize exclusively to mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref101">101</xref>], we subsequently validated Sdd3 as a starvation-enriched ribosome-bound protein.</p>

<title>ePAR-CLIP library preparation</title>
<p>Tagged and untagged strains were grown in synthetic complete medium with 120 μM uracil to OD<sub>600</sub> 1.0. Then, 4-thiouracil (Sigma 440736) was added to each culture to a final concentration of 500 μM, and cultures were grown with shaking at 30°C for an additional 3 hours. For UV crosslinking, cultures were poured over ice and pelleted and then resuspended in cold water and transferred to a petri dish situated on ice. Resuspended cells were crosslinked in a Stratalinker at 365 nm, approximately 5 cm from the UV bulb, for a total of 7.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (680 seconds). UV-treated culture was pelleted. For eCLIP treatment followed by gradient fractionation to visualize the migration of Lso2-Myc, cycloheximide was added to 0.1 mg/mL following UV crosslinking. Cells were then pelleted.</p>
<p>Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1:200 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail III, 0.44 U/mL murine RNase inhibitor). Extracts were clarified at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Downstream library preparation followed the method of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref044">44</xref>] with the following modifications. Anti-Myc antibody (10 μg, Sigma M4439) was bound to 100 μL of Dynabeads Protein G (ThermoFisher Scientific 10004D). For RNase digestion, 26 OD<sub>600</sub> units were diluted in lysis buffer to a final volume of 1.0 mL in lysis buffer. RNase I was added to a final concentration of either 1:20,000,000 (set 1: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2B and 2D</xref> left, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2B Fig</xref>) or 1:2,000,000 (set 2: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2D</xref> right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">2E–2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2E Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s003">S3C and S3D Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s009">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s010">S3</xref> Tables) and incubated with extracts for 15 minutes at 22°C and shaking at 1,200 rpm. IP with Myc-coupled beads proceeded for 2.5 hours at 4°C. For 3′ adapter ligation, samples were ligated to pre-adenylated adapter OJA225 (5′-5Phos/TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG/3ddC/) using T4 RNA Ligase 1 (NEB M0437M). As a diagnostic of crosslinking efficiency and approximate RNA size distribution, 10% of each IP and 10% of each untagged sample were removed for [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP labeling and then resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel. Radiolabeled RNPs were transferred from the gel to a PVDF membrane, which was exposed to a phosphorimager screen to produce the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s002">S2D Fig</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s003">S3C Fig</xref>. Input (0.5%) and IP (13%) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting for the Myc epitope. The remainder of each sample was loaded on a different gel, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. For the first set (made with 1:20,000,000 RNase I), the region of the membrane from 55 to approximately 130 kDa was excised for all samples to avoid a nonspecific species migrating around 50 kDa in the IP and the untagged libraries. For the second set (made with 1:2,000,000 RNase I), which included CCDC124-Myc, the region of the membrane from 35 to 100 kDa was excised for Lso2-Myc, from 55 to 130 kDa for CCDC124-Myc, from 35 to 130 kDa for their SMI, and from 55 to 130 kDa for the untagged. Primer OWG915 (5′-GCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCC) was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. The barcoded adapter OWG920 (5′-/5Phos/N<sub>10</sub>GATCGTCGGACTGTAGAACTCTGAACGTG/3SpC3/-3′) was used for ligation to the 3′ end of first-strand cDNA. For PCR amplification, OBC (5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATN<sub>6</sub>GTGACTGGAGTTCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA) was used as the forward primer, in which the N<sub>6</sub> was used to barcode each library on a flow cell, and Illumina RP1 (5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA) was used as the reverse primer. Libraries generally required 8–14 cycles of PCR amplification. Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument.</p>

<title>eCLIP read processing and quantification</title>
<p>ePAR-CLIP read processing followed the pipeline of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref044">44</xref>] (Supplementary Protocol 2) with the following modifications. Individual libraries were first demultiplexed by their library-level barcodes. For reverse reads, which contained at the first 10 positions a barcode for collapsing PCR duplicates within a library, this decamer was removed and appended to the fastq header. Two rounds of adapter removal using Cutadapt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref102">102</xref>] were run with previously published parameters except for the adapter sequences, which were modified to remove OBC from the 5′ side and NNNNNGATCGTCGGACTGTAGAACTCTGAACGTGTAG (embedded in OWG920) from the 3′ side. For mapping, the genome assembly Sigma1278b_MIT_2009_ACVY01000000 was downloaded from <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database. To consolidate reads and downstream peak calling on multicopy genes, the genome was modified as follows. All rRNA and tRNA genes containing a 40-base-pair window that multimapped elsewhere in the genome were first masked from the endogenous genome. Single copies of unique tRNA and rRNA genes were then placed on a separate artificial chromosome, with each locus separated by a spacer of 25 Ns. Forward and reverse reads were mapped using STAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref103">103</xref>] with published parameters except that a multimap cutoff of 10 and a mismatch rate of 9% were used. PCR duplicates were collapsed, the mapped files were sorted, and the reverse reads were used for peak identification as described. No replicates were merged in any analyses.</p>
<p>In the first set of libraries (low RNase), 2 Lso2-Myc replicates were used to prepare IP libraries. RNA from each of these replicates was used to prepare paired SMI libraries, and 2 untagged strains (YWG25) were used to prepare untagged libraries. After peak identification using CLIPper, the read fraction in each peak of an IP library was normalized by the read fraction of the corresponding region in the control libraries (SMI and untagged, respectively). Peaks with fold-enrichment &gt;4.0 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>, relative to both controls, and that overlapped by at least 1 nucleotide between the 2 IP replicates, were taken as reproducible targets.</p>
<p>In the second set of libraries (high RNase), 2 Lso2-Myc replicates and 2 CCDC124-Myc replicates were used to prepare IP libraries. One CCDC124-Myc replicate was discarded because of very low RNA recovery. RNA from an Lso2-Myc replicate was used to prepare a SMI library, and YWG25 was used to prepare an untagged library. Because most tRNA genes had &lt;64 uniquely mapping reads, multimapping reads were fractionally assigned to all mapped positions based on the STAR-generated MAPQ score, with the following scaling factors: {0: 0.2, 1: 0.286, 3: 0.5, 255: 1}. Genes with &lt;64 counts thus assigned (as determined by read 5′ ends) were excluded from further analysis. Coverage at each position was normalized by the lengths of the originating reads. The read density of a tRNA gene was then taken as the sum of normalized coverage across all positions in the gene, divided by the total number of primary alignments in that library. We defined enriched tRNA targets as those with a ≥4-fold ratio of read density in both IPs relative to the SMI and untagged.</p>
<p>Mutational analysis of T to C transitions was performed by extracting all rRNA mapping reads using samtools and then following the method of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref104">104</xref>]. Outputs are available as supplemental files on GEO under accession GSE109343.</p>

Because the OD<sub>600</sub> is unchanged during this period, we used total RNA in culture as a proxy for cellular abundance of RNA. Total RNA extraction and analysis were performed as described above for stationary phase samples.</p>

<title>Ribosome profiling library preparation</title>
<p>For ribosome profiling at 30 minutes of stationary phase recovery, 2 biological replicates of both <italic>lso2Δ</italic> and WT were grown. Each sample, which contained 2.0 L of culture, was harvested by rapid filtration (GE Healthcare 7184–009) and scraped into a conical tube. One mL of footprint lysis buffer was added (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/mL cycloheximide) and the cells immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Library preparation followed the method of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref065">65</xref>] with several modifications. Frozen cells were lysed by ball milling in a Retsch CryoMill. One minute of milling at 10 Hz followed by 1 minute of cooling was repeated 10 times. The lysate was spun for 5 minutes at 3,000 × <italic>g</italic> to remove debris. The supernatant was removed and further clarified for 10 minutes at 21,000 × <italic>g</italic>. The OD<sub>260</sub> of each sample was determined by Nanodrop.</p>
<p>During analytical polysome profiling, we found that the contribution of ribosomes to total OD<sub>260</sub> was highly variable between samples. However, dope-in of an internal standard required accurate quantification of total ribosome numbers. We therefore extracted total RNA from a fixed volume of each sample using hot acid phenol, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction in gel phase-lock tubes (Quantabio). At least 3 technical replicates of each sample were included to verify consistent recovery. Total RNA from all replicates was separated on a single 0.7% agarose/0.9% synergel (Diversified Biotech SYN100)/0.5X TBE gel containing 1.0 μg/mL ethidium bromide. A dilution series of total RNA mixed from several samples was also run on the same gel to ensure quantification in the linear range. The gel was scanned on a Typhoon FLA 9500. Using ImageJ, 18S and 25S band intensities were quantified. For each sample, the average of 18S + 25S intensities across technical replicates was used as the proxy for ribosome number per volume of lysate.</p>
<p>For RNase I digestion, lysate volumes adjusted to equalize total ribosome number between all samples contained anywhere from 18 to 38 OD<sub>260</sub> units. The magnesium concentration was raised to 5 mM. RNase I was added to each sample at a concentration of 15 U/OD<sub>260</sub>, followed by incubation at 25°C for 60 minutes with gentle mixing. In parallel, HeLa lysate was footprinted with 0.5 U/μL RNase I at 25°C for 30 minutes; 0.74 OD<sub>260</sub> units of digested HeLa lysate were added to each digested yeast sample. Mixtures were loaded onto 10%–50% sucrose gradients (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL cycloheximide) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3 hours at 4°C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Gradients were fractionated as described in “Yeast gradient profiling”; fractions from the 80S peak were pooled and extracted using hot acid phenol. Precipitated RNA was resuspended in 8 M guanidine HCl buffer (20 mM MES hydrate, 20 mM EDTA) and enriched for small RNAs as follows. Ethanol was added to 33% and the mixture spun through a Zymo-V column (Zymo Research C1012-50). The flow-through was collected and raised to 70% ethanol and then bound to a second Zymo-V column and eluted.</p>
<p>Footprints were dephosphorylated using T4 PNK (NEB M0201S) and then size-selected between 15 and 34 nt RNA markers on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The pre-adenylated adapter OJA225 5′-5Phos/TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG/3ddC/ was ligated to 3′ ends. Twenty picomoles or less of each sample was then treated with a half reaction of Ribo-Zero (Illumina MRZY1324). Samples were step annealed to the barcoded reverse transcription primer OWG921, followed by reverse transcription with AMV RT (Promega M5108). Gel-purified cDNA extension product was circularized with CircLigase (Epicentre CL4115K) and then PCR amplified with ONTI230 (forward) and OBC 5’-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATN<sub>6</sub>GTGACTGGAGTTCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA (reverse). Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500.</p>
<p>For ribosome profiling in log phase and at 3 hours of glucose withdrawal, 0.1 mg/mL cycloheximide was added to growing cultures and shaken for 2 minutes before harvesting. Downstream library preparation followed the method of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref109">109</xref>], except that 2 additional subtractive hybridization oligos were used to deplete rRNA: 5′-/5Biosg/ATGACCAAGTTTGTCCAAATTCTCC and 5′-/5Biosg/AATGGGACCTTGAATGCTAGAACGTGG. Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2000.</p>

<title>Ribosome profiling read processing</title>
<p>For all libraries, reads were first demultiplexed by their library-level barcodes. For stationary phase recovery libraries, PCR duplicates were collapsed using fastx-collapser (FASTX-Toolkit) with the option &lt;-Q33&gt;. The output sequences were then trimmed of the 3′ adapter and 5′ decamer barcode using Cutadapt with the options &lt;—adapter TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG—cut 10—overlap 3—minimum-length 15&gt;. Only reads ≥15 nt were retained.</p>
<p>For mapping of mixed human and yeast reads, the masked Sigma genome described in “eCLIP read processing and quantification” was concatenated with GRCh38 (GENCODE release 20) to build a joint reference. Reads were aligned uniquely using STAR with the command line options &lt;—alignEndsType EndToEnd—outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.1—outFilterMultimapNmax 1—outFilterMultimapScoreRange 1—outFilterType BySJout—outFilterScoreMin 15&gt;. Any reads that failed to align at this stage were excluded from further analysis. Aligned reads were then split by species.</p>
<p>Human reads were quantified using htseq-count [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref110">110</xref>] with the options &lt;—format = bam—stranded = no—type = CDS—idattr = gene_id—mode = union&gt;. These counts were converted to RPKMs; the length of a gene was taken to be the sum of exon lengths from all annotated isoforms.</p>
<p>Yeast reads were converted to genome coverage vectors of read 5′ ends. A read was assigned to a given ORF if its 5′ end was located between −12 of the start codon and −15 of the stop codon, inclusive. Footprint length histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) were determined from all alignments falling within annotated CDS regions. For DESeq2 analysis and calculation of RPKMs, all footprint lengths were used, but reads from the first 8 codons were excluded.</p>
<p>For analysis of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref073">73</xref>], raw fastq data were taken from SRA SRX581790-2 and SRX2339595-8. The reference genome for mapping was a modified version of sacCer3 (R64-2-1_20150113) in which all noncoding RNAs at which 40 mers multimapped were masked from endogenous chromosomes. Single copies of all unique noncoding RNA genes were then placed on an artificial chromosome with intervening spacers. All other pipeline steps, including mapping, were identical to processing of Sigma reads.</p>
<p>Analysis of log phase and glucose starvation footprint libraries followed the method of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref109">109</xref>], except that reads from the first 8 codons were excluded for expression quantification.</p>

<title>Absolute normalization of yeast reads</title>
<p>To compare bulk numbers of mRNA-bound ribosomes between samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g004">Fig 4G</xref>), the number of uniquely mapped yeast CDS reads was divided by the number of uniquely mapped human CDS reads in each library. To rescale yeast RPKMs for comparison of individual genes, human RPKMs from <italic>lso2Δ</italic> replicate 1 (which had the highest human read coverage) were plotted against human RPKMs from the library to be normalized. Only the top 5% of human genes were used. The slope of the linear regression was applied as a global scaling factor to the yeast RPKMs in the library to be normalized.</p>

<title>Ribosome profiling positional analyses</title>
<p>Metagene plots were created by dividing read counts at each position within a gene by the average read counts per nucleotide (expression level) of that gene. The values at each position were then averaged across the transcriptome. Only genes with ≥64 reads were used. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5A</xref> was created with 28–30 mer footprints and genes ≥1,000 nt. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s005">S5A Fig</xref> was created with 20–22 mer footprints and genes ≥1,000 nt. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g006">Fig 6D</xref> was created with 28–30 mer footprints and genes ≥100 nt.</p>
<p>For all codon-level analyses, we found that 28 mers from ribosomes paused with the start codon in the P site had 5′ read ends located 12 nt upstream of the A of AUG, as previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref111">111</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Other footprint lengths were therefore offset as follows to put them in frame with 28 mers (determined empirically): {20:0, 21:0, 22:+1, 25:0, 26:0, 28:0, 29:+1, 30:+1, 31:+1}. Twenty-seven mers were not well phased in our libraries. Reading frame analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) was performed on 20–22 mer 5′ read ends without offsets, in which “0” means that a read end is located a multiple of 3 from the first nucleotide of the start codon.</p>
<p>The ratio of start codon to body reads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5B</xref> was calculated using 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, and 31 mers. Start codon reads were taken as the number of offset 5′ read ends located 12 nt upstream of the A of AUG. For the same analysis of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005903.ref065">65</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005903.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), all footprint lengths were used without offset because of their consistent 3′ phasing. Start codon reads were taken as the number of 3′ read ends located 15 nt downstream of the A of AUG. For analysis of start/body read correlation with DESeq changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), 20–22 mers were also used in addition to long footprints. ORF body reads were taken as the total number of in-frame reads from the gene, excluding reads from the last 5 codons, and only genes with ≥64 reads were included.</p>
<p>The deviation of nucleotide usage in genes with start/body ratios sensitive to <italic>lso2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005903.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) was calculated as follows.

At each position <italic>i</italic>, the bias in usage of nucleotide <italic>N</italic> in the top quartile of genes was calculated as
