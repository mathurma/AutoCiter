        <p>Predicting the clinical outcome of cancer patients based on the expression of marker genes in their tumors has received increasing interest in the past decade. Accurate predictors of outcome and response to therapy could be used to personalize and thereby improve therapy. However, state of the art methods used so far often found marker genes with limited prediction accuracy, limited reproducibility, and unclear biological relevance. To address this problem, we developed a novel computational approach to identify genes prognostic for outcome that couples gene expression measurements from primary tumor samples with a network of known relationships between the genes. Our approach ranks genes according to their prognostic relevance using both expression and network information in a manner similar to Google's PageRank. We applied this method to gene expression profiles which we obtained from 30 patients with pancreatic cancer, and identified seven candidate marker genes prognostic for outcome. Compared to genes found with state of the art methods, such as Pearson correlation of gene expression with survival time, we improve the prediction accuracy by up to 7%. Accuracies were assessed using support vector machine classifiers and Monte Carlo cross-validation. We then validated the prognostic value of our seven candidate markers using immunohistochemistry on an independent set of 412 pancreatic cancer samples. Notably, signatures derived from our candidate markers were independently predictive of outcome and superior to established clinical prognostic factors such as grade, tumor size, and nodal status. As the amount of genomic data of individual tumors grows rapidly, our algorithm meets the need for powerful computational approaches that are key to exploit these data for personalized cancer therapies in clinical practice.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Why do some people with the same type of cancer die early and some live long? Apart from influences from the environment and personal lifestyle, we believe that differences in the individual tumor genome account for different survival times. Recently, powerful methods have become available to systematically read genomic information of patient samples. The major remaining challenge is how to spot, among the thousands of changes, those few that are relevant for tumor aggressiveness and thereby affecting patient survival. Here, we make use of the fact that genes and proteins in a cell never act alone, but form a network of interactions. Finding the relevant information in big networks of web documents and hyperlinks has been mastered by Google with their PageRank algorithm. Similar to PageRank, we have developed an algorithm that can identify genes that are better indicators for survival than genes found by traditional algorithms. Our method can aid the clinician in deciding if a patient should receive chemotherapy or not. Reliable prediction of survival and response to therapy based on molecular markers bears a great potential to improve and personalize patient therapies in the future.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In the past decade, several studies have used microarray gene expression data from tumors to predict the clinical outcome of patients (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002511.s007">Table S1</xref></bold>). The tumors included breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Srlie1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Wang1">[5]</xref>, lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Beer1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Boutros1">[8]</xref>, lymphomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Shipp1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Lenz1">[13]</xref>, leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Yeoh1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Bullinger1">[15]</xref>, and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Pomeroy1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Stratford1">[18]</xref>. Outcome is usually measured by categorical, often binary variables such as survival up to a certain time, recurrence of tumor or metastasis before a certain time, or success of treatment. Predicting such variables from gene expression levels can be viewed as a classification problem, and the set of genes used for prediction is commonly referred to as a signature. Accurate outcome prediction can be used clinically to select the best of several available therapies for a cancer patient. For instance, a low risk patient can be advised to select a less radical therapy.</p>
      <p>Whereas differences in gene expression between tumor and healthy tissue or between different tumor tissues are often strong, gene expression differences between patients with the same type of tumor but different outcome are more subtle. For example, distinguishing acute myeloid from acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been demonstrated to be up to 100% accurate using only a few genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Golub1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Li1">[21]</xref>. In contrast, outcome prediction is a much harder problem, with classification accuracies commonly in the range of 50–70%. It is therefore not surprising that many studies suffer from one or several of the following three problems: (i) limited or overoptimistic prediction accuracy, (ii) limited reproducibility, and (iii) unclear biological relevance of the genes used for prediction. For example, an early study predicting breast cancer metastasis using 70 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-vantVeer1">[3]</xref> was subsequently found (i) to have lower than initially published predictive accuracy on the same or independent data sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Michiels1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Buyse1">[23]</xref>, (ii) to be difficult to reproduce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Tibshirani1">[24]</xref>, and (iii) to have used 70 genes that can be easily replaced by 70 different but equally predictive genes derived from the same data, questioning the biological relevance of the particular 70 genes of the original study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-EinDor1">[25]</xref>. Notably, predictive gene sets derived from different studies for the same disease show almost zero overlap, questioning their biological relevance.</p>
      <p>To address and overcome these problems we have developed a computational network-based strategy for outcome prediction. Our algorithm, NetRank, couples gene expression measurements with a network of known relationships between the genes' products. NetRank is based on Google's PageRank algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Page1">[26]</xref>. PageRank uses the hyperlink information between web documents to better decide which documents are the most relevant ones. Similarly, NetRank uses biological interaction information between genes' products to better decide which genes are the most relevant for outcome prediction. Such interaction information is available in protein–protein, transcription factor–target, or gene co-expression networks. The inclusion of network information serves two purposes. First, gene products with many interactions should have a higher biological relevance since they can exert a bigger influence on a biological system. Second, considering network neighbors can help the algorithm to ignore correlations between expression and outcome that have no underlying biological causality. Such correlations can arise simply by chance, often due to the fact that microarray measurements are noisy and that the number of samples is typically several orders of magnitudes smaller than the number of genes investigated.</p>
      <p>We wanted to test the NetRank idea on outcome prediction for pancreatic cancer, for which no microarray-derived signature was yet published. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma accounts for approximately 130,000 deaths each year in Europe and the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Ferlay1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Jemal1">[28]</xref>. It has an extremely poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate below 2% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Gudjonsson1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Beger1">[30]</xref>. Currently, only a few prognostic factors for pancreatic cancer survival are used in the clinical setting, among them CA 19-9, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, levels of white blood cells, aspartate transaminase, and blood urea nitrogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Stocken1">[31]</xref>. A considerable number of protein markers for pancreatic cancer prognosis have been investigated using immunohistochemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Garcea1">[32]</xref>. However, the clinical value of most of these markers remains to be determined, and also most of these markers were found by chance or educated guesses rather than a systematic, genome-wide approach.</p>
      <p>The aim of our study was therefore (i) to carry out a genome-wide screen for genes whose expression in pancreatic cancer tissue samples reliably correlates with the patient survival time, and (ii) to use these genes as a molecular signature for reliable survival prediction. To this end, we collected and analyzed tissue samples from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from Germany in a multi-center study. Applying NetRank to gene expression profiles of these samples identified seven candidate marker genes prognostic for outcome. To assess the clinical value of our identified marker genes, we validated them on an independent patient cohort. We found that signatures based on these markers were more accurate than traditional clinical parameters and more accurate than signatures identified with other computational approaches.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We obtained gene expression profiles of sufficient quality from 30 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples of patients that underwent surgery in German university hospitals between 1996 and 2007, hereafter referred to as the screening dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for quality criteria and experimental details). For each patient, the clinical parameters age, sex, cancer staging according to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification, and survival time after operation were recorded. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002511-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> shows an overview of the patient characteristics. For predicting the prognosis of a patient, we assigned patient samples to either a poor or a good prognosis group depending on patient survival time. Such an assignment is straightforward if the survival time is bimodally distributed. However, such a bimodal distribution is often absent in cancer patient survival times (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002511.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). In this case, a common choice is to split by the median survival time independently of the distribution (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Lenz1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Raponi1">[33]</xref>), which has the advantage of yielding two classes of equal size. Thus, we defined prognosis as poor if the patient survival time was less than the median survival time of 17.5 months, and as good otherwise. This resulted in two prognosis groups with 15 patient samples each. The goal was to identify a signature of genes whose expression levels allowed to correctly predict the prognosis group of a patient. Since we wanted the resulting signature to be applicable in a clinical setting using immunohistochemistry staining of the signature proteins, we opted for a signature size in the order of five to ten genes.</p>

        <title>Signature evaluation methodology</title>
        <p>To identify signature genes, various state of the art methods exist. To evaluate these methods in comparison to our own NetRank method on the screening dataset, the following workflow was employed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002511-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). After filtering out low expression and low variance genes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>8,000 genes remained as potential signature genes. Five different methods for ranking genes according to their power to discriminate between the two prognosis groups were tested: (i) fold change, as defined by the ratio of a gene's mean expression in one group over the other group, (ii) the t-statistic, (iii) Pearson and Spearman rank correlation coefficients of a gene's expression with the survival time of the patient, (iv) the SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Tusher1">[34]</xref>, and (v) our NetRank algorithm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). In addition, selecting genes randomly was included as a control method. For each method, a support vector machine classifier was trained using the 5–10 top ranked genes as features. Prediction accuracy as defined as the percentage of correctly classified samples was evaluated with different training and test set sizes. All feature selection and machine learning steps were subjected to Monte Carlo cross-validation, which is a recommended and relatively un-biased evaluation strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Michiels1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Boulesteix1">[35]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002511-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).</p>

For each patient, the outcome (poor or good) is given (1). The dataset is randomly divided into a training and a test set (2). Within the training set, genes are ranked by how different they are between patients with poor and good outcome (3). The most different genes are selected (4). They are used to train a machine learning classifier on the training set (5). After training, the classifier is asked to predict the outcome of the test set patients (6). The predicted outcome is compared with the true outcome and the number of correctly classified patients is noted (7). Steps 2–7 are repeated 1,000 times, and the resulting final accuracy is obtained by averaging over the 1,000 accuracies of step 7.</p>

        <title>NetRank, a network-based approach for identifying predictive marker genes from microarray data</title>
        <p>We introduce NetRank, a modified version of the PageRank algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Page2">[36]</xref>. As employed by the Google Internet search engine, the PageRank algorithm uses network information (hyperlinks) between documents in the world wide web to assess the relevance of a document. A document is important if it is highly cited by other documents. Moreover, citations from important documents have more weight than citations from unimportant documents. Thus, in order to measure the relative importance of a document within the set of all web documents, PageRank ranks a document according to the number of highly ranked documents that point to it. Similarly, NetRank assigns a score to a gene which is influenced by the scores of genes linked to it. This linkage can be defined in several ways. Morrison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Morrison1">[37]</xref> described an adaptation of PageRank which uses networks where genes are connected if they share a Gene Ontology annotation. Here, we employ known transcription factor–target relationships (from TRANSFAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Matys1">[38]</xref>), protein–protein interaction (from HPRD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Mishra1">[39]</xref>), and gene co-expression (from COXPRESdb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Obayashi1">[40]</xref>) to define three different gene–gene networks, which were used with NetRank. NetRank first assigns as a score for each gene the absolute correlation of its mRNA expression level with the patient survival time in the dataset. The network is then used to spread this correlation to its neighbors and beyond. The genes with the highest NetRank score are then selected as signature genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).</p>

      <sec id="s2c">
        <title>NetRank outperforms traditional approaches</title>
        <p>We first compared the three above mentioned networks for NetRank and found that signatures obtained using the TRANSFAC transcription factor network consistently had higher predictive accuracies than those using the protein interaction or the co-expression network. We therefore decided to only use the TRANSFAC network for NetRank in the following experiments.</p>
        <p>For all training set sizes, signatures selected with NetRank using the TRANSFAC transcription factor–target network showed higher predictive accuracies than those selected by any of the other four methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002511-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). NetRank showed a maximum accuracy of 72% (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> standard error of the mean, s.e.m.) with a training set of 28 samples and a signature size of 7 genes. This compares favorably to studies in other cancers, which show accuracies in the range of 50–70%. We found that NetRank is especially beneficial for small training set sizes, where there is a 7% (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> s.e.m.) improvement in accuracy compared to the Pearson correlation method.</p>

        <p>Since many single prognostic markers for pancreatic cancer have been described in the literature, we next asked whether markers found with NetRank were superior to these literature markers. To this end, 51 markers identified via a literature search were used to train a support vector machine with different training set sizes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002511.s008">Table S2</xref></bold>). Surprisingly, we found that the NetRank markers showed on average a 12% higher accuracy than the literature markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002511-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>Using NetRank, we identified seven genes (<italic>STAT3</italic>, <italic>FOS</italic>, <italic>JUN</italic>, <italic>SP1</italic>, <italic>CDX2</italic>, <italic>CEBPA</italic>, and <italic>BRCA1</italic>) as most relevant for predicting survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

        <p>The marker protein with the most regulatory interactions is the transcription factor SP1. Some of its targets are additionally regulated by other markers such as CEBPA, STAT3, FOS, and JUN. One interesting module defined by the genes that are regulated by SP1 and FOS is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002511-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>.

        <title>Two immunohistochemistry signatures predict survival for patients with and without adjuvant therapy</title>
        <p>To validate our findings, we analyzed protein levels of our markers in an independent set of 412 patients (the validation dataset, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002511-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). We wanted to test how well the proteins encoded by the marker genes are indicative for the survival of a patient when assessed by immunohistochemical staining of the patient's tumor. Using tissue microarrays, immunohistochemistry stainings were obtained for each of the seven marker proteins STAT3, FOS, JUN, SP1, CDX2, CEBPA, and BRCA1 for each patient in the validation dataset (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002511.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>). The predictive accuracies of the marker staining intensities (encoded in two levels, low or high, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) were evaluated after training a support vector machine classifier in a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. The classifier predicted patients to belong either to a low risk (good prognosis) group, or to a high risk (poor prognosis) group. Using backward elimination, starting from the full set of markers, markers were removed one at a time until the accuracy of the trained classifier failed to improve. The clinical parameters tumor size (T), regional lymph nodes (N), distant metastasis (M), histological grade (G) and residual tumor (R) were tested in the same manner for comparison.</p>
        <p>Since some patients in the validation dataset received adjuvant therapy (mostly chemotherapy with gemcitabine), and the adjuvant therapy had an influence on survival time (although not quite as expected, see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002511.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>), we split the validation dataset into a group of patients with and without adjuvant therapy. Note that the decision to treat a patient with adjuvant chemotherapy is so far not based on any molecular markers (which was one motivation for our study). Chemotherapy is part of the standard treatment for pancreatic cancer in Germany since many years and is recommended for every patient. However, patients in a reduced state of health and patients who refuse it will not receive chemotherapy.</p>

          <title>Signatures are superior to clinical parameters and independently predictive of outcome</title>
          <p>Both signatures based on immunohistochemical staining of the tumor tissue improve prediction of patient prognosis. Comparison of the above signature accuracies shows that the additional predictive value of the signature markers compared to clinical parameters is 9% for patients with and 6% for patients without adjuvant therapy (70% versus 61% for adjuvant, and 65% versus 59% for non-adjuvant therapy).</p>
          <p>To further ensure that the markers predict survival independently from clinical parameters, we tested if there was a significant interaction in a Cox proportional hazard model for any pair of a marker and a clinical parameter. We did not find a significant interaction between any marker and any clinical parameter (N, M, G, R) used in our signatures. Hence, the markers found in our study are independently predictive of outcome and superior to established clinical parameters.</p>
          <p>One important finding of our validation was that the accuracy dropped from 72% to 65% when going from mRNA to protein level. Two reasons are likely to contribute to this fact. First, protein levels are known to not always correlate well with mRNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Chen1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-rntoft1">[51]</xref>.

        <title>Comparison with other studies</title>
        <p>The accuracies of our signatures are comparable to those found in other cancer studies. Stratford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Stratford1">[18]</xref> found six genes differentially expressed in tumors from pancreatic cancer patients with localized disease compared to metastatic disease using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Tusher1">[34]</xref>. Based on these six genes, they classified patients into high- and low-risk groups with 1-year survival rates of 55% and 91%, respectively. Our signatures classify patients into high- and low-risk groups with 1-year survival rates of 54% and 76%, respectively (adjuvant six-gene signature) and 55% and 69%, respectively (non-adjuvant five-gene signature). Unfortunately, Stratford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Stratford1">[18]</xref> did not report a classification accuracy percentage. Most surprisingly, although patients and methods were different, the six genes identified in their study and our seven genes share one gene of the Fos family. As mentioned before, there has hardly been any overlap among the signatures published so far for one tumor type. The discovery of <italic>FOS</italic> in both methods thus highlights its importance for tumor progression and outcome in pancreatic cancer, and further underlines the ability of our method to find reproducible and biologically significant markers.</p>

A value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the TRANSFAC network of transcription factors and their regulated targets gave the best results in terms of predictive accuracy of the identified signature genes.

Unfortunately, there seems to be no optimal damping factor across different cancer microarray studies. The value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is optimal for this one study. We also have data for optimal d-values in ten other cancer studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Wang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Lenz1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Raponi1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Bogunovic1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Zhu1">[58]</xref> and they vary (from 0.1 to 0.9, with 0.3 being the most frequent value). This suggests that in some cases more distant genes exert a stronger influence. Also, the incompleteness of current interaction networks implies that the fraction of disease-relevant genes covered by the network varies between diseases. For some studies, the network might cover the particular disease-relevant genes well and for others not. Thus, the d-value indicates also the match of the network's coverage and connectivity to the particular study.</p>

At each iteration the surfer makes a step from one node to one of its neighbors with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> he makes a jump to a random node in the network. In NetRank such a random node is selected with probability proportional to the correlation of the corresponding gene expression with patient survival (given by vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). With <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the probability of making two consecutive steps is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, the final ranking is obtained with information that comes for more than 90% from initial correlation values and direct neighbors only.</p>
          <p>So how does an algorithm perform that considers only direct neighbors instead of the whole network? In other words, is the global network structure needed to judge each gene, or is its local neighborhood sufficient? We implemented a variant of NetRank that spreads values only to direct neighbors. Each node is ranked according to the average of the initial node values of its direct neighbors. To our surprise, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002511.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>, this direct neighbor variant performed almost identically to the ranking by Pearson correlation (without network information). Hence, at least for this study, it is important to also consider distant neighbors.</p>
          <p>With a sufficiently large number of training samples, NetRank nearly always performs best, but the difference to Pearson correlation and the direct neighbor method becomes sufficiently small. With few training samples, NetRank and the network only (constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value) approach compete for the best accuracy. It seems that the strength of NetRank is to rely on network topology when data are sparse and correlation can be misleading, and to shift to relying on correlation when sufficient data is available.</p>

In fact, for the ten other cancer outcome studies we investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Wang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Lenz1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Raponi1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Bogunovic1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Zhu1">[58]</xref>, a TRANSFAC-based network gave the best results in seven, and a HPRD-based network in three of the studies.</p>

          <title>Filtering</title>
          <p>We initially filtered out low expression and low variance genes from our microarray data. It is commonly agreed upon that this is a necessary first step when searching for discriminative genes in microarray data. But since NetRank is a network-based, integrative approach, removing genes that could otherwise provide information for their neighboring nodes is probably a suboptimal strategy. For NetRank, we therefore keep all genes, but assign an initial value of zero to those genes that do not pass the filter. This leads for example to downranking of a node that has many neighbors with a value of zero, but it also allows for upranking of a node with an initial value of zero that has many high value neighbors.</p>
          <p>The question if filtering is necessary at all however remains. One would expect NetRank to be robust against “noise” since it uses additional network information that can help to detect and ignore noise. To clarify, our initial filtering actually serves two purposes. It removes not only noise (genes with low expression that are most likely not expressed), but also removes uninformative genes (genes that have low variance and thus cannot be used to discriminate between any classes in the data). Note that uninformative genes can be highly expressed – in our data, one third of the genes have high expression, but low variance.</p>
          <p>To separately assess the effect of noisy (low expression) and uninformative (low variance) genes on the accuracy we ran further experiments with subsets of our data. The results were quite interesting. When we did remove uninformative genes but not remove noisy genes, the resulting accuracy was still 71% (compared to 72% in the original filtering). This suggests that NetRank is rather robust to noise. However, when we did remove noisy genes but not remove uninformative genes, the accuracy dropped to 56%, which suggests that NetRank is not robust at all with respect to the presence of uninformative genes. Inspection of the highly ranked genes in this case revealed that the majority of them were uninformative high expression, low variance genes. As the top 5–10 genes are used for classification in our SVM, it is not surprising for the accuracy to drop if more than half of these genes are uninformative and hence cannot help in classification. A comparison with the original filtered approach showed that the previous top-ranked nodes are still found, but that the uninformative nodes score even higher.</p>
          <p>So why does NetRank assign high scores to uninformative genes? There is a simple explanation: the input for NetRank are not use gene expression values, but the genes' correlation with survival. So besides the network, the basis for ranking is a gene's absolute correlation coefficient, not its expression value. When we plotted the distribution of these correlation coefficients in four different groups (low/high expression/variance), we found that the highly expressed uninformative genes had very similar correlation coefficients compared to informative genes (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002511.s006">Figure S6</xref></bold>). This means that is virtually impossible for NetRank to detect if a gene will be uninformative for classification, as it can have an equally good correlation value than an informative gene. The fact that many highly expressed low variance genes are apparently correlated with survival suggests that either Pearson correlation is not an ideal measure here, or that the number of samples is too small to give a higher correlation signal in the informative genes. Since Spearman rank correlations show a similar pattern, we believe that the latter is true and that for this dataset size filtering is the best strategy.</p>
          <p>To summarize, while NetRank is rather robust against noisy low expression measurements, it is essential to filter out uninformative genes (i.e. set their initial values to zero) before running NetRank.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we present a novel method for identifying prognostic markers from genome-wide gene expression data. A key feature of the method is that it judges the relevance of a gene as marker not only by its expression (or rather the correlation of its expression with survival), but also by the expression of its neighbors. Thus, it can detect and therefore avoid markers that correlate with survival simply by chance or noisy measurements, but not due to an underlying biological causality. We applied this method to microarray data from 30 freshly frozen samples of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and obtained a prognostic marker set of seven genes. This set showed an accuracy of 72% in predicting the prognosis of a patient. To ensure validity of this result, we employed a rigorous Monte Carlo cross-validation procedure. We then validated these genes using high-throughput immunohistochemistry of samples from surgically resected tumors from an independent cohort of 412 patients; roughly half of these received adjuvant therapy. From the marker set we derived a six-gene signature for patients with adjuvant therapy and a five-gene signature for patients without adjuvant therapy. Both signatures improve prediction of patient prognosis compared to the use of clinical parameters when used for immunohistochemical staining of the tumor tissue. The additional predictive value of the signature markers compared to clinical parameters was 9% for patients with and 6% for patients without adjuvant therapy (as the best combination of clinical parameters only showed a predictive accuracy of 61% and 59%, respectively). Whereas the use of microarrays in clinical practice is limited by the large number of genes, complicated analytical methods, and the need for fresh-frozen tissue, RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry of a small number of proteins can be done routinely in a clinical setting.</p>
      <p>Note that the samples were obtained during initial surgery, before any of the patients received adjuvant therapy. The expression signatures we identified predicted clinical outcomes specific for patients with and without adjuvant therapy. These signatures could be used to stratify patients for adjuvant treatment of the disease: A patient that is classified as low risk (good prognosis) by the adjuvant therapy signature should receive adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, whereas a patient that is classified as low risk by the no adjuvant therapy signature might have a longer survival without chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>Our signature genes can also help to stratify pancreatic cancer patients for new therapies. STAT3 was found to be the best single prognostic marker, with a high expression of STAT3 indicating a high risk. STAT3 inhibitors might therefore be promising therapeutic agents. It is known that a large percentage of pancreatic cancers feature aberrantly activated STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Yu1">[59]</xref>. Very recently, novel STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitors were demonstrated to suppress growth in pancreatic cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Lin1">[60]</xref>.</p>
      <p>For breast cancer, an FDA approved microarray-based test that uses the 70-gene signature by van't Veer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-vantVeer1">[3]</xref> to assess the metastatic risk in patients with node negative breast cancer is commercially available and can be utilized clinically. In a validation study on an independent data set of 307 node-negative breast cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Buyse1">[23]</xref>, the 70-gene test was shown to have a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 42%. The accuracy, however, resulted in 50%, which is equivalent to guessing. The reported ROC curve for predicting time to distant metastases shows the same area under curve of 68% as our signature for predicting prognosis in patients with adjuvant therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002511-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). Using an appropriate cut-off, our signature also shows a high sensitivity of 83% with a specificity of 45% (upper right corner of the ROC curve, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002511.s004">Figure S4A</xref></bold>). It therefore can be used reliably to identify a group of patients who seem to benefit from the adjuvant therapy.</p>
      <p>Our study emphasizes the benefit of systematic network-based approaches that incorporate background knowledge for identifying biologically relevant marker genes. Correlations between gene expression levels and a clinical variable of interest can arise simply by chance, without any underlying biological cause, especially with few patient samples. One example for such a spurious correlation in our screening dataset is the <italic>HBA1</italic> gene, which encodes for hemoglobin alpha, and which showed a strong negative correlation with survival. Although <italic>HBA1</italic> would have been a candidate marker when ranked merely by correlation, it was not ranked among the top ten markers by NetRank. Since we found the idea of a cancer tissue expressing hemoglobin interesting and worth exploring further, we decided to include HBA1 in the immunohistochemistry validation. However, immunohistochemical staining for hemoglobin in the validation dataset was incapable of defining significantly different risk groups. In addition, adding HBA1 to our signatures did not improve, but impaired their predictive accuracies. We conclude that the strong negative correlation of <italic>HBA1</italic> expression levels with survival time in the screening dataset might have been caused by chance and not by any underlying biologically relevant causality. Network-based methods such as NetRank can add such causality for example in the form of known gene regulatory networks, resulting in the identification of markers that are more likely to be truly relevant.</p>
      <p>Recent work by the Ideker lab also emphasized the benefit of network-based approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Chuang1">[61]</xref>. Their study demonstrated that markers based on protein interaction subnetworks are first more reproducible than individual marker genes and second can improve classification accuracy for the van't Veer breast cancer dataset by 8% compared to the original 70 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-vantVeer1">[3]</xref>. A further approach documenting the usefulness of networks employed PageRank to identify genes cross-talking between already published cancer genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Nibbe1">[62]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During the progress of our study, another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Johannes1">[63]</xref> was published which used PageRank on protein interaction networks to improve recursive feature elimination for support vector machine learning. They found that this improved the prediction of <italic>ERBB2</italic> status and relapse in breast cancer. However, neither of these two studies validated their genes on an external patient cohort to demonstrate the validity of markers found with PageRanking based on biological networks. Moreover, we found that the use of transcription factor–target networks yields more accurate signatures than the use of protein interactions networks in cancer outcome studies.</p>
      <p>The use of background knowledge in order to get more robust and more biologically meaningful signatures comes at a price. It is in the nature of the NetRank algorithm to favor genes with many connections, since they can increase their ranking, whereas uncharacterized genes with no connections cannot. Hence, marker genes found with NetRank are more likely to be well known and well-described in the literature and less likely to be previously uncharacterized. We also found that the predictive accuracy of the immunohistochemistry -based markers was lower than that of the microarray-based markers. One potential bias stems from the different design of tissue microarrays, which vary in the number of cores per case, core size, and density. In addition, the semi-quantitative evaluation of the immunohistochemical staining tends to be less accurate and less objective than microarray-based gene expression profiling.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the expression signatures we identified predicted clinical outcomes in patients with surgically resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma specific for patients with and without adjuvant therapy. Since these signatures could be used to stratify patients for adjuvant treatment of the disease, they are a potential additional piece of information in clinical decision making and can help to reduce costs, improve patient survival, and quality of life.</p>

The MIAME compliant data were deposited in the ArrayExpress database under the accession number E-MEXP-2780. Since our goal was to find a small number (five to ten) of reliable markers, we wanted to make sure that any candidate markers that we test further do not fall into one the categories of (i) low variance between all samples and therefore not discriminative, (ii) de facto not expressed, or (iii) expressed at very low levels and thus not reliably measured in our microarray data. This is achieved by the filtering steps described in the following. Note that for NetRank, filtering out meant actually not removing, but setting intial values to zero in order to prevent loss of edges from the network due to node removal.</p>
          <p>First, to remove noise from genes with low expression, probe sets with a mean expression below 6 on the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> scale were filtered out from the dataset. Out of an initial 54,675 probe sets (measuring the expression of 20,111 genes), <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>30,000 remained after this filtering. Second, genes whose expression shows little variation between patients are not informative as they cannot discriminate between patient groups. We therefore filtered out probe sets with a standard deviation below 0.5 on the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> scale.

Third, we decided to keep for each gene only the probe set with the highest mean expression over all patients. We generally found a high correlation between probe sets reporting for the same gene. Keeping only the one probe set with the highest mean expression for each gene reduced the number of probe sets to 7,871 (measuring the expression of 7,871 genes). This is the size of the dataset that was used for all subsequent analyses. For NetRank, in order not to lose edges due to missing nodes, the size of the dataset was 20,111, with all except the 7,871 genes initialized with zero.</p>

Here, we follow the notation and implementation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Morrison1">[37]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e043" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>Here <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the ranking of page <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> after <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> iterations, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a symmetric adjacency matrix for the gene network, so <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if genes <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are connected, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> otherwise. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a vector of absolute Pearson correlation coefficients of gene expression values with the patient survival time, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a fixed parameter describing the influence of the network on the rank of a page.

The value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> appears to be used by Google <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002511-Page1">[26]</xref>. The rank of a gene depends on the rank of all genes that link to it. Scaling by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the summation ensures that each gene has equal influence in the voting procedure.

For NetRank, we added an additional inner cross-validation loop (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002511-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>, steps 2a to 2d). In this inner cross-validation, a part of the training set samples were set aside, and different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ranging from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1 were used to run NetRank on the remaining training set samples. Accuracies of the top-ranked genes were then tested on the samples previously set aside. As a result of the inner cross-validation, one <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was chosen and used once for deriving a signature based on the whole training set, and evaluating its accuracy on the test set. It is important to note that no information of the test set is used for selecting <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so the choice of a value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the inner cross-validation does not rely on any prediction accuracy in the test set data. We found that a value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002511.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the TRANSFAC network of transcription factors and their regulated targets gave the best results in terms of predictive accuracy of the identified signature genes.
