The intervening regulatory region is called a “bidirectional promoter.” These promoters are often associated with genes that function in DNA repair, with the potential to participate in the development of cancer. No connection between these gene pairs and cancer has been previously investigated. Using the database of spliced-expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we identified the most complete collection of human transcripts under the control of bidirectional promoters. A rigorous screen of the spliced EST data identified new bidirectional promoters, many of which functioned as alternative promoters or regulated novel transcripts. Additionally, we show a highly significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancer, including a substantial number of genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers. The repeated use of this promoter structure in the human genome suggests it could regulate co-expression patterns among groups of genes. Using microarray expression data from 79 human tissues, we verify regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters. Subsets of these promoters contain similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor binding sites in <italic>ERBB2, FANCD2,</italic> and <italic>BRCA2.</italic> Interpreting the regulation of genes involved in co-expression networks, especially those involved in cancer, will be an important step toward defining molecular events that may contribute to disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Promoters are regulatory regions that control transcription of genes. A special class of promoters, known as <italic>bidirectional</italic> promoters, regulates expression of two genes instead of one. These promoters are situated between two adjacent genes whose transcription start sites are physically within 1,000 bp and oriented in opposite directions. Bidirectional promoters are found repeatedly in the genome, suggesting an important biological significance for this regulatory configuration. We developed an algorithm to map bidirectional promoters using data from a comprehensive list of transcribed sequences known as expressed sequence tags, or ESTs. This approach improved the number of previously characterized bidirectional promoters by 300%. Included in the new data are bidirectional promoters that regulate expression of genes implicated in somatic cancers. For instance, ten well-recognized genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers were identified as having bidirectional promoters. Three of the genes are further related by having duplicate copies of the same binding site for a transcription factor within their bidirectional promoters. These binding sites are conserved among species, providing greater evidence that they are functionally important. This example, in which similar regulatory structures are used to control genes involved in cancer, illustrates how data can be mined from the comprehensive set of bidirectional promoters. Within this manuscript, we show statistical evidence that many cancer genes are regulated by bidirectional promoters. These promoters will be a valuable dataset for studying the role of gene regulation in tumor development.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The Intramural Research Program of the National Human Genome Research Institute, US National Institutes of Health, supported this research.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Yang MQ, Koehly LM, Elnitski LL (2007) Comprehensive annotation of bidirectional promoters identifies co-regulation among breast and ovarian cancer genes.

The definition of 1,000 bp is supported by analyses of Trinklein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b002">2</xref>], which show an enrichment of genes whose 5′ ends are on opposite strands and within 1,000 bp and no enrichment of genes with 5′ ends on the same strand at this distance. The sequences between the transcription start sites of bidirectional gene pairs are known as bidirectional promoters, and they influence expression of both adjacent genes. Bidirectional promoters represent a regulatory construction that is utilized repeatedly in the human genome, with 1,352 known examples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b002">2</xref>].</p><p>Despite substantial interest in these promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b003">3</xref>], the biological significance of this regulatory architecture is not well-established. The bidirectional arrangement is conserved among species, suggesting that it is functionally important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b002">2</xref>]. Furthermore, a strand-specific pattern of the nucleotides in these promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b003">3</xref>] could play a role in binding regulatory proteins. For instance, SP1-binding sites have been suggested as key regulators of CpG island promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b004">4</xref>]. If groups of bidirectional promoters are similarly regulated, then distantly located genes under the control of these promoters should show common expression patterns. Additional regulatory factors must also be involved, because genes that form a bidirectional pair are not always expressed together. Experimental studies show that within a pair, genes can be expressed in a mutually exclusive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b002">2</xref>]. How the intervening promoter sequence preferentially activates one gene versus another is currently unknown.</p><p>The categories of genes regulated by these promoters imply that specialized transcription factor binding sites could regulate expression of these genes. For instance, bidirectional promoters regulate DNA repair genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b001">1</xref>]. DNA repair genes frequently play a role in cancer that is elicited through mutations in their coding sequences. However, another plausible scenario toward the development of cancer comes from the misregulation of bidirectional promoters, especially if they contain common transcription factor binding sites. These sites would be candidates to explain a general mechanism in which regulatory disruptions at bidirectional promoters could play a pivotal role in cancer.</p><p>We developed a new algorithm to comprehensively map bidirectional promoters in the human genome using spliced expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The extended set of bidirectional promoters elucidates relationships among genes regulated by bidirectional promoters through co-expression networks. We show evidence that a subset of these promoters, which regulate genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers, contain transcription factor binding sites in common.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mapping and Validation of Bidirectional Promoters</title><p>Although ESTs frequently represent truncated forms of full-length mRNAs, large EST collections can provide robust evidence of uncharacterized bidirectional promoters through a combination of features. For instance, the UCSC (University of California Santa Cruz) Human Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>) annotates the direction of transcription for each EST. Also, EST data contains thousands of transcripts captured by oligo-capping techniques, providing enrichment in the 5′ sequences of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b005">5</xref>]. Given this information, we hypothesized that neighboring, spliced ESTs, which are transcribed in opposite directions and initiate within 1 kb of one another, are unlikely to represent disconnected pieces of the same transcript, and thereby represent either a bidirectional or a <italic>cis</italic>-antisense overlapping gene pair.</p><p>Our initial screen to identify bidirectional promoters partitioned the output according to its presence within annotation tracks of the UCSC Genome Browser. Because the spliced ESTs are the most complicated dataset, priority was given to promoters identified in more highly curated datasets, such as Known Genes and GenBank mRNA, over the spliced human ESTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b006">6</xref>]. Our dataset was compared with the previously published collection of bidirectional promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b002">2</xref>], confirming 99.6% of that collection and contributing an additional 300% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030072-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of newly identified bidirectional promoters came from the GenBank mRNA track (2,862) and from the spliced EST data (1,785). Overall, the spliced ESTs and mRNA identified nearly equivalent amounts of these promoters (3,529 or 3,855, respectively), but priority was given to the mRNA annotations for direct comparison to the previous dataset.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030072-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030072.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Identification of Bidirectional Promoters</title><p>The diagram depicts how bidirectional promoters were identified from the UCSC Human Genome Browser annotations, including Known Genes, mRNA, and spliced ESTs.

All promoters defined only by EST data were scrutinized by comparison with GenBank mRNA and UCSC Known Genes to detect complementary support for the direction of transcription. In this way, we determined that 1,100 of the EST transcripts flanking a bidirectional promoter are novel transcripts, overlapping nothing in either reference track. Another 974 overlap an mRNA or Known Gene, and extend the 5′ position of that reference gene by more than 100 bp. Some of these extension events add a full 5′ UTR to the reference gene and cover extreme distances to join an upstream alternative promoter. For example, the bidirectional promoters identified upstream of <italic>ERBB2</italic> (<italic>HER2/NEU</italic>) or novel gene <italic>AK094318</italic> lie 10 kb and 140 kb away, respectively, from additional downstream promoters (unpublished data).</p><p>To validate the EST gene pairs using biological evidence, all intervening regions were examined for two features known to associate with promoters: TAF250 binding (or TAF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b007">7</xref>]) and CpG islands. Greater than 50% of the bidirectional promoters identified solely from the spliced EST data have TAF250 present at both transcription start sites (and 70% have at least 1), and more than 90% have CpG islands. Thus, the bidirectional promoters identified using the spliced EST data can represent biologically active promoters. Furthermore, to verify biological activity of these predicted bidirectional promoters, each was compared with existing 5′ capped transcription data (known as CAGE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b008">8</xref>]. This independent experimental data confirmed the expression of pairs of flanking transcripts for 91%, 58%, and 65% of the promoters in the Known Genes, mRNA, and EST datasets, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030072-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Significant Overrepresentation of Bidirectional Promoters Associated with Cancer-Related Genes</title><p>The strong enrichment of bidirectional promoters associated with DNA repair genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b001">1</xref>] implies a possible link between this regulatory mechanism and genes participating in cancer pathways. Therefore, we examined DNA maintenance, metabolism, and repair genes from the COSMIC database (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b009">9</xref>]) for an association with bidirectional promoters. Of 302 genes implicated in somatic cancer, 45% had bidirectional promoters. The association is statistically significant with a <italic>p</italic>-value of ≤10e-6. In comparison, when sampled randomly from the genome, only 31% of human genes were associated with a bidirectional promoter. Furthermore, without our EST and mRNA analyses, only 12% of the genes on the COSMIC list could be identified as having a bidirectional promoter.</p><p>Other lists of somatic cancer genes were examined, including breast and colon cancer genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b010">10</xref>]. A significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters was found for somatic breast cancer genes (with a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.01), but not somatic colon cancer genes. These data confirm an association between bidirectional promoters and somatic cancer genes, and indicate that the type of cancer is relevant.</p><p>We further examined bidirectional promoters associated with genes implicated in uterine and ovarian cancers. For instance, 16 genes have been implicated in Type I and II endometrial (uterine) cancers ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b011">11</xref>] and references therein), and we found that eight of them have bidirectional promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030072-st001">Table S1</xref>). Although a comprehensive list of all genes implicated in somatic ovarian cancer is not available, a brief scan identified ten genes associated with mutations or mis-regulation in ovarian (and breast) cancer that have bidirectional promoters (<italic>BRCA1, FANCA, BARD1, FANCF, TP53, BRCA2, CHEK2, ERBB2, FANCB,</italic> and <italic>FANCD2;</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030072-t001">Table 1</xref>). This is the first report of bidirectional promoters for all of these genes except <italic>BRCA1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b012">12</xref>] and for these cancer-related genes as a group. Bidirectional promoters for several of the genes (for example, <italic>BRCA2</italic>) were identified solely from the spliced EST data. Although the partner to <italic>BRCA2</italic> is not a well-recognized gene, it was originally identified through rigorous screening by RT-PCR and sequence conservation to validate its presence in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b013">13</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-0030072-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030072.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Somatic Ovarian Cancer Genes Regulated by Bidirectional Promoters</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030072.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col6" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col7" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Ovarian Cancer Gene</td><td><hr/>Bidirectional Partner</td><td><hr/>Annotation of Partner</td><td><hr/>Decrease in Promoter Range by ESTs (bp)<sup>a</sup></td><td><hr/>Record of Aberrant Methylation</td><td><hr/>TAF250 at TSSs</td><td><hr/>CpG Islands at TSSs</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BARD1</td><td>DA865307</td><td>EST</td><td align="left">EST only</td><td>No evidence</td><td>Both</td><td>Across/first exon of both</td></tr><tr><td>BRCA1</td><td>NBR2</td><td>PC, EST</td><td>&minus;81</td><td>Yes &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b028">28</xref>&rsqb;</td><td>Both</td><td>Inside NBR2</td></tr><tr><td>BRCA2</td><td>DR731263</td><td>EST</td><td align="left">EST only</td><td>Yes &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b029">29</xref>&rsqb;</td><td>Both</td><td>First exon of BRCA2</td></tr><tr><td>CHK2</td><td>HSC20</td><td>PC, EST</td><td>&minus;32</td><td>Yes &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b030">30</xref>&rsqb;</td><td>Both</td><td>First exon of Both</td></tr><tr><td>HER2/ERBB2</td><td>PERLD1</td><td>PC, EST</td><td>&minus;60</td><td>Yes &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b031">31</xref>&rsqb;</td><td>Both</td><td>First exon of Both</td></tr><tr><td>TP53</td><td>AK001247</td><td>PC, EST</td><td>&minus;491</td><td>Yes &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b032">32</xref>&rsqb;</td><td>Both</td><td>Between/first exon of AK001247</td></tr><tr><td>FANCA</td><td>SPIRE2</td><td>EST</td><td>&minus;10,418</td><td>No evidence</td><td>None</td><td>First exon of both</td></tr><tr><td>FANCB</td><td>MOSPD2</td><td>PC, EST</td><td>0</td><td>No evidence</td><td>None</td><td>Across/first exon of both</td></tr><tr><td>FANCD2</td><td>BC043599</td><td>PC, EST</td><td>&minus;64</td><td>No evidence</td><td>Both</td><td>Across/first exon of both</td></tr><tr><td>FANCF</td><td>GAS2</td><td>EST</td><td>&minus;42,706</td><td>Yes &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b029">29</xref>&rsqb;</td><td>Both</td><td>Across/first exon of both</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Annotation resources: PC, protein coding gene in the UCSC Human Genome Browser; EST, spliced EST from the GenBank EST database.</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><p><sup>a</sup>The decrease in promoter distance by ESTs (bp) represents the difference in promoter length detected using ESTs versus the nonEST annotations.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot> --></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Relationships among Genes Regulated by Bidirectional Promoters</title><p>Many of the somatic ovarian cancer genes function in DNA surveillance and repair. Although none of these ten genes flank the same bidirectional promoter, several of them interact in multisubunit complexes implicated in breast or ovarian cancer, suggesting a large network of genes regulated to achieve coordinated functions. To address if bidirectional promoters are limited to a particular protein function, structural domain, or expression pattern, the ovarian cancer genes were clustered with other genes in the genome. Clustering was based on: (1) functional similarity—i.e., using a classification system of the biological function of all protein-coding genes called gene ontology (GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b014">14</xref>]); (2) amino-acid sequence and secondary-structure similarity by comparative alignment through <italic>psi</italic>-blastP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b015">15</xref>]; or (3) similar expression patterns based on microarray data collected from 79 human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b016">16</xref>]. Each type of cluster was assessed for the ratio of bidirectional promoters. These data were graphed on the same <italic>x</italic>-axis, representing the distance between the transcription start sites for the observed bidirectional promoters. In this way, all data in the plot displayed the characteristic asymptotic curve demonstrated in Trinklein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b002">2</xref>], illustrating that the majority of these start sites were separated by ∼300 bp. Furthermore, the ratio of bidirectional promoters was calculated for the cumulative number of genes at each distance. Eight of the ten ovarian cancer genes had a higher ratio of bidirectional promoters in the co-expression clusters than in the <italic>psi</italic>-blastP clusters or GO clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030072-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This result indicated that the set of genes regulated by bidirectional promoters extended beyond a particular function or structure. Therefore, a larger analysis of co-expression patterns could provide meaningful information about co-regulated groups of bidirectional promoters.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030072-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030072.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Clustering Analysis To Assess Bidirectional Promoters</title><p>Clustering methods include microarray expression data (red), GO categories (blue), and <italic>psi</italic>-blastP alignments (green).

Each reference gene was clustered with its closest 500 expression neighbors. By analogy, we confirmed that the human beta-globin gene is most closely co-regulated with the human alpha-globin gene, whose finely balanced expression levels are necessary for physiological homeostasis. Each expression cluster was scored for the ratio of its 500 genes associated with a bidirectional promoter. These data were plotted as the number of clusters versus the ratios, and showed two peaks—containing high or low ratios of bidirectional promoters relative to the genome average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030072-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The ratios ranged from 0.16 to 0.56. Extreme enrichment occurred for clusters containing mRNA processing proteins and mitochondrial proteins (with a <italic>p</italic>-value of ≤1e-100 for clustering of these categories compared with random genome sampling; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030072-st002">Table S2</xref>).

Despite this clustering, the bidirectional promoters were able to regulate each flanking gene separately, as shown by the decreasing correlation coefficient for expression between the pairs of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030072-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030072-g004">4</xref>B).

Additionally, the enrichment was significant compared with a control group of monodirectional promoters in those same clusters [i.e., promoters that regulate genes arranged in a head-to-tail fashion that fell within 1,000 bp of their neighbor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030072-sg002">Figure S2</xref>)]. For further comparison, bidirectional promoters were under-represented in expression clusters of brain-specific genes, with an average ratio of 0.23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030072-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030072-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030072.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Co-Regulation of Bidirectional Promoters</title><p>(A) The number of bidirectional promoters is graphed for the breast and ovarian cancer genes (solid brown line) and their bidirectional partner genes (solid black line).

The probability of finding the same six genes in seven of the 16,078 clusters was statistically unlikely if their expression patterns were completely unrelated (less than 1/10,000; see Methods). Two of the shared genes, <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>ITGB3BP,</italic> have bidirectional promoters; they are known to function in ovarian or breast cancer, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b018">18</xref>].

We mapped 741 consensus motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b019">19</xref>] to find the most frequent occurrences in these bidirectional promoters. The most common motifs were Sp1, NFAT, EGR-1, PAX4 (or RXR), and the ETS factor family member, ELK1. Compared with the set of brain-specific genes, the ten cancer genes had a 10-fold larger representation of consensus ETS factor binding sites. These sites comprised ELK1-binding sites, plus overlapping recognition sequences for other ETS factor family members (PEA3 and GABP). Confirming the hypothesis of a regulatory connection between some of these genes, tandem conserved binding sites for ELK1 mapped to the same position in <italic>ERBB2</italic> and <italic>FANCD2</italic>, 50 bp upstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030072-g005">Figure 5</xref>). A single conserved site containing this same DNA sequence was found at nearly the same distance upstream of <italic>BRCA2</italic>. <italic>BRCA1</italic> also had tandem sequences for the core of ETS factor binding sites (GGAA) near this position (unpublished data). Additionally, ETS factor binding sites were present as a trio with SP1 and PAX4/RXR binding sites in eight of nine ovarian cancer gene promoters. The brain-specific genes had no proximal ETS factor binding sites and fewer occurrences of the trio of binding sites (22% versus 77% in the ovarian cancer genes).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030072-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030072.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Conserved ETS Factor Binding Sites</title><p>(A) Transcription factor-binding sites are shown for the bidirectional promoters of <italic>ERBB2, FANCD2,</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>.

Returning to the 16,078 co-expression clusters containing 500 genes each, three clusters with the highest ratio of bidirectional promoters showed a distinct enrichment of the consensus ELK1 motif compared with three co-expression clusters with the lowest proportion of bidirectional promoters (the comparison returned a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.001 in a Chi-square test). The ELK1 motif was present in an average of 26% of bidirectional promoters in the enriched dataset and only 6% of bidirectional promoters in the depleted set. Thus, ELK1 binding sites were not universally present in all bidirectional promoters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The spliced EST data significantly increases the number of bidirectional promoters that can be identified in the human genome and reveals uncharacterized 5′ UTRs associated with some protein-coding genes. These 5′ ends may have been previously overlooked due to a systematic under-representation of the 5′ ends of genes in the curated datasets. The identification of these 5′ termini of genes further enables a precise determination of the position of the associated promoter. Although the number of genes associated with a bidirectional promoter seems large, many genes produce transcripts by selecting from multiple promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b020">20</xref>]. Given the extreme diversity in the choice of 5′ ends for many transcripts, bidirectional promoters may support only a minority of transcripts from a single locus. Furthermore, the large number of bidirectional promoters reported here represents a portion of an unknown total number of transcription start sites in the genome.</p><p>Relationships among the ten ovarian cancer genes are supported by their co-expression profiles and shared transcription factor-binding sites. For instance, all ten genes and several co-expressed genes contain ETS-family binding sites in their promoters. The role of ETS proteins is central to cancer biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b021">21</xref>]. Although numerous ETS proteins can bind the same core motif, specialized regulatory instructions may be dictated through different family members. Thus, computational approaches cannot conclusively implicate any particular ETS protein family member. Nevertheless, the patterns of binding motifs are reminiscent of the collection of binding sites recognized by the TNF-alpha enhanceosome, where combinations of binding sites (ETS, NFAT, SP1, and c-Jun) recruit CBP/p300 and RNA Pol II. Occupancy at these binding sites varies in response to the environmental cue and through competition for overlapping binding motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b022">22</xref>].</p><p>A precise list of all genes involved in somatic mutations in cancer is difficult to define. Nevertheless, we were able to show enrichment of bidirectional promoters in cancer-related gene sets. The presence of shared binding sites provides a basis for explaining coordinated expression among these promoters. The evolutionary conservation of the binding sites argues that they are under selection to fulfill a specific functional role. The identical placement of these sites upstream of the promoters implies the mechanism of action is similar at all three promoters.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Potential for Mis-Regulation of Bidirectional Promoters</title><p>In addition to common expression patterns, bidirectional promoters have the propensity for mis-regulation. Five of the nine breast and ovarian cancer genes have evidence of aberrant methylation affecting their expression levels in somatic tumors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030072-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, methylation of the <italic>MLH1</italic> bidirectional promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b023">23</xref>] is almost exclusively responsible for cases of sporadic mismatch-repair deficiency in colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b024">24</xref>]. This gene is located at the center of our shared expression network. The development of sporadic cancer is consistent with the loss of important functions of genes regulated by bidirectional promoters (e.g., genome stability, transcription, cell cycle control, nucleotide binding, tumor suppression, or mitochondrial stress response). These functions extend beyond the role of DNA repair, and are consistent with a much broader category of functions involved in the response to DNA damage. Loss of any of these cellular activities could lead to a neoplastic phenotype. Additionally, these functions argue that mis-regulation of bidirectional promoters could extend beyond breast and ovarian malignancies.</p><p>Epigenetic modifications associated with sporadic breast and ovarian cancers—such as silencing of bidirectional promoters—suggest a parallel mechanism by which regulatory disturbances could affect similar sets of genes as do mutations. Methylation could impede the binding of a protein (such as an ETS factor family member), putatively affecting the expression of two genes regulated by the bidirectional promoter. It has been previously shown that methylation of a bidirectional promoter inhibits expression of both associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b025">25</xref>]. We propose that bidirectional promoters be explored comprehensively as targets of aberrant methylation. We have identified a number of genes implicated in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers that are regulated in this manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>EST mapping.</title><p>The strand information of spliced ESTs was obtained from the table “hg17.estOrientInfo” at the UCSC Human Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>), where the direction of transcription for each EST in the genome is determined based on consensus intronic splice junctions. Coordinates for both spliced ESTs, Known Genes, and GenBank mRNA were downloaded from the UCSC Human Genome Browser. Prior to obtaining the final dataset of bidirectional promoters, our curation process removed questionable EST pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030072-g001">Figure 1</xref>), resulting in 5,653 promoter regions identified in this analysis. Curation was based on the following steps. Initial classifications were made for the intergenic or intragenic location of the promoter region. Each promoter was subsequently placed into confidence levels on the basis of supporting ESTs. A binary decision tree was used for sorting. The tree forked into left and right branches, representing the intragenic or intergenic promoters, respectively. Parallel classification schemes were implemented along both branches of the tree to assign confidence levels to the predictions. For instance, ESTs were required to display majority agreement for the orientation of transcription in the region. Additional considerations were used to resolve overlapping <italic>cis</italic>-transcription units caused by densely packed overlapping genes or embedded transcripts. Overlapping but antisense transcription units required comparison with the protein coding gene annotations for further validation. The predictions were accepted only if there was an absence of conflict with the protein coding gene annotations. Successive rounds of annotation produced the final list of gene pairs. Seven hundred eight bidirectional promoters fell within introns of protein coding genes to identify alternative promoters that direct transcription of both a shorter form of a protein coding gene and a divergent gene that is antisense to it. These were examined on a case-by-case basis to ensure their legitimacy. Additional pairs of transcripts were identified in which one EST and one UCSC Known Gene are present on each side, accounting for ∼159 gene pairs. In total, the new analysis identified nearly four times as many bidirectional gene pairs as were previously published (5,653 versus 1,352).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Expression clustering.</title><p>GNF Gene Expression Atlas 2 data was downloaded from the UCSC Human Gene Sorter ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030072-b026">26</xref>]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>) in gene clusters of the most 500 similarly expressed genes with a reference gene. The relationships were calculated by UCSC as a weighted sum of differences in log expression ratios. The similarity of each gene's expression profile to all others was extracted from the table “hg17.gnfAtlas2Distance”. For each of the 16,078 genes listed, we obtained the nearest 500 genes, with a threshold score based on the weighted sum of differences of less than 1.0. The ratio of bidirectional promoters in each group of 500 was determined by comparison to our reference list of bidirectional promoters determined using the EST binary classification scheme described in the section <italic>EST mapping</italic> and the bidirectional genes identified in the UCSC Known genes and GenBank mRNA annotation tracks.
