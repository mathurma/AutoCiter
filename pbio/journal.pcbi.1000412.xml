                <p>The regulation of cleavage plane orientation is one of the key mechanisms driving
                    epithelial morphogenesis. Still, many aspects of the relationship between local
                    cleavage patterns and tissue-level properties remain poorly understood. Here we
                    develop a topological model that simulates the dynamics of a 2D proliferating
                    epithelium from generation to generation, enabling the exploration of a wide
                    variety of biologically plausible cleavage patterns. We investigate a spectrum
                    of models that incorporate the spatial impact of neighboring cells and the
                    temporal influence of parent cells on the choice of cleavage plane. Our findings
                    show that cleavage patterns generate “signature” equilibrium
                    distributions of polygonal cell shapes. These signatures enable the inference of
                    local cleavage parameters such as neighbor impact, maternal influence, and
                    division symmetry from global observations of the distribution of cell shape.
                    Applying these insights to the proliferating epithelia of five diverse
                    organisms, we find that strong division symmetry and moderate neighbor/maternal
                    influence are required to reproduce the predominance of hexagonal cells and low
                    variability in cell shape seen empirically. Furthermore, we present two distinct
                    cleavage pattern models, one stochastic and one deterministic, that can
                    reproduce the empirical distribution of cell shapes. Although the proliferating
                    epithelia of the five diverse organisms show a highly conserved cell shape
                    distribution, there are multiple plausible cleavage patterns that can generate
                    this distribution, and experimental evidence suggests that indeed plants and
                    fruitflies use distinct division mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Cell division is one of the key mechanisms driving organismal growth and
                    morphogenesis. Yet many aspects of the relationship between local cell division
                    (how a cell chooses an orientation to divide) and global tissue architecture
                    (e.g., regular versus irregular cells) remain poorly understood. We present a
                    computational framework for studying topological networks that are created by
                    cell division; this framework reveals how certain tissue statistics can be used
                    to infer properties of the cell division model. Recently it has been observed
                    that five diverse organisms show almost identical cell shape distributions in
                    their proliferating epithelial tissues, yet how this conservation arises is not
                    understood. Using our model we show that the low variation observed in nature
                    requires a strong correlation between how neighboring cells divide and that
                    although the statistics of plants and fruitflies are almost identical, it is
                    likely that they have evolved distinct cell division methods.</p>

            <p>The spatial and temporal regulation of cell shape and cell proliferation are key
                mechanisms that direct tissue morphogenesis during development. Much of our
                knowledge of tissue morphogenesis comes from the study of simple epithelial
                monolayers, 2D planar sheets of strongly adhering cells in which division occurs in
                the plane of the epithelium. The strong structural constraints and developmental
                importance of epithelia have inspired a multitude of theoretical and computational
                models since the early 20<sup>th</sup> century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Thompson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Zallen1">[6]</xref>. Of
                these, an important class is topological models, where an epithelium is represented
                as a planar network (topology).</p>
            <p>The topology of an epithelium is defined as the network of connectivity between cells
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Some
                important topological properties include a cell's polygonal shape, defined
                as its number of neighbors, and the overall distribution of cell shapes within an
                epithelium. There are several reasons for considering these properties. First,
                empirical evidence from our recent work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Gibson1">[5]</xref> shows that the
                distribution of cell shapes is conserved in the proliferating epithelia of several
                diverse organisms, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval wing disc and
                the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole tail epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000412.s003">Table S1</xref>).
                Second, polygonal cell shape is linearly correlated with cell surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), a longstanding
                empirical observation known as Lewis' Law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Lewis1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Lewis2">[3]</xref>. Third, important
                developmental processes such as cell division, migration, and intercalation
                fundamentally alter topology by creating and breaking connections between cells.</p>

            <p>For these reasons, topological models have been useful both experimentally and
                theoretically in understanding proliferating epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Dubertret1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Classen1">[8]</xref> and

                connection between cell proliferation and tissue topology, arguing that spatial
                control of cell divisions could affect the overall distribution of polygonal cell
                shapes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Lewis1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Lewis2">[3]</xref>. Since that time, the relationships between cell
                shape, proliferation and epithelial topology have been further investigated using
                both topological models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Dubertret1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Gibson1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Cowan1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Bohn1">[10]</xref> and mechanical models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Shraiman1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Thry1">[13]</xref>,
                exploring a wide variety of phenomena including differential rates of division,
                adhesion forces, and stochastic divisions. However, due to unknown parameters and
                simplifying approximations, the specific mechanisms by which global tissue
                morphology emerges from the local control of cell divisions in epithelial monolayers
                still remains poorly understood. To better understand proliferation within the
                larval wing disc of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we recently developed
                a stochastic topological model of cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Gibson1">[5]</xref>. Our model
                mathematically predicts the emergence of a specific equilibrium distribution of
                polygonal cell shapes (<italic>p*</italic>), revealing how local stochastic
                cellular processes can give rise to predictable global tissue properties.</p>
            <p>The predicted distribution <italic>p*</italic> was empirically confirmed in
                the larval imaginal wing disc of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, but also
                closely matched in the tadpole tail epidermis of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>,
                the outer epidermis of the cnidarian <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic>, and also
                Lewis's cucumber epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). A common characteristic across these diverse examples is
                that the epithelia-like tissue undergoes rapid proliferation with minimal cell
                rearrangement. The apparent conservation of <italic>p*</italic> across these
                systems is surprising. Is <italic>p*</italic> the consequence of a conserved
                process of cell division across these proliferating 2D epithelia? Or is it possible
                that distinct processes of cell division converge upon the same final distribution
                of shapes? More generally, how do widely varying division strategies impact global
                epithelial organization?</p>
            <p>Despite much experimental and theoretical progress, previous models have limitations
                that make it difficult to address these questions. The major difficulty lies in
                modeling the neighborhood and lineage dependence in cleavage plane choice. For
                example, our previous model encodes a mean-field approximation that ignores the
                variability in the number of neighbors gained via the division of neighboring cells
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Gibson1">[5]</xref>.
                The mathematical models of Cowan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Cowan1">[9]</xref> do not account for
                neighboring divisions at all: a cell never gains sides from its dividing neighbors.
                These models cannot be used to study modes of cell division with any spatial or
                temporal dependence, both of which are biologically relevant. For example, cleavage
                patterns with mother-daughter or neighbor-neighbor correlations in cleavage plane
                choice are common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Feldman1">[14]</xref>. To explore and characterize the space of
                plausible cleavage patterns, a more expressive model is required.</p>
            <p>Here we present a computational model of cell division that enables us to explore a
                much larger class of biologically plausible division models by directly simulating
                the topology of a proliferating epithelium from generation to generation. This
                includes division schemes with spatial and temporal dependence between neighboring
                cells and mother-daughter cells. Given a division model, we can compute the
                equilibrium distribution of polygonal cell shapes, along with other tissue-level
                topological properties. Our findings show that the fraction of hexagons and the
                variability in cell shape are both important global indicators of local division
                parameters, and we propose that it may be possible to infer these parameters from
                empirical data. Furthermore, we describe several division schemes that can reproduce
                with high accuracy the cell shape distribution seen in five diverse organisms. We
                use this modeling framework to formulate and explore some of the central theoretical
                and empirical questions regarding the local-to-global regulation of cell shape in
                proliferating epithelia.</p>

            <p>The topology of an epithelial cell sheet can be described mathematically as a planar
                network of trivalent vertices, edges, and faces. The vertices represent tricellular
                junctions, the edges represent cell sides, and the faces represent the cells
                themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This
                planar network captures the connectivity between cells, but ignores geometric
                properties such as area, perimeter or interior angles. In this paper, we are
                interested in a cell's topological shape, which is defined as its number of
                sides, or equivalently, its number of neighbors in the planar network. Cell division
                events within the network locally alter the topology of the planar graph by adding
                new vertices, edges, and faces; multiple rounds of proliferation can thus
                significantly alter global tissue topology. By representing cell proliferation as a
                computation on an epithelial network, one can simulate many different cell division
                strategies and study the emergence of global properties such as the distribution of
                topological cell shape.</p>
            <p>The core of the topological model is the <italic>cleavage plane regulation
                model</italic> (CPM), which describes how a cell determines which two of its sides
                will be bisected by the cleavage plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Based on experimental observations of the

                    <p>(A) A cell's cleavage plane model (CPM) specifies the stochastic
                        rule by which a cell chooses its cleavage plane for the next division. In
                        this example, the hexagonal mother cell has equal chance of dividing into
                        two pentagons or one hexagonal and one quadrilateral cell. The choice of
                        cleavage orientation can also affect the neighbor cells in more than one
                        way, for example it may be biased towards smaller neighboring cells. After
                        division, daughter cells lose sides on average, while two neighboring cells
                        gain sides (orange). (B,C) A CPM is specified by the choice of first edge
                        (B) and second edge (C). The possible cleavage planes are shown as dashed
                        white lines. Probabilities of choosing a cleavage plane are shown adjacent

                <p>This model describes a generic proliferating epithelium with no/minimal cell

                    absence of cell rearrangement, roughly uniform cell division rates, and cleavage

                    <title>Cleavage Plane Regulation Model (CPM)</title>
                    <p>The CPM is the core of the model and describes how mitotic cells select their
                        cleavage planes. The two main local parameters of a CPM that affect global
                        epithelial topology are: 1) The extent to which cleavage plane orientation
                        is directed by the local neighborhood surrounding the cell; and 2) The
                        symmetry with which a mitotic cell's neighbors are distributed to
                        the two daughter cells. Computationally, this is modeled as a two-stage
                        algorithm that first selects a cell side (Side1) based on local topology and
                        then selects a second side (Side2) based on topological symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). In the
                        final step, cell division occurs through creation of a new side connecting
                        Side1 and Side2.</p>
                    <p>The selection of Side1 models the influence of local neighborhood topology on
                        cleavage plane orientation. Biologically, the local topology surrounding the
                        cell could impact cleavage orientation if neighbors with fewer sides
                        influence physical properties such as tension in the mitotic cell cortex

                        plane could also be influenced by a historical correlation between the
                        mother and daughter cleavage plane orientations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Feldman1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Dumais1">[15]</xref>. To model these effects, we simulated four

                                most tension on the cell and the cleavage plane attempts to relieve

                                probable than asymmetric ones. The geometric equivalent of this

                        important question. We find that simulations of a completely random CPM

                            (O<sc>rthogonal</sc>|E<sc>qual</sc>S<sc>plit</sc>) both converged to
                        distinct equilibrium distributions independent of initial conditions; the
                        standard deviation in the percentage of hexagons was less than
                        0.5% for both CPMs over widely varying initial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000412.s004">Table

                        that the initial conditions become statistically insignificant as the number

                        between CPMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000412.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, CPMs are

                        the percentage of hexagons and quadrilaterals in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000412.s004">Table

                        from CPM to CPM and are strongly correlated with two key properties of the

                        <italic>symmetry</italic>. Each division event splits one mitotic cell into

                        the number of sides for two neighbors of the mitotic cell.
                            <italic>Charitability</italic> refers to the tendency of the Side1
                        choice to confer sides to smaller neighbors, potentially reducing cell shape

                    <p>Our simulation results reveal a strong correlation between the degree of

                        result, strongly asymmetric CPMs yielded an equilibrium distribution with a
                        mode of 4 or 5 sides, suggesting that symmetric divisions may be critical to
                        establishing the majority of hexagonal cells observed in most natural
                        epithelia.</p>

                        as explicitly increasing in charitability. For every Side2 algorithm tested,
                        increasingly charitable Side1 CPMs led to an increased percentage of
                        hexagons and a correspondingly lower variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000412-g003">Figure 3A, 3C, and 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000412.s004">Table

                        appears to be implicitly charitable; the CPM favors the recently divided
                        sister cell which tends to have fewer sides due to its recent division. The
                        simulations suggest that this CPM lies between R<sc>andom</sc><sub>1</sub>
                        and S<sc>mallest</sc>N<sc>eighbor</sc><sub>1</sub> in its ability to reduce
                        shape variance. The simulations also reveal some complexities overlooked by
                        our earlier Markov chain model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Gibson1">[5]</xref>, which assumes
                        binomial symmetry but approximates the effect of neighbor correlations using
                        a mean-field assumption. The simulations show that many cell shape
                        distributions are possible, given a binomial division symmetry model. In
                        order to produce a fraction of hexagons close to that observed in natural
                        epithelia (&gt;40%), the Side1 model must have high
                        charitability (e.g.,
                            S<sc>mallest</sc>N<sc>eighbor</sc><sub>1</sub>|B<sc>inomial</sc><sub>2</sub>).

                        can reproduce the cell shape distribution observed in natural epithelia;
                        this CPM has lower charitability but higher symmetry. This illustrates that
                        the interplay between autonomous symmetry and non-autonomous charitability

                <title>Comparison to Empirical Data</title>
                <p>The wide spectrum of shape distributions produced by different CPMs raises the
                    intriguing possibility of inferring the CPM based solely on empirical
                    observations of global epithelial topology. For example, a hypothesis for a cell

                        with low variability in cell size. To test this hypothesis, we measured the

                        example, spindles in some plant cells use microtubules to find the longest

                        orthogonal regulation does not occur in the fly. Specifically, it is known

                        subsequent divisions, with 57% of four-cell clones forming a

                        in the fruitfly, our simulations suggest trying a maximally charitable and

                        empirical shape distribution is achieved at

                        S2</xref>). However, it is unclear how the
                            S<sc>mallest</sc>N<sc>eighbor</sc><sub>1</sub> might translate into a
                        physical mechanism. One possibility is that for a given cell, the longest
                        edge is adjacent to the smallest neighbor and thus more likely to be cut by
                        a cleavage plane or exert the most tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Thry1">[13]</xref>. Alternatively,
                        favorable neighbor correlations might arise indirectly, as a result of
                        globally aligned divisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-BaenaLopez1">[19]</xref>.
                        Nevertheless, it is clear that some form of charitability is required. A
                        recent mechanical model of cell division in the wing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000412-Farhadifar1">[12]</xref> uses
                        data-derived parameters to replicate cell geometry but assumes that the
                        division orientation is unaffected by cell neighbors. Our topological model
                        predicts that such a system, with moderate symmetry but indifferent to local
                        neighborhood, is likely to have more 5-sided cells than 6-sided cells, as
                        observed in the mechanical model. Understanding how charitability arises
                        will require a more thorough investigation of the division parameters in the
                            <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, which are still poorly understood.</p>
                    <p>By comparing natural and simulated cell shape distributions, we can make
                        several inferences about proliferating epithelia. First, the observed low
                        variability in cell shape implies that division strategies are not only
                        highly symmetric, but also moderately charitable: they directly or
                        indirectly favor adding sides to smaller neighbors. Second, although the
                        proliferating epithelia of five diverse organisms show a highly conserved
                        shape distribution, there are multiple plausible CPMs that can generate this
                        distribution, and experimental evidence suggests that indeed plants and
                        fruitflies do have distinct division mechanisms. This raises the possibility
                        that different organisms may have evolved distinct mechanisms to suppress
                        shape variability during proliferation. Alternatively, the low shape
                        variability may be an indirect outcome of other factors that favor symmetric
                        and charitable divisions. Looking forward, as proliferation is better
                        understood in other organisms, our topological framework can provide a
                        background for hypothesis generation and testing as well as a basis for
                        studying pattern formation in the presence of proliferation.</p>

                        simulations show less than 1% deviation in cell shape
                        percentages, indicating that each division rule (CPM) generates a robust
                        signature distribution with little variability. Large standard deviations
                        (exceeding 1.0%) are shown in blue. Rules with maximally
                        uncharitable division strategies (<sc>LARGESTNEIGHBOR<sub>1</sub></sc>
                            Side<sub>1</sub> strategy) appear more likely to exhibit high
                        variability in equilibrium shape frequency. The large variance appears to be
                        a result of conflicting effects that increase and decrease shape variance
                        (e.g. <sc>LARGESTNEIGHBOR|EQUALSPLIT</sc>) causing the overall topology to
                        be unstable. In contrast <sc>LARGESTNEIGHBOR|UNEQUALSPLIT</sc> quickly
                        converges to a stable situation with 99.9% quadrilaterals and one
                        extremely large cell.</p>
