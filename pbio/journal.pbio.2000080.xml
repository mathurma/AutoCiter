<abstract>
<p>Signaling of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) via its soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) is responsible for the proinflammatory properties of IL-6 and constitutes an attractive therapeutic target, but how the sIL-6R is generated in vivo remains largely unclear. Here, we use liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry to identify an sIL-6R form in human serum that originates from proteolytic cleavage, map its cleavage site between Pro-355 and Val-356, and determine the occupancy of all O- and N-glycosylation sites of the human sIL-6R. The metalloprotease a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) uses this cleavage site in vitro, and mutation of Val-356 is sufficient to completely abrogate IL-6R proteolysis. N- and O-glycosylation were dispensable for signaling of the IL-6R, but proteolysis was orchestrated by an N- and O-glycosylated sequon near the cleavage site and an N-glycan exosite in domain D1. Proteolysis of an IL-6R completely devoid of glycans is significantly impaired. Thus, glycosylation is an important regulator for sIL-6R generation.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine secreted by our body upon infection or trauma to stimulate the immune system response. IL-6 is partially responsible for fever and triggers inflammation in many diseases. It activates its target cells via the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and soluble forms of this receptor (sIL-6R) are present in high amounts in the serum of healthy individuals and mediate the inflammatory response in all cells of the human body. However, it remains unclear how the soluble form of this cytokine is generated in humans. In this study, we isolate sIL-6R from human serum and show that the majority is produced via cleavage of the membrane-bound IL-6R by a protease. We identify the exact cleavage site and find that it is identical to a cleavage site used by the metalloprotease ADAM17. We further show that glycosylation, a post-transcriptional modification, is dispensable for the transport and biological function of IL-6R and map the occupancy of all O- and N-glycosylation sites. However, we find that only a single N-glycan is critically involved in the regulation of proteolysis by ADAM17 and conclude that glycosylation is an important regulator for sIL-6R generation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with important functions in many physiological and pathophysiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref002">2</xref>]. IL-6 activates intracellular signaling cascades through a homodimer of the ubiquitously expressed β-receptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref003">3</xref>] but first has to bind to its nonsignaling alpha receptor (IL-6R). The IL-6R is expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific manner and only found on hepatocytes and some leukocytes like neutrophils and T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref005">5</xref>]. Signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R is mostly regenerative and anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The IL-6R is a typical type-I transmembrane protein that consists of an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain (“D1”), the cytokine-binding module (CBM) residing in two fibronectin-type-III domains (“D2” and “D3”), and a 55 amino-acid residue-long flexible stalk region that is followed by a transmembrane and an intracellular region. A minimal length of 22 amino acids of the stalk region is required for efficient IL-6 classic signaling, which corresponds to a stalk length of approximately 83 Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>N-linked glycosylation is an important post-translational modification that can ensure correct folding and stability of a protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref008">8</xref>]. It has been shown that N-linked glycosylation of gp130 is essential for its stability but dispensable for the signaling function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref009">9</xref>]. However, other signaling receptors require glycans for the ability to bind their respective ligands, e.g., the receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref010">10</xref>], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref011">11</xref>], or C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref012">12</xref>]. Although some asparagine residues within the extracellular part of the IL-6R have been identified that are used for N-linked glycosylation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref014">14</xref>], no functional role for these modifications has been determined. Addition of carbohydrates to serine or threonine residues, called O-linked glycosylation, has not been described so far for the IL-6R.</p>
<p>Soluble forms of the IL-6R (sIL-6R) are found in human serum at concentrations of about 30–70 ng/ml. IL-6 binds to membrane-bound and sIL-6R with similar affinity, and signaling of IL-6/sIL-6R has been termed IL-6 trans-signaling and is causative for the proinflammatory properties of IL-6. Specific inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling holds the promise to be as effective as total IL-6 blockade, but with reduced side effects like enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref015">15</xref>]. One mechanism that contributes to sIL-6R generation is alternative splicing of the <italic>IL6R</italic> mRNA, which results in a unique C-terminus of ten amino-acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref016">16</xref>], and only this form of the sIL-6R has been detected in human serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref017">17</xref>]. However, only 1%–20% of the total sIL-6R is generated by alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref021">21</xref>], and the generation mechanism of the majority remains unknown. Recently, we described expression of the IL-6R on circulating microvesicles, but this also accounted only for a minor proportion of the total sIL-6R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref022">22</xref>]. In vitro, sIL-6R can be efficiently generated by limited proteolysis, predominantly by the metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17.</p>
<p>ADAM17-mediated shedding can be induced by a variety of stimuli, and the phorbol ester phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) is the strongest known activator in vitro. Carboxypeptidase treatment of sIL-6R, which was purified from the supernatant of PMA-treated IL-6R overexpressing COS-7 cells, led to the identification of the ADAM17 cleavage site within the IL-6R between Gln-357 and Asp-358 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref014">14</xref>]. However, cleavage site profiling revealed that glutamine and aspartic acid are rather disfavored at the P1 and P1′ positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref023">23</xref>], and the IL-6R is the only ADAM17 substrate with such a cleavage site that is listed in the MEROPS database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref024">24</xref>]. Indeed, cleavage of an IL-6R peptide with recombinant ADAM17 occurred between Pro-355 and Val-356 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref025">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, deletion of amino-acid residues Ser-353 to Val-362 within the IL-6R stalk prevented ADAM17-mediated shedding and did not compromise its biological activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref014">14</xref>]. Proteolysis by ADAM10, the closest homologue of ADAM17, still occurred, which suggested the usage of multiple cleavage sites by ADAM10 or different cleavage sites by the two proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref007">7</xref>]. Besides the cleavage site, which is considered to be the major determinant of substrate/protease specificity, exosites are also known to contribute to the regulation of IL-6R proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we identify by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) an sIL-6R form in human serum that is generated via limited proteolysis, map its cleavage site, and characterize the occupancy of all O- and N-glycosylation sites. We confirm that the same cleavage site is used by ADAM10 and ADAM17 in vitro and show that mutation of Val-356 at P1′ is sufficient to completely block proteolysis. We further show that glycosylation is dispensable for IL-6R trafficking and signaling but regulates proteolysis through an N-glycan exosite in domain D1 and a sequon that is both N- and O-glycosylated adjacent to the cleavage site.</p>

<title>The Majority of sIL-6R in Human Serum Is Not Generated by Alternative mRNA Splicing</title>
<p>Although the existence of sIL-6R in human body fluids has been known for more than 25 y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref030">30</xref>], the mechanisms of its generation are largely unexplored. Müller-Newen et al. were able to purify an sIL-6R from human plasma that was generated by alternative splicing of the <italic>IL6R</italic> mRNA (termed ds-sIL-6R hereafter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref017">17</xref>]. However, several studies using ELISA revealed that only 1%–20% of the total sIL-6R is generated by splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref021">21</xref>], which suggests that other mechanisms must exist in parallel. We sought to confirm these findings and generated a polyclonal antibody (termed ds6R) against the ten unique C-terminal amino-acid residues of the ds-sIL-6R, which are not present in the full-length IL-6R or a proteolytically cleaved sIL-6R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In order to be able to quantify total sIL-6R and to distinguish only ds-sIL-6R in human serum, we first expressed and purified both sIL-6R and ds-sIL-6R as recombinant proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>, both sIL-6R forms were biologically active and equally well able to perform IL-6 trans-signaling, because they stimulated proliferation of Ba/F3-gp130 cells in a dose-dependent manner when combined with IL-6. A sandwich ELISA with a capture antibody that binds to the sIL-6R N-terminus (4–11) and a polyclonal detection antibody (Baf227, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref031">31</xref>]) measured recombinant sIL-6R and ds-sIL-6R with equal efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) and allowed us to measure total sIL-6R levels in the serum of eight healthy donors, which were in a similar range as described before (46.0 ± 6.4 ng/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref021">21</xref>]). Using the ds-sIL-6R-specific antibody ds6R, we set up an ELISA that only detects ds-sIL-6R and not other sIL-6R forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref016">16</xref>]). When we analyzed the same eight serum samples for ds-sIL-6R, we detected only 7.0 ± 2.0 ng/ml, which accounts for 15.1% ± 2.8% of the total sIL-6R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Thus, our results confirm previous studies that found that a fraction of the sIL-6R in humans is generated via alternative splicing but that the majority must originate from a different mechanism.</p>

<title>Mass Spectrometry Identifies a sIL-6R Form with a Protease-Derived C-Terminus and a Novel O-Glycosylation Site</title>
<p>In order to identify other human sIL-6R forms that exist in vivo, we performed an isotopic labeling strategy that is based on proteolysis in the presence of H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref032">32</xref>]. We isolated human serum, depleted the endogenous antibodies, and precipitated all sIL-6R forms by the sepharose-coupled 4–11 antibody, which binds to the N-terminal D1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We separated the precipitated proteins via SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, confirmed sIL-6R presence in the precipitate via western blot, and excised the corresponding region of the coomassie-stained gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Using an anti-IL-6R antibody, we detected several proteins of different molecular weights, which most likely are different sIL-6R isoforms and complexes of these with other serum proteins that are not dissociated under nonreducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Prior to in-gel proteolysis, the proteins were deglycosylated using peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). This endoglycosidase hydrolyzes the bond formed between the carbohydrate and the Asn side chain, resulting in the formation of an Asp residue at the former glycosylation site. Subsequently, protein digestion was performed in 50% H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O-containing buffers. By using this method, all proteolytically generated <italic>neo</italic>-C-termini contain an <sup>18</sup>O-isotope incorporated in the carboxyl group, while the original (canonical or truncated) protein C-terminus remains unmodified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>We identified a peptide that maps to the unique C-terminus of the ds-sIL-6R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), which further corroborates that ds-sIL-6R contributes to the total amount of sIL-6R in human serum. Furthermore, we identified another C-terminal peptide, which ends with Pro-355 and thus could belong to an sIL-6R that is generated through proteolysis of the membrane-bound IL-6R between Pro-355 and Val-356 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Both ds-sIL-6R and sIL-6R had an N-linked glycosylation at Asn-350, which was converted to Asp-350 during the N-deglycosylation with PNGase F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>, colored in green). Furthermore, using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) MS/MS, we identified an O-glycosylation site within the Asn-350 sequon on Thr-352, which was decorated with several different glycan structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000080.s001">S1A–S1E Fig</xref>).

<title>ADAM17 and ADAM10 Cleave the IL-6R between Pro-355 and Val-356 In Vitro</title>
<p>Having shown that a protease-derived sIL-6R exists in vivo, we sought to identify the protease that could be responsible for its generation. The IL-6R is a known substrate for three human proteases, the two metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref033">33</xref>], and the neutrophil-derived serine protease cathepsin G (CG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref035">35</xref>]. So far, the only protease of the IL-6R whose cleavage site has been mapped is ADAM17, which has been reported to cleave between Gln-357/Asp-358, two amino-acid residues downstream of Pro-355/Val-356 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref014">14</xref>]. In order to recapitulate this finding, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with a cDNA encoding human IL-6R and induced ADAM17-mediated shedding with PMA, a strong and well-known activator of ADAM17. We precipitated sIL-6R from the cell culture supernatant and performed SDS-PAGE and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The strongest band detected in the western blot corresponded to a cleavage product of the IL-6R, whereas the lower band at around 55 kDa most likely was the heavy chain of the antibody used for precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Indeed, MS analysis revealed a C-terminal peptide that ended with Pro-355 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), indicating exactly the same cleavage site that was used in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). We could further confirm the N-glycan site on Asn-350 and the O-glycan site at Thr-352 within the same sequon, which was again decorated with the same pattern of glycan structures found in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000080.s002">S2A–S2E Fig</xref>). Thus, we could not verify the originally published cleavage site Gln-357/Asp-358 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref014">14</xref>] but instead found an ADAM17 cleavage site between Pro-355/Val-356 that matches the published cleavage preferences of ADAM17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref023">23</xref>] and is in good agreement with other cleavage sites of ADAM17 substrates in the MEROPS database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref024">24</xref>].</p>

<p>To identify the cleavage site for ADAM10, we performed a similar experiment and stimulated transiently transfected HEK293 cells with ionomycin, a calcium ionophore that induces IL-6R cleavage by ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref036">36</xref>]. Similar to ADAM17-mediated shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), we detected cleaved IL-6R and a band of lower molecular weight, which most likely corresponded to the heavy chain of the antibody used for precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Surprisingly, we identified the same cleavage site between Pro-355 and Val-356 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) and the same pattern of O-glycans at Thr-352 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000080.s003">S3A–S3D Fig</xref>), indicating that both proteases share the same cleavage site.</p>

In general, we exchanged Pro-355 and Val-356 into amino-acid residues that have been shown to be disfavored by ADAM17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref023">23</xref>]. When we mutated the cleavage site to Ile-355/Glu-356 (termed IL-6R_IE hereafter; all other mutants are termed accordingly), we could not detect inducible formation of sIL-6R by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) or ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) after stimulation with PMA. The same was true for the IL-6R_DG mutant. When we calculated the increase in sIL-6R generation, the wild-type IL-6R was shed 3.6 ± 1.9-fold compared to vehicle-treated cells, whereas both mutants showed no increase in sIL-6R formation (1.3 ± 0.2-fold and 1.4 ± 0.2-fold, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).

In order to determine if mutation of either P1 or P1′ alone would be sufficient to block ADAM-mediated proteolysis, we created the corresponding four single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Whereas IL-6R_DV and IL-6R_IV were still shed after PMA treatment, albeit to a minor extent compared to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>), mutation of the P1′ site (IL6R_PE and IL-6R_PG) completely abrogated proteolysis by ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>), and we could not detect any increase in sIL-6R formation (0.9 ± 0.1-fold and 1.0 ± 0.1-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). Similar results were again obtained for ADAM10-mediated cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000080.s004">S4D–S4F Fig</xref>).

<p>The coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Asp358Ala within the IL-6R is located in close proximity to the cleavage site, and homozygous carriers of this SNP have increased sIL-6R serum levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref038">38</xref>]. We have shown previously that the Asp358Ala (termed IL-6R_PVQA in this study) mutation renders the IL-6R more susceptible to ADAM-mediated cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref021">21</xref>]. In order to investigate whether mutation of the cleavage site would be sufficient to block this increased proteolysis, we created three additional IL-6R mutants that contained Asp358Ala combined with single or double mutations of the cleavage site (termed IL-6R_DGQA, IL-6R_DVQA, and IL-6R_PGQA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). First, we verified our previous finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref021">21</xref>] that IL-6R_PVQA was indeed shed more than the wild-type IL-6R_PVQD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Mutation of both P1 and P1′ in IL-6R_DGQA completely abrogated PMA-inducible shedding, and mutation of P1′ alone, but not P1 alone, was sufficient to render the Asp358Ala mutant unresponsive towards proteolysis by ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Proteolysis by ADAM10 was also significantly reduced, although some inducible shedding by ionomycin could still be detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000080.s004">S4G Fig</xref>). Thus, mutation of Val-356 is also sufficient to prevent the enhanced shedding of the Asp358Ala mutant.</p>
<p>Finally, we analyzed whether these mutations influenced the biological activity of the IL-6R. To this end, we stably transduced Ba/F3-gp130 cells with wild-type IL-6R and IL-6R mutants. After transduction, Ba/F3-gp130-hIL-6R cells proliferated in a dose-dependent manner (0–100 ng/ml) in response to IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4K</xref>). As an internal control, we incubated all cell lines with Hyper-IL-6, which is a fusion protein of IL-6 and the sIL-6R and thus activates proliferation via gp130 homodimerization independent of membrane-bound IL-6R. Ba/F3-gp130-IL-6R_IE, Ba/F3-gp130-IL-6R_PE, and Ba/F3-gp130-IL-6R_DG proliferated equally well compared to the wild-type cells, indicating that mutation of the cleavage site did not affect the biological function of the IL-6R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g004">Fig 4L and 4M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000080.s004">S4H Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Determination of Four Additional N-Glycosylation Sites on the sIL-6R In Vitro and In Vivo via MS</title>

We first confirmed the presence of glycans on the full-length IL-6R and the sIL-6R by either removing just the N-linked glycans with PNGase F or by additionally also removing O-linked glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). While determining the cleavage site, we had already successfully detected an N-glycosylation site at Asn-350 and an O-glycosylation site at Thr-352, both in vitro and in vivo (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g003">3B</xref>).

As we could not detect any other O-glycosylation site in addition to Thr-352, the IL-6R contains two N-glycans located in domain D1, two N-glycans in domain D3, and a combined N-/O-glycan site within the stalk region adjacent to the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g005">Fig 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>N- and O-Linked Glycosylation Are Dispensable for Transport, Signaling, and Cell-Surface Turnover of the IL-6R</title>
<p>In order to analyze a functional role for the determined glycans, we created IL-6R mutants that lacked either one, multiple, or all N-glycosylation sites and stably transduced Ba/F3-gp130 cells with these.

<p>Finally, we analyzed protein stability and turnover at the cell surface of the wild-type IL-6R compared to the 4N mutant. For this purpose, we used a pulse-chase approach and labeled the IL-6R on the cells in the cold, shifted the cells back to 37°C for different time periods, and analyzed the remaining IL-6R on the cell surface via flow cytometry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g006">Fig 6H</xref>, the wild-type IL-6R disappeared from the cell surface in a time-dependent manner (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 44.1 ± 8.1 min), which did not differ significantly from the 4N mutant (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 40.9 ± 5.2 min). Collectively, our data show that glycosylation of the IL-6R is not needed for transport to and expression at the cell surface, is dispensable for IL-6-mediated signal transduction, and does not alter the half-life of the IL-6R at the cell surface.</p>

<title>The N-/O-Glycosylated Sequon Adjacent to the Cleavage Site Is of Minor Importance for IL-6R Cleavage</title>
<p>Having excluded that glycosylation is important for the signaling capacity of the IL-6R, we sought to analyze a possible role for the glycans in terms of IL-6R proteolysis. We first concentrated on the N-/O-glycan pair on Asn-350/Thr-352 adjacent to the ADAM10/17 cleavage site and employed an in vitro cleavage assay. Previous attempts to cleave an IL-6R peptide with recombinant ADAM17 gave mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref039">39</xref>]. We synthesized ten different glycopeptides containing either the wild-type sequence (QD) or the Asp358Ala mutation (QA) and incubated them with recombinant ADAM17.</p>
<p>Whereas the unglycosylated peptide 1(QD) was little but still significantly cleaved (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), the corresponding peptide 2(QA) was cleaved completely (1.0% ± 1.0% remaining, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Addition of an N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) on the residue corresponding to Asn-350 reduced proteolysis of peptide 3(QD) (91.4% ± 9.4% intact) but did not alter processing of peptide 4(QA) (0.4% ± 0.7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, addition of a larger biantennary N-glycan blocked cleavage of the 5(QD) peptide but did not alter processing of the 6(QA) peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Also of interest, addition of an N-Acetylgalactosamin (GalNAc) to the amino-acid residue corresponding to Thr-352 decreased cleavage of the <bold>7</bold>(QD) peptide (91% ± 8%) but also decreased shedding of the 8(QA) peptide compared to the unglycosylated peptide (10.8% ± 5.4% intact, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Importantly, we have detected GalNAc endogenously on the sIL-6R at Thr-352, but not GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000080.s001">S1A–S1D Fig</xref>). When we combined the biantennary N-glycan with the GalNAc, cleavage of 9(QD) was again blocked, but 14.7% ± 6.3% of the 10(QA) peptide was intact, suggesting an additive effect of the two glycans (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). Thus, in line with a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref025">25</xref>], we can detect an inhibitory influence of the glycosylation on the capacity of ADAM17 to cleave the IL-6R peptide, but overall, the influence appears to be rather small.</p>

<title>An N-Glycan in Domain D1 Serves as a Protease-Regulatory Exosite</title>
<p>In order to analyze the role of the other N-glycosylation sites, we used the stably transduced Ba/F3-gp130 cell lines and activated ADAM17-mediated shedding with PMA. We set the amount of sIL-6R shed from wild-type cells to 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) and calculated all other values accordingly. Surprisingly, mutation of Asn-55 enhanced PMA-induced shedding to 348% ± 116%, indicating that this N-glycan serves as a protease-regulatory exosite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

In order to prove that indeed the glycan and not the asparagine residue is responsible for this effect, we mutated Thr-57, which also leads to the loss of the glycan at Asn-55, and observed a comparable increase in IL-6R shedding (291% ± 64% and 126% ± 9%, both <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g008">Fig 8C</xref>).

We observed slightly enhanced shedding when we mutated Asn-245 (215% ± 82%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). Combined mutation of Asn-93 and Asn-245 (2N) did not enhance proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g008">Fig 8G</xref>), but the 3N and 4N variants, in which Asn-55 was mutated, showed increased IL-6R shedding by ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g008">Fig 8H and 8I</xref>).

PMA strongly induced shedding of wild-type IL-6R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g009">Fig 9B and 9C</xref>), but we could not detect proteolysis of the 5N mutant in HEK293 cells either by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g009">Fig 9D</xref>) or by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g009">Fig 9E</xref>), although the IL-6R-5N was transported to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000080.g009">Fig 9F</xref>). We have previously shown that the membrane-proximal domain (MPD17) and especially the conserved ADAM seventeen dynamic interaction sequence (CANDIS) region of ADAM17 are important for substrate recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref040">40</xref>], and we thus wondered whether the IL-6R-5N variant is still able to bind to ADAM17.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Soluble cytokine receptors play pivotal roles in health and disease. As long as the ligand-binding domains are retained within the soluble protein, they have similar affinities towards their ligands as the membrane-tethered counterparts. Most of them have antagonistic properties, because they compete with the membrane-bound receptors for the same cytokine, and cytokines bound to soluble receptors are no longer able to bind to their cognate target cells in order to activate them. The most prominent examples are the soluble receptors for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref041">41</xref>]. An Fc-fusion protein of the extracellular part of tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 2 (TNFR2)/p75 is approved under the name etanercept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>A rare example of an agonistic soluble receptor is the sIL-6R. Surprisingly, despite its importance in terms of disease and therapy, little is known about the mechanisms that lead to sIL-6R <italic>generation in vivo</italic>. In the present study, we confirm the presence of the ds-sIL-6R in human serum and detect for the first time a second form of the sIL-6R with a novel C-terminus generated by proteolytic cleavage. Interestingly, the cleavage event occurs between Pro-355 and Val-356 within the stalk region of the IL-6R. This cleavage site does not match the one previously described by Müllberg et al., who reported cleavage two amino-acid residues further downstream between Gln-357 and Asp-358 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref014">14</xref>]. However, cleavage site profiling of ADAM17 as well as data in the MEROPS database confirms a strong preference for a valine at the P1′ site and disfavors an aspartic acid at that position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref024">24</xref>], making the reported cleavage by Müllberg et al. between a glutamine and an aspartic acid in retrospect rather unlikely. Moreover, we also consistently found ADAM-mediated cleavage at Pro-355/Val-356 when we treated HEK293 cells overexpressing the IL-6R with PMA or when we incubated a peptide of the IL-6R stalk with the recombinant catalytic domain of ADAM17. We cannot absolutely exclude that exoprotease activity led to trimming of the C-terminal peptide in vivo or during sample preparation, which might confound the identification of the cleavage site via LC-MS. The different technique to determine the cleavage site used in Müllberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref014">14</xref>] might also account for the difference. However, our mutational analysis of the novel cleavage site, which suggests that substitution of Val-356 by glycine or glutamic acid is sufficient to render the IL-6R resistant towards ADAM-mediated proteolysis, further corroborates this finding.</p>
<p>The major genetic determinant of human sIL-6R serum levels is a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2228145), which leads to the exchange of Asp-358 to an alanine residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref038">38</xref>]. Homozygous carriers have strongly increased sIL-6R serum levels, which reduces their risk of suffering from coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref044">44</xref>]. Although differential splicing of the <italic>IL6R</italic> mRNA is increased in these individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref045">45</xref>], the majority of the sIL-6R is nevertheless generated by an alternative mechanism. We have shown previously that an IL-6R containing the Asp358Ala mutation is more efficiently shed by ADAM10 and ADAM17, which we thought was caused by the exchange of an aspartic acid to an alanine residue at the P1′ position of the cleavage site, which makes the IL-6R a better substrate for both metalloproteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref023">23</xref>]. Because we have now determined the cleavage site between Pro-355 and Val-356, this explanation for the observed effects of the Asp358Ala mutation has to be revised. However, the cleavage site profiling by Tucher et al. clearly shows a preference for an alanine over an aspartic acid residue also at the P3′ position, which explains the observed increase in proteolysis of the Asp358Ala mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>We have further used the LC-MS approach to determine all N- and O-glycans of the sIL-6R and investigated their functional role(s) in terms of signaling and proteolysis. Surprisingly, mutation of all glycan sites did not significantly alter the signaling capacity of the IL-6R, as shown by the IL-6-dependent proliferation of stably transduced Ba/F3-gp130 cells. This is in contrast to other cytokine receptors like epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref011">11</xref>], in which N-linked glycosylation is essential for ligand binding. A mutant devoid of all glycans of the IL-6 β-receptor gp130 was still able to signal, but the transport and the stability of the protein were severely compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref009">9</xref>]. However, the transport of the unglycosylated IL-6R mutant to the cell surface was only marginally affected, and the protein turnover compared to the wild-type IL-6R was not altered at all. Further experiments will show whether this is also true for the other two α-receptors of the IL-6 family, namely the IL-11R and the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>N- and O-linked glycosylation are common post-translational modifications that have been described for a variety of ADAM substrates besides the IL-6R, e.g., for TNFα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref046">46</xref>] or transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref047">47</xref>]. Substrates with and without glycans have also been used to generate novel ADAM17-specific inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref048">48</xref>]. Recently, it was shown that O-glycosylation near the cleavage site affects ADAM17-mediated proteolysis of small peptides of several ADAM substrates, among them the IL-6R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref025">25</xref>]. Here, we show that the IL-6R is indeed O-glycosylated on Thr-352 in vivo and confirm that this glycan reduces cleavage of an IL-6R peptide in conjunction with an N-linked glycan on Asn-350. Cell-based assays, however, revealed a rather small impact of the N-/O-glycosylated sequon adjacent to the cleavage site on ADAM17-mediated proteolysis. In contrast, an N-linked glycan on Asn-55, located in the D1 domain of the IL-6R far away from the cleavage site, was surprisingly identified as a protease-regulatory exosite, whose deletion caused increased shedding of the IL-6R. Importantly, this glycan on Asn-55 has no role in IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 binds to the CBM of the IL-6R located in domains D2 and D3, and the D1 domain is not in contact with IL-6 or gp130. Consequently, Hyper-IL-6 does not contain this domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref049">49</xref>], and a membrane-bound IL-6R variant lacking D1 is biologically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref050">50</xref>]. Furthermore, the solved crystal structure of the hexameric IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex contains an IL-6R that only consists of the domains D2 and D3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref051">51</xref>]. Thus, our data suggest that the glycan on Asn-55 has a unique role in the regulation of proteolysis but is dispensable for signaling of IL-6.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an IL-6R mutant without any N-glycans reached the cell surface and was able to mediate IL-6-dependent signaling, but its shedding was severely impaired. It is currently unclear why this IL-6R variant, which contains the cleavage site and is able to coprecipitate with the protease via CANDIS, is nevertheless largely resistant towards proteolysis. A possible explanation is cooperativity between the individual glycosylation site, and simultaneous loss of all five N-glycans results in structural changes within the IL-6R ectodomain that disturb cleavage by the protease but do not perturb IL-6-dependent signaling.</p>
<p>In summary, we identify a soluble form of the IL-6R in human serum that is generated by a protease in vivo and map the cleavage site by mass spectrometry. We mutate this cleavage site to generate IL-6R variants that are resistant towards ADAM-mediated cleavage. Furthermore, we map the occupancy of all N- and O-glycosylation sites of the sIL-6R and find that glycosylation is dispensable for trafficking, stabilization, and signaling of the IL-6R but is an important regulatory mechanism in terms of proteolysis.</p>

<title>In-Gel Digestion</title>
<p>After excision of gel bands and slicing them into small cubes (~1 mm<sup>3</sup>), the gel pieces were washed with water and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and destained (3–4 incubations with 30% acetonitrile [ACN]/50 mM ABC), followed by dehydration (ACN) and drying (10 min at 45°C in a SpeedVac vacuum centrifuge [Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany]). Disulfide bond reduction was performed with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 56°C, followed by alkylation of reduced cysteines with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 1 h at 25°C in the dark. Finally, gel bands were washed once more with H<sub>2</sub>O and twice with 50 mM ABC followed by dehydration with 100% ACN. Two strategies were applied (i) to identify the C-terminus of sIL-6R and (ii) to map the N-glycosylation sites. For the identification of the C-terminus of sIL-6R, N-glycans were deglycosylated with 50–100 U PNGase F overnight at 37°C in 50 mM ABC. Afterwards, the gel bands were washed once with 50 mM ABC and three times with H<sub>2</sub>O. After dehydration of the gel bands, proteins were in-gel digested overnight with 50–100 ng of the endoproteases chymotrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), trypsin, or Asp-N (both from Promega, Madison, WI) in 25 mM ABC containing 50% H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O (from Eurisotop, St-Aubin Cedex, France). For the assignment of N-glycosylation sites, the same protocol was performed, but H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O was only used during the deglycosylation step, while the proteolysis with chymotrypsin, trypsin, or Asp-N was performed in 25 mM ABC. Samples were acidified with 10% formic acid (FA) to pH 3–4. Peptide extraction was performed in three cycles with (i) 1% FA, (ii) 60% ACN/1% FA, and (iii) 100% ACN by incubating for 15 min at 25°C, with sonication for 2 min in ice-cold water. Between each step, the liquid supernatants were separated from the gel bands and collected in a second reaction tube. Merged supernatants were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and the samples were reconstituted in 3% ACN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).</p>

<title>Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)</title>
<p>In-gel digested in vitro samples were analyzed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-HPLC coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos with ETD (Thermo Scientific, Bremen) using an analytical setup described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref060">60</xref>]. After injection, samples were washed on a trap column (Acclaim Pepmap 100 C18, 10 mm × 300 μm, 3 μm, 100 Å, Dionex) for 5 min with 3% ACN/0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 30 μl/min prior to peptide separation using an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 analytical column (15 cm × 75 μm, 3 μm, 100 Å, Dionex). A flow rate of 300 nL/min using eluent A (0.05% FA) and eluent B (80% ACN/0.04% FA) was used for gradient separation as follows: linear gradient 5%–50% B in 120 min, 50%–95% B in 5 min, 95% B for 10 min, 95%–5% B in 0.1 min, and equilibration at 5% B for 10 min. Spray voltage applied on a metal-coated PicoTip emitter (30 μm tip size, New Objective, Woburn, Massachusetts, US) was 1.25 kV, with a source temperature of 250°C. Full scan MS spectra were acquired from 5 to 145 min between 300 and 2,000 m/z at a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400 (automatic gain control [AGC] target of 1e6; maximum ion injection time [IIT] of 500 ms). The five most intense precursors with charge states ≥2+ were used (i) for collision-induced dissociation (CID) with fragment ion detection in the ion trap (parameters: normalized collision energy [NCE] of 35%; isolation width of 2 m/z; resolution, AGC target of 1e4 and maximum IIT of 100 ms) and (ii) for higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with fragment detection in the orbitrap with an NCE of 40% (parameters: isolation width of 3 m/z; resolution, 7,500 at m/z 400; AGC target of 1e5 and maximum IIT of 1,000 ms).

<p>The serum samples were analyzed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-UHPLC coupled to a QExactive Plus (both from Thermo Scientific, Bremen). Injected samples were loaded and washed as described above. Peptide separation was performed using an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 analytical column (50 cm × 75 μm, 2 μm, 100 Å, Dionex) with a flow rate and eluent composition as described above: linear gradient 5%–50% B in 120 min, 50%–90% B in 5 min, 90% B for 10 min, 90%–5% B in 0.1 min, and equilibrating at 5% B for 10 min. Ionization was performed with 2.4 kV spray voltage applied on a noncoated PicoTip emitter (10 μm tip size, New Objective, Woburn, Massachusetts, US) with the source temperature set to 250°C. MS data were acquired from 5 to 115 min with MS full scans between 300 and 2,000 m/z at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200 (AGC value of 3e6 and maximum IIT of 100 ms). The ten most intense precursors with charge states ≥2+ were subjected to fragmentation with HCD with NCE of 28% (isolation width of 3 m/z; resolution, 17,500 at m/z 200; AGC target of 1e5 and maximum IIT of 100 ms). Dynamic exclusion for 45 s was applied with a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm. Lock mass correction was performed as described above. Acquired spectra were first searched by computer-assisted database searches using Proteome Discoverer 1.4.1.14 with the search engines SequestHT (Thermo Scientific) and Mascot (Matrix Science, Boston, Massachusetts). Searches were performed against the full human protein database including isoforms (downloaded from Uniprot, 17 July 2012, appended with common contaminants and enzymes used) using the following settings: semienzyme specificity; three missed cleavage sites; mass tolerances of 10 ppm for precursors and for fragment masses 0.02 Da (HCD) and 0.5 Da (CID); static modifications: carbamidomethylation on Cys; and dynamic modifications: oxidation of Met, deamidation of Asp, and <sup>18</sup>O-incorporation at peptides C-termini.

<title>Synthesis of Glycosylated IL-6R Peptides 1–10</title>
<p>Solid phase peptide synthesis was carried out on a PTI Tribute peptide synthesizer using Trt-ChemMatrix resin (PCAS Biomatrix, Quebec, Canada). The resin (500 mg, loading 0.42 mmol/g) was activated with 10% acetyl bromide in dichloromethane (DCM) over 3 h and washed with absolute dichloromethane. The activated resin was reacted with the first amino-acid (5 eq.) and DIPEA (5 eq.) in DCM.

The mixture was warmed to ambient temperature and was subsequently (after 24 h) purified by flash chromatography (DCM/MeOH) (0%–15% MeOH). For removal of the PhiPr group, the protected hydrazide was dissolved in DCM containing 1% of TFA. After 30 min, the solution was extracted with dilute KHCO<sub>3</sub>, dried, and concentrated. The aspartylation of the O-glycopeptides was carried out with 1.5 eq. of nonasaccharide amine according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000080.ref062">62</xref>] in DMF-DMSO (1:1) using 4 eq. of DIPEA, 2.5 eq. of HOAt, and 2.5 eq. of HATU. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was deprotected by addition of the 20-fold volume of TFA/TES/H<sub>2</sub>O (96:2:2). The mixture was concentrated to half the volume after 2 h. Diethyl ether (10-fold volume) was added, and the precipitated glycopeptide was treated with hydrazine hydrate (5% in CH<sub>3</sub>CN-H<sub>2</sub>O 1:9), dried, and purified by HPLC as described above.</p>
<p>The yields were as follows: 1 (15%), 2 (15%), 3 (16%), 4 (17%), 5 (12%), 6 (13%), 7 (25%), 8 (22%), 9 (25%), 10 (19%).</p>

<title>In Vitro Cleavage Assay</title>
<p>Two 1.5 ml reaction tubes were filled with 50 μl peptide (50 μM) solved in 25 mM Hepes (pH 9.0), and 0.5 μl of the recombinant catalytic domain of ADAM17 was added to one of the reaction tubes, whereas the other sample remained untreated. All samples were incubated for 16 h at 37°C. Afterwards, 1,150 μl 0.1% TFA was added to each sample, and the peptides were separated on a reverse phase chromatography column (Multo High Bio-200-C18) from Chromatographie Service (Langerwehe, Germany) using a linear gradient elution with a binary solvent system and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% TFA, and solvent B consisted of 100% ACN. After peak integration, peak areas for cleaved and noncleaved peptides were determined.</p>

<title>Deglycosylation of (s)IL-6R</title>
<p>The sIL-6R was precipitated with 4–11 beads from 10 ml supernatant of transiently transfected HEK293 cells after PMA stimulation. Furthermore, about 8 x 10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 cells, transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding the human IL-6R, were lysed (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets). Full-length IL-6R was precipitated from the lysate with 4–11 beads. The 4–11 beads were washed three times with PBS, and sIL-6R and full-length IL-6R were eluted in 74 μl H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 μl G7 buffer, 1 μl 10% NP 40, and 2.5 μl β-mercaptoethanol (10 min, 95°C). The eluted volume was divided into three 1.5 ml reaction tubes. The first tube remained untreated, the second was treated with 2 μl PNGase F, and the third was treated with 3 μl Deglyco-Mix. All samples were incubated at 37°C overnight. After addition of 15 μl 5x Laemmli buffer, samples were analyzed by western blot.</p>

<title>IL-6R Internalization Assay</title>
<p>In order to analyze internalization of the IL-6R, 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells were washed in PBS, seeded onto a 10 cm dish in serum-free DMEM, and starved for 2 h at 37°C. Afterwards, cells were again washed with PBS, and the IL-6R was labeled with the 4–11 antibody diluted in FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS). After 1 h incubation on ice, cells were washed and resuspended in 10 ml serum-free DMEM, seeded onto a 10 cm dish, and shifted back to 37°C. At the time points indicated (0–180 min), 1 ml of the cell suspension was taken from the dish, transferred into a 1.5 ml reaction tube, and kept on ice to inhibit further internalization of the IL-6R. After obtaining the last sample, the cells were washed in cold FACS buffer, and the remaining IL-6R on the cell surface was stained with an APC-conjugated anti-mouse mAb. The cells were washed again and analyzed by flow cytometry using the BD Biosciences FACS Canto II (Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany).</p>

To specifically detect ds-sIL-6R (either recombinant or in human serum), a similar approach was used (ds6R/Baf227). Both sandwich ELISAs were performed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, US) and the peroxidase substrate BM blue POD (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 1.8 M sulfuric acid, and the absorbance read at 450 nm on a Tecan rainbow reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany).</p>
