<abstract>
<p>Insufficient or dysregulated energy metabolism may underlie diverse inherited and degenerative diseases, cancer, and even aging itself. ATP is the central energy carrier in cells, but critical pathways for regulating ATP levels are not systematically understood. We combined a pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) library enriched for mitochondrial genes, a fluorescent biosensor, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in a high-throughput genetic screen to assay ATP concentrations in live human cells. We identified genes not known to be involved in energy metabolism. Most mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are essential in maintaining ATP levels under respiratory conditions, and impaired respiration predicts poor growth. We also identified genes for which coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation rescued ATP deficits caused by knockdown. These included CoQ10 biosynthetic genes associated with human disease and a subset of genes not linked to CoQ10 biosynthesis, indicating that increasing CoQ10 can preserve ATP in specific genetic contexts. This screening paradigm reveals mechanisms of metabolic control and genetic defects responsive to energy-based therapies.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>There is abundant evidence that insufficient energy, or energy failure, contributes to the pathophysiology of many inherited and degenerative diseases, cancer, and aging. However, we understand little about how cellular energy levels are regulated. To begin to address this gap, we developed a screening approach that uses a fluorescent biosensor to measure relative levels of ATP in individual cells and used this approach to identify those genes that are most essential to maintaining energy levels. We screened approximately 2,200 genes and found that mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are particularly critical in maintaining energy levels and enabling cell growth. We also used this approach to identify genetic targets that could be amenable to an energy-based therapy via supplementation with the mitochondrial cofactor coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). These included CoQ10 biosynthetic genes associated with human disease as well as a subset of genes not previously linked to CoQ10 biosynthesis. Our screening paradigm thus reveals mechanisms by which cellular energy levels are controlled. It can also be used to identify genetic defects that will be responsive to energy-based therapies. Application of this approach may additionally enable powerful screens for other key metabolites to further advance a genome-scale understanding of the regulation of metabolism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>ATP is the key energy-carrying molecule in all cells, and failure to maintain adequate ATP levels may be critical in many diseases, ranging from mitochondrial disorders to cancer and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref003">3</xref>]. Despite the importance of ATP, we understand little about the contributions of genes and pathways that maintain its levels and how they are regulated.</p>
<p>Genes that modulate ATP levels may be therapeutic targets for diseases of energy failure or candidates for novel inborn errors of metabolism. Finding these genes would provide insight into how energy failure contributes to disease. However, that analysis has been limited by a lack of tools to screen the genome at high throughput for modifiers of ATP levels. One innovative study assayed ATP with arrayed adherent cells and identified genes that, when knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi), decreased or increased cellular ATP content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref004">4</xref>]. Although an important starting point, the study was limited by a small number of library short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) per gene, and it assayed total ATP normalized to DNA content and so could not differentiate changes in cell size or cell cycle from ATP concentration.</p>
<p>The primary sources of ATP are mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cytoplasmic glycolysis. However, which pathway predominates and the genetic control points are determined by poorly understood factors. In addition, functional assays are needed to match specific energy-based therapies to disorders that are likely to benefit from these therapies. For example, cofactor therapies, such as coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation, have been used therapeutically in disorders of CoQ10 biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref005">5</xref>], but with limited efficacy in other mitochondrial disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors specifically report the level of their target metabolite in living cells, including ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref007">7</xref>], NADH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref008">8</xref>], lactate, and glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref009">9</xref>]. Measuring metabolites in individual cells instead of cell lysates has produced important observations of the temporal, spatial, and subcellular regulation of cellular metabolism. However, high-throughput technologies, such as flow cytometry, have yet to be combined with fluorescent biosensors to detect metabolites in screens and other large studies.</p>
<p>Here, we report a novel screening paradigm to identify genes that maintain cellular ATP levels. We combined fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to measure ATP in single living cells. This screen shows that FRET and FACS can be used to screen a metabolite based on the real-time level and to provide valuable insight into key pathways and therapeutic strategies to maintain ATP in human cells.</p>

<title>Optimizing an ATP-FRET sensor for FACS</title>
<p>FRET describes the process by which photons emitted from an excited fluorophore are transferred to a second fluorophore with an efficiency dependent on the physical proximity of those fluorophores. FRET-based biosensors operate on the principle that the binding of a metabolite to a specific protein domain tethered to 2 fluorophores changes the sensor’s confirmation and the distance and orientation of the fluorophores, thus fluorescently reporting the concentration of that metabolite. FRET-based biosensors for metabolites have been used with fluorescence microscopy, but flow cytometry also detects FRET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref010">10</xref>]. To our knowledge, sorting cells based on the real-time levels of a metabolite has not been done.</p>
<p>We started with an established sensor with modified cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and monomeric Venus (mVenus) (AT1.03<sup>YEMK</sup>, CFP-Venus ATP) separated by an ATP-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref011">11</xref>]. This sensor shows ATP-dependent changes in FRET at physiological ATP concentrations and is resistant to pH changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref011">11</xref>]. We found that it also reports ATP levels by flow cytometry as it had a higher FRET/donor signal than a mutant sensor with no ATP affinity (AT<sup>R122K/R126K</sup>, CFP-Venus Dead) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref007">7</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Furthermore, drugs blocking oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis (to stop all ATP synthesis) reduced the FRET signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Unfortunately, the FRET signal varied based on expression level of the sensor, limiting its ability to detect differences in ATP between cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s001">S1C Fig</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Materials and methods</xref>). This limitation would confound population-based measurements needed for a screen. We hypothesized that this artifact is due to the relative dimness of CFP and the poor overlap of CFP with available FACS laser excitation wavelengths (405 and 488 nm, with E<sub>max</sub> of CFP approximately 433 nm), causing reduced detection of FRET at low expression levels.</p>

<p>To improve the sensor, we substituted fluorophores using the same interposed ATP-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref012">12</xref>]. We selected Clover (donor) and mApple (acceptor) for their brightness, spectral overlap, and compatibility with standard flow cytometer laser and emission filter wavelengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref014">14</xref>]. The Clover-mApple sensor had the expected cytosolic localization in cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s001">S1D Fig</xref>) and produced a narrow distribution of FRET that reported ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The FRET signal was decreased by substituting the dead mutant that disrupts ATP binding (Clover-mApple Dead, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s001">S1E Fig</xref>) or by adding drugs to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). The signal was independent of expression of the sensor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s001">S1G Fig</xref>). In vitro, the dynamic range of the CFP-Venus ATP sensor approached saturation approximately 3 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s001">S1H Fig</xref>). Because cytosolic ATP levels are estimated in the low mM range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref015">15</xref>], the CFP-Venus sensor may be saturated at baseline ATP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref007">7</xref>], which precludes detection of increased ATP and likely reduces sensitivity to small decreases in ATP. Substituting green and red fluorophores for CFP and Venus can reduce the affinity of the sensor for ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref012">12</xref>], and the Clover-mApple ATP sensor FRET saturated close to 6-mM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating an improved capacity to detect higher ATP levels versus the CFP-Venus sensor. The Dead sensor showed little response to exogenous ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and can thus be a control to identify artifactual FRET changes independent of ATP binding. The Clover-mApple sensor showed limited sensitivity to pH similar to the CFP-Venus sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref007">7</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Because of the improved brightness, compatibility with standard flow cytometry lasers, dynamic range, and lack of FRET variation based on sensor expression level compared with the CFP-Venus sensor, the Clover-mApple ATP and Dead sensors were used for the high-throughput measurement of ATP in individual cells.</p>

<title>CRISPRi screen for determinants of cellular ATP level</title>
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) technology allows the knockdown of individual genes in a large population of cells.

<title>Single-cell detection and sorting based on ATP content.</title>
<p>(A) Schema illustrating ATP FACS sorting protocol. K562 cells were transduced to stably express the dCas9-KRAB and then the ATP FRET sensor (or Dead sensor), and a small population was selected for dual expression by FACS. These cells were then expanded and transduced with a CRISPRi sgRNA lentiviral library so that each cell individually expressed one of approximately 28,000 sgRNAs. Cells were selected for expression of the sgRNA by puromycin for 4–5 days, allowed to recover from puromycin, and then exposed to substrate and drug conditions forcing ATP synthesis from glycolysis only (oligomycin and glucose) or oxidative phosphorylation only (2DG and pyruvate) 30 minutes prior to sorting. Cells were then sorted for 60 minutes. Cells in the lowest and highest ATP quartiles were isolated by flow cytometry, and the abundance of each sgRNA was quantified in the high- and low-ATP quartiles by deep sequencing. (B) Time course of ATP decline after incubation of cells with a glycolytic inhibitor (10 mM 2DG) and pyruvate (10 mM) to force reliance on respiration for ATP (“respiratory” conditions) or when both respiration and glycolysis were blocked (10 mM 2DG and 5 μM oligomycin) to prevent all ATP production. ATP was measured both by FRET with the Clover-mApple ATP sensor using flow cytometry (left y-axis, box and whisker plots; line = median; box = 25th–75th percentile; whisker = 5th–95th percentile) and by luciferase assay (right y-axis, lines, error bars ± SD not visible beyond the points).

<p>ATP can be derived from oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, or both. To know the source of ATP, the screen was conducted 3 times, wherein cells were acutely exposed to different drug and substrate conditions that forced ATP synthesis to derive from (1) oxidative phosphorylation only, (2) glycolysis only, or (3) from both. We forced cells to use oxidative phosphorylation—the “respiratory” condition—by incubating cells with high-dose 2-deoxyglucose (2DG; 10 mM) to inhibit glycolysis and 10 mM pyruvate to support aerobic respiration without glucose. To limit homeostatic mechanisms or cell death, cells were switched to these treatments only about 30 minutes before sorting, leaving cells little time to adapt.</p>
<p>In the respiratory condition, ATP levels declined modestly, as assessed by luciferase and flow cytometry FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, blue line and box and whiskers, respectively, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s002">S2A Fig</xref> an independent repetition), showing that FRET is in the dynamic range of the sensor during screening and that cellular energy was acutely stressed but not depleted. The relative changes in ATP as measured by FRET or luciferase were similar, indicating that our ATP-FRET sensor reliably reflects ATP levels. Adding 5 μM oligomycin to block oxidative phosphorylation in combination with high-dose 2DG resulted in rapid and complete loss of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, red line [luciferase] and box and whiskers [FRET]), confirming that, in 2DG alone, ATP was actively being made and that all detected ATP was from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The Dead sensor showed only a minimal reduction in FRET upon inhibiting glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), although ATP levels measured by luciferase decreased as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s002">S2C Fig</xref>), indicating that the Dead sensor is a suitable control for genetic manipulations that alter FRET independent of ATP.</p>
<p>To restrict ATP production to glycolysis only—the “glycolytic” condition—cells were exposed to 2 mM glucose and 5 μM oligomycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). A low dose of 2DG (3 mM) was also added to the glycolytic condition to reduce ATP from baseline because ATP levels did not acutely decrease in K562 cells with oligomycin alone in glucose. As with the respiratory condition, reducing ATP below baseline levels during cell sorting was necessary to ensure that ATP levels were within the dynamic range of the sensor and to confirm that cellular energy was acutely stressed. Increasing 2DG to 10 mM in the glycolytic condition resulted in loss of ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s002">S2C Fig</xref>), confirming that detected ATP was derived from glycolysis. Finally, we screened a “basal” condition with PBS, 5 mM pyruvate, 10 mM glucose, and no inhibitory drugs.</p>
<p>Because FACS occurs over time, we noted the stability of ATP levels in each metabolic condition over the timeframe (30–60 minutes post treatment) needed to sort cells. For cells in respiratory or glycolytic conditions, ATP levels assessed by the ATP FRET sensor were stable for 90 minutes as detected by luciferase or flow cytometry FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). To conduct the screen, cells expressing the ATP FRET sensor, dCas9-KRAB, and a single sgRNA were exposed to acute metabolic conditions as above, and the highest and lowest quartiles of ATP as reported by the ATP FRET sensor were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To control for ATP-independent changes in FRET (e.g., from unexpected effects of the sgRNA on the synthesis or turnover of the sensor fluorophores), we conducted a parallel screen with the Dead FRET sensor. We collected approximately 200 cells per sgRNA (average of 10 sgRNAs/gene, approximately 2,000 cells/gene); with this method, about 1,000 genes can be screened and sorted per hour. Each collected quartile was deep sequenced, and the number of each sgRNA in each FRET quartile was determined by counting the sequencing reads for that sgRNA in that quartile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref017">17</xref>]. We generated a phenotype (fold-enrichment in the high- versus low-FRET quartile) for each sgRNA.</p>
<p>The screen was repeated 3 times for each of the 3 metabolic contexts (respiratory, glycolytic, basal) with the ATP FRET sensor, and twice with the Dead sensor in each context. The phenotype of each individual sgRNAs was averaged over the repetitions. The final gene phenotype was reported as the average of the 3 sgRNAs with the strongest phenotype per gene. We examined the raw phenotypes for separate sgRNAs for each repetition and found that the reproducibility of each sgRNA compared with non-targeting sgRNAs was good (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, select genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s009">S1 Table</xref> for all average phenotypes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s010">S2 Table</xref> for all individual sgRNA phenotypes for the respiratory condition for all 3 repetitions).</p>

<title>ATP-critical pathways depend on metabolic context</title>
<p>To assess the specificity of our screen for true hits that alter ATP levels, we considered the distribution of non-targeting sgRNAs. To simulate the analysis for the active CRISPRi sgRNAs, we tested random combinations of 10 sgRNAs from among the 1,400 non-targeting sgRNAs, each combination representing a simulated gene, and graphed the average of the 3 sgRNAs with the strongest phenotypes for each simulated gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> grey dots). The phenotypes of these simulated genes were tightly clustered around 1 (equal distribution in the high- and low-FRET fractions), thus representing the “noise” in the screen. A gene was defined as a “hit” in the respiratory condition if there were 2 or more sgRNAs yielding phenotypes &gt;2 SDs beyond the mean phenotype of the non-targeting sgRNAs, averaged over the 3 independent repetitions. Using these criteria, none of the simulated genes was identified as a hit under any of the 3 metabolic conditions (fold-enrichment in high versus low-ATP fractions all approximately 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s009">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s010">S2</xref> Tables), suggesting the specificity of the screen for detecting sgRNAs that affect gene expression.

<p>(A, B) Cells expressing an sgRNA from a mitochondrial-gene–enriched CRISPRi subgenome library with 10 sgRNAs/gene and either the ATP FRET sensor or Dead FRET sensor were placed in either (A) respiratory (10 mM 2DG and 10 mM pyruvate) or (B) glycolytic (5 μM oligomycin, 2 mM glucose and low-dose [3 mM] 2DG) conditions, and the cells were sorted by ATP concentration. Abundance of each sgRNA in the high- and low-FRET fractions was determined by deep sequencing, and the relative enrichment of each sgRNA in the high- versus low-ATP fraction determined. Black dots are individual gene phenotypes based on the average of the 3 sgRNAs with the largest phenotypes, averaged per sgRNA over 3 independent experiments. Grey dots are simulated genes consisting of random combinations of non-targeting sgRNAs. For each gene, the y-axis shows fold-enrichment in high versus low-ATP fractions for cells expressing the ATP FRET sensor, and the x-axis shows the corresponding fold-enrichment in high versus low-ATP fractions with the Dead FRET sensor.

Note that no genes that decreased ATP in the respiratory condition when knocked down also decreased ATP in the glycolytic condition, and knockdown of many genes decreasing ATP in the respiratory condition protected ATP in the glycolytic condition.

<p>To control for artifactual hits that might impact the FRET signal independent of the ATP level, the entire sublibrary was also rescreened 2 times with the Dead sensor, and the same analysis was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Potential hits that similarly altered FRET with the Dead sensor were removed from analysis. Under respiratory conditions, most hits that decreased the FRET signal with the ATP sensor had little effect on the FRET signal of the Dead sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), indicating that they are true low-ATP hits. However, occasional genes did influence the FRET signal of the Dead sensor, especially under glycolytic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), indicating that ATP-independent effects can also impact the FRET signal and underscoring the importance of a dead mutant control. An analogous control is not available for luciferase-based assays.</p>
<p>To determine the effect of metabolic context of gene knockdown on ATP levels, we compared the phenotypes of each gene in respiratory and glycolytic conditions. While few genes decreased the ATP FRET signal in glycolytic conditions, knockdown of some genes caused small increases in the ATP FRET signal in glycolytic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s011">S3 Table</xref>). Among these, some gene-targeting sgRNAs also increased the FRET of the Dead sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These artifacts were due to the effect of gene knockdown rather than general effects of CRISPRi because artifacts were not observed with non-targeting sgRNAs. In the glycolytic condition, 65 of 144 (45.1%) of FRET-increasing hits were removed because they also increased FRET in the Dead sensor control. ATP-independent artifacts seemed to be pathway specific: 20 of 29 (60.0%) of cytosolic ribosomal hits were removed because they increased FRET in the Dead sensor, but only 4 of 25 (16.0%) of mitochondrial ribosomal subunits were removed for that reason. Of the 79 hits remaining in the glycolytic condition after removing artifacts, 43 (54.4%) that protected ATP in glycolysis also decreased ATP in the respiratory condition, indicating opposite effects of knockdown of the same genes in opposite metabolic contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Only 6 genes reduced the FRET signal of the ATP sensor in basal conditions, but none decreased FRET from the Dead sensor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s009">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s010">S2</xref> Tables, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). While 60 genes produced small increases in the ATP FRET signal in basal conditions, only 8 (13.3%) did not also increase FRET from the Dead sensor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s011">S3 Table</xref>). The magnitude of phenotypes observed in the basal condition was smaller than seen in the respiratory or glycolytic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We conclude that very few genes alter ATP levels in basal condtions, consistent with the hypothesis that maintaining ATP levels is of primary importance in cells, and that cells adjust their metabolism and growth to maintain ATP levels. The acute metabolic perturbation in the respiratory and glycolytic conditions was thus essential to uncovering genes critical to maintaining ATP levels.</p>

<title>Enrichment of mitochondrial transcription and translation genes among ATP-critical pathways</title>

As expected, few trafficking or motility genes affected ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), suggesting that many functions are not needed to maintain ATP.

We compared our results to these screens and found overlap with our screen and the “death screen” conducted by Arroyo and colleagues, which examined genes necessary for cell survival in galactose, which forces reliance on mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The agreement between our screen and that of Arroyo and colleagues suggests that many genes for ATP maintenance are also needed for cell survival in substrate that forces reliance on oxidative phosphorylation. While we found about two-thirds of the hits from the Arroyo screen, half of our hits were not found by Arroyo and colleagues, suggesting that some cells survive with impaired respiratory function and may not be identified by a survival or growth screen.</p>

<p>There was very little overlap with the study by Lanning and colleagues from either our screen or that of Arroyo and colleagues. We expected the pyruvate condition from Lanning and colleagues to overlap with our respiratory condition. Instead, even though our library and that of Lanning and colleagues screened 384 genes in common, there was an overlap of only 6 ATP-decreasing genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Many ATP-decreasing genes in our study increased ATP in the study by Lanning and colleagues, overall suggesting that the assays produced different results.</p>

<title>Low-ATP hits impair mitochondrial bioenergetics</title>
<p>To further validate our assay, we generated stable cell lines expressing single sgRNAs against selected genes identified as low-ATP hits under respiratory conditions, selected for transduced cells with puromycin, and further verified gene knockdown in a subset of lines by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). As expected, knockdown of <italic>MRPL10</italic>, a strong low-ATP hit, decreased mitochondrial-derived ATP as detected by FACS/FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) and by luciferase versus a negative-control sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) but did not alter ATP in the glycolytic condition by either method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Luciferase analysis of additional low-ATP hits from the primary screen also confirmed decreased ATP in the respiratory condition, while glycolysis-derived ATP was unchanged or protected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), confirming by a second method that the FRET-based screen identified true changes in ATP, both increased and decreased. The magnitude of ATP change detected by luciferase, however, was somewhat smaller overall than that detected by FRET, suggesting that the FRET screen is more sensitive than standard luciferase assays. We hypothesize that the increased sensitivity of the screen is due to the large number of cells analyzed individually compared with pooling cells in a lysate as is required by luciferase analysis.</p>

<p>We also used a Seahorse analyzer to determine whether an impairment in aerobic respiration underlies decreased mitochondrial-derived ATP.

Impaired respiration might result either from an intrinsic deficit in respiration or decreased mitochondrial content. However, all lines had similar mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), as assessed by western blot on cell lysates against translocase of outer membrane 20 kDa subunit (Tom20) and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4 (NDUFS4), suggesting that mitochondrial-derived ATP levels are decreased due to an impairment in intrinsic mitochondrial function.</p>

<title>Direct ATP screening provides insights into the energy requirements of cell growth</title>
<p>To determine what energy sources support cell growth, we analyzed our ATP phenotype data from different conditions (respiratory, glycolytic) compared with data from a published growth screen of the same CRISPRi library in K562 cells performed under basal conditions that permit both respiration and glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref017">17</xref>]. When growth data are overlaid with our ATP data under respiratory conditions (ATP<sub>resp</sub>), genes organize into classes that differentially impact ATP and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). For example, knockdown of genes encoding components of the cytosolic ribosome slowed growth but did not affect ATP levels, but lower ATP levels did correlate with poorer growth for mitochondrial ribosomal genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In contrast to the respiratory condition, comparing growth with ATP levels under glycolytic conditions (ATP<sub>gly</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) demonstrated no relationship between growth and ATP levels for mitochondrial ribosomal genes. Therefore, among genes identified to impact growth, the ATP screen distinguishes genes that slow growth independent of energy levels from those that influence growth due to effects on mitochondrial function. Because cells in the growth screen had access to glucose without drugs (untreated), and we observed that few genes impact ATP levels in the similarly untreated basal condition (ATP<sub>basal</sub>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), we conclude that mitochondrial function is important for K562 cell growth even when respiratory and glycolytic substrates are present and ATP levels are normal. In contrast to the respiratory condition, when growth was compared with the corresponding ATP levels under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) or glycolytic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), there was no relationship between growth and ATP levels.</p>

<p>(A, B) Genetic impact on growth can be separated as energy dependent and energy independent. ATP phenotypes in different metabolic contexts (y-axis, same data as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3</xref>) compared to growth phenotypes under basal conditions (x-axis, from Gilbert and colleagues 2014, S3 Table, column B) with the same CRISPRi library in the same K562 cell line.

Genes encoding cytosolic ribosomal subunits (CRP, green triangles) showed no correlation (−0.693 ± 0.371 [NS]). (B) When GROWTH<sub>basGilbert</sub> was compared to ATP<sub>glyc</sub>, all 3 groups had negative slopes (MRP [−1.508 ± 0.503; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0039], MPI [−2.02 ± 0.962; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0474], and CRP genes [−1.91 ± 0.403; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001]). (C, D) Genetic impact on growth is dependent on metabolic context. K562 cells expressing the CRISPRi library were grown in media favoring respiration or glycolysis, and the genes enriched and depleted in each metabolic condition were determined.

<p>To further understand how genes influence growth through energy-independent and -dependent mechanisms, we compared ATP and growth under matching metabolic conditions. We performed separate growth screens in respiratory (GROWTH<sub>resp</sub>), glycolytic (GROWTH<sub>glyc</sub>), and basal (GROWTH<sub>basal</sub>) conditions and compared the growth phenotypes to the ATP phenotype in the corresponding metabolic condition. Mirroring what we observed when comparing respiratory ATP with growth in a basal condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), we observed that in respiratory conditions for both ATP and growth, knockdown of genes encoding components of the cytosolic ribosome showed no relationship between ATP and growth, indicating that these genes inhibit growth independent of energy level. In contrast, after knockdown of genes encoding components of the mitochondrial ribosome, the extent of decline in ATP<sub>resp</sub> correlated with the decrease in GROWTH<sub>resp</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In contrast, there was no relationship between ATP and growth in the glycolytic or basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). These data suggest that knockdown of mitochondrial ribosomal genes impairs growth by affecting mitochondrial energy metabolism, either directly (ATP) or indirectly (redox status from respiratory chain function) rather than by other effects on mitochondria (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering or reactive oxygen species [ROS] production), although these effects could also be regulated in a substrate-specific manner.</p>
<p>Gilbert and colleagues (2014) noted more genes that slowed growth than we did. The difference might be in the number of cell divisions. They included only a basal condition, which permitted many cell divisions. We found that cells grew poorly in respiratory and glycolytic conditions, limiting the total number of divisions. The ability to screen for phenotypes that are not compatible with robust cell growth is another advantage of FRET-based over growth-based screening.</p>
<p>Finally, although modest ATP decreases correlate with lower growth, several genes (e.g., <italic>PAF1</italic>, <italic>KPNB1</italic>, or <italic>ISCA2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) decrease ATP despite normal growth in respiratory conditions, again indicating that growth-inhibiting effects of decreased ATP can be overcome. Such genes that impair mitochondrial energy metabolism without slowing growth would be missed by growth-based screens but can be identified by a functional assay for ATP, as shown here.</p>

<title>Genes identified in the ATP screen influence cancer cell proliferation</title>
<p>Modulating ATP levels may have therapeutic potential for diseases with high biosynthetic requirements, such as cancer. Yet little is known about how diverse cancers respond to metabolic therapies, and metabolic therapies are not yet major strategies employed in the clinic. By identifying energy-modulating genes in human tumors, our screening approach may help to identify those cancer-related mutations that are critical to cellular ATP levels and thus support cancer cell growth.</p>
<p>Based on the results of our growth screen, we reasoned that hits that disrupt mitochondrial-derived ATP would negatively impact cancer cell growth and examined 1 hit that decreased ATP in respiratory conditions named <italic>METTL17</italic>, which is implicated in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref019">19</xref>]. We cloned the sgRNA targeting sequence associated with the greatest ATP alterations for the <italic>METTL17</italic> (sequence provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Materials and methods</xref>). Lentivirus expressing these or negative-control sgRNAs was transduced into HCC827 human lung cancer cells expressing dCas9-KRAB. After 1 week, total METTL17 protein levels were more reduced in cells transduced with sgRNA targeting this protein than in negative controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s008">S8A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Anticancer therapies inhibit tumor growth by affecting proliferation, and to determine whether <italic>METTL17</italic> silencing altered cell proliferation, we performed trypan blue staining of HCC827 cells expressing either negative-control sgRNA (Neg 1) or stable silencing of <italic>METTL17</italic> that were exposed to either control medium or medium containing 20 mM 2DG over 48 hours. <italic>METTL17</italic>-silenced cells yielded significantly fewer viable cells at basal condition than negative controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s008">S8B Fig</xref>), while the number of nonviable cells (trypan blue–positive) did not differ significantly between the groups. Inhibition of glycolysis with 2DG further decreased the total number of viable cells after 24 hours in both negative-control and <italic>METTL17</italic>-silenced lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s008">S8B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether reducing METTL17 protein expression compromises cell cycle progression either at baseline or during glycolysis inhibition, unsynchronized HCC827 cells in standard culture conditions were collected at 24 hours after exposure to control medium or medium with 10 or 20 mM 2DG. Collected cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by FACS. Baseline G1 and G2 fractions were similar between control and METLL17 cells at baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Forcing control HCC827 cells to increase mitochondrial energy production by inhibiting glycolysis with 2DG led to an accumulation of cells in G1. This shift was absent in cells lacking METTL17 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s008">S8C Fig</xref>), suggesting that knockdown of METTL17 decreases the overall growth rate, potentially to preserve ATP levels. We specifically assessed apoptosis by analyzing Annexin V using FACS, which quantified &lt;6% Annexin V positivity across all cells and conditions, indicating that death was not prominent under basal or 2DG conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s008">S8D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Although <italic>METTL17</italic> did not itself impact growth in K562 cells, it was nonetheless identified in our ATP screen performed in K562 human leukemia cells; these subsequent studies link <italic>METTL17</italic> to a cancer-relevant endpoint in a different cancer cell line—in this case, human lung cancer cells—in which stable silencing of <italic>METTL17</italic> significantly suppresses basal cancer cell proliferation without producing increased apoptosis. This finding parallels observations from our screen that indicate a negative relationship between genes that inhibit mitochondrial function and basal cell growth. From the standpoint of cancer therapeutics, these data raise the possibility of pharmacologic inhibition of METTL17 function or other genes critical to mitochondrial-derived ATP suppressing tumor growth, and future studies are needed to assess this possibility and its potential to preferentially target tumor cells.</p>

<p>(A) CoQ10 rescue of ATP in respiratory conditions was assessed with a mini-library of sgRNAs.

<p>We then repeated the full subgenome library screen 3 times with CoQ10 supplementation and twice without. Known CoQ10 biosynthetic genes again showed improved ATP with CoQ10 supplementation, and a subset of low-ATP hits with no known direct function in CoQ10 biosynthesis including <italic>COX11</italic> showed improved ATP with CoQ10 supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s013">S5 Table</xref>). To support these findings, we measured ATP levels with and without CoQ10 in a subset of these genes by luciferase and confirmed rescue of ATP levels in several genes (<italic>PDSS1</italic>, <italic>PDSS2</italic>, <italic>COX11</italic>) and no rescue in others (<italic>COX16</italic>, <italic>ATP5MPL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), consistent with what was observed by FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). No improvement in ATP was detected with CoQ10 supplementation in the glycolytic condition by luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), confirming the specificity of CoQ10 to the respiratory metabolic context.</p>
<p>CoQ10 could rescue ATP levels by correcting a primary or secondary CoQ10 deficiency or by augmenting mitochondrial function through other mechanisms. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured cellular CoQ10 levels with and without CoQ10 supplementation in cells with a CoQ10 biosynthetic gene knocked down (<italic>PDSS2</italic>) or selected low-ATP hits with no known function in CoQ10 biosynthesis (<italic>COX11</italic>, <italic>ATP5MPL</italic>, <italic>COX16</italic>). We observed that baseline CoQ10 levels were low in cells lacking <italic>PDSS2</italic>, but CoQ10 levels in cells lacking <italic>COX11</italic>, <italic>ATP5MPL</italic>, or <italic>COX16</italic> were not different from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Supplementation with CoQ10 increased CoQ10 levels in all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Supplementation also increased the fraction of total CoQ10 in the oxidized versus reduced state in control cells and in cells with single-gene knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). From these data, we conclude that CoQ10 supplementation can improve mitochondrial ATP production by correcting a primary CoQ10 deficiency, but the rescue of <italic>COX11</italic>-induced ATP deficiency results either from additional improvements in respiration or other undefined benefits of supraphysiologic CoQ10 levels.</p>

<title>Specificity of ATP FRET screen</title>
<p>Our screen identified genetic factors that regulate ATP with high specificity. None of the &gt;2,000 simulated genes we screened produced hits, and 87.2% (136/156) of our total hits that decreased ATP under respiratory conditions had known mitochondrial functions. The other 12.8% (20 genes) likely also function in energy metabolism and warrant further study. CRISPR and RNAi screens using whole-genome libraries are common and powerful tools to dissect genetic pathways in mammalian cells. Yet most assay an endpoint (e.g., survival, growth, reporter gene expression) that may reflect heterogeneous molecular intermediates. Measuring a metabolite in real time at a scale compatible with genome-wide screening is novel and enables a mechanistic dissection of detailed biochemical processes.</p>
<p>Genes identified in our screen had little overlap with the only screen published on genetic regulators of ATP (Lanning and colleagues) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref004">4</xref>]. This study did not observe decreased ATP phenotypes under a respiration-only condition (pyruvate) with inhibition of most mitochondrial ribosomal genes, and in fact, 6 such genes increased ATP by more than 25% when knocked down, and they found increased ATP with inhibition of a majority of screened CoQ10 biosynthetic genes. While some differences may be attributable to the different cell types used (K562 cells in this study; HeLa in Lanning and colleagues’ study), the mitochondrial ribosome and CoQ10 biosynthesis are believed to be critical to aerobic respiration across different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref023">23</xref>]. The discrepancies between these studies warrant further consideration. Lanning and colleagues measured ATP in many cells concurrently, and ATP was normalized to total DNA content. This method would be susceptible to artifacts caused by differences in cell size (altering the absolute ATP content) or cell cycle (impacting the ATP/DNA ratio) that would not reflect changes in ATP concentration. Other differences include the use of 2 siRNAs per gene by Lanning and colleagues versus 10 sgRNAs per gene in this study, and the use of an ATP-insensitive control to remove ATP-independent artifacts in this study. We believe that the methodologic advantages detailed here—including our detection of nearly all genes in one mitochondrial compartment (i.e., the ribosome) and the gene-specific rescue of ATP by CoQ10—demonstrate that our FRET-based method of screening for ATP modifiers adds substantially to the nascent field of metabolite-based screening.</p>
<p>The high-throughput screen described here required fast-growing cells capable of effective CRISPRi-mediated gene knockdown. Any cell type selection, particularly a transformed cell line, will likely impact the results of a screen. K562 cells have successfully revealed important biology in other related screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref018">18</xref>], and here, they demonstrated clear pathway-specific effects, e.g., from knockdown of mitochondrial ribosomal subunits. These effects are biologically plausible, are supported by additional investigation (e.g., rescue by CoQ10), and likely can be generalized to other cell types. Knowledge of essential and novel mitochondrial processes enables future detailed studies in targeted disease models.</p>
<p>Effects of pH on the fluorescent ATP biosensor are unlikely to underlie the findings reported here. We employed a Dead sensor control to eliminate artifacts due to ATP-independent effects on the fluorophores, and many hits identified in this study were validated by luciferase assay, a completely orthogonal methodology.</p>

<title>ATP levels are uniquely sensitive to disruption of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins</title>
<p>We found differences in the classes of genes required to maintain ATP levels. Mitochondrial-derived ATP levels were decreased by knockdown of 40% (27/67) of mitochondrial transcription/translation genes and 85% (57/67) of mitochondrial ribosomal genes. In contrast, knockdown of only 23% (21/90) of screened respiratory chain genes decreased ATP levels. The specific respiratory chain genes identified in this screen may be critical to maintaining ATP levels. Indeed, mutations in some of the genes identified in our screen, e.g., <italic>PDSS2</italic> and <italic>COX10</italic>, are believed to cause human mitochondrial disorders by depleting ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Our screen also assayed other classes of mitochondrial genes with known roles in promoting respiration, but only a subset of the genes tested were identified as hits. For example, our screen identified select components of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, which plays a critical role in maintaining cristae morphology (<italic>IMMT</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref026">26</xref>], <italic>MINOS1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref027">27</xref>]), and a subset of mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins (e.g., neither Mfn1 or Mff were low-ATP hits). In one case, the fission receptor encoded by <italic>MIEF1</italic> (Mid51) was a hit, while the related gene <italic>MIEF2</italic> (Mid49) was not, despite functioning in the same pathway. There are likely several reasons why certain genes with known functions in respiration were not hits. First, in many cases, these genes are likely less critical for maintaining ATP levels than those genes identified as hits. For example, although mitochondrial dynamics proteins influence respiration, mitochondria can continue to respire with different morphologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref028">28</xref>], and the impact on respiration may only be observed in cell types and conditions with high energy requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref029">29</xref>]. In other cases, there may be compensatory pathways that maintain respiration or delayed effects on ATP levels that would be missed in our assay system. We examined the capacity to maintain ATP after only a few days of gene knockdown and could have missed genes that might influence ATP levels more slowly, e.g., by compromising processes such as mitochondrial DNA maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref030">30</xref>]. In other cases, there may have been insufficient knockdown by CRISPRi, or gene function may be preserved even with substantial knockdown. As such, future studies will be needed to determine whether specific pathways (e.g., individual respiratory chain complexes) are more or less critical for ATP synthesis. Our finding that a majority of mitochondrial ribosomal subunits were identified as hits suggests that most genes critical for ATP maintenance would be identified in this screen and that many genes not hit may indeed be less critical for maintaining ATP in the conditions screened in this study.</p>
<p>Why are ATP levels so sensitive to disruption of genes involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis? Genes in the mitochondrial genome are retained evolutionarily, including proteins at the core of respiratory chain complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref031">31</xref>], whereas peripheral subunits were more easily moved to the nucleus, perhaps due to differences in protein hydrophobicity. Disrupting nuclear-encoded genes that impair mitochondrial transcription and translation may affect mitochondria more than individual respiratory chain components because they interfere with expression of multiple core, mitochondrially encoded subunits. This observation suggests that combined respiratory defects cause disease due to more severe energy failure than dysfunction of a single respiratory chain complex.</p>
<p>Mutations in only a few mitochondrial ribosomal proteins cause human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref023">23</xref>]. Others have likely not yet been linked to disease due to rarity or early lethal phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref032">32</xref>]. Indeed, whole-exome sequencing has led to the discovery of mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal subunits as the cause of neonatal lethal diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref033">33</xref>]. From our findings, loss of these proteins may produce disease due to energy failure, but their loss could also compromise other mitochondrial functions, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> metabolism and ROS production, and deficits in these functions may contribute to disease.</p>
<p>The screen presented here was not exhaustive of all mitochondria-localized genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s009">S1 Table</xref> for complete gene list). For example, most components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and some respiratory chain subunits, including many complex III subunits, were not included, and further investigation is required to define the bioenergetic requirement for these genes and for comparisons of individual respiratory chain complexes.</p>

<title>New genes linked to metabolism</title>
<p>We identified genes without recognized mitochondrial functions that, when knocked down, reduced ATP only from mitochondria. The strongest such hit was <italic>KPNB1</italic>, which encodes a component of the nuclear pore complex. No human disease is yet associated with this gene, but it may be needed for mitochondrial biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref034">34</xref>] because <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae lacking Importin-Beta had fewer mitochondria. This may be due to impaired nuclear import of Nrf2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref035">35</xref>]. Our studies show impaired mitochondrial function with <italic>KPNB1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>), indicating a conserved role in mitochondrial metabolism but normal mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the defect is not due to decreased mitochondrial biosynthesis. Also, <italic>PAF1</italic>, which regulates nuclear gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref036">36</xref>], has no known link to energy metabolism, but its knockdown also decreases ATP only when ATP is produced by the mitochondria as detected by FRET and luciferase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s009">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s011">S3</xref> Tables, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Overall, our findings demonstrate the capacity of functional screens to identify mitochondria-related genes whose protein products may not necessarily be localized to the mitochondria as well as demonstrate that further study of putative mitochondrial genes may give insight into how energy levels are maintained, contribute to disease, and/or can be therapeutic targets.</p>

<title>Metabolic substrate determines gene requirements for ATP levels</title>
<p>Knocking down most mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes affected mitochondria-derived ATP levels but did not decrease ATP when cells used glycolysis alone or both respiration and glycolysis. Therefore, glycolysis may compensate for decreases in aerobic respiration, and/or energy consumption may be decreased to maintain normal ATP. In support of the former, when cells were forced to use only glycolysis-derived ATP, knockdown of some mitochondrial ribosomal proteins actually enhanced the capacity of cells to maintain ATP levels above those of control cells in the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). This likely reflects up-regulated glycolysis when aerobic respiration was compromised by gene knockdown.</p>
<p>Which metabolic context is most relevant to in vivo human diseases of energy failure? This is poorly understood. Local substrate conditions are often not known and differ among cell types, energy requirements, stressors (e.g., starvation), and perhaps genetic modifiers of metabolism. Developmental stage is a consideration; e.g., the in utero environment is more hypoxic than after birth, leading to increased reliance on glycolysis during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>In our experiments, knockdown of only a few genes caused chronic basal ATP deficiency. More were important to maintaining ATP levels during acute metabolic perturbations. We hypothesize that disease more often results from acute insults to ATP homeostasis in a setting that is sensitized by an underlying deficiency in mitochondrial function than a chronic deficit in ATP levels. Acute exposure to respiratory or glycolytic conditions may not seem representative of chronic metabolic disease, but many disorders of energy failure manifest as intermittent acute clinical episodes rather than chronic disease. For example, patients with Leigh syndrome or mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) present with acute stroke-like episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref038">38</xref>]. Similarly, hypoxia/ischemia, rhabdomyolysis due to mitochondrial disease, and hypoglycemia due to inborn errors in fatty acid oxidation are acute forms of energy failure and injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref040">40</xref>]. The relative contributions of chronic versus intermittent ATP perturbation to metabolic disease need more study.</p>

<title>ATP correlates with, but is not required for, cell growth</title>
<p>What are the cellular consequences of insufficient ATP? ATP is required for many cell functions (e.g., neuronal activity, myocardial contractility, insulin release, and cell growth) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref041">41</xref>]. However, it is rarely proven that insufficient ATP itself underlies deficits in these functions. Growth-based screens in human cells with shRNA or CRISPR libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref043">43</xref>] create a “black box” between the gene and growth change that may not reflect a metabolic etiology. To investigate this, we studied the relationship of ATP level and growth under different metabolic conditions. Our data suggest that specifically insufficient ATP (i.e., energy failure), not loss of other functions, explains why decreasing mitochondrial ribosomal proteins compromise growth in respiratory conditions. Moreover, cells may decrease growth as a means of preserving ATP levels when ATP production is decreased. The relationship between ATP level and cell growth also raises the possibility of an energy threshold for growth. In addition, we identified several genes for which CRISPRi markedly decreased ATP without compromising growth, or slowed growth without affecting ATP. These findings highlight the significant utility of the ATP screen in beginning to define the contribution of metabolism to cellular functions.</p>
<p>An important strength of our screen is the ability to identify ATP-modulating genes under distinct metabolic conditions (basal, respiratory, glycolytic). Moreover, we hypothesize that genes identified in these specific contexts (metabolic and/or cellular) will exert similar effects in other cellular and experimental contexts. For example, our data indicate that <italic>METTL17</italic> loss significantly suppresses human lung cancer cell growth and support the idea that the identification of energy-modulating genes could inform the development of cancer-relevant biochemical approaches. Moving forward, defining the precise cellular and metabolic contexts amenable to metabolic-based therapy will require cancer-type–specific studies, as our findings suggest.</p>

<title>CoQ10 responsiveness</title>
<p>To our knowledge, we report here the first high-throughput screen of responsiveness to CoQ10 (or any drug) for single-gene causes of mitochondrial dysfunction. Of at least 18 known CoQ10 biosynthetic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref044">44</xref>], 10 were screened in our library, and 5 are known to cause human disease. Among these 5, knockdown of <italic>PDSS1</italic>, <italic>PDSS2</italic>, and <italic>COQ2</italic> decreased ATP specifically in the respiratory condition in this screen. CoQ10 supplementation prevented the drop in ATP in respiratory conditions in all 3 of these genes as detected by repeat FRET-based screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>) and by luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). However, many mitochondrial disorders have not responded clinically to CoQ10 supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref006">6</xref>]. We also identified several genes in which mitochondrial-derived ATP increased with CoQ10, even in the absence of a known role in CoQ10 biosynthesis. In particular, <italic>COX11</italic> consistently showed improved ATP with CoQ10 supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref>). Moreover, cells lacking <italic>COX11</italic> did not have lower CoQ10 content, suggesting that the ATP rescue must be due to a role of CoQ10 in other mitochondrial functions. We speculate that supraphysiologic levels of CoQ10 may improve mitochondrial ATP production, e.g., by improving the efficiency of the respiratory chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref045">45</xref>] or increasing mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref046">46</xref>]. Indeed, CoQ10 has been reported to partially prevent ATP depletion from mitochondrial stressors in the absence of a known defect in CoQ10 biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref047">47</xref>]. Alternatively, CoQ10 also has known functions as an antioxidant that could decrease energy requirements or indirectly increase energy production. Although <italic>COX11</italic> is not yet associated with disease, we hypothesize that <italic>COX11</italic> deficiency, if found, may respond to CoQ10 treatment.</p>
<p>If supraphysiologic CoQ10 can boost mitochondrially derived ATP, why is CoQ10 not more broadly effective? Perhaps there are 2 CoQ10 thresholds to increase ATP: one to restore deficient levels in disorders of CoQ10 biosynthesis and a second to boost mitochondrial ATP production though other mechanisms at supraphysiologic levels. Difficulty achieving high enough CoQ10 levels may explain the lack of clinical efficacy in humans, in which the bioavailability of CoQ10 is limited, especially in certain tissues, such as the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref048">48</xref>]. Secondary CoQ10 deficiency may also underlie some mitochondrial disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004624.ref049">49</xref>], contributing to the degree of CoQ10 responsiveness.</p>
<p>Our findings here suggest that the beneficial effects of CoQ10 supplementation on mitochondrial-derived ATP levels may also go beyond simply restoring CoQ10 levels to normal. Moreover, our observation that CoQ10 rescues ATP levels caused by knockdown of some genes and not others has important implications for the utility of high-throughput screening for targeting therapies to mitochondrial disease and other disorders of energy failure. There are hundreds of single-gene mitochondrial disorders, and until now, no mechanism existed to screen for effective interventions for each genetic deficiency individually. The high-throughput nature of our technology should permit preclinical screening of any number of candidate therapies in different substrate/drug combinations, adding tremendously to our understanding of the interaction between single-gene mitochondrial dysfunction and external stresses and therapies. Furthermore, just as we combined our ATP data with other large-scale growth screens to achieve new insights, metabolite screening for other molecules with fluorescent biosensors (e.g., ROS, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) may advance a genome-scale understanding of the regulation of metabolism.</p>

K562 cells were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI-1640 with 25 mM HEPES, 2.0 g/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.3 g/L L-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Lentivirus expressing the Clover-mApple ATP or Dead sensors was produced by the UCSF Viracore and transduced with polybrene (8 μg/mL) into K562-dCas9-expressing cells via spinfection. Two days after transduction, cells were selected by FACS that expressed both fluorophores (Clover and mApple). To avoid artifacts from potential mutations or variations in a single cell, a small polyclonal population of ATP FRET sensor-expressing cells was expanded for all subsequent experiments. The use of a polyclonal population was very unlikely to have affected screen results for several reasons, as follows: post-FACS comparisons showed no difference in FRET distribution from small or large collections of ATP FRET sensor-expressing cells; sufficient cells were screened such that each sgRNA was screened in approximately 200 cells, which would average out any cell-to-cell variability; and, as described above, the Clover-mApple sensor did not differ in FRET signal based on sensor expression level.</p>
<p>For the CRISPRi pooled library, lentivirus was transduced as above, and 2 days after transduction, puromycin selection (0.65 μg/mL) was started and maintained for 4 to 5 days total, followed by 1 to 3 days of recovery from puromycin.

Lentivirus expressing dCas9-KRAB and sgRNA of interest was produced by the UCSF Viracore and transduced with polybrene (8 μg/mL) into HCC827-dCas9–expressing cells over 2 consecutive days. At 48 hours after transduction, puromycin selection (1 μg/mL) was started and maintained for 7 days total. Experiments were performed using the pooled cells surviving antibiotic selection.

For the CFP-Venus ATP sensor, excitation was from a 405-nm laser and FRET detected by a 525/50-nm filter. mTagBFP fluorescence from the CRISPRi library was excited by a 405-nm laser and detected by a 450/50-nm filter. Donor and FRET channels were detected on a linear scale, and mTagBFP fluorescence was detected on a logarithmic scale. Sorting was conducted using 4-way purity into 2 tubes and an 85-μm nozzle. At least 200 cells/sgRNA in the sublibrary were collected in each repetition.</p>

<p>First cells were gated by forward (FSC-A) and side scatter (SSC-A), then for single cells using FSC-A/FSC-W and SSC-A/SSC-W. Next, cells were gated based on positive mTagBFP fluorescence, indicating the presence of a CRISPRi sgRNA, followed by gating out of cells with donor or FRET signal from the ATP sensor that overlapped with background (too dim) or exceeded the range of the sorter (too bright). The ratio of FRET/Donor was displayed as a histogram, and the top and bottom 25% of cells on this histogram were separated by FACS and collected for sequencing.</p>

The sgRNAs were amplified, and adaptors were attached in a single PCR step. The amount of 1.1 μg of undigested genomic DNA was used per 50 μL PCR reaction, and sufficient reactions were performed to include all isolated genomic DNA. PCR was conducted using Q5 HotStart High Fidelity Polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) using the following forward primer: aatgatacggcgaccaccgaGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACNNNNNNgcacaaaaggaaactcaccct and reverse primer: caagcagaagacggcatacgaCGACTCGGTGCCACTTTTTC, which includes necessary adaptor and indexing sequences. “N” refers to the variable index sequence. PCR parameters were 98 °C for 30 seconds followed by 26 cycles of 98 °C for 15 seconds, 62.5 °C for 15 seconds, 72 °C for 20 seconds, and ending at 72 °C for 6 minutes. Samples were then ramped down to 4 °C and held. The resulting PCR products from multiple reactions were pooled, and unincorporated primers were removed using the GeneRead Size Selection Kit (Qiagen).

<title>Growth screen</title>
<p>To examine the effect of individual gene knockdown on cell growth, sgRNA from the CRISPRi sublibrary for mitochondria, motility, and trafficking represented in a K562 cell population were compared before and after 7 days of growth. Six million cells were collected before and after 7 days of culture in medium containing different metabolic substrates, maintained at a cell density between 250 k/mL and 1 M/mL. Medium consisted of RPMI-1640 (includes 11 mM glucose) and 50 μg/mL uridine, along with 2.5 mM pyruvate (basal), 20 mM 2DG and 2.5 mM pyruvate (respiratory), or 1 μM oligomycin (glycolytic).

<p>K562 cells transfected with dCas9-KRAB, ATP FRET sensor, and CRISPRi pooled library were cultured with 50 μM CoQ10 or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) vehicle alone for 5 days. The cells were maintained at a cell density between 250 k/mL and 1 M/mL prior to sorting 6-million–cell high- and low-ATP fractions under acute respiratory conditions as described above. Genomic DNA was processed and sequenced for sgRNA quantification as described. Three CoQ10-treated replicates and 2 vehicle-treated replicates were performed. ATP phenotype rescue was calculated as the difference between each CoQ10-treated gene’s ATP phenotype and its average vehicle-treated ATP phenotype. A gene was determined to have strong rescue if it had either a <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 and rescue larger than 1 SD from the average rescue of non-targeting guides, or a <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.1 and a rescue larger than 2 SDs from the average rescue of non-targeting guides.</p>

<title>Mini-library and CoQ10 ATP phenotype rescue</title>
<p>Individual sgRNAs were selected to create a small library that could be screened more rapidly with analysis of fewer cells. From the primary screen, 1 to 3 sgRNAs/gene were selected based on robust decreased ATP phenotype (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004624.s012">S4 Table</xref> for list of sgRNAs and genes). This small library consisted of 161 sgRNAs targeting 68 genes and 20 non-targeting sgRNAs. sgRNAs were cloned by synthesizing 2 oligonucleotides with complementary sequences per sgRNA with necessary overhangs, annealing the oligonucleotides, and individually ligating into the sgRNA lentiviral backbone plasmid as used by Gilbert and colleagues (2014). Sequences were checked by Sanger sequencing of individual clones. DNA from individual sgRNAs was then pooled in approximately equal amounts, and the presence of all sgRNAs was confirmed by deep sequencing of the pooled plasmids after PCR amplification of the sgRNA regions. Lentivirus was created, and cells were selected for integration of the sgRNA-bearing sequence as in the primary screen.</p>
<p>To identify genetic causes of mitochondrial dysfunction responsive to bioenergetic therapy, K562 cells containing 1 sgRNA from the above small library were screened as in the primary screen in respiration-only substrates after they were grown in culture media containing either no supplement or 50 μM CoQ10 for at least 72 hours. The cells were maintained at a cell density between 250 k/mL and 1 M/mL and then sorted by flow cytometry into high- and low-ATP fractions of 1 million cells each under acute treatment of respiration-only substrate. Genomic DNA was processed and sequenced for sgRNA quantification as described.

(C) FRET/Donor ratio (x-axis) of the CFP-Venus ATP FRET sensor as a function of the acceptor fluorescence (y-axis), used as a surrogate for sensor expression level. The FRET/Donor ratio depends heavily on the sensor concentration, especially at lower expression levels.

(E) FRET versus donor fluorescence of the Clover-mApple ATP FRET sensor (red), and the corresponding Clover-mApple Dead sensor (orange), were analyzed by flow cytometry. Approximately 3,400 cells per group; experiment repeated twice with similar results. (F) Cells expressing the Clover-mApple ATP FRET sensor (red, untreated) were treated with 5 μM oligomycin and 10 mM 2DG for 30 minutes (purple) to block ATP synthesis prior to flow cytometry.

The abundance of each sgRNA in the high- and low-FRET fractions was determined by deep sequencing, and the relative enrichment of each sgRNA in the high- versus low-ATP fraction was determined. The graph shows the fold-enrichment of individual genes in the high- versus low-ATP quartiles of FRET (y-axis), with each point representing the mean enrichment of the 3 sgRNAs with the largest fold-enrichment magnitudes, in basal conditions without metabolic inhibition.

This growth screen was performed in duplicate, and the growth phenotype of each gene knockdown was plotted here against its respective average ATP phenotype for each metabolic condition in each replicate. The compilation of these runs under respiratory conditions (panel A and D) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, while the compilation under glycolytic conditions (panel C and F) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g007">Fig 7D</xref>. (A) In the first replicate, under respiratory conditions, when GROWTH<sub>resp</sub> was compared to ATP<sub>resp</sub>, MRP (purple squares) and MPI (orange diamonds) genes had strong positive slopes (0.323 ± 0.125 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.0096] and 0.599 ± 0.157 [p = 0.0008], respectively, by F-test), and CRP genes (green triangles) did not (−0.0634 ± 0.0462 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.1740]). (B) In basal conditions, when GROWTH<sub>bas</sub> was compared to ATP<sub>basal</sub>, no subset was different from 0 (MRP slope = −0.0625 ± 0.0519 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.2316]; CRP slope = −0.0113 ± 0.0916 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.902]; and MPI slope = −0.12 ± 0.0908 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.199]). (C) Under glycolytic conditions, when GROWTH<sub>glyc</sub> was compared to ATP<sub>glyc</sub>, MRP had an increased slope (0.163 ± 0.0411 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001]), while MPI and CRP did not (−0.127 ± 0.0745 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.1] and 0.00181 ± 0.0589 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.976], respectively). (D) In the second replicate, under respiratory conditions, when GROWTH<sub>resp</sub> was compared to ATP<sub>resp</sub>, MRP (purple squares) and MPI (orange diamonds) genes had strong positive slopes (0.664 ± 0.092 [<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001] and 0.467 ± 0.238 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.0626], respectively, by F-test), and CRP genes (green triangles) did not (0.013 ± 0.0910 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.8879]). (E) In basal conditions, when GROWTH<sub>bas</sub> was compared to ATP<sub>basal</sub>, no subset was different from 0 (MRP slope = 0.103 ± 0.0531 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.0576]; CRP slope = −0.14 ± 0.0941 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.143]; and MPI slope = 0.136 ± 0.0878 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.135]). (F) Under glycolytic conditions, when GROWTH<sub>glyc</sub> was compared to ATP<sub>glyc</sub>, MRP had a non-0 slope (−0.161 ± 0.056 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.0056]), while MPI and CRP did not (−0.207 ± 0.127 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.118] and −0.0652 ± 0.0958 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.500], respectively).

<title><italic>METTL17</italic> silencing reduces cell proliferation in HCC827 human lung cancer cells.</title>
<p>(A) METTL17 knockdown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004624.g008">Fig 8</xref>. Lentivirus expressing negative-control sgRNA or sgRNA targeting METTL17 was transduced into HCC827 cells expressing dCas9. After growth in 1 ug/mL puromycin for 1 week, total METTL17 protein levels were significantly lower in sgRNA METTL17-expressing cells than negative controls. (B) Cells expressing either negative-control sgRNA or sgRNA targeting <italic>METTL17</italic> were compared by trypan blue viability assay to quantify numbers of cells growing 48 hours after plating identical numbers of cells. <italic>METTL17</italic> silencing is associated with significantly reduced cell proliferation compared with non-targeting control. A total of 20 mM 2DG exposure for 24 hours significantly and similarly reduced numbers of both control and <italic>METTL17</italic>-silenced HCC827 cells (mean +/− SEM shown; <italic>t</italic> test, **<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001; ***<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.0001). (C) Unsynchronized cells stained with PI 24 hours after exposure to control media or media with 10 or 20 mM 2DG. Cells were analyzed by FACS, and G1 and G2 fractions were quantified. Exposure to 2DG caused an increase in the G1 fraction for both sgRNA negative controls but not <italic>METTL17</italic>. Data show mean ± SEM; <italic>n</italic> = 4 samples/group; 10,000 sorted per group. ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 versus control by two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test. (D) Unsynchronized cells stained with Annexin V-FITC 24 hours after exposure to control media or media with 20 mM 2DG. Cells treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 minutes were included as a positive control for death induction. Cells were analyzed by FACS and percentage of FITC-positive cells were quantified. Data show mean ± SEM.
