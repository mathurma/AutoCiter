      <abstract>
        <p>Phenotypic transitions play critical roles in host adaptation, virulence, and sexual reproduction in pathogenic fungi. A minority of natural isolates of <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which are homozygous at the mating type locus (<italic>MTL</italic>, <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> or α/α), are known to be able to switch between two distinct cell types: white and opaque. It is puzzling that white-opaque switching has never been observed in the majority of natural <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains that have heterozygous <italic>MTL</italic> genotypes (<bold>a</bold>/α), given that they contain all of the opaque-specific genes essential for switching. Here we report the discovery of white-opaque switching in a number of natural <bold>a</bold>/α strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> under a condition mimicking aspects of the host environment. The optimal condition for white-to-opaque switching in <bold>a</bold>/α strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is to use N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as the sole carbon source and to incubate the cells in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Although the induction of white-to-opaque switching in <bold>a</bold>/α strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is not as robust as in <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes in response to GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub>, opaque cells of <bold>a</bold>/α strains exhibit similar features of cellular and colony morphology to their <italic>MTL</italic> homozygous counterparts. Like <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes, white and opaque cells of <bold>a</bold>/α strains differ in their behavior in different mouse infection models. We have further demonstrated that the transcriptional regulators Rfg1, Brg1, and Efg1 are involved in the regulation of white-to-opaque switching in <bold>a</bold>/α strains. We propose that the integration of multiple environmental cues and the activation and inactivation of a set of transcriptional regulators controls the expression of the master switching regulator <italic>WOR1</italic>, which determines the final fate of the cell type in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Our discovery of white-opaque switching in the majority of natural <bold>a</bold>/α strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> emphasizes its widespread nature and importance in host adaptation, pathogenesis, and parasexual reproduction.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Phenotypic transitions enable fungal pathogens to better adapt to their ever-changing environments. Approximately 10% of natural <italic>Candida albicans</italic> strains, which are homozygous at the mating type locus (<italic>MTL</italic>, <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> and α/α), can switch between two distinguishable morphological forms: white and opaque. The two cell types differ in a number of biological aspects including virulence, susceptibility to host immune attacks, and mating competency. Here, we demonstrate that white-opaque switching competency is not restricted to the <italic>MTL</italic> homozygous strains, but is a general characteristic of all <italic>MTL</italic> strain types of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold>, α/α, and <bold>a</bold>/α). Two host environmental cues, N-acetylglucosamine and CO<sub>2</sub>, promote white-to-opaque switching and stabilize the opaque phenotype. Thus, although switching is normally blocked in <bold>a</bold>/α cells, this block can be overcome through specific environmental changes. We further show that three transcriptional regulators (Rfg1, Brg1, and Efg1) help to regulate white-opaque switching in <italic>MTL</italic> heterozygotes of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. This study generalizes white-opaque switching to strains with all mating-type configurations and emphasizes its importance in host adaptation, pathogenesis, and parasexual reproduction.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Phenotypic plasticity is critical for microorganisms to survive under fluctuating environments. For fungal pathogens, phenotypic switching is a common strategy to rapidly adapt to different host niches and facilitate colonization and infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Jain1">[1]</xref>. A specific phenotype can also confer the fungus a growth advantage over competing microorganisms in a specific environment or host niche. <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, the major causative agent of fungal infections in humans, can switch between two different visible cell types: white and opaque <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Slutsky1">[2]</xref>. The two cell types differ in a number of biological aspects including morphology, virulence, and mating competence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Lohse1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang1">[5]</xref>. White cells are small and round and form “white,” dome-shaped colonies on solid media, while opaque cells are large and elongated and form darker and flatter colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Anderson1">[6]</xref>. White cells are more virulent than opaque cells in systemic infections, whereas opaque cells appear more suited to cutaneous colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Kvaal1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Kvaal2">[8]</xref>. Opaque cells possess pimples on the cell wall and exhibit unique antigenicity, which may help the pathogen in evading the host immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Lohse1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, opaque cells are significantly less susceptible to phagocytosis by cells of the fly and mouse innate immune systems than white cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Lohse2">[9]</xref>. Perhaps the best studied feature of opaque cells is their mating competency. Opaque cells mate ∼10<sup>6</sup> times more efficiently than white cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Miller1">[10]</xref>. It has recently been shown that <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic>, another important human fungal pathogen, can also undergo white-opaque switching and parasexual mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Porman1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Xie1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite the importance of white-opaque switching in host adaptation, pathogenesis, and parasexual reproduction in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, only a minority (&lt;10%) of natural strains have been reported to undergo white-opaque switching in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Lockhart1">[13]</xref>. It has been shown that the mating-type locus homeodomain proteins (MTL<bold>a</bold>1/α2) inhibit white-opaque switching via controlling the expression of the master regulator <italic>WOR1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Zordan1">[16]</xref>. Consistent with this, the minority of natural isolates capable of white-opaque switching in vitro are homozygous at the <italic>MTL</italic> locus; this relieves the block of the mating locus proteins. The majority (&gt;90%) of <italic>C. albicans MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α isolates in nature were thought to be incapable of white-opaque switching unless they underwent homozygosis of the mating type locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Lockhart1">[13]</xref>. These ideas raised a fundamental question. Given the importance of white-opaque switching in host adaptation and pathogenesis, why do the majority of <bold>a</bold>/α natural isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic> not undergo white-opaque switching unless they undergo a genetic rearrangement?</p>
      <p>In this study, we provide reasonable answers to this basic question. We show that naturally occurring <bold>a</bold>/α isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic> can indeed undergo white-opaque switching under a specialized set of environmental conditions. Previous studies typically used glucose as the sole carbon source and grew cells in ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. We show here that <bold>a</bold>/α strains can undergo white-opaque switching in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> when N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is used as the sole carbon source. GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub>, primarily produced by bacterial commensals, are abundant in the gut and have synergistic effects on the induction of the opaque cell phenotype in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang3">[17]</xref>. Therefore, this culture condition likely mimics certain aspects of host niches, such as those in the gut. Opaque cells of <bold>a</bold>/α strains exhibit similar phenotypes of typical <italic>MTL</italic> homozygous opaque cells, except they lack the ability to mate. Further experiments demonstrate that three transcription factors Rfg1, Brg1, and Efg1 are involved in the regulation of white-opaque switching in <bold>a</bold>/α <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains. This study indicates that there is an alternative gene circuit, which can bypass the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 block to switching, and promote white-opaque switching in <italic>C. albicans</italic> under certain environmental conditions that are reminiscent of niches of the host. We propose that white-opaque switching is not limited to the minority of <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes, but rather is a general characteristic of natural <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains.</p>

        <title>Demonstration of White-Opaque Switching in Natural <italic>MTL</italic>a/α Strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic></title>
        <p>There are three <italic>MTL</italic> types of natural <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates (<bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold>, α/α, and <bold>a</bold>/α). Under normal conditions, <italic>MTL</italic> heterozygotes (<bold>a</bold>/α) are blocked for switching and “locked” in the white phase in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Miller1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Lockhart1">[13]</xref>. Since <bold>a</bold>/α strains are more competitive than their <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> or α/α derivatives (at least in some in vivo assays) and carry the entire set of opaque-specific genes essential for switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Lockhart2">[18]</xref>, we suspected that the <bold>a</bold>/α isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic> could also undergo white-opaque switching in their natural niches. We also reasoned that routine laboratory media and culture conditions were totally different from conditions in natural niches and might not be conducive for the transition in <bold>a</bold>/α strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. To test our hypothesis, we took advantage of the synergistic effects of two host environmental cues, GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub>, on the induction of the opaque cell phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang3">[17]</xref>. We grew 94 natural isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic> on Lee's GlcNAc medium in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. We found that 34 strains (36%) formed opaque colonies under this condition. We then examined the <italic>MTL</italic> genotype of all 94 tested strains. Of them, 92 were <bold>a</bold>/α, one was <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold>, and one was α/α. The two <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes (one <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> and one α/α) were identified as switching to opaque, along with the 32 <bold>a</bold>/α strains in the switchable strain list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001525.s005">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>An example of an <bold>a</bold>/α clinical strain that could undergo white-opaque switching (SZ306) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g001">Figure 1</xref>. We noticed that SZ306 could also form opaque colonies on rich medium (YPD) when cultured for an extended time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g001">Figure 1A</xref>); some other <bold>a</bold>/α strains also exhibited this behavior. The white and opaque cells of <bold>a</bold>/α strains were similar to their counterparts of <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes in the size and shape of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g001">Figure 1B</xref>): white cells of <bold>a</bold>/α strains were small and round with no pimples on their cell wall surface, while opaque cells were elongated and possessed obvious opaque-specific pimples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that two opaque-enriched genes, <italic>OP4</italic> and the master regulator <italic>WOR1</italic>, were expressed in opaque cells of <bold>a</bold>/α strains but not in white cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Conversely, the expression levels of the white-enriched genes <italic>WH11</italic>, <italic>EFG1</italic>, and <italic>RFG1</italic> were significantly higher in white cells than in opaque cells of <bold>a</bold>/α strains.

        <title>Opaque Cells of <italic>C. albicans MTL</italic>a/α Strains Are Mating-Incompetent</title>
        <p>White-opaque switching and mating are two coupled biological processes that are both controlled by the MTL<bold>a1</bold>/α2 complex in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Miller1">[10]</xref>. One possibility that could explain how <bold>a</bold>/α isolates could undergo white-opaque switching is that the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex might not function properly; thus, cells could behave as though they were <bold>a</bold> or α cells. Although our DNA sequencing analysis showed that the <italic>MTL</italic> locus of the switchable <bold>a</bold>/α isolates were normal and with no obvious defects, the expression of <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>1 or <italic>MTL</italic>α2 could, in principle, be defective. To exclude this possibility, we performed a mating experiment with opaque cells from three independent <bold>a</bold>/α strains. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, these cells showed no mating response, whereas <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> and α/α opaque cell controls mated normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g002">Figure 2Ba, b, c, e, f, and g</xref>). Quantitative mating assay demonstrated that the mating efficiencies of the <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α x <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold> or α cells crosses were undetectable (&lt;1×10<sup>−7</sup>). The mating efficiency of the <italic>MTL</italic> <bold>a</bold>/Δ x α/α cross-control was (2.3±0.8)×10<sup>−2</sup>, at least 1×10<sup>5</sup> times higher than that of the <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These results demonstrate that <bold>a</bold>/α opaque cells cannot mate with either <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> or α/α opaque cells, suggesting that the white-opaque switchable <bold>a</bold>/α strains are mating-incompetent. However, once the opaque cells of these <bold>a</bold>/α strains were converted to <bold>a</bold>/Δ or Δ/α strains by deletion of one allele of the <italic>MTL</italic> locus, they acquired mating competence and mated as efficiently as the WT <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> or α/α controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g002">Figure 2Ah</xref>). We conclude from these experiments that the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex is functional in the regulation of mating, and that the white-opaque switching in these strains is not due to the inactivation of <bold>a</bold>1 or α2 proteins.</p>

        <title>Induction of White-to-Opaque Switching by GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> in <italic>C. albicans MTL</italic>a/α Strains</title>
        <p>As described in the introduction, GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> are two potent inducers of white-to-opaque switching and are believed to be characteristic of host niches such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang3">[17]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g003">Figure 3</xref>, the frequencies of white-to-opaque switching in the <bold>a</bold>/α strain SZ306 was extremely low on Lee's glucose (&lt;0.6%) or GlcNAc (0.5%) medium in ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> alone also had little effect on the induction of opaque phenotype on Lee's glucose medium in this <bold>a</bold>/α strain (switching frequency&lt;0.4%). However, the switching frequency of white-to-opaque in SZ306 was increased to 7.5±3.1% when cultured on Lee's GlcNAc medium in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> had a synergistic effect on the induction of the opaque cell phenotype. To compare the switching features of <bold>a</bold>/α strains and <italic>MTL</italic> homozygous “<bold>a</bold>” or “α” strains, we converted SZ306 (<bold>a</bold>/α) to an <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/Δ strain, namely SZ306a, and RVVC10 (<bold>a</bold>/α) to an <italic>MTL</italic>Δ/α strain, namely RVVC10α, by deletion of one allele of the <italic>MTL</italic> locus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g003">Figure 3</xref>, although the frequency of white-to-opaque switching in SZ306a was only 0.4% on Lee's glucose medium in ambient CO<sub>2</sub>, GlcNAc, or 5% CO<sub>2</sub> alone increased the switching frequencies to 3.0±2.7% and 34.4±0.9%, respectively. Notably, SZ306a underwent a mass conversion (switching frequency = 100%) on Lee's GlcNAc medium in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, consistent with our previous study of the synergistic effect of GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> on white-to-opaque switching in <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang3">[17]</xref>. As in SZ306 and SZ306a, GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> had a similar effect on the induction of the opaque cell phenotype in RVVC10 and its derivative, RVVC10α (unpublished data). These results indicate that <bold>a</bold>/α strains are less sensitive than their “<bold>a</bold>/Δ” or “Δ/α” derivatives to GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub>, but that white-to-opaque switching is stimulated by GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> in all three <italic>MTL</italic> configurations.</p>

The switching frequencies were 38.6±7.7, 34.6±5.3, and 18.7±7.1 on Lee's GlcNAc medium in ambient CO<sub>2</sub>, on Lee's glucose in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and on Lee's GlcNAc in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001525.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001525.s007">Table S3</xref>).

For the “<bold>a</bold>/Δ” and “Δ/α” strains, SZ306a and RVVC10α, the opaque phenotype was very stable on both Lee's glucose and GlcNAc, irrespective of whether the cells were cultured in air or 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Under the four conditions tested (Lee's glucose in air, Lee's GlcNAc in air, Lee's glucose in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and Lee's GlcNAc in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), the opaque-to-white switching frequencies of SZ306a and RVVC10α were all less than 1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001525.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001525.s007">Table S3</xref>). We sequenced the <italic>WOR1</italic> promoter of several switchable <bold>a</bold>/α strains and found what is believed to be the major <bold>a</bold>1/α2 cis-regulatory sequence site was intact. These results indicate that although the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex does not provide an absolute block to white-to-opaque switching in these <bold>a</bold>/α strains, it reduces switching to favor white cells, likely by turning down (but not off) the expression of <italic>WOR1</italic>.</p>

To test whether opaque cells of <bold>a</bold>/α strains were better at cutaneous infections, newborn mice were used and the fungal colonization of the skin was assessed by scanning electron microscopy as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Kvaal2">[8]</xref>. Compared to white cells, opaque cells of both SZ306 and the reference strain WO-1 showed increased colonization in a cutaneous mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The number of opaque cells that colonized the skin was significantly higher than that of white cells (Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> value&lt;0.002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

        <title>Global Transcriptional Profiles of White and Opaque Cells of the <italic>MTL</italic>a/α Strain CY110</title>
        <p>To characterize the genome-wide transcriptional profiles of white and opaque cells of the <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strains, we performed RNA-Seq analysis of CY110, a clinical isolate of <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α genotype. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001525.s008">Table S4</xref> (Sheet 1), the expression levels of 1,631 genes demonstrated a greater than twofold change in white and opaque cells. As expected, previously characterized white cell–enriched genes, such as <italic>WH11</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic>, were up-regulated in white cells, while opaque cell–enriched genes, such as <italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>OP4</italic>, were strongly up-regulated in opaque cells. A total of 838 genes demonstrated a greater than 3-fold change in our RNA-Seq analysis. Of them, 459 were previously reported as white (205) or opaque (254) cell–enriched genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Lan1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Tuch1">[21]</xref>, and 379 were only found in our analysis, which could be <italic>MTL</italic> genotype-dependent phase-specific genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001525-t001">Table 1</xref>, of the highly differentially expressed genes, the ratio of potential <italic>MTL</italic> genotype-dependent genes remarkably decreased, suggesting that highly differentially expressed genes are less <italic>MTL</italic> genotype-dependent.

Fermentative metabolism–associated genes were highly expressed in white cells of CY110 (e.g., glucose transporter genes <italic>HGT6</italic>, <italic>HGT7</italic>, and <italic>HGT8</italic>), while oxidative metabolism–associated genes were highly expressed in opaque cells (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase <italic>IDP2</italic>, malate synthase <italic>MLS1</italic>, acyl-CoA oxidase <italic>POX1</italic>, and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase genes <italic>FOX2</italic> and <italic>FOX3</italic>).

        <title>Wor1, Rfg1, Brg1, and Efg1 Are Involved in the Regulation of White-Opaque Switching in <italic>C. albicans MTL</italic>a/α Strains</title>
        <p><italic>WOR1</italic> is the master regulator of white-opaque switching in <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and is extensively up-regulated in opaque cells of both <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes and heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001525.s008">Table S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Zordan1">[16]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>WOR1</italic> in an <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strain SZ306u, a derivative of SZ306, blocked white to opaque switching on all media tested including Lee's GlcNAc medium in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (switching frequency&lt;0.03%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001525.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Under this culture condition, the white-to-opaque switching frequency of the wild-type SZ306u (<italic>WOR1/WOR1</italic>) and the single copy mutant (<italic>WOR1/wor1</italic>) were 4.3±1.0% and 0.5±0.3%, respectively, suggesting that the copy number of <italic>WOR1</italic> could affect its own expression and the white-to-opaque switching frequency. Therefore, Wor1 is also essential for the induction of opaque phenotype in <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strains.</p>
        <p>The <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex inhibits the expression of <italic>WOR1</italic> and thus controls white-to-opaque switching in SC5314 background strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Zordan1">[16]</xref>. The promoter region of <italic>WOR1</italic> is extremely long (&gt;10 kb), indicating the regulation of <italic>WOR1</italic> expression could be very complex. Two facts imply that the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex does not work alone to control the expression of <italic>WOR1</italic>. First, even in the <italic>MTL</italic> homozygous strains (that therefore lack the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex), the default cell type is the white form, at least in typical laboratory media, indicating some other regulators must repress the expression of <italic>WOR1</italic>. Second, there appears to be only a single binding site of the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex on the long promoter region of <italic>WOR1</italic>. To find the regulators coordinately working with the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex in repressing <italic>WOR1</italic> expression, we screened a library of ∼160 transcription factor null mutants (of the <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α genotype) of SC5314 background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Du1">[22]</xref>. The library was suitable for the screening because SC5314 and its derivatives (<bold>a</bold>/α) used for making the mutants are nonswitchable on the Lee's GlcNAc medium. We predicted that inactivating the transcription factors involved in inhibiting <italic>WOR1</italic> expression would lead to the opaque phenotype. And we found three <bold>a</bold>/α mutants (<italic>rfg1/rfg1</italic>, <italic>brg1/brg1</italic>, and <italic>efg1/efg1</italic>) could undergo white-to-opaque switching on the Lee's GlcNAc medium in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 25°C, suggesting the transcription factors Rfg1, Brg1, and Efg1 are involved in the regulation of white-opaque transition in <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. PCR analysis was conducted to confirm that the <italic>MTL</italic> genotype of the <italic>rfg1/rfg1</italic>, <italic>brg1/brg1</italic>, and <italic>efg1/efg1</italic>mutants were <bold>a</bold>/α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Rfg1 is a member of the HMG domain family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that has been shown to be a regulator of filamentous growth and virulence in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Khalaf1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Kadosh1">[24]</xref>. We observed that the <italic>rfg1/rfg1</italic> mutant (<bold>a</bold>/α) could also form opaque colonies or sectors in Lee's glucose and YPD media when cultured at 25°C for an extended time period (unpublished data). Consistent with the phenotype of <italic>rfg1/rfg1</italic> mutant in white-opaque switching, Northern blots showed that the expression of <italic>RFG1</italic> was enriched in white cells, relative to opaque cells in <italic>C. albicans MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>For decades, white-opaque switching was observed in only a minority (&lt;10%) of natural <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates: those that were homozygous at the mating-type locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Slutsky1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Soll1">[4]</xref>. How does this species maintain such a complex switching system if the majority of strains (which are <bold>a</bold>/α) do not do it? One possibility is that white-opaque switching in <italic>C. albicans</italic> has been maintained as a means to attain mating competency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Miller1">[10]</xref>. However, <italic>C. albicans</italic> populations in the host are primarily clonal, indicating that, if parasexual mating actually occurs in nature, its role may not be to generate genetic diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Graser1">[28]</xref>. In this study, we have generated evidence for a different explanation for the widespread maintenance of white-opaque switching in <italic>C. albicans</italic> clinical isolates. We show that many naturally occurring <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> can indeed undergo white-opaque switching, with the opaque phenotype of <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> being largely similar to that of <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes, except that they do not mate. Although such switching of <bold>a</bold>/α strains does not readily occur under typical laboratory conditions, we show that the combination of GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> are strong inducers of switching in <bold>a</bold>/α strains. Importantly, some <bold>a</bold>/α strains can undergo white-to-opaque switching at 37°C, the physiological temperature of the human host. These conditions are believed to be present in host niches such as the gut, where glucose is limiting and the carbon sources are largely from GI mucus and cell debris of microbes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Chang1">[29]</xref>. Together with our recent discovery of white-opaque switching in <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α heterozygotes of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Xie1">[12]</xref>, our findings thus generalize white-opaque switching to strains with all mating-type configurations and suggest that the ability to switch is conserved in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>.</p>
      <p>We have shown that opaque cells of <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic> share many features with opaque cells of <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes. However, there are some important differences. For example, opaque cells of <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α isolates undergo mass conversion to white cells on glucose containing media, while opaque cells of <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes are very stable. Thus, <bold>a</bold>/α opaque cells are not as stable as opaque <bold>a</bold> or α cells and require the continuous presence of the environmental signals. Secondly, opaque cells of <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α isolates are mating-incompetent.</p>
      <p>The MTL<bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex inhibits the expression of the master regulator <italic>WOR1</italic>, thereby blocking white-opaque switching in the laboratory strain SC5314 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Zordan1">[16]</xref>, which is an <bold>a</bold>/α strain. However, in the <bold>a</bold>/α strains described here, white-opaque switching is permitted; the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex “turns it down” but does not completely block white-opaque switching. The long upstream region of <italic>WOR1</italic> implies that multiple environmental signals and transcriptional regulators feed into it, and thus it is easy to imagine that strains could vary in the precise response of Wor1 to environmental signals. We have demonstrated that more than one third of natural isolates of <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains tested in this study formed opaque or opaque-sectored colonies on Lee's GlcNAc plates in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. We propose that the white-opaque phenotypic transition itself is a general feature of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, but the quantitative response of the switch to features of the environment and to the mating type configuration differs from strain to strain.</p>
      <p>The regulation of white-opaque switching in <italic>MTL</italic> homozygotes involves an interlocking transcriptional circuit, in which Wor1 occupies the central position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Zordan2">[27]</xref>. We propose that Wor1 also acts as a master regulator in the process of white-opaque switching in <italic>MTL</italic> heterozygotes of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Ectopic expression of <italic>WOR1</italic> in the “non-switchable” <italic>MTL</italic> <bold>a</bold>/α strain CAI4, a derivative of SC5314, induces white-to-opaque switching on glucose-containing laboratory media, suggesting that Wor1, if ectopically expressed, can override the repressing effect of the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex on the white-to-opaque transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Huang2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Zordan1">[16]</xref>. By screening a deletion mutant library of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we have identified three transcription factors, Rfg1, Brg1, and Efg1, involved in the regulation of white-opaque switching in <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strains. These three transcription factors inhibit opaque cell formation in <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strains since their null mutants are capable of switching between white and opaque cell types. Consistent with the phenotype of their null mutants, the transcriptional expression of <italic>RFG1</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic> was enriched in white cells of <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Nobile et al. have recently demonstrated that Brg1 and Efg1 bind to nearly the entire 10 kb intergenic region between <italic>WOR1</italic> and its adjacent divergent gene <italic>ORF19.4883</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Nobile1">[25]</xref>. However, the location of the peaks of Brg1 and Efg1 binding were distant from the putative <bold>a</bold>1/α2 cis-regulatory sequence. These results not only provide direct evidence of Brg1 and Efg1 binding to the promoter of <italic>WOR1</italic>, but also indicate that they may work together with the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 complex to reduce the expression of Wor1 in white cells and prevent switching to opaque cells. The transcriptional repressor Rfg1 may work in a similar manner as Efg1 and Brg1. We propose that inactivation of any of these three regulators would lead to increased expression of <italic>WOR1</italic>, which then initiates a self-positive feedback loop to induce the opaque cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Together with Wor1, additional transcriptional regulators, such as the positive regulators Wor2 and Czf1, coordinately regulate the expression of <italic>WOR1</italic> by binding directly to the <italic>WOR1</italic> upstream intergenic region (A.D.H., C.J.N., and A.D.J. unpublished data), and maintain the cells in the opaque phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Consistent with the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001525-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, deletion of <italic>WOR2</italic> or <italic>CZF1</italic> results in increased opaque-to-white switching frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Zordan2">[27]</xref>.</p>

      <p>In summary, we have shown that, in many naturally occurring <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains, the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 repressor is not an absolute block to white-opaque switching as it is in the standard laboratory strain SC5314. Rather, the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 activity reduces switching frequency (and renders the opaque form less stable) in these newly described strains, but this reduction can be partially overcome by the addition of GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> to the growth medium. We propose that the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 repressor and other regulators (including Efg1, Brg1, and Rfg1) as well as these environmental signals all impinge on the long regulatory region of Wor1, the master regulator of white-opaque switching. This information is somehow integrated by the Wor1 regulatory region, and the level of Wor1 transcription is set accordingly. Because Wor1 appears to be the major determinant of the white-opaque switch frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Lohse3">[30]</xref>, the model can account for nearly all the observations in this article.</p>
      <p>The most important implication of the work is that all strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (not just strains that are homozygous at the mating type locus, as previously believed) can undergo white-opaque switching if the appropriate signals are present in the growth medium. Thus, we propose that multiple environmental inputs combined with internal transcriptional regulators can activate white-opaque switching in virtually all <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains. White-opaque switching, in essence, produces two radically different types of cells from the same genome, thereby explaining the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to occupy different niches in the host. We believe that the discovery of white-opaque switching in naturally occurring <bold>a</bold>/α strains accounts for the widespread conservation of the white-opaque switching machinery.</p>

        <p>The plasmid pSFS2A-URA3 was generated by inserting two DNA fragments containing sequences homologous to the 5′- and 3-terminals of <italic>C. albicans URA3</italic> gene into the <italic>Apa</italic>I/<italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Sac</italic>II/<italic>Sac</italic>I sites of pSFS2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Reuss1">[31]</xref>. The auxotrophic strain SZ306u for uridine was constructed by disruption of one copy of <italic>URA3</italic> with the linearized plasmid pSFS2A-URA3 and then grown on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) containing medium. The white-opaque switching-competence of SZ306u was then confirmed. SZ306 and RVVC10 were converted to SZ306a and RVVC10α by deletion of one <italic>MTL</italic> allele with the plasmid T2A-MTL (Srikantha and Soll, unpublished).

The second copy of <italic>WOR1</italic> was then deleted with the linearized plasmid T2A-WOR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001525-Yi1">[33]</xref>.

Briefly, the microsatellite locus CAI was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers (forward, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- ATG CCA TTG AGT GGA ATT GG -3′</named-content>; reverse, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- AGT GGC TTG TGT TGG GTT TT -3′</named-content>). The forward primer was 5′ fluorescently labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein. The sizes of the amplicons were determined by GeneScan analysis using a DNA sequencer, and the number of trinucleotide repeat units in each fragment was calculated. Because of the diploid nature of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the CAI genotype of a strain is determined by the repeat number in both alleles of the locus. For example, a strain with a genotype CAI 17–21 means that one allele of the locus contains 17 trinucleotide repeats and the other 21.</p>
