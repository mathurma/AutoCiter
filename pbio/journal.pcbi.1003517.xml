<abstract>
<p>The continuously prolonged human lifespan is accompanied by increase in neurodegenerative diseases incidence, calling for the development of inexpensive blood-based diagnostics. Analyzing blood cell transcripts by RNA-Seq is a robust means to identify novel biomarkers that rapidly becomes a commonplace. However, there is lack of tools to discover novel exons, junctions and splicing events and to precisely and sensitively assess differential splicing through RNA-Seq data analysis and across RNA-Seq platforms. Here, we present a new and comprehensive computational workflow for whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq analysis, using an updated version of the software AltAnalyze, to identify both known and novel high-confidence alternative splicing events, and to integrate them with both protein-domains and microRNA binding annotations. We applied the novel workflow on RNA-Seq data from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients' leukocytes pre- and post- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment and compared to healthy controls. Disease-mediated changes included decreased usage of alternative promoters and N-termini, 5′-end variations and mutually-exclusive exons. The PD regulated FUS and HNRNP A/B included prion-like domains regulated regions. We also present here a workflow to identify and analyze long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) via RNA-Seq data. We identified reduced lncRNA expression and selective PD-induced changes in 13 of over 6,000 detected leukocyte lncRNAs, four of which were inversely altered post-DBS. These included the U1 spliceosomal lncRNA and RP11-462G22.1, each entailing sequence complementarity to numerous microRNAs. Analysis of RNA-Seq from PD and unaffected controls brains revealed over 7,000 brain-expressed lncRNAs, of which 3,495 were co-expressed in the leukocytes including U1, which showed both leukocyte and brain increases. Furthermore, qRT-PCR validations confirmed these co-increases in PD leukocytes and two brain regions, the amygdala and substantia-nigra, compared to controls. This novel workflow allows deep multi-level inspection of RNA-Seq datasets and provides a comprehensive new resource for understanding disease transcriptome modifications in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a novel, fascinating class of RNAs with largely unknown biological functions. Parkinson's-disease (PD) is the most frequent motor disorder, and Deep-brain-stimulation (DBS) treatment alleviates the symptoms, but early disease biomarkers are still unknown and new future genetic interference targets are urgently needed. Using RNA-sequencing technology and a novel computational workflow for in-depth exploration of whole-transcriptome RNA-seq datasets, we detected and analyzed lncRNAs in sequenced libraries from PD patients' leukocytes pre and post-treatment and the brain, adding this full profile resource of over 7,000 lncRNAs to the few human tissues-derived lncRNA datasets that are currently available. Our study includes sample-specific database construction, detecting disease-derived changes in known and novel lncRNAs, exons and junctions and predicting corresponding changes in Polyadenylation choices, protein domains and miRNA binding sites. We report widespread transcript structure variations at the splice junction and exons levels, including novel exons and junctions and alteration of lncRNAs followed by experimental validation in PD leukocytes and two PD brain regions compared with controls. Our results suggest lncRNAs involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, and specifically PD. This comprehensive workflow will be of use to the increasing number of laboratories producing RNA-Seq data in a wide range of biomedical studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent studies have identified conspicuous diversity in large intergenic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) found across many species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Gupta1">[1]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Guenzl1">[2]</xref>. LncRNAs are currently defined as transcripts of over 200 nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Wang1">[3]</xref>. Nonetheless, the GENCODE non-coding RNA set, the largest currently lncRNA database, contains currently as much as 136 spliced transcript shorter than 200 bp, and the general and structural annotation of lncRNA overall is still ongoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Harrow1">[4]</xref>. LncRNAs may contain open reading frames (ORF), and are often transcribed by RNA polymerase II, spliced and polyadenylated – but do not code for any protein product. LncRNAs are the least well studied among thousands non-coding eukaryotic RNAs that have been discovered so far. While genome-wide expression and evolutionary analyses suggest that some of them play functional roles, their cellular mechanisms of action are still largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Guttman1">[5]</xref>. Nonetheless, accumulating evidence suggests that in the nervous system, lncRNA functions span regulating brain evolution and neural development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Qureshi1">[6]</xref> and mediate behavioral and cognitive processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Cao1">[7]</xref>. In Drosophila, the neuronal-expressed CRG lncRNA is involved in regulating locomotion by recruiting RNA polymerase II to the adjacent promoter of the movement-related protein-coding gene CASK, thereby increasing CASK expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Li1">[8]</xref>. In humans, lncRNAs are involved in neurogenesis, neuropsychiatric disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Lin1">[9]</xref>, cancer (for example, HT19 which is involved in tumor growth) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Matouk1">[10]</xref>) and in Autism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Ziats1">[11]</xref> as well as in the neurodegenerative Huntington's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Johnson1">[12]</xref> and Alzheimer's (AD) diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Holden1">[13]</xref>. However, the involvement of lncRNAs in the leading neurodegenerative motor disorder worldwide, Parkinson's disease (PD), is still unknown.</p>
<p>PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide (after AD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Nussbaum1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Dorsey1">[15]</xref>, with age being the leading risk factor currently known and no known cure. It affects 1–2% of the population above 65 years of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Allain1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-BenmoyalSegal1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Douglas1">[18]</xref> and is characterized by four cardinal motor symptoms (resting tremor, bradykinesia (“slow movement”), postural instability and akinesia (“lack of movement”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Hoehn1">[19]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Fahn1">[20]</xref>. These appear when most of the brain's dopamine-producing neurons have already been diminished. Most cases are defined as ‘sporadic’ and treatment is aimed at replacing lost DA through adjusting the declining levels of the precursor L-Dopa. The alternative, deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment allows a significant reduction in the medication dosage while drastically improving motor function in patients. DBS presumably alleviates the disease symptoms by targeting the basal ganglia Sub-Thalamic Nucleus (STN) brain region through yet undefined mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Kringelbach1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>While the underlying aetiology of sporadic PD remained elusive, genomics studies have implicated several genes in the loss of DA neurons. Mutations in α-synuclein (SNCA), the first gene identified as linked to PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Polymeropoulos1">[22]</xref>, cause early-onset PD, and the SNCA protein product has been identified as a major component of Lewy bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Baba1">[23]</xref>, a morphological pathological hallmark of PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Gibb1">[24]</xref>. Mutations in the ubiquitin ligase Parkin (PARK2) that targets proteins for degradation in the proteasome through linkage of ubiquitin molecules cause DA neuron pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Um1">[25]</xref> and autosomal recessive Parkinsonism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Kitada1">[26]</xref>. The DJ-1 (PARK7) protein regulates oxidation–reduction signalling pathways via inducing gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Mullett1">[27]</xref>, inhibiting the formation of SNCA aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Shendelman1">[28]</xref> and limiting dopaminergic cell death in cellular and animal PD models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Guzman1">[29]</xref>. Mutations in the putative serine threonine kinase LRRK2 (PARK8) cause uncoupling of mitochondria in fibroblast and neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Cooper1">[30]</xref>; and the PTEN-induced protein kinase PINK1 (PARK6), mutations in which cause early-onset PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Hatano1">[31]</xref> is believed to be involved in mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Grenier1">[32]</xref>. Taken together, these observations suggest that inherited, and possibly acquired impairments in the pathways regulating protein metabolism, oxidative stress and mitochondrial functioning are causally involved in PD emergence. Yet, current medications only improve the disease motor symptoms – but do not provide a cure. Furthermore, identification of the disease in its early stages, before the majority of the dopaminergic neuron population have diminished, is currently impossible.</p>
<p>Transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood is of great interest for clinical research, as differences between samples obtained in a minimally invasive and cost-effective manner can be translated into gene signatures of disease, as well as disease stage, drug response and toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Cao1">[7]</xref>. Blood cells interact with most tissues and organs in the human body and their cellular composition provides a reflection of both physiological and pathogenic stimuli, including brain treatment effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq1">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, 80% of the genes expressed in peripheral blood cells are shared with other central tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Johnson1">[12]</xref>. While nucleated white blood cells make up the minority of blood cells, they are the most informative. Correspondingly, gene expression differences in peripheral whole blood have been used to determine gene signatures related to both acute myeloid leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Li1">[8]</xref> and neuropsychiatric disorders and Huntington's disease, where significant correlation between blood and brain transcripts was identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Lin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Matouk1">[10]</xref>. Other neurological diseases for which peripheral blood-based biomarkers have been identified include multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Nickles1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Harris1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-FehlbaumBeurdeley1">[36]</xref>. These effects have been specifically attributed to neuronal death, neuronal cell-free RNA expression and well-described neuro-immune modulatory effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Nickles1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Harris1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-FehlbaumBeurdeley1">[36]</xref>. Likewise, we have recently observed parallel changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes predicted as their targets that further underwent splicing changes in PD leukocytes and in PD-relevant brain regions, including the substantia nigra (SN) as well as the frontal lobe) through coupled analysis of small RNA-Seq data and splice junction arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq2">[37]</xref>. These spanned immune, mitochondrial and oxidative stress changes, supporting our microarray identification of interleukin-4 (IL4) related processes in whole blood data from a large early PD cohort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq3">[38]</xref>. Since the first report of miRNA involvement in PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim1">[39]</xref>, new findings provide ample evidence for involvement of differentially expressed miRNAs in the PD brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Mouradian1">[40]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Junn1">[41]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Harraz1">[42]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Gascon1">[43]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-MinonesMoyano1">[44]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-deMena1">[45]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Doxakis1">[46]</xref>. In differential expression studies of PD patients' leukocytes, we found expression changes that were partially reversed following DBS treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq4">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq5">[48]</xref>. Parallel changes were also detected in both the frontal cortex and the caudate-putamen brain areas from PD model mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxin. Thus, leukocyte datasets provide useful resource for identifying possible disease biomarkers (which are urgently needed for PD), and for studying PD-related processes in an easily accessible tissue. With the advent of current genomic technologies, new tools are required for linking between different datasets produced from various technologies including different types of microarrays, and RNA-Seq of both long and short molecules.</p>
<p>Other potentially involved regulators of other transcripts are microRNAs (miRNAs), ∼22 nucleotides small non-coding RNAs processed by Drosha and Dicer from larger pri-miRNA molecules (the initial miRNA transcript) and pre-miRNA (i.e the 65–70 nucleotide hairpin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim2">[49]</xref>. Binding of mature miRNAs to RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) is followed by guidance to target cognate protein-coding mRNAs, largely through identification of ‘seed’ matches (sequences complementary to positions 2–8 of the miRNA) in the 3′ un-translated region. The miRNA-RISC complex then initiates a program for mRNA degradation or block of translation. Of note, miRNAs can operate in tandem, cooperatively, or without an apparent seed sequence match. Since the first report of miRNA involvement in PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim1">[39]</xref>, new findings provide ample evidence for involvement of differentially expressed miRNAs in the PD brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Mouradian1">[40]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Junn1">[41]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Harraz1">[42]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Gascon1">[43]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-MinonesMoyano1">[44]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-deMena1">[45]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Doxakis1">[46]</xref>. Much of these changes are reflected in PD leukocytes, where we recently observed by microarray analyses coupled miRNA-Alternative Splicing (AS) modifications that were modulated by DBS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq2">[37]</xref>. Thus, leukocyte datasets provide useful resources for studying PD-related processes, and new tools are required for linking between these different datasets.</p>
<p>In our current study, we employed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing and a newly developed workflow that includes comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis approaches to characterize all of the leukocyte-expressed protein coding transcripts as well as the non-coding class of lncRNAs in PD patients and control volunteers. We identified splicing changes, as well as novel exons and junctions by implementation widespread gene-, exon- and junction-level analyses. We implemented a variety of differential expression and splicing analysis methods including linear regression, Splicing Index (SI), ASPIRE and FIRMA. This enabled an integrated analysis of exons and junctions (both separately and combined), transcript structural variations and functional processes, and allowed the conduction of integrated RNA-Seq analysis of whole transcriptome data. We also implemented a new module that enables identification of known and novel Poly-A sites. Our comprehensive novel RNA-Seq analysis workflow further enabled the identification of specific protein domains translated from sequence regions detected as spliced, as well as potential miRNA binding sites within the detected regions. We applied this vast range of analysis tools on PD leukocytes from PD patients (pre-DBS) and post treatment (post-DBS) while being either on- or off-electrical stimulation, all as compared to matched controls the Amygdala and SN. The experimental and analysis workflow is illustrated under <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003517-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Additionally, we used a publically available junction array datasets to characterize knock out effects of two PD leukocyte modified genes that are involved in additional neuropathologies, both include prion-like domains: FUS and HNRNP A/B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim3">[50]</xref>. We further analyzed an additional independent RNA-Seq dataset from PD brain samples and compared the PD blood and leukocyte modified lncRNAs to the brain modified ones following the full characterization of PD brain expressed lncRNAs in the external dataset. Experimental quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) tests validated exemplary findings both in patients' leukocytes and two brain regions from an additional set of PD brain samples as compared with unaffected control brain samples.</p>

<title>General outline of the RNA-Seq experiment and analysis workflow.</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from PD leukocytes pre-DBS, post-DBS on stimulation and following one hour of electrical stimulation cessation (off-Stim). Libraries were constructed for SOLiD whole transcriptome sequencing following ribosomal RNA removal, fragmentation and gel purification. Primary analysis of the 50 nucleotide long reads was followed by mapping of the outcome reads to the human genome through BioScope cloud computation. Tertiary data analysis workflow was developed through a novel RNA-Seq module of AltAnalyze (version 2.0). The analysis steps included: sample-specific database construction followed by detection of known and novel junctions and exons. Four different algorithms were used for measurement of splicing changes from single features (junctions/exons) and feature pairs. These included: linear regression, splicing-index, ASPIRE and FIRMA. Subsequent annotation of the splicing events at the transcript level enabled detection of various annotations including 3′ and 5′ end variations, cassette exons and mutually exclusive exons. Additionally, detection of both promoter region and splicing alternations as well as intron retention events was enabled, and a novel module for poly-A site prediction was incorporated. Enrichment for protein binding domains and miRNA target sites was conducted using z-score and the corresponding databases. Additionally, detection of all the lncRNAs expressed in these samples expressed lncRNAs was conducted through alignment to GENCODE 7 database, and followed by differential expression analysis (EdgeR) and predictions of secondary structure and potential miRNA complementarity predictions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To deeply delineate splicing modulations and to characterize the full profile of lncRNAs as well as their differential expression in PD, we implemented a novel and comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis workflow (available as version 2.0 of AltAnalyze <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Salomonis1">[51]</xref> program). We applied the full analysis workflow on whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq data from blood leukocytes of PD patients pre- and post-DBS treatment in two states: on- and following one hour off electrical stimulation, as well as from age- and gender-matched healthy control (HC) volunteers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s007">Table S1A</xref>). Overall, 12 RNA-Seq libraries were produced (of 3 replicates per condition) (all deposited under the Gene Expression Omnibus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Edgar1">[52]</xref>, GEO accession number GSE42608). The total number of read counts per library ranged between 75,174,576 −111,910,462 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s007">Table S1B</xref>). Of them, 54%–71% (which were composed of 41,413,564 to 74,845,764 reads, median: 60,933,494 reads, or 67%) were mapped to the human genome (UCSC genome assembly, version 19). The total sequenced read counts did not show statistically significant differences between the different clinical groups (PD patients pre- and post-DBS or healthy control samples). Uniquely aligned exon reads amounted to 62.4%–74.4% of the total number of mapped reads. Overall, 633,054 exons were identified in the RNA-Seq libraries; Reads that were aligned to unique junctions composed 2.4%–3.8% of the total number of aligned reads. Using the newly developed analysis workflow that we present here, we identified as many as 344,009 of them (54%) as novel human exons. The rest (289,045, composing of 46%) were previously annotated in either the EnsEMBL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Hubbard1">[53]</xref> or in the UCSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Kent1">[54]</xref> human genome databases. Similarly, of the 321,808 junctions identified in total in the RNA-Seq libraries, 102,053 (32%) were novel. The rest (219,755, or 68%) were already annotated.</p>

<title>LncRNAs are widely expressed in PD leukocytes and selectively altered in the disease</title>
<p>So far, only a few RNA-Seq studies have detected or analyzed lncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Ilott1">[55]</xref>. We took advent of our next generation RNA-Seq data to identify all of the leukocyte-expressed lncRNAs and to search for differentially expressed lncRNAs in disease- and post-surgical treatment state. For this purpose, we mapped all of the sequenced reads detected in leukocytes from PD patients pre- and post-DBS and from matched healthy control (HC) volunteers against the largest currently available lncRNA database, the GENCODE database version 7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Derrien1">[56]</xref>. This database consists of reconstructed transcript models using Exonerate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Howald1">[57]</xref> and Scripture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Guttman2">[58]</xref>, and is based on the high-depth transcriptomic data from 16 human tissues made publicly available from Illumina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Derrien1">[56]</xref>. The current version of the GENECODE database covered 14,880 partially identified lncRNAs based on their chromatin signatures or position relative to protein coding genes. Alignment of the RNA-Seq leukocyte data to GENCODE revealed an average of 6,209 leukocyte expressed lncRNAs (across all the leukocyte sequenced libraries), of them as many as 5,862 were present in all the libraries. Generally, PD patient leukocytes at all clinical stages (either pre- or post- DBS treatment, and comparing on- and off- electrical stimulation) contained less lncRNAs than in HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003517-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>LncRNAs are expressed in leukocytes and exhibit differential expression in PD and following DBS.</title>
<p>Over 5,800 lncRNAs were detected as expressed in RNA from PD patient's leukocyte pre- and post-DBS (both on and off electrical stimulation) and in control leukocyte RNA samples through alignment of the RNA-Seq read counts to GENCODE database (A). (B) Differential expression analysis of the detected lncRNAs using common dispersion model and trimmed normalization identified 13 lncRNAs as highly significantly changes (FDR&lt;0.05) in PD patients leukocytes pre-DBS as compared with HC, 8 exhibiting increase and 5 – decrease in PD (C) Differential expression analysis of the post-DBS leukocyte samples compared to the pre-DBS state of the same patients leukocytes detected 18 DBS-modified lncRNAs (4 up- and 14 down-regulated), four of which also changed in the disease pre- treatment (color marked). Note inverse directions of change post-DBS as compared with pre-DBS in all the overlapping lncRNAs (D) Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) validated the disease-induced patients leukocytes increases of spliceosomal lncRNA U1 (left), in the lncRNA RP11-79P5 (middle) and in RP11-462G22 (right) in patients' leukocytes. (E–F): Parallel validations in two brain region samples from PD patients and age-matched male controls from the Netherland's Brain Bank (NBB): the SN (E) and Amygdala (F). In all sections, the Y axis is averaged delta Ct fold change, and * marks t-test p&lt;0.05. Leukocyte reference gene: RPL19, brain reference gene: TUBB3.</p>

<p>We applied differential expression analysis of all the lncRNAs that were expressed in all the libraries using EdgeR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Robinson1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Robinson2">[60]</xref>. The analysis used an over-dispersed Poisson model (to account for both biological and technical variability) and Empirical Bayes methods (to moderate the degree of over-dispersion across transcripts and improve the reliability of the results). The normalization approach employed an empirical strategy that equates the overall expression levels of genes between samples under the assumption that the majority of them are not differentially expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Robinson1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Robinson2">[60]</xref>. Overall, the analysis revealed 596 PD leukocytes modified lncRNAs (p&lt;0.05). Briefly, the fold change tagwise dispersion plot of the lncRNAs detected in PD patient leukocytes was slightly skewed towards positive log fold change, indicating a general up-regulation trend in PD leukocytes (Smear plot is illustrated under <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003517-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The biological coefficient of variation (BCV) and multidimensional scaling clustering (MDS) plots are given under <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s001">Figure S1</xref>. Among all of the PD leukocyte altered lncRNAs compared to HC (with uncorrected p&lt;0.05), 13 passed FDR correction (FDR&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003517-t001">Table 1</xref>). Overall, 11 of them were annotated by GENCODE 7.0 as novel entities. Those were well supported by locus-specific transcript evidence or evidence from a paralogous or orthologous locus while not being currently represented in the two databases of HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Seal1">[61]</xref> and RefSeq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Pruitt1">[62]</xref>.

<title>Dispersion plots show parallel change patterns in PD leukocytes and brain tissues.</title>
<p>(A) The fold change smear plot of the lncRNAs detected in PD patients' blood leukocytes as compared with HC using tagwise dispersion is slightly skewed towards positive log fold change indicating a general up-regulation trend in PD leukocytes (x axis: average log count per millions of RNA-Seq reads, y axis: log fold change PD compared to HC). The top most differentially expressed lncRNAs (n = 595, uncorrected p&lt;0.05) are highlighted in red. (B) Fold change smear plot for lncRNAs in blood leukocytes following Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment as compared with the pre-DBS leukocyte RNA from the same PD patients show the 663 differentially expressed ones (uncorrected p&lt;0.05) exhibited massive down-regulation of 428 lncRNAs. (C) A short one hour of electrical stimulation cessation post-DBS induced very mild lncRNA modifications (n = 110 differentially expressed lncRNAs, uncorrected p&lt;0.05), equally down- and up- regulated under electrical stimulation cessation (n = 55 in each group). (D) Of over 7,000 lncRNAs detected through PD brain RNA-Seq data analysis, 964 were altered in PD brain samples compared with unaffected brains (red colored), 242 of these passed FDR correction. A global trend of down-regulation of the brain lncRNAs under PD is clearly evident.</p>

<p>To further challenge the significance of PD leukocyte modified lncRNAs, we analyzed an additional, independent recently released RNA-Seq dataset from post mortem brain samples of PD patients and healthy donors (Array expression accession number E-GEOD-40710).

<title>RNA-Seq analysis identifies known and novel junctions, exons and disease-related splicing events</title>
<p>Identifying the U1 spliceosomal lncRNA as disease- and treatment-altered in PD patients' leukocytes called for exploring possible concurrent splicing and transcript structure modifications in the same patients RNA samples. While we have previously reported alternative splicing alterations in PD leukocytes pre- and post-DBS through exon and junction microarray analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq4">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq5">[48]</xref>, RNA-Seq data analysis offers several important advantages in expression studies. Being independent of predefined probes (as compared with microarray platforms), RNA-Seq allows unbiased identification of novel junctions, exons and transcript isoforms as well as altered polyadenylation choices at high resolution. The in-depth coverage allows a more accurate measurement of exon inclusion or exclusion and identification of lowly abundant junctions and exons. Moreover, this analysis further enables detection of reciprocal pairs of junctions, one that includes and the other that excludes an exon. To fully exploit these virtues, we developed an updated version of AltAnalyze (version 2.0) for RNA-Sequencing analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.altanalyze.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.altanalyze.org/</ext-link>). Extending the program that was initially developed and introduced for junction microarray analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Salomonis2">[72]</xref>, we introduce a significantly improved workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003517-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This is reflected in its user-friendly pipeline for the analysis of both known and novel splicing events directly from SOLiD BioScope processed RNA-Seq results (but also from other platforms, such as TopHat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Trapnell1">[73]</xref>, HMMSplicer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Dimon1">[74]</xref> and SpliceMap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Au1">[75]</xref>). The obtained analysis results can be directly integrated with alternative exon or junction array datasets. Unlike existing RNA-Seq analytical pipelines, this new version of AltAnalyze can directly evaluate differential gene expression, identify known and novel alternative exons and junctions and alternative Poly-A sites, perform combinatorial exon and junction analyses and evaluate these effects at the level of protein domains, miRNA targeting and enriched biological pathways, as a fully automated and user-friendly pipeline.</p>
<p>We have developed a full analysis scheme to analyze using a wide range of analysis approaches gene, exon and junction levels of count data. This tool is able to analyze count information that is obtained from various platforms and analysis methods of data produced by RNA-Seq experiments (Methods). We have applied the full scheme of the new version of AltAnalyze (version 2.0) on leukocyte RNA-Seq data from PD patients pre- and post-DBS and matched HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003517-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Splicing-Index (SI) algorithm (described in detail under <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Srinivasan1">[76]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Gardina1">[77]</xref>) was applied on the PD leukocyte RNA-Seq data based on the above-described novel targeted RNA-Seq module of AltAnalyze. The SI analysis enabled us to detect 1,652 alternatively spliced exons in 1,221 distinct genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s010">Table S4A and S4B</xref>) in PD as compared with HC, including such that belong to the splicing factor HNRNPF. The SI exon level analysis based on RNA-Seq read counts yielded many more splicing products in PD leukocytes' RNA than was previously detected by both our PD leukocyte microarrays (exon and junction) analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq6">[78]</xref>. Notably, 34 modified genes were detected in both the RNA-Seq and microarray technologies, including the elongation factor EIF2AK3 and the interleukin receptor IL1RL1. Also, the majority of disease-induced changes, 1313 were exon inclusion ones and only 339 – exclusion events, similar to the enrichment of inclusion events seen in cortical samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Berson1">[79]</xref>.</p>
<p>To further identify high confidence splicing events, we implemented linear regression analysis approach for analyzing all the reciprocal junction pairs detected in the RNA-Seq libraries (i.e reciprocal junction pairs: all the pairs of junctions one of which includes an exon in the transcript and one excludes it). Following sample-specific database construction of all the known and novel junctions available in the samples, the test is performed on all the junction pairs detected in the RNA-Seq libraries (both novel and known). Using this novel RNA-Seq implemented analysis approach on the sequenced PD leukocyte RNA, we could identify all the detected known and novel splice junctions. The novel RNA-Seq linear regression tool of the AltAnalyze RNA-Seq module subsequently identified 315 reciprocal junction pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s010">Table S4C</xref>) as significantly changed in the disease, the majority of them (228 junction pairs) identified as novel by de-novo predictions that followed dataset-specific database construction (enabled in the new RNA-Seq adapted version 2.0 of AltAnalyze). Only 87 of the disease-altered junctions existed in current genomic databases, and thus the majority of these junctions could not be previously detected by microarray analyses. Of the total changed junctions, 157 and 158 spliced junction pairs induced exon inclusion and exclusion events in 144 different genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s010">Table S4D</xref>), suggesting that unique splicing events occur under PD. Some events were, however annotated as affecting more than one type of transcript structure variation, yielding an overall of 179 such PD-associated annotations. These primarily involved alternative cassette exons (N = 142, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Other types of detected events included alternative 3′-ends (n = 11), alternative 5′-ends (n = 7), alternate promoters (n = 5), mutually exclusive exons (n = 2) and 2 trans-splicing inducing splice junction pairs events.</p>
<p>To enable a more rigorous detection of alternative exons, we implemented and applied for RNA-Seq the Analysis of Splicing by Isoform Reciprocit<italic>y</italic> (ASPIRE) approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Konig1">[80]</xref> through the novel RNA-Seq version of AltAnalyze (version 2.0). This identified pairs of alternative exons and reciprocally expressed exclusion junctions through combined junctions and exons analysis based on RNA-Seq read counts for both types of gene structures. Subsequent analysis of the corresponding read counts from leukocyte RNA of PD patients compared to control samples identified 105 inclusion and 88 exclusion events in 192 exon-junction pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s010">Table S4E</xref>).</p>

Of these, 748 were inclusion and 320- exclusion events; extending our previous reports of widespread influence of DBS on splicing direction.

<p>Overall, the exons in samples of PD leukocytes showed significantly different frequencies of transcript functional relevance as compared with healthy samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003517-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, light blue bars).

The short period of one hour of electrical stimulation cessation reduced the proportions of all the event types, as compared to the stimulated state (and in some cases, also compared to the pre-DBS disease state). However, the proportion of alternative 3′ intron ends was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003517-g007">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s014">Table S8</xref>).

<p>Alternative Polyadenylation (Poly-A) predictions were incorporated into the novel version of AltAnalyze, which was adopted for RNA-Seq analysis and enabled reporting transcript event annotations.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We present here a comprehensive approach to analyze whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq data obtained via various platforms, using measurements of both splice junctions and exons, independently and in combination through various analysis methods, which enable identification and analysis of both know transcript variant as well as novel ones. The workflow enables additionally identification of transcript structures modifications, and integration with protein binding sites and microRNA annotations. We have re-implemented a diverse set of splicing-directed analysis methods (ASPIRE, linear regression, FIRMA and splicing-index) that were originally developed to analyze splice-sensitive microarray data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Salomonis1">[51]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Ule2">[103]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Purdom1">[104]</xref>, for the analysis of complex RNA-Seq data of protein-coding transcripts. The new RNA-Seq analysis workflow enables de-novo identification of genome-specific transcript structures through sample specific database construction based on the experimental specific read counts. We also incorporated for the first time prediction of Poly-A sites in the novel AltAnalyze version described here (version 2.0). This workflow enabled us to detect novel exons and junctions in protein coding RNA molecules, as well as a large range of splicing events under PD pre- and post- brain stimulation both on- and one hour off- electrical stimulation (which re-induces the disease motor symptoms), as compared with healthy control volunteers. We also present here a workflow for detection and differential expression analysis of lncRNAs in whole transcriptome RNA-Seq data.</p>
<p>Together, the novel analysis workflow and unique RNA-Seq dataset enabled us a widespread analysis of differential splicing as well as to detect lncRNAs and characterize their differential expression in both the disease and treatment states. At the transcript level, the DBS-induced increase in alternative ends, as well as in intron retention and alternative promoter usage, was accompanied by a 50% decrease in the number of ‘bleeding exons’ (that ‘leak’ into other transcripts). The number of cassette exons (present in certain transcripts but not in others) was predictably highest among all the possible types of splicing events in all the sequenced samples. Specifically, we observed increase in the frequency of cassette exons and intron retention events both in the disease and following DBS, as compared with the global population of expressed exons. Notably, non-conventional AT/AC and GT/AG ending introns were predictably very rare, in all the tested clinical conditions, as compared with the other types of transcript structural variations and disease-modified Poly-A choices.</p>
<p>Our deep survey characterized leukocyte-expressed lncRNAs in both patients and control volunteers and identified 5 lncRNAs that are over-expressed in the disease and inversely decrease following DBS. These include the spliceosome component U1, supporting the notion of disease-involved splicing modulations. Also, increased levels of the muscular dystrophy-associated RP11-462G22.1 (lnc-FRG1-3) may be relevant to the muscle rigidity in PD, one of the six disease hallmark motor symptoms. Another disease-modified lncRNAs that decreased post-DBS (RP11-79P5.3) was also found as differentially expressed by analysis of an additional external, independent PD brain RNA-Seq data-set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Rhinn1">[65]</xref> and its disease up-regulation was successfully validated by qRT-PCR in the leukocytes as well as in two brain regions from an additional set of PD and unaffected control brain samples, in both the Amygdala and SN.</p>
<p>So far, only a few large-scale studies have revealed fundamental characteristics of lncRNAs including their low levels of expression, temporal and spatial patterns of expression, sequence conservation and association with histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Young1">[105]</xref>. Functional assays have also revealed diverse mechanisms through which lncRNAs act to regulate protein-coding genes at both the transcriptional and translational levels. However, to date there is insufficient data on the relationship between sequence, expression and pattern of newly identified lncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Wapinski1">[106]</xref>. The relatively low sequence and transcriptional conservation between species further complicate these studies. Yet, the identification of alternative, still unidentified features may produce a framework with which to accurately predict the functions of un-annotated lncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Young1">[105]</xref>. An independent brain dataset analyzed in the current study exhibited a large number of lncRNAs commonly expressed in leukocytes from PD patients, thus we provide here an exceptionally rich resource for lncRNA expression in PD human leukocytes and brain regions.</p>
<p>We recently profiled differentially expressed miRNAs of PD patients' leukocytes pre- and post-DBS by small RNA deep sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq7">[107]</xref>, concurrently with alternative splicing changes of their predicted target genes. That study involved analysis by a junction array-adopted version of AltAnalyze. Here, we use the AltAnalyze target prediction module to detect potential miRNA binding sites within regions detected as undergoing splicing modifications by the RNA-Seq analyses, as well as putative protein binding domains. To detect disease and treatment-affected pathways, the splicing-sensitive results were re-analyzed using the functional AltAnalyze analysis module GO-Elite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Zambon1">[108]</xref> for over-representation analysis (ORA) of pathways, ontologies and other gene sets. We believe that our current approach and results will provide a useful resource for biomedical researchers of movement and neurodegenerative disorders, and that our suggested analysis workflow may maximize the observations obtained by analyzing RNA-Seq data through simultaneous detection of novel junctions, exons and splice isoforms in a data-specific manner through comprehensive yet sensitive detection of alternative splicing events.</p>
<p>Our lncRNA analysis workflow and results will also provide an important resource to the biomedical community. Currently, 31% of the human genome bases in sequenced transcripts are annotated as intergenic (located between coding genes). Of these, lncRNAs are rapidly emerging as important and fascinating regulatory factors across a diverse catalogue of molecular, genetic and cellular processes, but phenotypic consequences of their differential expression, as well as sequence and structure derived functionality are still an Enigma. Here, in addition to comprehensive detection of both junction and exon level splicing changes in protein coding transcripts, we also fully characterized the disease- and treatment-expressed lncRNAs, and found large disease-induced expression changes in 13 lncRNAs (of the over 6000 lncRNAs detected in the leukocytes overall), including such that are involved in RNA processing. We have validated the RNA-Seq observed disease alternations through real-time RT-PCR for three lncRNAs, including two potential ceRNAs predicted to bind numerous miRNAs. Although only recently detected, lncRNAs raise a great interest to the scientific community due to their tremendous influence on our perception of genes. It is clear now that they can function at the molecular level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Wilusz1">[109]</xref>, but their potential role in human neurodegenerative diseases was not reported yet. Certain lncRNAs function as transcriptional regulators of neighboring protein-coding genes by cis- or trans-modulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Beckedorff1">[110]</xref>, enhance or repress nearby protein-coding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Wilusz1">[109]</xref>, operate as epigenetic gene regulators through histone or DNA modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Lee2">[111]</xref> (for example, in muscular dystrophy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Cabianca1">[112]</xref>, and act as precursors or decoys for small RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Jalali1">[113]</xref>. Thus, the expression map of lncRNAs in human leukocytes and specifically, in PD patients' pre- and post- DBS treatment may become an important resource. Specifically, both miRNA-binding lncRNAs and splicing modulations have been demonstrated to impact miRNA binding site integrity, which has been proposed to be an important mechanism in regulating miRNA-RNA sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Salomonis1">[51]</xref>. Emerging evidence further demonstrates a role for lncRNAs in regulating both miRNA targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Salmena1">[114]</xref>, possibly competing with the protein coding targets of the sponged miRNAs, and splicing factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Moran1">[115]</xref>. For example, the lncRNA MALAT1 modulates SR splicing factor phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Tripathi1">[116]</xref>, whereas miR-188-5p which is complementary to the PD-induced lncRNAs targets the alternative splicing regulatory factor SFRS1 (SF2/ASF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Sanford1">[117]</xref> (which we previously reported as modified in PD patients through exon microarray analysis).</p>
<p>Two of the PD differentially induced lncRNAs predictably bind many complementary miRNAs, and were further increased following DBS treatment. RP5-875O13.1 (lnc-SPATA21-1) showed complementarity to 8 miRNAs and RP11-462G22.1 to 21 miRNAs, supporting the notion that lncRNAs may function in PD as protective decoys preventing the functioning of their complementary miRNAs. That miRNAs may present lncRNA-trapped, possibly non-functional versions, further suggests that quantifying miRNA levels in biological sources may be insufficient to predict their functioning potential. The DBS treatment potentially exacerbated this reaction, upon induction of changes in large number of lncRNAs. These two lncRNAs may hence belong to the newly discovered competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) lncRNA class, originally described as transcribed retropseudogenes that retain the miRNA-binding function of their parent mRNAs, which currently include lncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Salmena1">[114]</xref>. CeRNAs have been proposed to function as miRNA ‘decoys’ or ‘sponges’, thereby de-repressing levels of protein coding transcripts that share with the ceRNAs the same miRNA response elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Salmena1">[114]</xref>. Although ceRNA-mediated regulation represents an elegant mechanism by which lncRNAs may control protein function through miRNA mediators, the proportion of lncRNAs that act as ceRNAs remains unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Ilott1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>Of note, secondary sequence structures were so far not studied for lncRNAs, and our current observation for secondary structure enabling possible miRNA sponging for two of the disease differentially expressed lncRNAs calls for future studies involving lncRNA secondary structures predictions. Future comparative study of various species will provide further insights into structure-based functionality of lncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Rands1">[118]</xref>. So far, Knockout models for specific lncRNAs did not produce any phenotypes. However, evidence for their importance stems from lncRNAs involvement in cancer and other human diseases, and evolutionary analyses suggest that lncRNAs represent a new class of non-coding genes whose importance should become clearer upon further experimental investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Young2">[119]</xref>. We anticipate some of these associations will be made clearer by longitudinal studies that will include larger cohorts of PD patients as well as targeted lncRNA knockout models that will experimentally validate a link between splicing events with lncRNA differential expression. The discovery of at least one lncRNA regulated in our PD patients that affects splicing, highlights additional potential candidate lncRNA spliced targets consistently identified via RNA-Seq, junction and exon microarray analyses. Importantly, we found highly complex and previously unknown splicing and alternative poly-A patterns in healthy controls' leukocytes and a conspicuous decline of this rich variability in PD leukocytes. Together, these findings support the notion of a massive impact of both lncRNAs and the existence AS changes that cause a wide range of transcript-level structure modifications in PD.</p>
<p>Blood cells provide an accessible source for biomarker identification, and although accurate identification of disease biomarkers in the blood has proven difficult in the past, blood biomarkers were recently found for both neurological diseases as well as psychiatric disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Nickles1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Harris1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-FehlbaumBeurdeley1">[36]</xref>. Future studies in larger cohorts of Parkinson's patients will enable verification of disease markers in the blood. Here, we employed a non-biased full leukocyte RNA-sequencing followed by detection of known and novel splicing events and transcript functional level annotations concurrently with detection of poly-A sites. This allowed us to profile both known and novel structural transcript changes in PD pre- and post-treatment ON- and OFF-stimulus at an unprecedented depth.</p>
<p>At the structural level, mutations in the prion-like domains of splicing factors such as heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein AB (hnRNP A/B) and FUS were recently shown to lead to pathological protein fibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim3">[50]</xref>. While their involvement in sporadic neurodegenerative processes is still incompletely understood, findings of hnRNP A/B decline in Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Berson1">[79]</xref> suggests that impaired splicing regulation might be involved in the emergence of sporadic neurodegenerative processes, including PD. Splicing alternations were also reported to occur early on in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and failed nuclear transport and fibril formation by splicing factors harboring prion-like domains, such as hnRNP A/B and FUS was recently implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim3">[50]</xref>. It is hence noteworthy that we found AS changes in the prion-like domains of the non-mutated variants of these transcripts and identified <italic>protein transport to nuclei as</italic> a primarily impaired signaling network in PD leukocytes. Additional predictions involve neuro-immune signaling, with a specific focus on the CDC42 Rho GTPase which functions both in controlling anxiety and in defense against viral infection and general immune cell activities, both phenomena known in PD patients and which emerged in our network analysis as changed in the disease. Post-mortem brain studies of sporadic PD, highlighted mitochondrial dysfunction as being central to the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Schapira1">[120]</xref>, and it was further pointed out as contributing to the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Ataxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Narendra1">[121]</xref>. Pink1 and Park2 may act in a quality control pathway preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, and regulators that control Park2 translocation into the damaged mitochondria were recently elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Schapira1">[120]</xref>, revealing that this pathway is much more complicated than previously appreciated, and suggesting that other, yet unknown, regulators also contribute to the process.</p>
<p>Here, we have charted the first whole transcriptome genome-wide splicing map of Parkinson's leukocytes through characterization of both known and novel junctions and exons via multileveled analysis of high throughput long RNA sequencing. Wide annotations of alternate promoters, splicing and alternative poly-A sites allowed us to identify and quantify both disease- and treatment-induced splicing shifts, miRNA binding site modifications, putatively changed protein-protein interactions and other transcript structural changes in the three tested states of the participant patients (disease, post-treatment ON- and OFF- stimulus). We also noted shifts in splice patterns in PD leukocytes as compared with the global splicing map of the human genome, which was partially sustained post-DBS presenting specific attenuation of disease-derived increase in the frequency of Poly-A choices. To identify inclusion exons expressed in a reciprocal nature relative to a corresponding exclusion junction we have implemented and applied on the RNA-Seq data a more stringent algorithm based on the ASPIRE analysis approach. Importantly, we provide here a full resource of leukocyte-expressed lncRNAs in both disease and healthy states and specifically in PD.</p>
<p>In summary, we developed a novel computational approach and a user friendly tool for analyzing whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq data through sample specific database construction. Our workflow includes identification of novel splice junctions, exons and splicing events, including such that involve novel variants, in protein-coding genes. We combined both exon- and junction- level analyses by applying this newly developed version of AltAnalyze for RNASeq analysis to gain deep insight into gene expression and splicing aberrations in PD and search for electrical stimulation -induced changes, concurrently with global detection and differential expression of the leukocyte expressed lncRNAs. RNA-seq comprehensive analyses thus enable new insight to leukocyte transcriptome data, which becomes an important resource for researchers of neurodegenerative diseases overall, and our results will provide insights into DBS-treatable diseases overall (including mental disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-HeeramunAubeeluck1">[122]</xref>). In particular, lncRNAs may be future novel biomarkers for PD and other neurodegenerative and neurological conditions and an important tool in future personalized neurology.</p>

<title>Recruitment of human PD patients and control volunteers</title>
<p>Blood leukocytes were collected from 3 PD patients pre- and post- bilateral sub-thalamic (STN)-DBS neurosurgery while being on stimulation and following a short 1-hour of stimulation cessation and from 3 healthy age-matched control healthy volunteers (HC). The age, disease duration and Body-Mass Index (BMI) of the study patient participants are given under Table ST1. All the patient study volunteers that passed our stringent set of exclusion criteria signed informed consent forms prior to inclusion in the study (clinical parameters of the recruited volunteers are given under ST1). To control for variability in the leukocytes expression profiles that stem from other factors (such as infections, or other diseases), volunteers were assessed for their clinical background and state and fulfilled detailed medical history questionnaires. Exclusion criteria for participant patients included depression and past and current DSM Axis I and II psychological disorders (SM), chronic inflammatory disease, coagulation irregularities, previous malignancies or cardiac events, or any surgical procedure up to one year pre-DBS. Potential volunteers that did not fulfill these inclusion criteria were not recruited to the study. All patients went through bilateral STN-DBS electrode implantation (Medtronics, USA) and were under dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) both pre- and post-DBS (on significantly reduced dosage post-DBS with t-test p&lt;0.01), the last medication administered at least five hours pre-sampling. The clinical severity of the disease was assessed by a neurologist by the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Fahn2">[123]</xref>.

<p>Blood collection was conducted in a fixed range of hours (10AM–14PM). In order to reduce expression profile variability that depends on the time of sampling. To ensure accurate inspection of in-vivo leukocyte expressed RNA, the collected venous blood (9 ml blood using 4.5 ml EDTA (anti-coagulant) tubes) was immediately filtered using the LeukoLock fractionation and stabilization kit (Ambion, Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). To ensure high RNA quality, the leukocyte-enriched samples were immediately incubated in RNALater (Ambion) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/technotes/blood_technote.pdf" xlink:type="simple">http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/technotes/blood_technote.pdf</ext-link>).

Ribosomal RNA removal was verified by RNA 6000 Nano gel analysis. Library construction was conducted according to SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit (PN4425680) protocol, fragmentation (by RNase-III) was verified on Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (#5067-1513) and 150 ng fragmented RNA ware used for further protocols. cDNA samples were run on 4% Agarose gel, 150–250 base pairs (bp) sized fragments were cut and extracted using Qiagen Min-Elute Gel-Extraction Kit (#28604), gel was dissolved by intensive vortex and not by heating. Libraries were amplified for 12 cycles using bar-coded primers supplied in SOLiD Transcriptome Multiplexing Kit (Ambion, #4427046).

<title>Primary processing of SOLiD RNA-Seq reads</title>
<p>RNA-Seq reads (.csfasta files) and quality scores (.qual files) were obtained using the SOLiD instrument software: SOLiD-3. SOLiD-3. System software analysis was used for all the primary data analysis including image analysis, bead finding, quality metrics and color calls. The software applications used to set and control data analysis included SOLiD software suite under license agreement. The suit included: Instrument Control Software (ICS), SOLiD Experimental Tracking System (SETS), and SOLiD Analysis Tools (SAT) V3.0. Job management by the Job Manager used the Corona-Lite v4.0 platform. Sequencing was run on the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 System. Images of each cycle were analyzed, data was clustered and normalized. For each tag, a sequential (sequence-ordered) set of color space calls was produced. Quality metrics were produced through normalization. Two probe sets were used to maximize the fraction of “mappable” amplified beads, read length and sequencing throughput for sequencing of the 50-bp reads. Five rounds of primers (A, B, C, D and E) were used to sequence template by ligation of di-base labeled probes. As the libraries were size fragmented, the set of primers used was specific to the P1 Adaptor. For each library three types of raw data files were created: .csfasta (the sequenced reads in color space), .qual and .stats. The quality values given in the .qual files (estimate of confidence given for each color call), q for a particular call, is mathematically related to its probability of error (p), and is calculated as follows: q = −10log<sub>10</sub>p. The SOLiD q values are similar for those generated by Phred and the KB basecaller for capillary electrophoresis (described in detail under <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Ewing1">[124]</xref>). The algorithm relies on training (calibration) to a large set of control data and color calls for which the correct call is known. In SOLiD-3 system, the correct call is determined by mapping the read to a known reference sequence.</p>

The count reads were mapped to the UCSC human genome version 19 (February 2009 GRCh37/hg19 assembly, homo_sapiens.GRCh37.56.dna.toplevel.fa database) twice: once to receive exon quantification (using the counttag tool) and once more to receive junction level quantification, using the BioScope splice junction extractor tool. The *.gff and *.sam files were created during this analysis step. The BioScope alignment software Mapreads was used.

<sec id="s4h1">
<title>1. Predicting de- Novo junctions, exons and Poly-A site choices, annotating UCSC and EnsEMBL exons and detecting intron retention</title>
<p>For each RNA-Seq sample, a sample-specific database was constructed, based on the count reads obtained by the experimental procedure, and both EnsEMBL and UCSC genome coordinates. Following the identification of all of the transcript structural event types by parsing of all EnsEMBL and UCSC databases, the cases of intron retention were identified first by searching for regions that consist of a single exon and span two adjacent exons in at least one additional transcript for each gene. The remaining exons were clustered based on genomic coordinate overlaps (e.g alternate 5′ or 5′ start-sites). Each exon was annotated as corresponding to exon block and region number within the corresponding transcript. All possible pair-wise transcript comparisons for each gene were then performed to identify exon pairs that show evidence of alternative exon-cassettes, alternative 3′ or 5′ splice-sites or alternative-N or -C terminal exons. All transcript exon pairs were considered (except for those adjacent to a retained intron) by comparing the exon block-ID and region-IDs of an exon and its neighboring exons to the exon blocks and regions in the compared transcripts, and a custom heuristic assigned the appropriate annotation based on these transcript comparisons. In addition to all of the de-novo splicing annotations, additional splicing annotations were imported from the UCSC genome database and linked to existing exon blocks and regions based on genomic coordinate overlaps. Various programs can be used to produce the junction input .BED/TAB files, in addition to SOLiD Bioscope output files (such as TopHat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Trapnell1">[73]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu</ext-link>, HMMSplicer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Dimon1">[74]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://derisilab14.ucsf.edu/software/hmmsplicer" xlink:type="simple">http://derisilab14.ucsf.edu/software/hmmsplicer</ext-link>)). Paired-end data from SpliceMap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Au2">[125]</xref>) can also be analyzed. Exon count input .bed files are produced from BAM files with BEDTools (and exon counts can be further uploaded as .tab count files, produced by BioScope for SOLiD libraries, as in this case). In addition to known splice junctions (EnsEMBL and UCSC), novel reciprocal junction and trans-splicing events are analyzed and annotated as well. We have further incorporated, for the first time, alternative Poly-A predictions using the polyA database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Zhang1">[126]</xref> with human genomics coordinates. Additionally, alternative promoters were identified.

<title>2. A novel AltAnalyze RNA-Seq module enables de-novo detection of junctions, exons and alternative splicing events and prediction of alternate Poly-A sites, promoters and intron retention events</title>
<p>To identify alternative splicing events, we have adopted for RNA-Seq analysis the AltAnalyze program (originally developed for Affymetrix mouse custom splicing arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Salomonis2">[72]</xref> and further on to prototype Affymetrix human splice junction arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq2">[37]</xref>). For the analysis of RNA-Seq data, we implemented both single-feature (exon/junction) through Splicing-Index (SI) (initially introduced to exon microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Gardina1">[77]</xref>) and FIRMA, or combined (pairs) of features analyses (e.g reciprocal junction pairs): through linear regression and ASPIRE. The calculation of statistical significance involved t-test (default) but can also be modified to other statistical tests (such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov). In addition to detection of known junctions and exons, novel junctions and exons (as well as splicing changes) are derived by de-novo predictions. The exon values are normalized to the total number of read counts using the RPKM calculation prior to the analysis. Further details are given under AltAnalyze online documentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.altanalyze.org" xlink:type="simple">www.altanalyze.org</ext-link>). The tool also enables concurrent analysis of junctions and exons – combined gene-level analysis, and permutations for junction-level analyses. The FIRMA approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Purdom1">[104]</xref> was implemented for gene-level analysis of RNA-Seq data. We applied both junction and exon level analysis approaches on this study RNA-Seq data from PD leukocytes, to conduct three independent comparisons: patients pre-DBS to healthy control volunteers, patients post-DBS on stimulation to their pre-DBS state, and post-DBS following one hour off electrical stimulation as compared with one hour earlier while being on electrical stimulation.

<title>Differential expression analysis of lncRNAs in PD leukocytes and brain samples</title>
<p>Differential expression analysis of PD samples compared to normal controls was performed with the Bioconductor EdgeR software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Robinson1">[59]</xref> version 3.4.2 on R (version 3.0.2, 64 bit), using Trimmed Mean of Ms (TMM) normalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003517-Robinson2">[60]</xref> and exact test. The tagwise dispersion was calculated for each lncRNA (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003517.s003">Figure S3</xref>, PD leukocyte compared to controls as an example), and was moderated by EdgeR toward a common value inferred by all the examined genes. The dispersion parameter determined how to model the variance for each gene in each comparison and dataset. The common variation is inferred from all the datasets. The variance under a negative binomial model computed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003517.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where EM is the estimated mean and D – the dispersion, for each gene in each comparison and dataset. The fold change calculation uses the square root of the dispersion as the biological coefficient of variation, inferred by Poisson distribution), and the tagwise dispersion parameter determines how to model the variance for each gene for the differential expression analysis.</p>
