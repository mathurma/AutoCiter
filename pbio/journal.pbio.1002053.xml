<abstract>
<p>Fatty acid synthesis in plants occurs in plastids, and thus, export for subsequent acyl editing and lipid assembly in the cytosol and endoplasmatic reticulum is required. Yet, the transport mechanism for plastid fatty acids still remains enigmatic. We isolated FAX1 (<italic>fatty acid export 1</italic>), a novel protein, which inserts into the chloroplast inner envelope by α-helical membrane-spanning domains. Detailed phenotypic and ultrastructural analyses of FAX1 mutants in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> showed that FAX1 function is crucial for biomass production, male fertility and synthesis of fatty acid-derived compounds such as lipids, ketone waxes, or pollen cell wall material. Determination of lipid, fatty acid, and wax contents by mass spectrometry revealed that endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)-derived lipids decreased when FAX1 was missing, but levels of several plastid-produced species increased. FAX1 over-expressing lines showed the opposite behavior, including a pronounced increase of triacyglycerol oils in flowers and leaves. Furthermore, the cuticular layer of stems from <italic>fax1</italic> knockout lines was specifically reduced in C29 ketone wax compounds. Differential gene expression in FAX1 mutants as determined by DNA microarray analysis confirmed phenotypes and metabolic imbalances. Since in yeast FAX1 could complement for fatty acid transport, we concluded that FAX1 mediates fatty acid export from plastids. In vertebrates, FAX1 relatives are structurally related, mitochondrial membrane proteins of so-far unknown function. Therefore, this protein family might represent a powerful tool not only to increase lipid/biofuel production in plants but also to explore novel transport systems involved in vertebrate fatty acid and lipid metabolism.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Fatty acid synthesis in plants occurs in chloroplasts—the organelle more commonly known for conducting photosynthesis. For subsequent lipid assembly to be possible in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), export of these fatty acids across the chloroplast envelope membranes is required. The mechanism of this transport until now has not been known. We isolated FAX1 (<italic>fatty acid export 1</italic>), a novel membrane protein in chloroplast inner envelopes. FAX1 function is crucial for biomass production, male fertility, and the synthesis of fatty acid-derived compounds like lipids, waxes, or cell wall material of pollen grains. Whereas ER-derived lipids decreased when FAX1 was missing, levels of plastid-produced lipids increased. FAX1 over-expressing mutants showed the opposite behavior, including an increase of triacyglycerol oils. Because FAX1 could complement for fatty acid transport in yeast, we concluded that FAX1 mediates the export of free fatty acids from chloroplasts. In vertebrates, FAX1 relatives are structurally related proteins of so-far unknown function in mitochondria. This protein family may thus represent a powerful tool not only to increase lipid oil and biofuel production in plants but also to explore novel transport systems in animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fatty acids (FAs) are building blocks for the majority of cellular lipids, which are essential throughout life of organisms. Besides their role as constituents of biological membranes, plant acyl-lipids are used for diverse functions at different destinations and tissues (reviewed in [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). For example, triacylglycerols (TAGs) in seeds of oilseed plants represent the major form of carbon and energy storage. Cuticular waxes at the surface of plants restrict loss of water and provide protection against pathogen attack. Furthermore, the formation of pollen cell walls is strictly dependent on delivery of modified FAs from tapetum cells in anthers (reviewed in [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). De novo FA synthesis in plants occurs in plastids (for overview, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Growing alkyl chains in the plastid stroma are attached as acyl moieties to acyl carrier protein (ACP), and in seed plants become available for lipid assembly mainly in the form of palmitoyl (16:0)- and oleoyl (18:1)-ACP. Part of these long-chain FAs will be integrated into lipids inside plastids (prokaryotic pathway); the majority, however, is exported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for further elongation, acyl editing, and lipid synthesis (eukaryotic pathway).</p>
<p>Although it is generally agreed that free FAs are shuttled across plastid envelope membranes, the mode of export still remains enigmatic [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] since until now, no membrane-intrinsic transporter protein could be associated with a direct function in plastid FA export (for overview, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). On the one hand, a facilitated diffusion of free FAs through the lipid environment of membranes is suggested, which is supported by the recent finding that an acyl-ACP synthase in the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 is necessary and sufficient for FA transfer across membranes [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other hand, several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins for lipids, FAs, or acyl-coenzyme A (CoA), and for import of FAs into peroxisomes [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as well as FA-transport systems from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, yeast, or mammals, provide evidence for an active mode of transport in plastids. Nevertheless, before transport, acyl-ACP thioesterases at the inner plastid envelope membrane catalyze the hydrolysation of fatty acyl-ACP to free FAs. After crossing both inner and outer plastid envelope membranes (IE, OE), free FAs are re-activated to acyl-CoAs by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (LACSs). As demonstrated for the protein LACS9, these enzymes can attach to the cytosolic face of the plastid OE [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. At the ER membrane, the ABC transporter ABCA9 has recently been described to be involved in FA-uptake, most likely in the form of acyl-CoA, thereby being important for TAG synthesis during seed filling [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Once arrived in the ER lumen, plastid-derived FAs are utilized for synthesis of specific lipid classes via the so-called eukaryotic pathway, where phosphatidic acid (PA) represents an important intermediate, phosphatidyl-choline (PC) is a major membrane phospholipid, and TAGs are the energy storage lipids produced. Subsequently, these eukaryotic lipids are distributed to various subcellular locations. For re-import of eukaryotic lipids into plastids, most likely in the form of ER-derived PA, an ABC transporter system (TGD1, 2, 3) at the IE [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the PA-binding ß-barrel lipid transfer protein TGD4 in the OE [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] are required. In plastids, the diacylglycerol backbone from these eukaryotic precursors is used for synthesis of the galactolipids MGDG, DGDG (monogalactosyl-, digalactosyl-diacylglycerol), and the sulfolipid SQDG (sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerol). In addition, however, a prokaryotic-type pathway also produces MGDG, DGDG, SQDG, and the phospholipid phosphatidyl-glycerol (PG) directly from newly synthesized FAs and thus does not require previous FA-export from plastids (for overview, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]).</p>
<p>Here we describe FAX1, a novel protein in the IE of plastids that belongs to the Tmemb_14 superfamily of membrane proteins with so-far unknown function. Functional studies in yeast as well as <italic>FAX1</italic> mutant analysis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> clearly demonstrate that FAX1 mediates FA-export from plastids and thus, to our knowledge, represents the first membrane-intrinsic protein described to be involved in this process. In mammals, FAX1 relatives are structurally related mitochondrial membrane proteins, for which the biological task is not yet clear [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, FAX1 not only is a missing link to explain the mode of plastid FA-export and to improve plant lipid/biofuel production but might also propel the understanding of Tmemb_14 protein performance in general.</p>

<title>FAX1, a Novel Chloroplast Inner Envelope Membrane Protein</title>
<p>The Arabidopsis protein At-FAX1 (At3g57280, for <italic>fatty acid export 1</italic>) was previously annotated as potential plastid-targeted and plant-specific solute transporter by proteomic and phylogenetic analysis [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, we identified transcripts of <italic>At-FAX1</italic> to be up-regulated upon induction of early leaf senescence [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To analyze protein function, we isolated the cDNA of <italic>FAX1</italic> genes from Arabidopsis and pea (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic>). For both proteins, chloroplast targeting peptides and four hydrophobic α-helices are predicted (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). By the latter, plant FAX1 clearly groups to the so-called Tmemb_14 superfamily of proteins with so-far unknown function. The Tmemb_14 family is ubiquitous, with members in nearly all eukaryotes and some bacteria (InterPro|UPF0136). In Arabidopsis, four proteins (FAX1–FAX4) are predicted to be targeted to plastids, while three (FAX5–FAX7) most likely are directed to other, non-plastid membranes via the secretory pathway (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The plastid-intrinsic FAX1 is restricted to the chlorophyll-containing plant kingdom, with representatives in mono- and dicotyledons as well as in mosses and green algae (compare InterPro|UPF0136, [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). Relatives of non-plastid predicted At-FAX proteins, however, can be found in eukaryotes such as mammals, insects, or yeast, and in some bacteria and cyanobacteria (e.g., <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> or <italic>Nostocales</italic>).</p>

KF981436. Predicted chloroplast targeting peptides (ChloroP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP</ext-link>), with 33 aa and 39 aa for At-FAX1 and Ps-FAX1, respectively, are marked with red triangles. The Tmemb_14 domain (Pfam|PF03647) of At-FAX1, including the four conserved hydrophobic domains, is indicated. Identical amino acids (49%) are shaded in black, hydrophobic α-helices (ARAMEMNON) are boxed in green, and peptides used for generation of antisera are indicated by red lines. (B) Members of the FAX/Tmemb_14 family in Arabidopsis. Whereas At-FAX1-At-FAX4 are predicted to be in plastids, At-FAX5-At-FAX7 most likely localize to membranes of the secretory pathway. Hydrophobic α-helices (black squares) and subcellular localization are depicted according to ARAMEMNON. Predicted chloroplast targeting peptides (ChloroP) are marked with red triangles. (C) At-FAX1 and Ps-FAX1 [sequence starting with Tmemb_14 domain, see (A)] in comparison to At-FAX6 (At3g20510) and human proteins of the Tmemb_14 superfamily: TMEM14A (Q9Y6G1) and TMEM14C (Q9POS9). Arabidopsis genome initiative (AGI) codes and InterPro accession numbers in brackets. Whereas At-FAX1 and Ps-FAX1 are slightly more similar to TMEM14C (17% identical, 35% similar aa), At-FAX6 shares 28% identical aa with both proteins TMEM14A and 14C. Predicted hydrophobic α-helices (ARAMEMNON) are boxed in green; α-helices in TMEM14A, 14C [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] are boxed in blue.</p>

<p>For all Tmemb_14 proteins, four hydrophobic α-helical domains are predicted (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). However, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure determination of the human Tmemb_14 proteins TMEM14A and TMEM14C [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that only three of these helices are membrane-spanning. TMEM14A contains an amphiphilic N-terminal helix, presumably located at the lipid micelle-water interface, while for TMEM14C an amphiphilic helix that orients perpendicular to the lipid bilayer, is placed between the second and third membrane domain. Amino acid sequences of the plastid FAX1 and the non-plastid At-FAX6 nicely align to both TMEM14A and 14C (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), but structural modeling revealed that the mature At-FAX1 and Ps-FAX1 are more similar to TMEM14C (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Here, three membrane-spanning and one amphiphilic helix are likely, while the additional N-terminal amino acids of FAX1 proteins might form another α-helical domain not present in TMEM14C. In contrast, the structure of At-FAX6 resembles that of TMEM14A with an N-terminal amphiphilic helix followed by three transmembrane domains (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

Membrane-spanning and amphiphilic α-helices of FAX and of TMEM14 are depicted in green/yellow-green and blue/light blue, respectively. Please note that At-FAX1 contains an additional N-terminal stretch that most likely folds into another α-helix (gray). First and last amino acid residues are indicated. (C) In vivo green fluorescent protein (GFP)-targeting. Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were transiently transformed with constructs for FAX1- and NiCo-GFP (chloroplast IE marker; [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Images show GFP and chlorophyll fluorescence, as well as an overlay of both (bar = 5 μm). (D) Immunoblot analysis of FAX1 in chloroplast subfractions. Equal protein amounts (5μg) of pea chloroplast outer envelope (OE), inner envelope (IE), stroma (str), thylakoids (thy), as well as 2.5μg protein of Arabidopsis microsomal membranes (mm) and chloroplast envelopes (env) were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against Ps-FAX1 and At-FAX1. Antisera against marker proteins LSU (str), LHCP (thy), NiCo (IE), OEP16.1 (OE), and TPR7 (mm, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) were used as controls.

<p>With its membrane-spanning domains, FAX1 inserts into the inner envelope membrane (IE) of plastids as could be shown by in vivo GFP-targeting and immunoblot analysis. At-FAX1-GFP signals in Arabidopsis protoplasts, which can be detected as rings around chloroplasts (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), point to an envelope localization. This could be confirmed and specified to IE by immunoblot analysis using sub-fractionated pea chloroplasts. In pea IE membranes as well as in Arabidopsis chloroplast envelopes, FAX1 signals appear as a band of about 25kDa (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In agreement, FAX1 peptides in proteomic analyses of plastid membranes were exclusively detected in IE preparations (see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and references therein). To exclude ER localization, we further probed against ER-enriched Arabidopsis microsomal membranes (see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), where no FAX1 signals could be detected (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>

Subsequently, two lines homozygous for the <italic>fax1–2</italic> allele (Co#7 and Co#54) were selected for further analysis. To stable over-express <italic>FAX1</italic> in wild-type plants, the <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>FAX1</italic> construct was introduced into Col-0, and two independent lines named ox#2 and ox#4 were identified as FAX1 over-expressors. Quantitative real time RT-PCR revealed that <italic>FAX1</italic> transcripts in line Co#7 are at wild-type levels, whereas line Co#54 contains about 12 times more <italic>FAX1</italic> mRNA. Over-expression in ox#2 seedlings was mild (about 2-fold), but strong in line ox#4 (about 200 times more mRNA than in wild type; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig.</xref>). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the strength of FAX1 expression in these lines and the knockout in <italic>fax1–2</italic> on the protein level (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig.</xref>).</p>
<p>Homozygous <italic>fax1–1</italic> and <italic>fax1–2</italic> knockout mutants both were characterized by reduced biomass at mature rosette stages (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Full flowering <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts were significantly smaller than wild type, had thinner inflorescence stalks, and flowers producing short siliques that contained almost no seeds (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). Detailed analysis of different tissues and organs revealed that the decrease in biomass of <italic>fax1</italic> lines was detectable throughout the entire plant body, including root, leaf, and stem tissues (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Because differences in stem dry weight were slightly more pronounced than in fresh-weight (FW) samples, most likely cell wall synthesis was affected. This could be confirmed by ultrastructural analysis of stem tissue (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>). Here <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts showed small vascular bundles with reduced secondary cell walls (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A, D, G Fig.</xref>). Since the same phenotype was detected in both independent T-DNA insertion lines <italic>fax1–1</italic> and <italic>fax1–2</italic>, and could be reverted by complementation in lines Co#7 and Co#54 (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we conclude that the reduced biomass is caused by the loss of FAX1 function.</p>

<fn id="t001fn001"><p>7-week-old Arabidopsis plants from the respective <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants and wild-type lines as specified in the text were dissected into different organs, which were weighed and measured. Data that were significantly different when compared to Col-0 (Student’s <italic>t-</italic>test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.025) are in bold. Respective <italic>p</italic>-values (comparison to Col-0) are listed.</p></fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Remarkably, FAX1 over-expressing lines ox#2 and ox#4 were slightly bigger and produced more biomass as well as thicker inflorescence stalks than wild type (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), thus behaving opposite to <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts. In stems, this led to about one more hypodermal cell layer and to extended vascular strands, including an increased amount of xylem and phloem vessels, as well as a multi-layered procambuim (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C, F, I Fig.</xref>). Because fresh weight of ox#2 and ox#4 stems was significantly higher than in wild type, but—in contrast to <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts—stem dry weight of FAX1ox lines was similar to wild type (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the increased biomass of FAX1 over-expressors is most likely mainly due to enhanced production of cells. However, since tracheid walls of ox#2 appeared to be slightly thicker than in Col-0 (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2H, I Fig.</xref>), we can’t fully exclude an additional effect on the size of secondary cell walls. Interestingly, the rate of FAX1 overproduction—i.e., 2-fold for ox#2, 200-fold for ox#4—did not quantitatively affect the strength of biomass phenotypes, indicating a rather non-linear effect of protein function.</p>
<p>To understand the peculiar loss-of-function phenotype of homozygous <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts during flower and silique development, segregation analysis of mutant alleles was performed. Self-fertilization of heterozygous <italic>fax1–1</italic> and <italic>fax1–2</italic> revealed that the ratio of homozygous progeny was 7% and 4%, respectively, pointing to defect male and/or female gametophytes (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, when stigmata from homozygous <italic>fax1–2</italic> flowers were fertilized with wild-type <italic>fax1–2</italic> pollen, normal seeds with 100% heterozygous <italic>fax1–2</italic> mutant alleles were produced, indicating fertile <italic>fax1</italic> knockout female gametophytes and sporophyte organs. In contrast, pollination of wild-type stigmata with homozygous <italic>fax1–2</italic> anthers, produced short siliques, as observed during selfing of homozygous <italic>fax1–2</italic> mutants (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), and led to an estimated seed yield &lt;0.1% of wild type. Furthermore, during manual crossing it became evident that pollen grains of homozygous <italic>fax1–2</italic> flowers were improperly released from anthers. To minimize potential anther defects from the paternal sporophyte, we thus pollinated homozygous <italic>fax1–2</italic> stigmata with heterozygous <italic>fax1–2</italic> anthers, thereby producing 12% progeny homozygous for <italic>fax1–2</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In summary, these results point to impaired transmission of male gametophytes (pollen) and defects of the male sporophyte (anther) in <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts, finally leading to the observed male sterility.</p>

<title>FAX1 Function Is Essential for Pollen Cell Wall Assembly</title>
<p>To further analyze flower development, in particular that of male parts, we examined the morphology of flower tissue from <italic>FAX1</italic> mutant lines (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>). In <italic>FAX1</italic> wild-type and over-expressors (ox#2, ox#4), pollen release by anther dehiscence, transfer to the stigma, and fertilization as indicated by high yield of viable seeds was normal. However, flowers of <italic>fax1</italic> knockout mutants showed stigmata with non-pollinated papillae. In addition, <italic>fax1</italic> anthers released only very few pollen grains (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A, B, G Fig.</xref>).

In contrast to the rest of the plant organs, where regeneration of <italic>fax1</italic> knockout defects in Co#7, Co#54 lines was 100% (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), complementation of <italic>fax1–2</italic> pollen phenotypes was incomplete. This effect was best visualized by the colorless pollen of <italic>fax1</italic> knockout and complementation lines (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B, D, G Fig.</xref>), due to the absence (<italic>fax1–2</italic>) or incomplete (Co#54) assembly of a pollen coat (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D–F</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3I–K Fig.</xref>) that normally includes yellow flavonoid and carotenoid deposits (for overview, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). The incomplete complementation was restricted to pollen grains and most likely is due to the <italic>35S</italic> promoter system, which in Arabidopsis shows no or reduced activity in pollen grains and anther tissue, respectively [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

<p>Subsequently, the detailed structure of anther tissue and pollen grains of <italic>fax1–2</italic> knockout, Col-0 wild type, and the complementation line Co#54 was visualized by light- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at the mature, tricellular pollen stage (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C–F</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3H–K Fig.</xref>). In general, anthers of <italic>fax1–2</italic> were smaller than in wild type and the surface of pollen grains appeared to be wrinkled (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Cross sections revealed an impaired release of <italic>fax1–2</italic> pollen, although pollen sacks were wide open, indicating full dehiscence of anthers. Tapetum cells seemed to be degraded as expected for the developmental stage analyzed, however, the locule of <italic>fax1–2</italic> anthers was covered by an electron-dense material, which stuck to pollen grains and thus most likely was responsible for improper pollen delivery (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C–E</xref>). Ultrastructural resolution demonstrated that the well-defined structures of the outer pollen cell wall—i.e., the exine layer and the pollen coat, which covers the exine surface and its cavities—were absent in <italic>fax1–2</italic> knockouts (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). The intine, representing the innermost layer of the pollen cell wall and composed of cellulose, pectin, and various proteins, secreted by the microspore (gametophytic origin, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]), however, looked intact. In contrast, mature wild-type pollen showed a complete exine, consisting of a flat nexine layer and the sculpted sexine parts tectum and bacula. Furthermore, the latter were filled and covered with the tryphine pollen coat (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). Pollen cell walls of Co#54 displayed an intermediate state of biogenesis with visible nexine layers, but incomplete arrangement of tectum and bacula structures as well as pollen coat material (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3J, K Fig.</xref>). As described above, these findings point to an incomplete complementation of <italic>fax1–2</italic> knockouts in pollen.</p>
<p>In conclusion, structural analysis of anthers and mature pollen grains showed that FAX1 is essential for biogenesis of the outer pollen cell wall, in particular for the assembly of exine and pollen coat. Both layers consist of complex biopolymers, such as sporopollenin (exine) and tryphine (pollen coat), that are mainly made of FA-derivatives and lipids originating from the tapetum tissue of anthers (sporophytic origin, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Thus, FAX1 might play a role in delivery of these compounds by mediating FA-export from tapetum cell plastids. Most likely, the electron-dense, sticky material in <italic>fax1</italic> knockout anthers that prevents release of pollen grains represents cellular debris of degenerated tapetum cells and/or not-incorporated sporopollenin or tryphine material.</p>

<title>FAX1 Affects Cell Wall Size and Cuticular Wax Composition</title>
<p>Because during analysis of <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants an altered surface of epidermal cells was apparent, we investigated structure as well as wax and cutin coverage of epidermis cells from primary inflorescence stalks of <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Microscopic analysis revealed that the width of epidermal cell walls in <italic>fax1–1</italic> was strongly reduced when compared to wild type (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). As for cell walls in xylem vessels (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>), a strong effect was only found for knockout and not for FAX1 over-expressing lines. However, an electron-dense cover at the extracellular side of the cell walls, most likely representing the cutin matrix of the cuticular layer, appeared to be more intense in ox#2, but reduced in <italic>fax1–1</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, C</xref>). To examine the constitution of the cuticular layer, we therefore determined wax and cutin coverage from stem epidermis cells. Surprisingly, the total loads of different wax and cutin species were not altered for all lines analyzed (<italic>fax1–1</italic>, <italic>fax1–2</italic>, Col-0, WT2, Co#7, Co#54, ox#2, ox#4, see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Data</xref>). Furthermore, no change in composition regarding aliphatic chain length or functional groups (e.g. ketones, acids or aldehydes) could be detected. The only significant difference we found was for C29-ketone wax components, which were reduced in both <italic>fax1</italic> knockout lines by more than 50% when compared to stems from all other plants (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>Since cutin contents were unchanged, the different strengths of the outer layer of epidermal cell walls observed by TEM most likely are due to stronger (ox#2) and weaker (<italic>fax1–1</italic>) crosslinking of the cutin matrix with cell walls. The wax composition of cuticular layers, however, is dependent on plastid FA-synthesis as well as excretion of modified FAs via the plasma membrane of epidermis cells (for overview, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). In parallel to the assembly of sporopollenin and tryphine material in pollen cell walls (see above), FAX1 might thus be necessary for plastid FA-export, previous to synthesis and release of ketone wax components.</p>

<title>Plastid FAX1 Impacts Cellular FA and Lipid Homeostasis</title>
<p>Because <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts revealed a lack of FA- and lipid-derived compounds in pollen as well as stem epidermis cells (see above), we measured free FAs and polar lipid species such as phospho-, sulfo-, galacto-lipids, and triacylglycerols in leaves and flowers of mature <italic>FAX1</italic> mutant plants (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). To spotlight changes in <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants compared to wild type, we determined relative values and summarized representatives of significantly different levels, as well as abundant species from each molecule class in the next two figures. For comparison to the overall FA/lipid composition of each tissue, we listed contents in mol% of all significantly different species in <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Tables, and further estimated the impact of changes in mol% of each molecule class in the next table.</p>
<p>In leaves of <italic>fax1</italic> knockout plants, levels of 30 FA and polar lipid species (irrespective of TAGs) were significantly different from wild type (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). For free FAs, we observed an increase of plastid-produced FA 18:2 (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref> Table) and a decrease for FAs 20:0, 24:0, 26:0 (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Table</xref>), which are elongated at the ER. Whereas aggregate levels of 34:x glycolipids (MGDG, DGDG, SQDG) were only slightly elevated (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref> Table), the highly abundant MGDG 36:6 (11.7 mol% in wt) with an ER-made diacylglycerol backbone was considerably less (2.7 mol%) than in wild type (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Table</xref>). The eukaryotic-type DGDG 36:6, however, increased contributing about 0.7 mol% more to the overall lipid content (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Table</xref>). Strong upward changes were observed for phosphatidyl-glycerol (PG) species (2.7- to 5-fold; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Table</xref>), leading to an entire gain of up to 3.2 mol% (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) of these mainly plastid-derived phospholipids. In contrast, the ER-produced phospholipids phosphatidyl-choline (PC) and -ethanolamine (PE) mostly decreased in <italic>fax1</italic> knockout leaves (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Table</xref>). Here the effect, in particular of highly abundant PC 34:3, PC 36:6 (9.3, 7.4 mol% in wt), was especially strong and is estimated to primarily contribute to a total reduction of PCs by 8.8 mol% (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Whereas the overall decrease of PE was about 0.5 mol%, phosphatidyl-inositol (PI) contents showed a pronounced upward fold change, which, however, only very slightly contributed to the overall lipid composition, and thus leaf PI might rather be involved in signaling (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Table</xref>).</p>

<p>Free fatty acid (FA) and polar lipid species were determined in leaf tissue of 7-week-old, mature flowering plants. Data (arbitrary units) are expressed relative to the internal standard (PC 34:0) and normalized to mg fresh weight (FW). For overview, we depict representatives of the most abundant species and those significantly different in <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants. A complete dataset with details on analysis is given in <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>; values in mol % are listed in <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>. Levels in FAX1 mutants significantly different to wild type are indicated by asterisks (Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, *: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). For a better resolution of differential patterns, <italic>y</italic>-axes are scaled differently. C<sub>16–18</sub> FAs are exclusively and glycolipids in (A) and (B) are mainly synthesized in plastids (for details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Discussion</xref>). Please note that the diacylglycerol backbone for the “34”-glycolipids can originate from prokaryotic (from plastids) and eukaryotic (from the ER) phospholipid precursors, respectively. C<sub>20–26</sub> FAs and phospholipids in (C) and (D), as well as precursors for “36”- glycolipids, are only produced outside plastids in the cytosol and/or ER. (A), (C) Free FA and lipid levels in caulinary leaves of <italic>fax1–1</italic>, <italic>fax1–2</italic> knockout and Col-0, WT2 wild-type lines (yellow and black bars, respectively) were determined by UPLC-Orbitrap MS [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Mean values (<italic>n</italic> = 6 ± SD), averaged over both <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts and both wild types, respectively, are shown. (B), (D) Free FA and lipid content (<italic>n</italic> = 6–12 ± SD) in caulinary leaves of the <italic>FAX1</italic> over-expressing line ox#4 and Col-0 wild type (green and black bars, respectively) was measured by UPLC-qTOF MS [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Please note that in comparison to the dataset in (A) and (C), usage of a different mass spectrometer results in different scaling of the relative values.

Here, without counting TAGs, 28 molecule species were significantly different from wild type (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B, D Table</xref>). Contents of all differentially regulated and mainly plastid-derived FAs, 34:x glycolipids (MGDG, DGDG, SQDG) as well as PG 34:2 dropped (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Table</xref>). A considerable impact on the total lipid content came from reduction of highly abundant molecules such as MGDG 34:5, 34:6; DGDG 34:2, 34:3; or SQDG 34:3, all with levels higher than 2 mol% in wild type. In consequence, the estimated overall reduction was about 2.8, 1.9, and 0.9 mol% for 34:x MGDG, DGDG, and SQDG, respectively (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For lipids produced by the eukaryotic pathway at the ER, we found a mild decrease of MGDG 36:5 (0.4 mol%) and only very minor changes (0.04–0.08 mol%) for SQDG 36:4, 36:5, and PE 34:3 (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Table</xref>). The effect on PC contents, however, again was quite strong (total increase of about 3.0 mol%, see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), including elevated levels of the abundant PC 34:1, 34:3, 36:2, and 36:3 (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Table</xref>).</p>
<p>When compared to leaves, flower tissue of <italic>fax1</italic> ko and FAX1ox lines showed a similar differential pattern of free FAs and lipids, which are presumably mainly produced via the prokaryotic pathway (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A, B Table</xref>). Whereas in <italic>fax1</italic>, FAs that after synthesis have to be exported from chloroplasts (i.e. 16:0, 18:0, 18:1) increased when compared to wild type (largest change for 16:0 = 0.24 mol%), the plastid internal FA 18:3 and the plastid external FA 24:0 decreased by about 0.1 mol% each (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A, C Table</xref>). In FAX1 ox flowers only a minor increase of FA 18:0 was detected (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Table</xref>). As found in leaves, overall levels of 34:x MGDG, DGDG, and SQDG increased in knockouts but decreased in over-expressors (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The most prominent changes were for MGDG 34:6 (increase of 0.6 mol% in <italic>fax1</italic>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Table</xref>) and for MGDG 34:5 (decrease of 0.3 mol% in FAX1ox, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Table</xref>).</p>
<p>For several lipid species, which are assembled at the ER, however, patterns in flowers were different and more diverse than in leaves. These included a rise in 36:x MGDG levels (dominated by +0.8 mol % of MGDG 36:6) in <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C Table</xref>); an increase and a decrease of about 0.45 mol% PE in <italic>fax1</italic> and FAX1ox, respectively (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>); as well as a strong reduction of PC in FAX1ox flowers (up to 5.6. mol%, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In <italic>fax1</italic> knockout flowers in contrast, PC (mostly PC 36:6 by-1.0 mol%; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C Table</xref>) and also PI species (-0.26 mol%) significantly dropped (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The most robust differential distribution in both mutant lines and tissues, however, was found for triacylglycerol oils (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Here we determined significant changes for more than half of the molecules measured (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). More important, however, was a massive decrease of high and low abundant TAGs in <italic>fax1</italic> knockout leaves (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Table</xref>) and flowers (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Table</xref>) as well as a strong increase in FAX1ox leaves (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Table</xref>) and flowers (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D Table</xref>). Fold changes were highest for low abundant TAGs (e.g., 8.3-fold decrease for TAG 56:7 in <italic>fax1</italic> leaves, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Table</xref>). As expected, the biggest impact on overall TAG content was by significant changes in high abundant species, resulting in a drop of-4.3 and-7.2 mol% in leaves and flowers of <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts and an accumulation of +3.2 and +6.6 mol% for leaf and flower tissue from FAX1ox lines, respectively (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>In summary, determination of free FAs and lipids in <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants clearly shows that the function of FAX1 in the IE membrane of chloroplasts impacts cellular FA and lipid homeostasis. Overall we found significant differences compared to wild type for more than 50% of all species determined (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Together with the observed lack of FA- or lipid-derived compounds in <italic>fax1</italic> knockout pollen cell walls and cuticular waxes (see above), these findings point to a function of FAX1 in FA-export from plastids (for details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<title>FAX1 Is Able to Mediate FA-Transport into Yeast Cells</title>
<p>In baker’s yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) import of exogenous long-chain FAs by the so-called vectorial acylation process requires a multiprotein complex, which consists of Fat1p (the membrane-spanning transport protein) and Faa1p or Faa4p, acyl-CoA synthetases for intracellular FA activation [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In order to test a potential FA-transport function of FAX1, we thus analyzed growth complementation of the yeast <italic>fat1</italic> and <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> mutants, which represent knockouts for Fat1p and Faa1p/Faa4p, respectively [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, we transformed the coding sequence of the mature At-FAX1 protein into <italic>fat1</italic> and <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> cells. Since previous studies revealed that the uptake of the polyunsaturated FA α-linolenic acid (C<sub>18:3</sub>) into yeast cells was toxic for wild-type but not for <italic>fat1</italic> cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we challenged growth of FAX1-containing yeast mutants by addition of high α-linolenic acid concentrations (3.6 mM) to the media (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A–C</xref>). In drop tests on agar plates, all cells showed normal growth under control conditions (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, left). In addition, yeast mutant cells, transformed with the empty vector only, were resistant to excess α-linolenic acid (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, right). However, <italic>fat1</italic> cells expressing the mature At-FAX1 protein died in the presence of α-linolenic acid overload (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, right), indicating that FAX1 is able to restore FA-uptake in <italic>fat1</italic> mutants. In contrast, α-linolenic acid induced cell death was not observed in <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> cells, neither with nor without FAX1, pointing to a FAX1 function in FA-transport and not in FA-activation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we monitored a very similar behavior for growth kinetics of the respective yeast cells in liquid media (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B, C</xref>). Here, a FAX1-mediated toxicity of α-linolenic acid was significant after 18 h when compared to empty vector cells. While this effect was highly significant and strong in <italic>fat1</italic> mutants as indicated by a reduction of cell density to about 54% after 29 h (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>), only a mild growth inhibition was detected in Δ<italic>faa1/faa4</italic> (density of FAX1 cells was about 78% of control cells after 29 h; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). In addition, when compared to vector-only cells grown without α-linolenic acid, we observed a slight growth reduction by addition of α-linolenic acid itself as well as for FAX1-transformed cells in absence of α-linolenic acid, independent of yeast mutant strains (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B, C</xref>). Whereas the former observation can be explained by unspecific, background uptake of α-linolenic acid provided at excess external concentrations, the latter effect might be due to a general, but minor, toxic effect of FAX1 expression in yeast.</p>
<p>To assess specificity of FAX1 for FAs, which have to be exported from chloroplasts in vivo, i.e., palmitic (C<sub>16:0</sub>), stearic (C<sub>18:0</sub>), and oleic acid (C<sub>18:1</sub>), we performed additional yeast growth complementation assays in the presence of the FA-biosynthesis inhibitor cerulenin and supply of moderate external FA concentrations (i.e., 100 μM; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref>). Results with rapidly (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A–C Fig.</xref>) and non-exponentially growing cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D Fig.</xref>) allowed definition of a potential substrate specificity of FAX1, preferring C<sub>16:0</sub> over C<sub>18:1</sub> and C<sub>18:0</sub> FAs (for details see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Discussion</xref>). When we tested α-linolenic acid (C<sub>18:3</sub>), which in planta is not exported from plastids (see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]), as a control in this assay, FAX1 specificity was in the range as for stearic/oleic acid, but significantly lower than for palmitic acid (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig.</xref>).</p>

<p>In summary, our results show that the protein FAX1 in the IE of plastids is able to mediate FA-export as supported by the following findings: (i) FA-transport function of FAX1 in yeast; (ii) differential distribution of ER- and plastid-derived FAs/lipids in <italic>FAX1</italic> mutant plants; (iii) male sterility of <italic>fax1</italic> knockout lines, caused by impaired delivery of FA-derived compounds; (iv) decreased ketone wax compounds in cuticular layers of <italic>fax1</italic> knockout stems; (v) a focus on differential expression of genes for acyl lipid as well as carbohydrate and cellular/cell wall metabolism in <italic>FAX1</italic> mutant lines (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>).</p>

<title>On the Function of FAX1</title>
<p>Complementation of the yeast <italic>fat1</italic>, but not of the <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> mutant, indicates that FAX1 is acting only in membrane transfer of FAs and not in FA-activation. This is in contrast to, for example, yeast and human FA-transporters such as Fat1p and FATPs, which in addition have acyl-activating functional domains [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. FAX proteins group into the Tmemb_14 family and thus most likely contain three hydrophobic, membrane-spanning α-helical domains and one amphiphilic helix at the lipid bilayer/water interface. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the latter might be responsible for binding and transfer of FA-chains across the IE membrane. Once loaded with a FA produced in the plastid stroma, this α-helix might become lipophilic enough to fold into the lipid bilayer and flip FAs over the IE. Furthermore, FAX1 and also FAX2 (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) contain an extended N-terminal region (gray helix in <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Structural modeling indicates that these stretches fold into additional, most likely non-membrane associated α-helices: one for FAX1, two for FAX2, respectively. Interestingly, the two anti-parallel helices of the FAX2 N-terminus fit to sequence and structure of a ‘four-helical up-and-down bundle’ of the human apolipoprotein apoE3, which is involved in lipid transport and binding during formation of lipoprotein particles. Amphiphilic α-helices in the C-terminus of apoE3 are described to bind to lipids and thereby induce a conformational change in the N-terminal helix bundle that allows detergent-like solubilization of lipids and formation of lipoprotein particles (for overview, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Therefore, the N-terminal helices of plastid FAX proteins might be involved in similar functions during FA-transport. The different apparent molecular weights observed for FAX1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig.</xref>), most likely resulting from discrete conformations and/or packing of membrane domains, support these hypotheses for a transport mode. Once at the intermembrane space, FA-handover from FAX1 to substrate binding proteins, and transport across the OE membrane via a ß-barrel protein might be possible. For plastid re-import of eukaryotic lipids for example, the latter two proteins are represented by TGD2 (substrate binding) and TGD4 (OE ß-barrel, [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Furthermore, in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, a similar system has been described for export of lipopolysaccharides, including an ABC transporter that flips the lipid moiety across the inner membrane, transfer proteins in the periplasm, and a ß-barrel protein in the outer membrane [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For plastids, subsequently an acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) at the cytosolic face of the OE might finally drive FA-transfer in a passive, carrier-like process. Co-expression of At-FAX1 with LACS4 (ATTED-II coexpression networks), and regulation of LACS1, 3, and 5 expression in <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>) underline a possible cooperation with ACS.</p>
<p>The close structural similarity of FAX proteins to the human TMEM14A and TMEM14C, which both localize to mitochondrial membranes, in the future might enable explanation of TMEM14 protein function in vertebrates. Whereas TMEM14C was identified to coexpress with the core machinery of heme biosynthesis and its knockdown causes anemia in zebrafish [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], TMEM14A was described to stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential and thereby inhibit apoptosis in a yeast system [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, their exact biological function is still unknown. Since animal mitochondria are the site for FA-degradation via ß-oxidation, a role for TMEM14 proteins in FA/lipid homeostasis, energy metabolism or disease (e.g., apoptosis) in vertebrates might be possible.</p>

<title>FAX1 Function Impacts Cellular Lipid Homeostasis</title>
<p>Levels and subcellular distribution of free FAs and polar lipids in Arabidopsis <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants mainly correlated with a FA-export function, by which FAX1 influences cellular FA and acyl lipid homeostasis (for overview, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Most likely because of their toxicity and high metabolic fluxes for primary metabolites, changes in free FAs were not very pronounced. However, very-long–chain FAs (C<sub>20</sub>), which are elongated outside plastids and thus require previous export of C<sub>16–18</sub> FAs, were significantly reduced in <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). According to acyl-ACP synthesis rates and specificity of thioesterases in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplasts, oleic acid (C<sub>18:1</sub>) is the major free FA exported from chloroplasts, followed by palmitic acid (C<sub>16:0</sub>) and only very little amounts of stearic acid (C<sub>18:0</sub>; compare [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). FAX1 in yeast assays performed best for FA 16:0 (determined specificity range: 16:0 &gt; 18:1 ~ 18:0 ~ 18:3) and thus, most likely, mainly is involved in the plastid export of free palmitic acid but also can transport oleic acid, which at the stromal side of the plastid IE is provided at highest substrate concentrations. The fact that in yeast, FAX1 was also able to transport α-linolenic acid (C<sub>18:3</sub>), which in planta is retained inside plastids, indicates that the protein does not discriminate between different degrees of unsaturation, but in general prefers C<sub>16</sub> over C<sub>18</sub> FAs. In chloroplast IE membranes, FAX1 most likely functions in a passive, carrier-like mode, driven by concentration gradients of free FA substrates (see above). Interestingly, accumulation of export-directed C<sub>16–18</sub> FAs in flower tissue of <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts (+0.24 &gt; +0.04 &gt; +0.01 mol% for 16:0 &gt; 18:0 &gt; 18:1), reflect the substrate specificity range of FAX1 in yeast (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Table</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref>). Furthermore, non-exported FA 18:3 significantly decreased (0.14 mol%; <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Table</xref>) in flowers of <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts, thereby maybe pointing to stronger fluxes of FAs into plastid-intrinsic pathways (e.g., synthesis of oxilipin hormones), due to a block in FA export via FAX1.</p>
<p>Besides changes in free FAs, 65% of the differential lipid patterns depicted in <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> underline the hypothesis of plastid FA-export via FAX1, best documented by the strong reciprocal changes in TAG oils. Here for almost 90% of all significantly distributed TAGs (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>), the pattern in both <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants and tissues perfectly matched to a FA-export function of FAX1. The distribution of 34:x glycolipids (MGDG, DGDG, SQDG), which increased in <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts but decreased in FAX1 over-expressors, also corresponded to our theory. In this case, we can, however, not exclude a contribution of ER-made species, since the diacylglycerol backbone for the “34”-glycolipids can originate both, from prokaryotic (from plastids) and eukaryotic (from the ER) phospholipid precursors, respectively. Yet, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is a so-called 16:3 plant, which for galactolipids prefers the prokaryotic pathway with high levels of 16:3 acyl chains. In contrast, ER-derived “34” DAG-backbones contain 16:0 saturated acyl moieties (compare [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). Thus, we can assume that MGDG 34:x and DGDG 34:x with more than four desaturated C-bonds are completely synthesized in plastids. For the strong MGDG 34:x reductions in FAX1ox leaves and flowers (2.8 and 0.5 mol%, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and the increase in <italic>fax1</italic> flowers (+0.7 mol%) indeed 34:4, 34:5 and 34:6 are the major contributing species (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) and therefore support our hypothesis. Most likely at least the abundant forms of phosphatidyl-glycerol (PG 34:3, 34:4) are exclusively made inside plastids as well (see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]), and thus the pronounced overall increase of PG in <italic>fax1</italic> leaf tissue (+3.2 mol%) also mainly is due to a block of FA-export via FAX1.</p>
<p>Our assumption that FAX1 mediates plastid FA-export is further confirmed by a large decrease of PC-levels in <italic>fax1</italic> knockout tissues (up to 8.8 mol%) and a strong increase of PC in FAX1ox leaves (+3.0 mol%). However, also, considerable contrasting evidence is found for three ER-made lipids in flower tissue (i.e., +0.9–1.0 mol% MGDG 36:x, DGDG 36:x in <italic>fax1</italic>; -5.6 mol% PC in FAX1ox). The latter findings that only apply to lipid species synthesized in the cytosol/ER of flowers might be explained by the inhomogeneity of mature flowers, consisting of leaf, stalk, pollen, ovary, and seed/silique tissues, and/or by a preferential flow of FA-building blocks for lipids into TAG oils during seed development. Furthermore, for the bilayer-forming DGDG 36:x, a plastid export is described to act as surrogate lipid for the lack of PC at, e.g., phosphate-limited growth conditions (see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and references therein). Thus, the observed increase of DGDG 36:x species in <italic>fax1</italic> knockout mutants might compensate for the strong decrease of PC in the same tissues (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002053.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, levels and subcellular distribution of free FAs and polar lipids in <italic>Arabidopsis FAX1</italic> mutants mainly support a plastid FA-export function of FAX1. In addition, we can, however, not exclude plastid FA-export via different mechanisms or a bypass by other plastid FAX proteins (see below). Due to this potential functional redundancy of plastid FAX proteins, mutation of FAX1 alone does not affect all lipid species present in plants. Effects in leaf tissue, in particular of <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts are somewhat more straightforward and stronger than in FAX1 over-expressing lines. The latter is not unexpected for mutation of a protein involved in transport, which is highly expressed in leaf tissues (see below and <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig.</xref>). However, the impact of FAX1 mutation on TAG-oil levels might be of future biotechnological importance. Interestingly, already the enhanced FA-transport by FAX1 was able to significantly increase TAG contents in leaves and flower tissues. Furthermore, our finding is in line with higher TAG when FA-loading to the ER in seeds is improved by over-expression of the ABC transporter ABCA9 [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, coupling of the bottlenecks FA-transport (e.g., FAX1, ABCA9) with those of FA-synthesis and acyl-editing processes and a seed-specific expression might boost plant oil production in future approaches.</p>

<title>The Role of FAX1 in Plant Development</title>
<p>Transcripts of <italic>At-FAX1</italic> are present in all developmental stages and peak in leaf tissues (cotyledons, rosette, caulinary, senescent leaves, and flower sepals) as well as in early pollen development (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A–C Fig.</xref>). Consequentially, the strongest phenotype of <italic>fax1</italic> knockout mutants can be observed during growth (e.g., reduced rosette leaf size and biomass) and in particular in pollen grains, leading to almost complete male sterility due to the absence of pollen cell walls and impaired pollen release by anthers. For FAX1, we propose a function in FA-export from plastids of tapetum cells in anthers, which in <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts leads to the strongly impaired assembly of exine layers and pollen coat, most likely because of the lack of FA-precursors for sporopollenin and/or tryphine synthesis (for a detailed description, see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>).</p>
<p>Since FAX1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> belongs to a family of seven proteins, the plastid-predicted FAX2, 3, and 4, whose expression is regulated throughout plant development as well (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig.</xref>), most likely can bypass the loss of FAX1 function in all tissues and organs, leading to the rather mild overall phenotype of <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts. Especially in seed tissue (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5D, E Fig.</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig.</xref>), FAX2, 3, and 4 most likely play a more prominent role than FAX1. Indeed transcripts for <italic>FAX2</italic> and <italic>FAX3</italic>—i.e., the highest plastid <italic>FAX</italic> genes in seed development and germination—showed to be significantly up-regulated (1.13- and 1.24-fold) in <italic>fax1</italic> knockout flowers. Please note that with a relative signal of 1585 in wild type, <italic>FAX2</italic> and <italic>FAX3</italic> are strongly expressed in flower tissue we used for microarray analysis (among highest 9% of all genes on the chip; compare microarray dataset E-MTAB-3090 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress" xlink:type="simple">www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The function of FAX1 in FA-delivery for pollen cell wall as well as for cuticular wax assembly is further underlined by differential gene expression in <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>), and by the occurrence of phenotypes similar to <italic>fax1</italic> when biosynthesis pathways for FA/lipid-derived precursor material are mutated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. These include a plastid-intrinsic fatty-acyl-ACP reductase (AlcFAR2/MS2), involved in primary fatty alcohol synthesis for anther cuticle and pollen sporopollenin formation [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; as well as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP703A2, CYP704B1; [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) that hydroxylate FAs, and the ACS ACOS5 [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] that activates FAs for sporopollenin synthesis in the cytosol of anther cells. Furthermore, several long-chain ACS (LACS1, 2, 4) are necessary to activate long-chain and very-long–chain FAs for building of cutin and wax as well as pollen exine layers [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, several ABC transporters in the plasma membrane are required for deposition of surface lipids, displaying <italic>fax1</italic>-like phenotypes upon mutation: ABCG26 for pollen exine formation from tapetum cells, as well as ABCG11, G12, and G13 in lipid export from epidermis cells for formation of cuticular wax layers (for overview, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). As for FAX1, pathways for synthesis of precursors of pollen cell wall and cutin/wax components often overlap. In stems of <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts, we further identified strong regulation of two genes involved in wax biosynthesis: AlcFAR3/CER4 and CYP96A15/MAH1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>). Because the latter enzyme is catalyzing synthesis of wax ketone components, its differential expression is in line with the observed lack of C29 ketones in <italic>fax1</italic> knockout stems.</p>
<p>Besides deranged acyl lipid homeostasis, obviously also carbohydrate and cellular/cell wall metabolism was affected in <italic>FAX1</italic> mutants as reflected by the impact on plant biomass production and differential regulation of gene expression (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref> Figs.). In general, we assume that these effects are rather secondary and most likely might result from still unknown signaling events, due to changed FA/lipid homeostasis. Since <italic>fax1</italic> knockout plants are short of energy-rich lipids, they most likely turn down anabolic carbohydrate metabolism required for polysaccharide synthesis, resulting in, e.g., reduced biomass and secondary cell walls. The opposite effect is observed in <italic>FAX1</italic> over-expressors, in which an excess of lipids most likely leads to more biomass and the production of additional cell layers in stems. These observations clearly demonstrate regulation of energy metabolism and a close correlation between the availability of FAs/lipids and the utilization of carbohydrates in growth processes. This link is further underlined by the finding that the flow of carbon into oil can be promoted by activating plastid FA synthesis and repressing starch synthesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this context FAX1, to our knowledge, is not only the first membrane protein identified that mediates FA-export from plastids, but FAX1 and its relatives represent key transport proteins and thus—together with enzymes of FA/lipid-synthesis and modification—might provide powerful future tools to modulate plant lipid and bioenergy production [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>

<p>For each independent harvest (2-times for <italic>fax1</italic> knockout, 4-times for <italic>FAX1</italic> over-expressing lines) cauline leaves and flowers (stage 10–15, according to [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]) were sampled from at least ten individual, 7-week-old plants and grinded in liquid nitrogen. To be able to work on tissue of identical sample pools (i.e., from 7-week-old plants) for wax/cutin analysis, FA/lipid determination, and transcript profiling, as well as because FAX1 is highly expressed in cauline leaves (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig.</xref>), we chose the latter instead of old rosette leaves. Tissue powder of each harvest was portioned into three aliquots of 50 mg, which were used to determine polar lipid and free FA contents. For details on data analysis, see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. Lipids/FAs were extracted from six (<italic>fax1</italic> k.o) to 12 (<italic>FAX1</italic> over-expressors) biological replicates using 1 ml of a pre-cooled (−20°C) methanol:methyl-tert-butyl-ether (1:3) mixture, spiked with 0.1 μg/ml PC 34:0 (17:0, 17:0) as internal standard. The samples were incubated for 10 min at 4˚C, followed by another 10 min incubation in an ice-cooled ultrasonication bath. After adding 650 μl of UPLC grade water:methanol (3:1), the homogenate was vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min in a table top centrifuge. The addition of water:methanol leads to a phase separation producing an upper organic phase, containing the lipids, and a lower phase containing the polar and semi-polar metabolites. The upper organic phase was removed, dried in a speed-vac concentrator, and re-suspended in 500 μl buffer B (see below) and transferred to a glass vial. 2 μl of this sample were injected onto a C8 reversed phase column (100 mm × 2.1 mm × 1.7 μm particles BEH C8, Waters), using a Waters Acquity UPLC system. The two mobile phases were water (UPLC MS grade, BioSolve) with 1% 1 M NH4Ac, 0.1% acetic acid (buffer A), and acetonitrile:isopropanol (7:3, UPLC grade BioSolve) containing 1% 1 M NH4Ac, 0.1% acetic acid (buffer B). The gradient separation, which was performed at a ﬂow rate of 400 μl/min, was 1 min 45% A, 3 min linear gradient from 45% A to 35% A, 8 min linear gradient from 25 to 11% A, 3 min linear gradient from 11% A to 1% A. After washing the column for 3 min with 1% A the buffer was set back to 45% A and the column was re-equilibrated for 4 min (22 min total run time). Mass spectra were acquired as described [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] using either an Orbitrap Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher) for <italic>fax1</italic> knockout lines or a Waters Synapt G1 (Waters) for <italic>FAX1</italic> over-expressors, and corresponding wild types, respectively. The spectra were recorded using altering full scan and all-ion fragmentation scan mode, covering a mass range from 100–1,500 m/z. The resolution was set to 10,000 with 10 scans per second. Spectra were recorded from min 0 to min 20 of the UPLC gradients. The analysis of the spectra (alignment, peal picking, normalization and peak integration) was performed with the software package CoMet 2.0 (Nonlinear Dynamics) according to the instructions of the vendor.</p>

<title>Complementation of FA Uptake in Yeast</title>
<p>For growth assays in yeast, the coding sequence of the mature At-FAX1 protein was subcloned into the yeast expression plasmid pDR195 (XhoI/BamHI). Therefore, we fused the open reading frame of the predicted mature At-FAX1, starting with aa 34 of the preprotein, behind an “ATG” base triplet by PCR amplification. The yeast mutant strains <italic>fat1</italic> (LS2020-YB332) and <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> (LS1849-YB525) are specified in [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Both strains were transformed with mature At-FAX1/pDR195 and the vector control pDR195 as described [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. If not denoted elsewhere, liquid cultures of the respective yeast cells were grown to exponential phase in synthetic defined medium (SD-ura), containing 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, and necessary auxotrophic amino acids without uracil. Subsequently, 2 μl drops of the cultures were spotted in different dilutions onto SD-ura plates (2% agar), supplemented with 3.6 mM α-linolenic acid (0.1%, w/v in ethanol), and 1% tergitol (to increase α-linolenic acid solubility). For control plates, an equal amount of the solvent ethanol was added instead of α-linolenic acid. Assays in the presence of cerulenin were performed according to [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in SD-ura media supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% Brij 58, 0.7% KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10μM cerulenin and either 100μM of palmitic, stearic, oleic or α-linolenic acid. Growth of yeast cells on solid media was documented between 2 to 6 days at 30°C. OD<sub>600</sub> measurements were performed in identical liquid media, inoculated to a starting OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05 or 0.06/0.03 for cerulenin experiments with the respective yeast cells. Cultures were continuously shaken at 30°C and the OD at 600nm was determined at indicated time points.</p>

Raw signal intensity values (CEL files) were computed from the scanned array images using the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console 3.0. For quality check and normalization, the raw intensity values were processed with Robin software [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] default settings as described [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Specifically, for background correction, the robust multiarray average normalization method [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] was performed across all arrays (between-array method). Statistical analysis of differential gene expression of mutant versus wild-type samples was carried out using the linear model-based approach developed by [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In total, we analyzed the following comparisons (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig.</xref>): (A) flowers: <italic>fax1</italic> knockout (<italic>n</italic> = 5) versus wild type (<italic>n</italic> = 5); (B) flowers: <italic>FAX1</italic> over-expressors (<italic>n</italic> = 8, four times each ox#2, ox#4) versus wild type (<italic>n</italic> = 5); (C) stems: <italic>fax1</italic> knockout (<italic>n</italic> = 4) versus wild type (<italic>n</italic> = 4).

(B) RT-PCR analysis of the <italic>FAX1</italic> transcript content in leaves and flowers of homozygous <italic>fax1–1</italic>, <italic>fax1–2</italic> knockout lines, Col-0 wild type, and wild type segregated from heterozygous <italic>fax1–2</italic> line (wt2). RNA was prepared from 7-week-old plants and reverse transcribed into cDNA [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. PCR reactions were conducted with gene-specific primers for <italic>FAX1</italic> (LCfw and LCrev, 265 bp product on wild-type cDNA). For primer positions, see (A). As control, constitutively expressed actin 2/8 (PCR product of 435 bp) was analyzed. (C) Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed as described [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] on RNA, isolated from 14-day-old seedlings of <italic>FAX1</italic> wild type (Col-0 and wt2), <italic>fax1–2</italic> complementation (Co#7, Co#54), and <italic>FAX1</italic> overexpressing (ox#2, ox#4) lines. The transcript content was quantified relative to 10,000 molecules of actin 2/8 mRNA (<italic>n</italic> = 3; ±SD) and normalized to the amount in Col-0, which was set to 1.0 (for numerical values, see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Data</xref>). Please note that the <italic>y</italic>-axis for ox#4 (right) is scaled up 10-fold. (D) Immunoblot of At-FAX1 on total protein extracts isolated from leaf material of 30-day-old <italic>fax1–2</italic>, Col-0, Co#54, ox#2, ox#4 plants (see [C]). Please note that for detection of signals in all samples, different amounts of protein were loaded: 80, 80, 40, 80, and 5μg, respectively. Antiserum against the inner envelope protein TIC62 was used as loading control. For comparison, purified inner envelope membranes from pea (IE, 40μg protein) were stained with Ps-FAX1 antiserum. Numbers indicate the molecular mass of proteins in kDa. Please note that the band at 25kDa represents the main signal for FAX1 in all samples (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). However, around 23kDa a second band becomes visible, when a high amount of protein is loaded (triangles). When FAX1 is overexpressed (Co#54, ox#4), this band represents a strong signal and therefore most likely corresponds to FAX1 proteins with a more packed conformation. In addition, several other signals appear in FAX1 overexpression lines (asterisks). All bands are absent in <italic>fax1–2</italic> knockout leaves and can thus be regarded as specific for FAX1.</p>

<title>FA-transport specificity of FAX1 in yeast.</title>
<p>The mature At-FAX1 cDNA in pDR195 (FAX1) and the empty plasmid pDR195 (-) were introduced into <italic>fat1</italic> and <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> yeast mutants, respectively (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Growth assays were performed in the presence of 5–10 μM cerulenin (CER, inhibitor of FA-biosynthesis) and 100μM FAs according to [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To test for FAs, which in planta have to be exported from chloroplasts (see [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]), we used palmitic acid (PAL, C<sub>16:0</sub>), stearic acid (STE, C<sub>18:0</sub>), and oleic acid (OLE, C<sub>18:1</sub>). For results with the control α-linolenic acid (LIN, C<sub>18:3</sub>), which in vivo is not exported from plastids, see (B), right panel, and <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>. (A), (B) For growth on solid medium, 2 μl of exponentially growing yeast cells (diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1/ml) were grown at 30°C on SD-ura plates (2% glucose, 0.5% Brij 58, 0.7% KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) in the presence of 10μM (A) and 5μM (B) CER, respectively. Cartoon: distribution of different strains on plates. Whereas <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> mutants (on lower halves of plates) did not grow at all, <italic>fat1</italic> cells transformed with the empty plasmid (-, upper right quarter) showed colonies in all assays after four to six days of incubation. In contrast, growth of <italic>fat1</italic> with FAX1 (upper left quarter on plates with 10μM CER in [A]) was strongly restricted in the presence of PAL (left) and reduced with STE (middle) and OLE (right panel). In the presence of 5μM CER (B), growth inhibition by FAX1 was not as strong but still differential, resulting in an OD<sub>600</sub>/ml of all cells grown in the upper left quarter of 2.5 (for PAL), 3.6 (for STE), 4.0 (for OLE, see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Data</xref>), and 4.5 (for LIN), respectively.

Red bars and numbers indicate maximal difference of cell density ratios, for numerical values see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Data</xref>. As on plates in (A) and (B), liquid cultures of <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> cells did not grow (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Data</xref>). (C) Cell growth at 30°C was started with an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.06 from exponentially growing cultures and was monitored from 15 h (all cells at OD<sub>600</sub> 0.2) until 45 h (left) and 65 h (middle, right graphs). In general, growth curves reflected behavior on plates in (A). Whereas growth of <italic>fat1</italic> (FAX1, black triangles) in comparison to <italic>fat1</italic> (-, white circles) was strongly inhibited by PAL (left), reduction of cell amplification in the presence of STE (middle) and OLE (right) was less. Please note different scaling of <italic>y</italic>-axes. For comparison to LIN, see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref> (please note that in the latter assay growth of all cells was delayed, when compared to curves in [C]). (D) Growth curves of slowly amplifying <italic>fat1</italic> cells. In contrast to (C), cell growth was started with an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.03 from non-exponentially growing cultures and monitored for 60 h incubation at 30°C. Please note that in slow-growing, diluted cell suspensions, FAX1 (black triangles) can complement for the lack of FAs. Here, the strongest growth promotion was with OLE (3.9-fold), followed by PAL (2.9-fold) and STE (2.5-fold). Without CER—i.e. no inhibition of intrinsic FA-synthesis—cells entered a logarithmic, rapid growth phase between 15–20 h, and differences in cell density were only marginal (&lt;1.5), except for OLE between 14–20 h, which reflected differences in cell density ratios at 60 h in the presence of CER (<xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Data</xref>). <bold>FA-transport specificity of FAX1 in yeast</bold>: Due to the results depicted in (A)–(D), we conclude that in yeast, FAX1 is able to transport all FAs that are exported from chloroplasts in planta, but prefers palmitic (C<sub>16:0</sub>) over oleic (C<sub>18:1</sub>) and stearic acid (C<sub>18:0</sub>). Between the latter two, however, we were unable to distinguish specificity. FAX1 transport of α-linolenic acid (C<sub>18:3</sub>), a polyunsaturated FA, which in planta has not been described to be exported from chloroplasts, was in the range of oleic/stearic acid but significantly lower than for palmitic acid (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). <bold>Discussion</bold>: In general, CER inhibits FA-biosynthesis, and thereby growth of yeast cells becomes dependent on FA-uptake from the extracellular medium. Depending whether we used slow or rapidly growing yeast cells, we found opposite effects for FAX1. (<bold>1</bold>.) In slow-growing <italic>fat1</italic> cells (D), FAX1 could partly complement growth defects in the presence of CER, most likely by mediating uptake of FAs (assay for yeast Fat1, compare Fig. 2 in [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). Without FAX1, in contrast, growth inhibition of <italic>fat1</italic> (-) cells was strong over the time course of the experiment. The growth promoting effect of FAX1 was highest for oleic acid (C<sub>18:1</sub>), followed by palmitic (C<sub>16:0</sub>) and stearic acid (C<sub>18:0</sub>), and thus exactly reflecting the in planta situation (see below). Although FAX1 most likely is not directly linked to yeast endogenous FA-activation and metabolism (see below), strong inhibition of FA-synthesis by CER in highly diluted, slow-growing cell cultures most likely pushes free FAs transported by FAX1 into yeast intrinsic FA-metabolism pathways. (<bold>2</bold>.) In long-term growth of rapidly amplifying <italic>fat1</italic> cells (A, B, and C), however, FAX1 was inducing growth inhibition that was strongest for palmitic acid (C<sub>16:0</sub>), followed by stearic (C<sub>18:0</sub>), oleic acid (C<sub>18:1</sub>), and the control α-linolenic acid (C<sub>18:3</sub>). We therefore conclude that the presence of FAX1 during prolonged incubation of these cells leads to an accumulation of toxic free FAs and in consequence growth arrest as observed for an excess of α-linolenic acid (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A–C</xref>). Since FAX1—unlike the yeast Fat1 protein—probably is not directly interacting and co-operating with the endogenous acyl-CoA synthetases for intracellular FA-activation (Faa1p or Faa4p), extended FAX1 FA-uptake most likely leads to a surplus of toxic free FAs, which can’t be efficiently esterified to CoA for subsequent metabolism. In contrast, <italic>fat1</italic> cells without FAX1 (transformed with empty vector control) were able to grow after 6 days on plate (A), (B) and about 24 h in liquid culture (C). This late growth activation can be explained by a decline of FA-biosynthesis inhibition by CER at high cell densities, presumably in combination with a bypass of FA-uptake either by yeast intrinsic transporters and/or passive diffusion through membranes. Both hypotheses are supported by the following findings: (i) no growth of <italic>fat1</italic> (-) at low cell densities (strong CER effect, see above); (ii) less pronounced differences in growth promotion/inhibition with 5μM CER (B) or 50μM of FAs (see <xref rid="pbio.1002053.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Data</xref>); (iii) no growth of <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> cells in presence of CER, due to the lack of FA-activation for subsequent metabolism. In summary, the observed growth effects are nontrivial, because of simultaneous interference with yeast FA-biosynthesis (CER), FA-transport, and FA-activation (<italic>fat1</italic>, <italic>faa1/faa4</italic> mutants). Furthermore, toxicity effects of accumulating free PAL, STE, OLE or LIN might be diverse. However, we can show reproducible and specific results for FAX1 and define a substrate specificity range. According to acyl-ACP synthesis rates and specificity of thioesterases in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplasts, oleic acid (C<sub>18:1</sub>) is the major FA exported, followed by palmitic acid (C<sub>16:0</sub>) and only little amounts of stearic acid (C<sub>18:0</sub>; compare [<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002053.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). FAX1 in our yeast assays preferred FA 16:0 over 18:1 and 18:0 and thus most likely mainly is involved in the plastid export of palmitic acid. Because these observations were made in vivo, but in a heterologous and nontrivial system, we can, however, only approach the in planta situation.</p>

Data analysis details: For <italic>fax1</italic> knockouts, analysis was performed on tissue from two independent <italic>fax1–1</italic>, <italic>fax1–2</italic> knockout and Col-0, WT2 wild-type lines, separately harvested for two times. For FAX1 over-expressors the two independent lines ox#2 and ox#4 were compared to Col-0 wild type in four different harvests. For each harvest, cauline leaves and flowers were sampled from at least ten individual plants and tissue powder was portioned into three aliquots. In total this resulted in <italic>n</italic> = 12 data points for each molecule species, determined in each genotype (<italic>fax1</italic> knockout, FAX1 over-expressor, and wild types). Significance analysis of mutant to wild-type differences was performed over all harvests and lines in each tissue.
