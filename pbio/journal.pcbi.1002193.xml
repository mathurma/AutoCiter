        <p>Extensive experimental information supports the formation of ligand-specific conformations of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as a possible molecular basis for their functional selectivity for signaling pathways. Taking advantage of the recently published inactive and active crystal structures of GPCRs, we have implemented an all-atom computational strategy that combines different adaptive biasing techniques to identify ligand-specific conformations along pre-determined activation pathways. Using the prototypic GPCR β2-adrenergic receptor as a suitable test case for validation, we show that ligands with different efficacies (either inverse agonists, neutral antagonists, or agonists) modulate the free-energy landscape of the receptor by shifting the conformational equilibrium towards active or inactive conformations depending on their elicited physiological response. Notably, we provide for the first time a quantitative description of the thermodynamics of the receptor in an explicit atomistic environment, which accounts for the receptor basal activity and the stabilization of different active-like states by differently potent agonists. Structural inspection of these metastable states reveals unique conformations of the receptor that may have been difficult to retrieve experimentally.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute one of the most important classes of cellular targets owing to their known response to a host of extracellular stimuli, and consequent involvement in numerous vital biological processes. Compelling evidence herein referred to as ‘functional selectivity’ shows that ligands with varied efficacies can stabilize different GPCR conformations that may selectively interact with different intracellular proteins, and therefore induce different biological responses. Understanding how this selectivity is achieved may lead to the discovery of drugs with improved therapeutic properties. We propose here a computational strategy that enables identification of the specific conformations assumed by a GPCR when interacting with ligands that elicit different physiological responses. Not only can these computational models help bridge the information gap in structural biology of GPCRs, but they can be used for virtual screening, and possibly lead to the structure-based rational discovery of novel ‘biased’ ligands that are capable of selectively activating one cellular signaling pathway over another.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are versatile signaling proteins that functionally couple a host of extracellular stimuli to intracellular effectors, thus mediating several vital cellular responses. The majority of marketed drugs act as agonists, inverse agonists, or antagonists at these receptors depending on whether they increase, reduce, or have no effect on the so-called ‘basal activity’ that characterizes unliganded GPCRs for diffusible ligands. Not only can a specific GPCR activate different G-protein or arrestin isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Lefkowitz1">[1]</xref>, but a single ligand can display different efficacy for different signaling pathways, an observation that has been dubbed “functional selectivity”, “agonist trafficking”, “biased agonism”, “differential engagement”, or “protean agonism” in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Kenakin1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Urban1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>At the molecular level, a simple explanation for this phenomenon is that ligands with varied efficacies can shift the conformational equilibrium of a GPCR towards different conformations of the receptor, which in turn can activate one or another intracellular protein. Although several spectroscopy studies (e.g., for the β2-adrenergic receptor, herein referred to as B2AR, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Ghanouni1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Yao1">[9]</xref>) have been instrumental in showing that ligands with different efficacies stabilize GPCR conformational states that are structurally and kinetically distinguishable, perhaps the most direct evidence of ligand-induced conformational specificity comes from the recent high-resolution crystallographic structures of several different ligand-bound GPCRs. In the majority of cases, these structures were obtained in the presence of an inverse agonist, and therefore in an inactive state. Only very recently have high-resolution crystal structures of agonist-bound GPCRs started to appear in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rasmussen1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Lebon1">[15]</xref>. However, possibly restrained by crystallization conditions, not all these agonist-bound structures present the features that are usually attributed to an active GPCR conformation, most typically: the large outward movement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) with respect to the center of the receptor helical bundle, which is accompanied by the disruption of an important salt bridge between the conserved D/E3.49-R3.50 pair and E6.30, commonly referred to as the “ionic lock”. Residue numbering here and throughout the text follows the Ballesteros-Weinstein notation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Ballesteros1">[16]</xref>. According to this notation, each residue is indicated by a two-number identifier N1.N2 where N1 is the number of the transmembrane helix, and N2 is the residue number on that helix relative to its most conserved position, which is designated N2 = 50. We direct the reader elsewhere (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Deupi1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Kobilka1">[18]</xref>) for recent reviews of all the relevant structural changes that have been attributed by various biophysical techniques to active forms of GPCRs.</p>
      <p>A different extent of structural rearrangement was noted at the binding site of high-resolution crystal structures of GPCRs depending on the type of ligand to which they were bound. For instance, only minor local structural changes were noted between the high-resolution crystal structures of the B2AR in the presence of inverse agonists such as carazolol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Cherezov1">[19]</xref>, timolol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Hanson1">[20]</xref>, ICI-<italic>118,551</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Wacker1">[21]</xref>, or a compound deriving from virtual screening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Wacker1">[21]</xref> and the neutral antagonist alprenolol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Wacker1">[21]</xref>. Slightly more pronounced differences were noted by comparing these inverse agonist/antagonist-bound binding pockets with those stabilized by full agonists (i.e., either the covalently-bound ligand FAUC50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rosenbaum1">[11]</xref> or BI-167107 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rasmussen1">[10]</xref>). Among them, the most notable differences were the hydrogen bonding contacts that only agonists formed with S5.42 and S5.46 on TM5. Similar interactions helped discriminate between inverse agonist-bound crystal structures of the β1-adrenergic receptor (B1AR) and structures obtained in the presence of full agonists (e.g., isoprenaline or carmoterol) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Warne1">[13]</xref>. Notably, only one of these two hydrogen bonds involving TM5, specifically the interaction with S5.42, was also present in structures stabilized by the partial agonists salbutamol or dobutamine, suggesting a distinguishable binding mode between full and partial agonist structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Warne1">[13]</xref>. Analogous to the cases of the B1AR and B2AR, where specific residues (i.e., S5.46) are found to bind uniquely to agonists, key residues (S7.42 and H7.43) that bind agonists (either adenosine or NECA) but not antagonists (ZM241385) were revealed by the very recent crystal structures of a thermostabilized construct of the adenosine A2A receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Lebon1">[15]</xref>. Unlike another recent crystal structure of this receptor stabilized by both T4-lysozyme and the conformationally selective agonist UK-432097 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Xu1">[12]</xref>, these agonist-bound structures did not display changes at the cytoplasmic side that resemble those of an active state of a GPCR. In addition to the crystal structure of the adenosine A2A receptor bound to UK-432097 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Xu1">[12]</xref>, these more marked changes at the cytoplasmic side have so far only been observed in the high-resolution crystal structures of opsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Park1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Scheerer1">[23]</xref>, Meta II rhodopsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Choe1">[14]</xref>, and the nanobody-stabilized B2AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rasmussen1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite these recent remarkable achievements in structural biology of GPCRs, the majority of pharmacologically relevant ligands of these receptors do not appear to be ideally suited for the stabilization and crystallization of these receptors, most likely because of their low affinity, slow off-rate, and poor solubility. Not only might this prevent the identification of physiologically relevant conformational states of a given GPCR, but it is considered a limiting bottleneck for the characterization of different structures of these receptors. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can help to fill this information gap by enabling an atomic-level characterization of ligand-specific conformations that are impossible or difficult to retrieve experimentally. Moreover, these simulations allow extension of static structural data into dynamic representations, thus laying the basis for a mechanistic understanding of the selective activation of GPCR-mediated signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>To enable characterization of large conformational changes within the limited timescales commonly accessible to MD simulations, and to evaluate the extent to which ligands with different efficacies affect the free-energy landscape of GPCRs, we implemented a computational strategy employing a combination of different adaptive biasing techniques. Specifically, we used well-tempered metadynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Barducci1">[24]</xref> to identify metastable states of a GPCR along putative activation pathways between inactive and active crystallographic states determined by adiabatic biased MD. We tested the accuracy of this strategy in reproducing crystallographic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Cherezov1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Wacker1">[21]</xref> and/or spectroscopic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Ghanouni1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Yao1">[9]</xref> data available for the B2AR in its interaction with either a full agonist (i.e., epinephrine), a weak partial agonist (i.e., dopamine), a very weak partial agonist (i.e., catechol), two inverse agonists (i.e. ICI-<italic>118,551</italic> and carazolol), or one neutral antagonist (i.e., alprenolol). The results show a clear ligand-induced modulation of the free-energy landscape of the receptor with shifts in the conformational equilibrium towards inactive or active conformations depending on the physiological response elicited by the simulated ligand.</p>

        <p>A model of the B2AR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s001">Figure S1</xref> was prepared starting from one of the available crystal structures of this receptor (PDB ID: 2RH1), removing the lysozyme insertion, and modeling the missing intracellular loop 3 (IL3) with the Rosetta <italic>ab-initio</italic> loop modeling protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rohl1">[25]</xref>. The intracellular loop 2 (IL2), which is probably misfolded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Warne2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Vogel1">[27]</xref> in the inactive structure of the B2AR (2RH1), but in a helical conformation in the active nanobody-stabilized crystal (3P0G) of the receptor, was also replaced by the lowest-energy Rosetta model with a helical fold. The resulting receptor model was embedded into an explicit 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/10% cholesterol membrane bilayer using a pre-equilibrated 8×8×10 nm patch hydrated with SPC/E water molecules, and the procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Kandt1">[28]</xref>. As found in the crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Cherezov1">[19]</xref>, one palmitoyl group was covalently attached to a C-terminal residue (Cys 341) of the receptor before insertion in the membrane. The system was then hydrated with SPC/E water molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Berendsen1">[29]</xref> and Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> ions were added to ensure charge neutrality.</p>
        <p>The resulting system of ∼50,000 total atoms was equilibrated with unbiased MD simulations for 20 nanoseconds (ns) using the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations all-atom (OPLS-AA) force field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Jorgensen1">[30]</xref> for the receptor and united-atoms Berger parameters for the lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Berger1">[31]</xref>. The Gromacs 4.0.7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-VanDerSpoel1">[32]</xref> package enhanced with the Plumed plug-in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Bonomi1">[33]</xref> was used for all simulations. Specifically, NPT simulations were carried out under periodic boundary conditions, using the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Parrinello1">[34]</xref> with a time constant of 1.0 ps and a reference pressure of 1 bar to control pressure, and the Nose-Hoover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Nose1">[35]</xref> algorithm with a time constant of 1.0 ps to maintain a constant temperature of 300 K. Prior to production runs (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s011">Table S1</xref>), the system was equilibrated by a series of three 0.2 ns runs with progressively weaker restraints on the protein backbone followed by a 3.0 ns unconstrained equilibration. We used the standard Gromacs leap-frog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-VanDerSpoel1">[32]</xref> algorithm with a time step of 2.0 fs, LINCS algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Hess1">[36]</xref> to preserve the bond lengths, and SETTLE algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Miyamoto1">[37]</xref> to maintain the geometry of the water molecules. Lennard-Jones interactions were treated with a twin-range cutoff of 0.9∶1.4 nm and an integration time step of 2.0 fs; the neighbor list was updated every 10 steps. Electrostatic interactions were described using the particle-mesh Ewald method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Darden1">[38]</xref>, with a cutoff of 0.9 nm for real-space interactions, and a 0.12-nm grid with fourth-order B-spline interpolation for reciprocal-space interactions.</p>

        <title>Adiabatic Biased MD Simulations</title>
        <p>The starting equilibrated unliganded conformation of the B2AR within the lipid bilayer was subjected to ten independent Adiabatic Biased MD (ABMD) simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Marchi1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Paci1">[40]</xref> to obtain transition pathways of the receptor from an inactive to an active conformation, built using the coordinates of the nanobody-stabilized crystal structure (PDB code: 3P0G). Briefly, this method biases the system towards a given value χ<sub>0</sub> of a predefined order parameter χ(R), where R represents the coordinates of the atoms in the system. A harmonic bias acts only when the distance of χ(R) from the target χ<sub>0</sub> is bigger than its minimum value previously reached during the simulation (i.e. if χ(R(t))- χ<sub>0</sub> &gt; min<sub>s&lt;t</sub> χ(R(s))- χ<sub>0</sub>), according to the following equation:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002193.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
        <p>The order parameter χ measures the distance from the putative activated conformation of the receptor, and is defined as the Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the active conformation of the B2AR (all residues were included except the long flexible IL3). In order to obtain activated final states, the simulation was run with χ<sub>0</sub> = 0. After carrying out 10 independent ABMD runs with an elastic constant of k = 10 kcal/(mol⋅nm<sup>2</sup>), the trajectories were pooled and clustered using an average linkage agglomerative algorithm and the same dissimilarity measure used to run ABMD.</p>

        <p>The free-energy profiles of liganded and unliganded systems were estimated using metadynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Bussi1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Raiteri1">[47]</xref>. Briefly, this technique enables an efficient reconstruction of the free-energy as a function of a set of <italic>k</italic> predetermined order parameters, referred to as collective variables s<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>(R), 1≤<italic>i</italic>≤<italic>k</italic>. A history-dependent bias potential is added to the force-field driving the system dynamics so as to discourage the re-visiting of regions of the s<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> phase space that have already been explored. Specifically, the bias potential is<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002193.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where t′ is a multiple of a deposition time τ and the values of w<sub>t′</sub> and σ<sub>i</sub> regulate the shape and size of the Gaussian bias contributions. In the original metadynamics algorithm, w<sub>t′</sub> = w is constant, and the free-energy profile can be estimated up to an insignificant additive time-dependent constant as W(R)  =  − lim<sub>t→∞</sub> V(R,t).</p>
        <p>Here, we used well-tempered metadynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Barducci1">[24]</xref>, a variant of the original metadynamics algorithm that enables assessment of simulation convergence while keeping the computational effort focused on physically relevant regions of the conformational space. In this variant of the method, the value of w<sub>t′</sub> depends on the bias accumulated up to t′ according to the equation: <disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002193.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where ΔT is a constant with the dimension of a temperature, <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann constant, and w is a constant energy representing the maximum height of the Gaussian biases. Since in the regions where the bias is higher the exponential factor reduces the rate of the bias update, the bias potential smoothly converges to a constant value in time, and the underlying free-energy can be derived by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002193.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where T is the temperature at which the simulation is performed.</p>
        <p>To efficiently sample the conformational space along the activation pathway, reference states from the clustered ABMD runs were selected by cutting the agglomerative tree at 30 clusters, and selecting from them <italic>n</italic> = 10 clusters homogeneously covering the pathway. The reference states R<sub>j</sub> (1≤<italic>j</italic>≤<italic>n</italic>) were numbered assigning j = 1 to the cluster closer to the inactive state (Cα RMSD from 2RH1 ∼0.4 Å) and j = 10 to the one closer to the active state (Cα RMSD from 3P0G ∼0.3 Å). Two path collective variables describing the position along (<italic>s</italic>) and the distance from (<italic>z</italic>) the pathway were defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Branduardi1">[48]</xref> as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002193.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002193.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where d(R,R<sub>j</sub>) is the squared Cα RMSD (excluding IL3) with respect to the reference structure R<sub>j</sub>, and Z  =  ∑<sub>1≤<italic>j≤n</italic></sub> exp(− γ d(R,R<sub>j</sub>)). The simulations were performed choosing γ  =  1/0.25 Å<sup>-2</sup>, σ<sub>s</sub> = 0.1, and σ<sub>z</sub> = 1 Å<sup>2</sup>, and well-tempered metadynamics was used with a bias factor ΔT = 10 T, an initial value of w = 0.4 kcal/mol, and a deposition interval τ = 8 ps. Metadynamics simulations were run for 300 ns, time at which the reconstructed free-energy difference between the metastable states converged to 0.2 kcal/mol.</p>

        <title>Free-Energy Calculations</title>
        <p>Since the trajectory was generated adding the metadynamics bias, the resulting conformations cannot be used to obtain statistical information on order parameters other than the collective variables. However, it is possible to unbias the distribution of any given function of the system coordinates using the algorithm described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Bonomi2">[49]</xref>. This so-called reweighting technique was used to estimate the free-energy surface of the complexes as a function of three important descriptors of receptor activation, namely the distance between R3.50 and E6.30 (the “ionic lock”), the rotamer of residue W6.48 (the so-called “toggle switch”), and the outward displacement of the intracellular segment of TM6.</p>
        <p>Three order parameters were defined to monitor the behavior of these changes upon activation. For the ionic lock, we defined d<sub>IL</sub> =  ||〈<bold>R</bold><sub>3.50</sub>〉 − 〈<bold>R</bold><sub>6.30</sub>〉||, where 〈<bold>R</bold><sub>3.50</sub>〉 and 〈<bold>R</bold><sub>6.30</sub>〉 represent the center of mass of the η-nitrogens of R3.50 and the δ-oxygens of E6.30, respectively. For the toggle switch, we monitored the first dihedral angle χ<sub>TS</sub> of the side chain of W6.48. Finally, the movement of TM6 was measured by aligning the receptor to the inactive crystal structure (2RH1) and calculating the distance d<sub>TM6</sub>  =  ||<bold>M</bold> − 〈<bold>R</bold><sub>6.35</sub>〉|| (angled brackets indicate the centroid of all the atoms of the residues) between the midpoint of an imaginary line connecting residues K6.35 and Y2.41 in the inactive structure, <bold>M</bold>  =  ½[〈<bold>R</bold><sub>2.41</sub>〉 + 〈<bold>R</bold><sub>6.35</sub>〉] (located roughly at the center of the intracellular exposed surface of the receptor), and residue K6.35. The outward movement is described by the difference in d<sub>TM6</sub> values between any given conformation and the reference inactive crystal structure, i.e. by Δd<sub>TM6</sub> = d<sub>TM6</sub>–d<sub>TM6</sub> (2RH1).</p>

        <title>Unliganded Receptor</title>
        <p>An activation pathway from the inactive to the active B2AR crystal structures (PDB codes 2RH1 and 3P0G, respectively) was obtained by ABMD following the protocol described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref> section. This pathway was used to define the <italic>s</italic> and <italic>z</italic> collective variables (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref> section for corresponding equations) that were employed for the metadynamics simulations. Panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the free-energy ?G of the unliganded receptor as a function of the position <italic>s</italic> along the activation pathway following integration of the dependence on <italic>z</italic>. Specifically, <italic>s</italic> = 0.0 and <italic>s</italic> = 1.0 indicate the inactive and fully activated extreme conformations of the pathway, respectively. This free-energy profile shows two minima, one at s∼0.2 that is close to the inactive state and the other at s∼0.6 that is shifted towards the active state. The two states are separated by a barrier of ∼2.5 kcal/mol, but they have a similar overall stability (ΔG&lt;k<sub>B</sub>T), and are therefore equally populated at equilibrium. Inspection of the entire two-dimensional free-energy profile ΔG(<italic>s,z</italic>) reported in the supplementary material (see panel A of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s002">Figure S2</xref>) shows that these states correspond to conformations along the activation pathway with values of <italic>z</italic> close to 0. Visual inspection of a representative structure of the s∼0.2 energy basin confirms that the corresponding transmembrane bundle is very close to the inactive B2AR crystal structure (Cα RMSD excluding IL3 ∼0.6 Å), as substantiated by the very small outward movement of TM6 (Δd<sub>TM6</sub> ∼ 0.4 Å) with respect to the inactive crystal (see panel B of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, a representative structure of the second energy basin at s∼0.6 (RMSD ∼1.6 Å and ∼1.1 Å from the inactive and active crystal structures, respectively) displays a more pronounced outward movement of TM6 (Δd<sub>TM6</sub> ∼2.5 Å in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

Specifically, these molecular switches are: 1) the ionic lock between TM3 and TM6, herein monitored using the distance <italic>d<sub>IL</sub></italic> between R3.50 and E6.30 and 2) the W6.48 rotamer toggle switch, herein monitored using the first dihedral angle χ<sub>TS</sub> of the residue side chain.

        <p>The neutral antagonist alprenolol, consisting of an “aromatic head” (a 2-allyl-pheniloxyl moiety) and an “aliphatic tail” (oxy-propanol-amine) (see chemical structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), was docked in accordance to the binding mode assumed by the ligand in the crystal structure of the corresponding ligand-bound receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Wacker1">[21]</xref>.

A similarity is also noted between the two-dimensional energy surfaces of the alprenolol-bound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) and the unliganded B2AR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). In spite of these qualitative similarities, the inactive state at s∼0.2 is more stable (∼1 kcal/mol) than the intermediate state at s∼0.6 for the alprenolol-bound receptor compared to the unliganded one.

        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g002">Figure 2B</xref> shows a representative conformation of the lowest energy basin identified for the alprenolol-bound receptor. In this conformation, and similar to the corresponding crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Wacker1">[21]</xref>, the alprenolol charged moiety in its aliphatic tail forms interactions with polar residues D3.32 and N7.39, while the ligand aromatic head interacts with residues V3.33, V3.36, F6.51, N6.55, Y5.38, and S5.42, which define a cleft formed by TM3, TM5 and TM6. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g002">Figure 2C</xref> shows that the energetically most stable alprenolol-bound inactive state is characterized by inactive molecular switches (χ<sub>TS</sub>∼160° and d<sub>IL</sub>∼5 Å). This state, labeled <italic>a</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, is separated by an energy barrier of ∼3 kcal/mol from the second most stable energetic minimum at χ<sub>TS</sub>∼50° and d<sub>IL</sub>∼12 Å (<italic>c</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), with a transition state (<italic>b</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) at χ<sub>TS</sub>∼85° and d<sub>IL</sub>∼5 Å. Thus, the presence of alprenolol in the binding pocket does not appear to disrupt the free-energy profile seen in the unliganded receptor, further confirming a possible rotamer toggle switch of the W6.48 residue prior breaking of the ionic lock. The stability of alprenolol in a representative state of the ligand-receptor complex extracted from the most stable energy basin at s∼0.2 was confirmed by carrying out ∼50 ns unbiased MD simulations.

        <title>Receptor Bound to Inverse Agonists</title>
        <p>We assessed the effect of two different B2AR inverse agonists, namely ICI-<italic>118,551</italic> and carazolol, on the free-energy landscape of the receptor during transition from inactive to activated experimental states. Carazolol and ICI-<italic>118,551</italic> share important structural features with alprenolol, e.g., they both have an “aliphatic tail” (oxy-propanol-amine for carazolol and oxy-butanol-amine for ICI-<italic>118,551</italic>) and an “aromatic head”. The results of the simulations for the carazolol-bound and the ICI-<italic>118,551</italic>-bound receptor are illustrated in panels A-C and D-F of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g003">Figure 3</xref>, respectively.</p>

        <p>In the presence of either carazolol or ICI-<italic>118,551</italic>, the B2AR free-energy profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g003">Figure 3A and 3D</xref>, respectively) show a single lowest-energy basin at s∼0.18 close to the inactive state of the receptor. These much more stable energy basins are also present in the two-dimensional energy surfaces of the carazolol-bound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s005">Figure S5A</xref>) and the ICI-<italic>118,551-</italic>bound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s005">Figure S5C</xref>) B2AR, and comprise inactive conformations as further illustrated by the lower energy values for states characterized by the absence of outward movement of TM6 (Δd<sub>TM6</sub> ∼ 0.4 Å in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s005">Figures S5B and S5D</xref>). Representative conformations extracted from the lowest energy basins of either the carazolol-bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) or the ICI-<italic>118,551</italic>-bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) receptors show that the energy-optimized binding poses of these ligands are very similar to their positions in the corresponding crystal structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Cherezov1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Wacker1">[21]</xref>. Similar to the binding mode of alprenolol, the charged moieties contained in the aliphatic tails of these ligands interact with polar residues D3.32, and N7.39, while their aromatic heads are oriented toward TM3, TM5, and TM6, thus directly interacting with residues in these helices (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g003">Figures 3B and 3E</xref>). To assess the stability of the ligands in these representative conformations, we performed standard, unbiased MD simulations. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s006">Figures S6A</xref>-D, which report the time evolutions of the RMSD of the protein, as well as those of the heavy atoms of carazolol and ICI-<italic>118,551</italic>, after superposition of the receptor Cα atoms, the receptor conformations are stable and the binding modes of the ligands are conserved over a simulation time of ∼50 ns.</p>
        <p>The intermediate state at <italic>s</italic>∼0.6 that was significantly populated in the unliganded and neutral antagonist-bound receptor is much less stable at ΔG∼4.0 kcal/mol in the case of the carazolol-bound or ICI-<italic>118,551</italic>-bound receptors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g003">Figures 3A and 3D</xref>, respectively). However, these are still metastable states, as judged by the presence of shallow minima at s∼0.6 in both the free-energy profiles, and are separated from the inactive states by multiple barriers. In terms of modulation of the toggle switch and the ionic lock, the free-energy as a function of χ<sub>TS</sub> and d<sub>IL</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g003">Figures 3C and 3F</xref> for the carazolol-bound and ICI-<italic>118,551</italic>-bound complexes, respectively) features only one minimum in the inactive region of these molecular switches (χ<sub>TS</sub>∼160° and d<sub>IL</sub>∼3 Å).</p>

        <p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, our proposed binding mode of epinephrine within a fully activated B2AR (energy basin at s∼0.9) is consistent with the binding poses displayed by full agonists in the B2AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rasmussen1">[10]</xref> and B1AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Warne1">[13]</xref> crystallographic structures. Specifically, the ligand amino group forms hydrogen bonds with D3.32 and N7.39 of B2AR, the ligand β-hydroxyl group interacts with D3.32, and the ligand catecholamine hydroxyl groups interact through hydrogen bonding with the side chains of both S5.42 and S5.46. In this state, the B2AR helix bundle is structurally very similar to the corresponding nanobody-activated crystal structure of the receptor (C? RMSD from 3P0G is ∼1.6 Å). The stability of the epinephrine binding pose and the specific receptor conformation were verified by carrying out ∼50 ns standard MD simulations (see corresponding time evolutions of RMSD in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s008">Figure S8</xref>). On the other hand, representative structures of the energy basin at s∼0.2 (data not shown) corresponded to conformations of the helix bundle very similar to the inactive crystal structure of B2AR (Cα RMSD from 2RH1 is ∼1.0 Å).</p>
        <p>Two energy basins (labeled <italic>a</italic> and <italic>c</italic>) were identified from the free-energy as a function of the order parameters describing the ionic lock and rotamer toggle switches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Specifically, the basin comprising conformations in which both the ionic lock and rotamer toggle switches are in the ‘active’ (d<sub>IL</sub>∼16 Å and χ<sub>TS</sub>∼50°) positions appear to be more stable than the basin with receptor conformations with ‘inactive’ (d<sub>IL</sub>∼3 Å and χ<sub>TS</sub>∼160°) molecular switches. Also in this case, the minimum free-energy path between these two energy basins suggests activation of the toggle switch prior breaking of the ionic lock interaction along the path to full receptor activation.</p>

        <p>The weak and very weak partial agonists, dopamine and catechol, were also simulated in the context of the B2AR activation pathway. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002193-g004">Figures 4D and 4G</xref> illustrate the free-energy profiles of the catechol-bound and dopamine-bound receptors, respectively. In both cases the receptor is most stabilized in an intermediate state (s∼0.6) along the pathway to activation. Inspection of the free-energy as a function of the position (<italic>s</italic>) along and the distance (<italic>z</italic>) from the activation pathway (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s009">Figures S9A and S9C</xref> for the catechol-bound and dopamine-bound receptors, respectively) confirms that these two ligands stabilize a state different from the inactive or fully activated ones as judged by the lowest energy values at z∼2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s009">Figure S9A</xref> for catechol, and at s∼0.6, z∼0.0 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002193.s009">Figure S9C</xref> for dopamine.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying GPCR functional selectivity is extremely important in modern drug discovery, since it provides a unique opportunity for the identification or rational design of ‘biased’ ligands as novel more effective therapeutics. Epitomizing an emerging paradigm in current drug discovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Kar1">[54]</xref>, native states of GPCRs can be assumed in a dynamic equilibrium between different conformational sub-states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rosenbaum1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Kobilka1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Deupi2">[55]</xref>, which correspond to the valleys of an energy landscape, the barriers of which reflect the timescales of the conformational exchange. The relative populations of these sub-states follow statistical thermodynamics distributions and are shifted towards specific conformations as a consequence of ligand binding and/or other allosteric events such as those induced by protein-protein interactions. Thus, ligands with varied efficacies are believed to modulate the free-energy landscape of a GPCR, shifting the conformational equilibrium towards active or inactive conformations of the receptor, depending on their pharmacological action.</p>
      <p>A reliable characterization of the specific conformations that inverse agonists, agonists (both full and partial), or antagonists can stabilize in a given GPCR is highly desirable for the structure-based discovery of novel ligands eliciting selected functional responses. This is difficult to achieve by X-ray crystallography for the majority of GPCRs due to their intrinsic structural instability, and the realization that the majority of pharmacologically active ligands are not ideal compounds for receptor stabilization that is suitable for crystallization.</p>
      <p>The enhanced sampling approach we describe here provides atomic-resolution information of receptor conformations along pre-determined activation pathways that are differentially stabilized by ligands with different efficacies. Our approach also provides a quantitative description of the thermodynamics of the B2AR basal activity, with the unliganded receptor being able to sample both an inactive state and an intermediate state that is shifted towards the activated conformation. This latter state is structurally different from the fully active state of B2AR captured by the nanobody-stabilized crystal structure. Although it exhibits a broken ionic lock and a cytoplasmic opening that is able to accommodate the camelid antibody, a few clashes are produced by the much smaller outward movement of TM6 (∼2.5 Å compared to the ∼5.9 Å that can be achieved by a full agonist). Given the small free-energy difference between the two lowest energy minima identified for the unliganded B2AR, these two states are almost equally populated at equilibrium, in agreement with the high basal activity of the B2AR. Moreover, the relatively low energy barrier between the two states is consistent with the flexible nature of the unliganded B2AR, and the consequent difficulty in obtaining crystals of the native receptor.</p>
      <p>We observed a more or less pronounced perturbation of the free-energy profile of the unliganded B2AR depending on the ligand considered for binding. Although alprenolol has often been described as a neutral antagonist of B2AR, its presence in the B2AR binding pocket slightly modifies the free-energy profile of the receptor, making the inactive state more stable in spite of the small difference in free-energy (∼k<sub>B</sub>T). This result is not completely surprising in light of the evidence existing in the literature for a role of alprenolol as an inverse agonist or even a weak agonist, depending on the assay used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Chidiac1">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Wisler1">57</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results show that the selection of a single conformational state is particularly effective in the case of inverse agonists. The docking of either carazolol or ICI-<italic>118,551</italic> in the receptor dramatically changes the free-energy landscape of B2AR and reduces it to a funneled profile with a single major basin corresponding to the inactive conformation. This result is consistent with the greater availability of crystals of B2AR in an inactive conformation stabilized by potent inverse agonists in the binding pocket, and with the observation that the structural features of the inactive states of the various receptors obtained so far are similar.</p>
      <p>The situation is different when we study the free-energy landscape in the presence of agonists. The computational experiment with epinephrine shows that a full agonist is capable of stabilizing a state of B2AR presenting structural features that have been found in the nanobody-stabilized agonist-bound crystal structure of B2AR. However, in addition to this active state, we obtain a relatively stable agonist-bound inactive state that is structurally similar to the inverse agonist-bound crystal structure of B2AR. This is not surprising, given the absence of TM6 outward movements noted in both the B2AR crystal structure with a covalently-bound agonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rosenbaum1">[11]</xref>, and the agonist-bound B1AR crystal structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Warne1">[13]</xref>. Moreover, the relatively small difference in free-energy between the fully active and the inactive agonist-bound conformations is probably due to the lack of the G-protein in the simulation setup, in line with the observation deriving from the two recent agonist-bound B2AR crystal structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rasmussen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Rosenbaum1">[11]</xref> that a ligand alone is not sufficient to stabilize a fully active crystallographic state of the receptor, but a G-protein mimicking nanobody is necessary to trap this conformation. Different from the crystallographic information, but in line with experimental evidence from fluorescence spectroscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Yao1">[9]</xref>, we find that metastable states corresponding to fully (and partial) activated conformations of the receptor favor the rotamer change of the W6.48 side chain.</p>
      <p>The partial agonism elicited by dopamine and catechol shifts the conformational equilibrium towards states that are different from that stabilized by the full agonist, and captured in the nanobody-stabilized crystal structure. In particular, the two ligands affect the free-energy landscape in different ways. While the intermediate dopamine-bound state always features a broken ionic lock, the receptor samples conformations that have different ionic lock states when catechol is in the binding pocket. Notably, experimental evidence from fluorescence spectroscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Yao1">[9]</xref> also suggested that the very weak partial agonist catechol is not able to completely disrupt the interaction between the charged residues at the cytoplasmic end of TM3 and TM6. Structurally, the two conformations stabilized by catechol and dopamine are different in the degree of separation between the extracellular ends of TM5 and TM6 and between the intercellular ends of TM3 and TM6. Consistent with the hypothesis that global structural features of the receptor, such as the tilt of the extracellular half of TM5, can optimize the binding to agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002193-Katritch1">[58]</xref>, we see a larger TM5 tilt in the presence of dopamine (as well as for epinephrine) and a smaller one in the presence of catechol. Owing to the greater ability of catechol to stabilize a state with a formed ionic lock, the intracellular ends of TM3 and TM6 also appear slightly closer (by ∼1 Å) together.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have designed a strategy using a combination of different adaptive biasing techniques that enables characterization of reliable ligand-specific conformations as demonstrated here in the case of B2AR. The strategy is completely general and may be of practical use for the structure-based design of ‘biased’ ligands that selectively activate signaling pathways, and may therefore exhibit improved therapeutic properties.</p>
