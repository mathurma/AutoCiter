				<article-title>Mechanisms of Aging in Bone Marrow Stem Cells</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Age-related defects in stem cells can limit proper tissue maintenance and hence contribute to a shortened lifespan. Using highly purified hematopoietic stem cells from mice aged 2 to 21 mo, we demonstrate a deficit in function yet an increase in stem cell number with advancing age. Expression analysis of more than 14,000 genes identified 1,500 that were age-induced and 1,600 that were age-repressed. Genes associated with the stress response, inflammation, and protein aggregation dominated the up-regulated expression profile, while the down-regulated profile was marked by genes involved in the preservation of genomic integrity and chromatin remodeling. Many chromosomal regions showed coordinate loss of transcriptional regulation; an overall increase in transcriptional activity with age and inappropriate expression of genes normally regulated by epigenetic mechanisms was also observed. Hematopoietic stem cells from early-aging mice expressing a mutant <italic>p53</italic> allele reveal that aging of stem cells can be uncoupled from aging at an organismal level. These studies show that hematopoietic stem cells are not protected from aging. Instead, loss of epigenetic regulation at the chromatin level may drive both functional attenuation of cells, as well as other manifestations of aging, including the increased propensity for neoplastic transformation.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>Aging is marked by a decline in function of the entire organism. The effect of age on the regenerative capacity of adult stem cells, which should rejuvenate tissues throughout life, is poorly understood. Bone marrow stem cells, also known as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), continuously regenerate the cells that comprise the blood, including the immune system, which fails with age. Here, we show that older HSCs were less able to regenerate the blood system than young HSCs. Paradoxically, the HSC number increased concomitantly, leading to no major difference in overall blood production, even though the immune system did exhibit some defects. To determine why these changes occurred, we looked at global patterns of gene expression in young versus old HSC. Stem cells exhibited an elevated inflammatory response and a decline in factors, called chromatin regulators, that orchestrate DNA accessibility and gene expression. Additional evidence supports the idea that loss of overall gene regulation (epigenetic regulation) is a major event during aging. Whereas much of aging research is concentrated on accumulation of mutations in DNA rather than on global regulatory mechanisms, we speculate that these epigenetic changes could drive many of the manifestations of age. This view also may explain the increased incidence of cancer with age.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Somatic stem cells replenish many tissues throughout life. In general, they have slow turnover and reside in specialized niches, protected from the environment, so that only a few are activated at a time. Thus, stem cells are a defense against aging, replacing cells lost through attrition. If the rejuvenating effect of stem cells were perfect, senescing cells would be replaced indefinitely; but even in highly regenerative tissues such as the skin, the gut, and the hematopoietic system, age-related decline in function is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b001">1</xref>]. Still unclear are the effects of aging on the stem cells themselves, which could contribute to inferior tissue repair.</p>
      <p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) continuously replenish the blood and immune system throughout life. Data from mice support an age-related decline in stem cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b001">1</xref>], suggesting that older HSCs are inadequate to cope with the demands of blood production. When limited numbers of aged hematopoietic progenitors are transplanted into young recipients under competitive conditions, they show an overall reduction in long-term repopulating potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b002">2</xref>]; in particular, lymphopoiesis is deficient, whereas myelopoiesis is enhanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b004">4</xref>]. Paradoxically, however, the total number of primitive progenitors has been reported to increase with age in the C57Bl/6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b005">5</xref>]. A recent study of aged hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells suggested that increased expression of particular proto-oncogenes may underlie some of these observed changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b004">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although the previous studies varied widely, the findings provide compelling evidence for major age-related alterations in HSC function. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie these deficits, we examined gene expression in HSC as a function of age on a genome-wide scale in normal and an early-aging <italic>p53</italic> mutant strain. These data provide a comprehensive molecular portrait of aging in HSC, and show that stem cell aging mirrors the aging of other tissues, marked by a dramatic inflammatory response, stress responses, and substantial alterations in the regulation of chromatin structure.</p>

        <title>Phenotypically Defined HSCs Increase in Number with Age and Possess a Functional Defect</title>
        <p>The number of whole bone marrow (WBM) progenitors defined by cell surface markers in C57Bl/6 mice increases with age relative to total WBM cellularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b005">5</xref>]. To assess whether this property extends to HSCs purified using the side population (SP) cells defined by their ability to efflux Hoechst 33342 dye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b006">6</xref>], we examined the SP cells in C57Bl/6 mice ranging from 2 to 21 mo of age. The results demonstrate a 9-fold increase in the number of SP cells with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), with the most primitive SP<sup>low</sup> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b007">7</xref>] showing the greatest increase. These SP cells also exhibit the surface phenotype of HSC regardless of age (c-kit<sup>pos</sup>, lineage<sup>neg</sup>, and Sca-1<sup>pos</sup> [SParKLS]), consistent with their high degree of purity and homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-sg001">S1</xref>). Aged HSCs were uniformly CD48<sup>neg</sup>, which is one of the markers recently described to mark differentiated hematopoietic cells from both young and aged mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b009">9</xref>] (unpublished data). Thus, murine HSCs defined by multiple phenotypes increase 9-fold in WBM over approximately 2 y. The increase in cell number was not a result of greater proportion of S-phase HSCs, as determined by propidium iodide staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), suggesting an alternative mechanism for the increase in HSC number.</p>

        <p>Limiting dilution bone marrow transplantation can measure the ability of HSCs to reconstitute recipients under competitive conditions and the functional purity of HSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b010">10</xref>]. HSCs (SParKLS) were therefore purified from either 2- or 21-mo-old mice and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients, along with competitor bone marrow. Progeny from donor HSC were distinguished from competitor and recipient cells using the CD45 allelic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b011">11</xref>]. The proportion of peripheral blood progeny derived from purified young and old HSC was monitored at 4, 8, and 16 wk post-transplantation. Four weeks after transplantation, there was little difference in the contribution of young versus old HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), but at 8 and 16 wk post-transplant, the contribution from the old HSCs was significantly reduced, but still multilineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). This finding argues that HSCs acquire a defect in long-term, but not short-term, repopulating potential with increasing age. This deficit represents roughly a 3-fold loss in functional activity per purified stem cell. With a 5- to 10-fold numerical increase in HSC, this indicates that the total stem cell activity remains fairly constant with age, which is consistent with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b012">12</xref>].</p>

        <title>Gene Expression Changes in Aging HSCs by Microarray Analysis</title>
        <p>To identify transcriptional changes in aged HSCs that correlate with the observed functional deficit, we examined the expression of more than 14,000 genes, using Affymetrix MOE430a microarrays and HSCs purified from 2-, 6-, 12-, and 21-mo-old mice. A quadratic trend line (parabola) was fit for each gene over the 19-mo test period, which showed that the genes generally either increased or decreased in expression in a time-dependent fashion. We used a linear contrast model based on the entire observation course to determine which genes had the largest changes in expression over time. This revealed 1,600 genes that were up-regulated at 21 mo (“Up-with-Age” group), and 1,500 that were down-regulated (“Down-with-Age” group), which is summarized as a heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g002">Figure 2</xref>. A small hand-picked list is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050201-t001">Table 1</xref>; the entire list of differentially expressed genes is supplemented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-st001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-st002">S2</xref>, and a searchable database of all genes on the array can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050201" xlink:type="simple">http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050201</ext-link>. Expression changes of a subset of these genes were validated by real-time quantitative PCR in duplicate on independently purified HSC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). We also compared transcriptional profiles for WBM versus HSCs to identify HSC-specific transcripts; surprisingly, only a modest overlap of genes was found with those that were up-regulated or down-regulated with age, suggesting that the HSC-specific transcriptional programs remain relatively stable as the organism ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A remarkable overlap was found between genes up- and down-regulated with age in this study and a previous study of HSC aging, with the top ten genes being identical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b004">4</xref>].</p>

For this purpose, we used Gene Ontology (GO; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.geneontology.org</ext-link>) to group genes on the basis of a particular biological process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b013">13</xref>], and identified GO categories that were enriched with statistical significance by a method previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b014">14</xref>]. When applied to the Up-with-Age gene list, the analysis revealed a large number of enriched categories that have been linked to aging in general, such as NO-mediated signal transduction, the stress response (protein folding), and the inflammatory response, whereas categories enriched for Down-with-Age genes often included those involved in the preservation of genomic integrity, such as chromatin remodeling and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) (the entire GO results can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050201" xlink:type="simple">http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050201</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>NF-κB and P-Selectin Are Activated in Aged HSCs</title>
        <p>A link between aging and inflammation has been demonstrated in several vertebrate models and in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b015">15</xref>], and we found evidence for the age-dependent regulation of several stress-related genes in HSCs. One of the most highly up-regulated of these genes expresses P-selectin, a cell surface adhesion molecule that serves as a marker for physiological stress states, including inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b016">16</xref>], aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b017">17</xref>], and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b018">18</xref>]. P-selectin expression in HSCs, was of particular interest because it mediates the leukocyte–vascular endothelium interaction important for leukocyte extravasation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b016">16</xref>] and therefore has implications for HSC migration. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated increasing levels of P-selectin on the surface of HSCs isolated from 24- to 28-mo-old mice (21%–81%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), in contrast to scant levels (3%) on HSCs from young mice.</p>

To test this, we purified HSCs from 2- and 22-mo-old mice, and examined them for p65 localization by immunofluorescence. In contrast to only 3% of 2-mo-old HSCs, 71% of 22-mo-old HSCs showed enhanced nuclear localization of p65 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g004">4</xref>C).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, genes that participate in NO-mediated signal transduction were the first to be up-regulated during HSC aging, followed closely by those contributing to the stress response and the regulation of lymphocyte proliferation. Inflammatory-response genes were not activated until late in the aging process, after up-regulation of NF-κB signaling, strengthening our hypothesis that inflammation exerts a strong influence on HSC aging through stimulation of the NF-κB pathway.

        <title>Centers-of-Regulated Expression Analysis</title>
        <p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> the chromatin regulatory factor Sir2, a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase, suppresses recombination and silences transcription at multiple genomic loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b020">20</xref>]; its loss is associated genomic instability and aging. Since genes involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional silencing were excessively down-regulated in our GO enrichment analysis, we predicted global dysregulation of transcriptional activity. We reasoned that this would be evidenced by finding regions of chromosomes in which genes that were physically clustered together changed coordinately with age. To test this idea, genes were ordered by their chromosomal position, and age-induced and age-repressed genes were mapped using a density-based statistical approach. The result was a single curve across each chromosome, with peaks representing regions of coordinate up-regulation, and valleys regions of coordinate down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Chromosomal loci with significant coordinate changes in gene expression were identified as centers of regulated expression (COREs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, red lines). Using this method, we found more than 100 such COREs among the 19 mouse autosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-st003">Table S3</xref>). Importantly, there were twice as many CORE peaks as there were valleys, indicating a predominance of a loss of transcriptional silencing throughout the genome.</p>

        <title>Immunoglobulin Kappa Expression Provides Evidence for Chromatin Dysregulation</title>
        <p>With such dramatic changes in chromatin regulation, we expected to find inappropriate expression of specific genes in aged HSC. Indeed, with age, we observed a striking increase in expression of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene (<italic>IgH;</italic> ∼37-fold) and the immunoglobulin kappa <italic>(IgK)</italic> light chain gene (∼50-fold). Ig genes are not normally active in HSC, but become highly expressed in B cells. We thus decided to examine age-related transcription of the highly studied <italic>IgK</italic> locus in more detail. The possibility that B cells were contaminating the purified HSCs was excluded using antibodies against two markers of early and mature B cells, CD19 and Il-7r (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A). In addition, a PCR-based assay to detect Ig recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b024">24</xref>] showed no evidence of V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B).</p>

Using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to detect GL <italic>IgK</italic> transcripts in poly-A RNA extracted from HSC from 2- and 24-mo-old mice, GL transcripts were readily detectable in HSC from old mice, but were absent in HSC from young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Sequencing confirmed their GL structure, which included the entire first joining minigene (J1) and the constant region with a poly-A tail. These data are consistent with a loss of epigenetic regulation at the <italic>IgK</italic> locus with age in aged HSC. Such epigenetic changes may enable access by NF-κB and other factors that drive <italic>IgK</italic> gene expression, leading to inappropriate expression in aged HSC.</p>

Mutant mice expressing a truncated allele of <italic>p53</italic> (m allele) display an augmented p53 response, several early-aging phenotypes, and hematopoietic defects, including a blunted HSC proliferative response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b028">28</xref>] and a lack of sufficient stem cell potential throughout life to maintain longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b029">29</xref>]. In contrast, mice with half the amount of p53 <italic>(p53<sup>+/−</sup>)</italic> would be expected to live longer than wild-type (WT) mice, except that they develop lethal tumors. Consistent with the role of p53 in regulating cell proliferation, the <italic>p53<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice exhibit increased stem cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b029">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>We examined HSC from <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> and <italic>p53<sup>+/−</sup></italic> HSC to gain insight into the role of stem cells in organismal aging.

Interestingly, many of the genes from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050201-t001">Table 1</xref> exhibit a “younger” expression pattern in the <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice, including up-regulated genes such as <italic>Icam-1</italic> (−4.3 mo), <italic>CatnB</italic> (−3 mo), and <italic>Dnaja2</italic> (−2.8 mo), as well as down-regulated genes such as <italic>Madh4</italic> (−6.3 mo), <italic>Hdac6</italic> (−4.6 mo), <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> (−5 mo), and <italic>Sirt7</italic> (−6.4 mo). Genes were then grouped on the basis of GO, and the categories with a significant shift in predicted age (Wilcoxon <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) were identified. Overall, the <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice appeared younger by 1–5 mo compared to the <italic>p53<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice in the vast majority of significant GO categories (84/87) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-st008">Table S8</xref>). Only three categories were “older” in <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice, the most striking being that of the inflammatory response, indicating that this can be uncoupled from the other manifestations of aging. Examples are P-selectin and Cox2, which are older in the <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> compared to the <italic>p53<sup>+/−</sup></italic> HSC by +4.6 and +6 mo, respectively. The notion of relative youth of <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> stem cells is supported by the observation that HSC from <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice do not exhibit an age-related increase in number as is observed in their WT counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b030">30</xref>], and have attenuated activity after 5FU treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b028">28</xref>], which can be explained by the lower HSC proliferative capacity. This is also consistent with our observation that HSC from the <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice form in vitro colonies at a similar frequency as WT HSC, but with reduced size, indicating a reduced proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). These results suggest that although <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice appear older at a tissue and organismal level, the genetically imposed slower rate of proliferation uncouples the manifestations of aging in HSC, causing them to remain relatively young at a molecular level despite an inflammatory and aged tissue milieu.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Limitations in stem cell number or function have been proposed to restrict longevity. However, we show here that in WT mice, stem cells decline in function, when measured per HSC, with a concomitant increase in their number, resulting in a minimal net change in overall HSC activity, strongly suggesting that stem cells are not likely to be a factor limiting hematopoietic regeneration with age. However, their functional deficits do show that HSCs are impacted by the forces of aging in a manner similar to that of differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b034">34</xref>].</p>
      <p>In our molecular analysis, we identified global age-related changes in gene expression in murine HSCs, with a view to identifying mechanisms that could be responsible for these age-associated declines in HSC function. Genes involved in inflammatory and stress responses dominated the group of up-regulated genes, whereas those participating in chromatin regulation and DNA repair were prominent among down-regulated genes.</p>
      <p>Many of the observed expression changes are corroborated by a recent study of HSC aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b004">4</xref>]. Although the number of genes that go up or down with age was similar between our study and the one by Rossi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b004">4</xref>], the precise overlap between the genes is modest: only 343 genes were differentially expressed in both lists. We believe this is primarily due to a different purification strategy and array analysis that was used in our study. Remarkably, however, the top ten genes in both lists of genes that were Up-with-Age as well as those that were Down-with-Age were identical, and the magnitude of the changes was striking. For example, P-selectin was found highly up-regulated with age, for a mean fold-change of approximately 60 between the two studies. Likewise, both studies observed the up-regulation of specific protooncogenes, such as <italic>Runx1,</italic> that we believe could contribute to the increased incidence of myeloid leukemia with age.</p>
      <p>In both studies, the inflammation markers P-selectin and clusterin (both regulated by NF-κB) and protein-folding genes such as <italic>Hspa8</italic> and <italic>Dnajc3</italic> were found up-regulated. Additionally, we found genes involved in DNA repair and chromatin maintenance <italic>(Xab2, Rad52, Polb,</italic> and <italic>Lmna)</italic> to be down-regulated in both studies, supporting the notion that HSC become epigenetically dysregulated.</p>
      <p>The marked stress response exhibited by the HSC suggests that a proinflammatory microenvironment exists within the aging marrow. Studies of aging arteries, brain, and kidney have also observed up-regulation of inflammatory markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b035">35</xref>], but could not distinguish between immune cell infiltration and intrinsic inflammatory response of the tissue. The up-regulation of <italic>TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4)</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050201-t001">Table 1</xref>) is especially intriguing because one of its principal signaling targets is NF-κB, which regulates a variety of genes involved in the inflammatory response, including prostaglandin E2 synthase (Cox-2) and the adhesion molecules ICAM1 and P-selectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050201-t001">Table 1</xref>). This molecular profile resembles the elevated inflammatory state previously described in older mice (“inflamm-aging” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b037">37</xref>]); however, our mice were raised in specific-pathogen–free conditions, and thus the inflamm-aging can be independent of antigenic load. Strikingly, Inflammatory Response was one of the few GO categories found “older” in the <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice compared to the <italic>p53<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice. This correlates with the early-aging phenotype observed at the organismal level in <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice, and suggests that inflammation is an intrinsic effect of age.</p>
      <p>The up-regulated inflammatory genes in aging HSCs may have mechanistic implications for the decline of HSC function. The ability of HSCs to engraft in bone marrow is influenced by their homing properties; since cell adhesion plays a critical role in the engraftment of HSCs, aberrant up-regulation of genes encoding P-selectin and ICAM1 might affect the ability of older HSCs to home to the bone marrow, disrupting repopulation. Likewise, down-regulation of genes in the TGFβ signaling pathway such as <italic>SMAD4, endoglin,</italic> and <italic>spectrin b2</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050201-t001">Table 1</xref>), may explain the increased number of HSCs, because the TGFβ pathway influences HSC pool size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b038">38</xref>].</p>
      <p>Equally striking was the increased expression of clusterin (clu) and amyloid beta precursor protein (App) in aged HSCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050201-t001">Table 1</xref>), because these proteins aggregate within plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b039">39</xref>]. Cathepsin B, involved in APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b040">40</xref>] processing, also increased in aged HSCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050201-t001">Table 1</xref>). Clusterin, containing chaperone homology, along with several chaperonin subunits (beta, gamma, zeta, eta, and theta) increased with age, as did stress-response genes <italic>Hsc70/Hspa8, HSP90/Hspca, Bip/Hspa5,</italic> and several <italic>Hsp40</italic> homologs <italic>(Dnaja1, Dnaja2, Dnajb6, Dnajb10,</italic> and <italic>Dnajc3)</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050201-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050201-st001">S1</xref>). These changes, as well as the approximately 6-fold enrichment in NO-mediated signaling genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g003">Figure 3</xref>), may be in response to oxidative stress, a common feature of aged cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b041">41</xref>]. Some of these genes were previously noted to increase with age in murine hearts and skeletal muscle, and to decrease in animals on dietary restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b032">32</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although inflammatory and stress-response genes increased with age, genes that ensure transcriptional fidelity declined with age. For instance, <italic>lamin A</italic> declined with age and is linked to normal human aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b042">42</xref>] and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050201-t001">Table 1</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Bloom syndrome homolog (Blm)</italic> declined, mutations in which cause genomic instability, hypermutability, and cancer predisposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b044">44</xref>]. Multiple DNA repair genes, including <italic>Rad52, Xrcc1,</italic> and <italic>Xab2</italic> were also down-regulated. Because DNA damage is thought to be a driving factor in aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b045">45</xref>], a blunted DNA damage response could retard DNA repair, increasing the risk of retaining mutations, leading to malignant transformation, one of the hallmarks of old age.</p>
      <p>It was surprising that HSCs from 12-mo-old early-aging <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice appeared molecularly younger than age-matched WT and <italic>p53<sup>+/−</sup></italic> HSC. This suggests that a genetically imposed lower rate of stem cell proliferation, as seen in the <italic>p53<sup>+/m</sup></italic> HSC, can reduce the apparent age of the HSC, despite their residence in an environment that exhibits other outward manifestations of aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b028">28</xref>]. But this reduced proliferative capacity also results in poorer hematopoietic regeneration activity, when the stem cells are examined at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b028">28</xref>]. In other words, lower HSC proliferation results in a more youthful stem cell, but poorer tissue regeneration, and consequently an aged phenotype; this indicates that stem cell proliferation and tissue regeneration are finely balanced to maximize longevity, so that cell cycle disruption results in an uncoupling of tissue and organismal aging from the aging of the resident stem cell.</p>
      <p>Finally, three lines of evidence in our work indicate broad changes in epigenetic regulation with age. Several GO categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) and specific genes involved in transcriptional silencing via chromatin regulation are down-regulated with age, such as the SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling genes <italic>(Smarca4</italic> and <italic>Smarcb1),</italic> as well as three histone deacetylases (Hdac1, -5, and -6) and a DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt3b). Because these changes largely occur mid-way through life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), they could easily be envisioned to underlie inappropriate expression of additional genes. In addition, the CORE analysis revealed many chromosomal regions coordinately changing with age, and suggested an overall loss of transcriptional silencing. Finally, inappropriate transcription from the <italic>IgK</italic> locus, known to be driven by NF-κB activity following epigenetic modification enabling accessibility of the locus, was observed in old, but not young, HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050201-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>Together, these data suggest an epigenetic view of aging that readily explains how so many diverse effects of age are evident at molecular, cellular, and organismal levels, and contrasts with the assumption that accumulation of lesions in genomic DNA or mitochondria accounts for the major effects of aging. Chromatin dysregulation could be a primary force in aging; epigenetic changes in otherwise normal cells could drive the loss of overall cellular functionality, as well as lay a fertile ground for secondary genetic events that lead irreversibly to oncogenic transformation. In this model, inappropriate expression of protooncogenes, or down-regulation of tumor suppressors, could result in a pre-transformed state, similar to myelodysplastic syndrome, a notion corroborated by another study of aging in murine HSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b004">4</xref>] in which <italic>Runx1, Pml,</italic> and other protooncogenes were up-regulated with age. Likewise, the increased transcriptional accessibility of some loci may enable interactions between otherwise distant chromatin domains, enhancing the likelihood of chromosomal translocations. Of particular note, the <italic>IgK</italic> locus that we show is transcriptionally active in aged HSC, is a well-established translocation partner with the <italic>Myc</italic> protooncogene in the generation of hematopoietic malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b046">46</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>IgK</italic> alleles have been shown to be differentially located within the nucleus depending on their state of activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b047">47</xref>], which could result in their juxtaposition to oncogenes, increasing the likelihood of translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b048">48</xref>]. The role of epigenetic changes in cancer formation is increasingly recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b049">49</xref>]; here, we suggest that chromatin dysregulation is a natural result of environmental insults with age, and a primary driver of secondary effects of age, including malignancy. A systems approach to the ways in which inflammation, stress response, and epigenetic regulation are linked may be essential to understanding aging and cancer.</p>

        <title>Gene Ontology analyses.</title>
        <p>To investigate the biological significance of the gene lists described above, we used GO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.geneontology.org</ext-link>). GO is a controlled vocabulary that describes gene biological roles and is arranged in a quasi-hierarchical structure from more general terms to the more specific. After mapping each gene in the two lists to the GO tree structure, we determined the number of genes at or below any given node in the GO hierarchy and the amount of statistically significant enrichment (Fisher exact <italic>p-</italic>value) for each GO node relative to chance observation, using a previously developed procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050201-b054">54</xref>]. To assess the emergence and disappearance of enriched GO categories, we defined the time of half-maximal expression change (<italic>T</italic><sup>1/2-max</sup>) for each gene in each category over the time interval. For genes whose maximal expression values were outside the 2- to 21-mo interval, the <italic>T</italic><sup>1/2-max</sup> was determined as the intermediate expression value between the expression at 2 and 21 mo. For genes whose extreme expression values were within the interval, the <italic>T</italic><sup>1/2-max</sup> was determined as the intermediate expression value between the expression at 2 mo and that extrema. Genes were grouped by GO category, yielding reliable estimates of time of induction and reduction for a given biological process.

        <title>CORE analysis method.</title>
        <p>To identify COREs, we obtained the genome coordinates of the Affymetrix MOE430A array from the MM5 build of the UCSC Genome Browser. To compare the locations of age-induced or age-repressed genes, we divided all genes into two disjoint classes based on the sign of the 21-mo versus 2-mo contrast. Redundant probe sets were removed by grouping all probe sets by Entrez Gene annotation. Because not all probe sets for a single Entrez Gene identifier have the same sign for the contrast score, the sign of the mean value was assigned to the Entrez Gene identifier. To compare the positions of these locations, we constructed a Gaussian kernel density estimate by chromosomal position for genes that increased with age and genes that decreased with age. We then calculated a ratio of these density estimates for the two groups. This ratio represents the density of genes that increase (peak) or decrease (valley) with age. A permutation test was performed to estimate the <italic>p</italic>-value where gene locations were randomly swapped along each chromosome, maintaining gene density but randomizing direction of regulation (up/down), Density estimate ratios were calculated based on 1,000 random permutations. This calculation enabled us to estimate a threshold of statistical significance such that peaks and valleys (high densities of age-induced and age-repressed genes) exceeding the 0.025 and 0.975 permutation-based quantiles were judged to be statistically significant at an estimated <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05.</p>
