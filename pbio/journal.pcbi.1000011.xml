Serious alterations of alternative splicing occur in cancer tissues, leading to expression of multiple aberrant splice forms. Most studies of alternative splicing defects have focused on the identification of cancer-specific splice variants as potential therapeutic targets. Here, we examine instead the bulk of non-specific transcript isoforms and analyze their level of disorder using a measure of uncertainty called Shannon's entropy. We compare isoform expression entropy in normal and cancer tissues from the same anatomical site for different classes of transcript variations: alternative splicing, polyadenylation, and transcription initiation. Whereas alternative initiation and polyadenylation show no significant gain or loss of entropy between normal and cancer tissues, alternative splicing shows highly significant entropy gains for 13 of the 27 cancers studied. This entropy gain is characterized by a flattening in the expression profile of normal isoforms and is correlated to the level of estimated cellular proliferation in the cancer tissue. Interestingly, the genes that present the highest entropy gain are enriched in splicing factors. We provide here the first quantitative estimate of splicing disruption in cancer. The expression of normal splice variants is widely and significantly disrupted in at least half of the cancers studied. We postulate that such splicing disorders may develop in part from splicing alteration in key splice factors, which in turn significantly impact multiple target genes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>RNA splicing is the process by which gene products are pieced together to form a mature messenger RNA (mRNA). In normal cells, RNA splicing is a tightly controlled process that leads to production of a well-defined set of mRNAs. Cancer cells, however, often produce aberrant, mis-spliced mRNAs. Such disorders have not been quantified to date. To this end, we use a well-known measure of disorder called Shannon's entropy. We show that overall splicing disorders are highly significant in many cancers, and that the extent of disorder may be correlated to the level of cell proliferation in each tumor. Surprisingly, genes that control the splicing mechanism are unusually frequent among genes affected by splicing disorders. This suggests that cancer cells may withstand harmful chain reactions in which splicing defects in key regulatory genes would in turn cause extensive splicing damage. As mis-spliced mRNAs are widely studied for cancer diagnosis, awareness of these global disorders is important to distinguish reliable cancer markers from background noise.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by European Commission grant LSHG-CT-2003-503329 (The Alternative Transcript Diversity Consortium) and Institut National du Cancer grant PL0079.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The majority of mammalian genes produce alternative transcripts as part of their normal expression program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Carninci1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Johnson1">[4]</xref>.

However, while most studies of splicing and cancer attempt to isolate “signature” splice variants with significant over-expression in disease cells, no published work to date has focused on the bulk of splicing disruption that potentially arises when the splicing machinery is impaired.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the extent and modalities of non-specific alternative transcript disruptions in cancer. Instead of seeking “interesting” signature isoforms, we analyzed the distribution of all isoforms from a single gene in a given tissue. We postulated that, in a tissue where the splicing machinery is impaired, the distribution of isoforms may be more disordered than in a control tissue. To measure the level of disorder in cDNA and cDNA tag libraries, we borrowed the notion of entropy from information theory. We applied this measure to all three types of alternative transcription, comparing isoform distributions in pairs of disease and normal tissues. Our results show that neither alternative polyadenylation nor alternative transcription initiation are associated with a disordered isoform expression. However, in half of the cancers studied, alternative splicing showed a highly significant entropy gain relative to the corresponding normal tissues. We analyze this entropy gain and discuss its possible causes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isoform Entropy: Definition</title><p>Given a random variable <italic>X</italic> with probabilities <italic>P</italic>(<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>) for discrete set of events <italic>x1</italic>,….,<italic>k</italic>, Shannon's entropy, also known as Information Entropy, is defined by:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000011.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The entropy, and thus the disorder, is maximal when the probability of all the events <italic>P</italic>(<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>) are equal and thus the outcome is most uncertain.

This suggests that expression of alternative polyadenylation and initiation isoforms does not present large scale alterations in cancer. Alternative splicing however was quite different with 24 of the 27 cancer tissues studied showing a higher level of entropy than their normal counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000011-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000011.s002">Table S1</xref>). This entropy gain was highly significant in 13 cases, suggesting that the expression of splicing isoforms is strongly disrupted in certain cancers. In none of the 27 cases studied did the normal tissues show significantly higher entropy than disease tissues, and none of the three non-cancer diseases (arthritis, ascites and schizophrenia) presented a significant entropy change between normal and disease tissues.</p><p>The observed entropy bias is not imputable to sampling differences in normal and cancer libraries. The number of ESTs/cDNAs used to calculate entropy did not differ significantly between normal or disease tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000011.s002">Table S1</xref>), mainly due to the fact that we considered only isoforms that are expressed both in disease and normal tissues. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000011.s002">Table S1</xref>) showed no relationship between the entropy ratio and differences in the numbers of ESTs/cDNAs between normal and disease tissues (P = 0.28) or between the entropy ratio and the total size of libraries (P = 0.12). The observed gain in entropy can therefore not be attributed to a size effect of cancer EST libraries.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Splice Factors Are Over-Represented Among Splice-Impaired Genes</title><p>In the ten most disrupted cancer tissues, splicing entropy gains were caused by 16 to 258 significantly disrupted genes, or 30%–68% of the gene set available for entropy calculation in these tissues. This suggests that splicing perturbation is caused by factors that regulate multiple genes at the same time. Sets of splice-disrupted genes from different tissues show little overlap therefore we cannot isolate a list of genes displaying a generally higher rate of splicing disruption. However, a clear functional trend appears when high entropy gain tissues are pooled together. In the ten cancer tissues that displayed the highest gain in splicing entropy (from stomach/carcinoma to brain/astrocytoma, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000011-g002">Figure 2</xref>), we analyzed all genes showing a splicing entropy gain (414 genes) for functional enrichment. Interestingly, the most over-represented terms among splice-disrupted genes either contain “RNA splicing” or are higher level terms that incorporate RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000011-t001">Table 1</xref>). The “RNA splicing” class mostly comprises splice factors. This suggests that splicing alterations in a few key splice factors could be involved in the more extensive splicing disruption observed in the high entropy-gain tissues. This enrichment is observable only after cancer tissues are pooled, which means the number of disrupted splice factors in a single disease is low. A total of 13 splice factors show a significant increase in splicing entropy in the cancer tissues studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000011.s003">Table S2</xref>). Most are constitutive splice factors, only three (TRA2B, U2AF1, SF3A2) being involved in alternative splicing regulation.</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-1000011-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000011.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology term biases for genes with entropy gain in high-entropy cancer tissues, as measured using the Gene Ontology Toolbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Martin1">[38]</xref>.</title></caption><!--===== Grouping alternate versions of objects =====--><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi-1000011-t001-1" mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000011.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><table><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Enriched GO Term</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">P-value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Cellular physiological process</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.55E-10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">RNA metabolism</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.87E-10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">RNA processing</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3.48E-08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">mRNA metabolism</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">4.74E-08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">RNA splicing, via transesterification reactions</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">8.89E-08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">RNA splicing with bulged adenosine as nucleophile</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">8.89E-08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Nuclear mRNA splicing, via spliceosome</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">8.89E-08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Primary metabolism</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.35E-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">RNA splicing</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.69E-07</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Enrichment is measured relatively to all genes in the genome.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Splice factors are subject to alternative splicing at higher rates than average genes: 72% of the 58 annotated splice factors in Gene Ontology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Ashburner1">[22]</xref> have at least one alternative splice form in the ATD database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-LeTexier1">[25]</xref>, with an average of 5.4 isoform per gene, compared to 62% alternative splicing and 3.4 isoform per gene in the total ATD gene set. To test whether this bias could explain the over-representation of splice factors among disrupted genes in the high entropy gain cancers, we performed the same GO-term analysis among splice-disrupted genes in the ten disease categories displaying the lowest entropy gain. We could not observe any functional bias in this gene set (not shown). Therefore, splicing deregulation of splice factors is a hallmark of tissues where overall splicing is deregulated. This again designates misplicing of splice factors as a possible cause of wider splicing disruption in these tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Splicing Entropy Gain Is Correlated to Proliferation Signature</title><p>Although tumors are diverse and heterogeneous, they all share the key ability to proliferate at a higher level than normal tissue and this despite the very tight control that the organism usually exerts on cell proliferation. To test potential links between disordered isoform expression and higher levels of proliferation, we classified the cancer types that deregulate the splicing mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000011-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) in function of their proliferative potential. To evaluate proliferation, we extracted the 188 genes from the “cell cycle” module of Stuart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Stuart1">[26]</xref>, a cluster of coexpressed genes shown to be enriched in elements that are overexpressed in highly proliferative cells and whose high expression is a marker of entry into the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Puthier1">[27]</xref>.

We thus used a high expression of these markers as a surrogate for a high level of proliferation.

This new perspective enabled us to characterize another kind of splicing disorder in which splice variant expression profiles are significantly flattened in tumors. While isoforms from the same gene are usually differentially expressed in a given tissue, with clear minor and major forms, these expression differences are reduced in cancer and this leads to a raise of isoform entropy. Although controlled over/under-expression events may in principle produce a flattened profile, we find unlikely that the generalized entropy gain observed in cancer could result from a combination of multiple controlled changes in isoform expression. The entropy gain is more likely a sign of a general loss of regulation involving widespread, non-specific perturbations of alternative splicing. We did not observe such cancer-related disorders in alternative transcription initiation and alternative polyadenylation, the two other processes associated with expression of disease-specific isoforms.</p><p>Previous efforts to identify cancer-specific splice forms, either through EST analysis or experimental means, have mostly ignored non-specific, large-scale disruptions. An exception is the study by Xu and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Xu2">[29]</xref> which sought splice forms with statistically significant expression changes between normal and tumor EST libraries. In that sense, these authors were looking for events that would cause an entropy reduction, not an entropy gain. However, they also discussed the impact of unspecific disruptions and analyzed expression patterns that may lead to cancer-specific isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000011-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The most frequent patterns leading to cancer-specific events were the loss of a normal isoform S, and the switch in expression between normal (S) and cancer-specific (S') isoforms. A general entropy gain would go against the occurrence of such events, which makes these patterns even more interesting on a background of entropy gain. Contrarily, the “gain of S'” category is directly correlated to a rise of entropy (<italic>i.e.</italic> the “tumor” situation has higher entropy). Therefore, in a context of general entropy gain, events of the “gain of S'” category, even when statistically significant, could merely reflect the wider splicing disruption and should be considered with caution. Xu and Lee rightly noted that this category, which produces only a small fraction of cancer-specific splice forms, may be related to a loss of splicing specificity in tumors.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000011-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000011.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Classification of cancer-specific splice events as proposed by Xu and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Xu2">[29]</xref>.</title><p>Three typical cases of cancer-specific events are shown.

Splice factors previously analyzed for such dysfunctions include SF2/ASF, U2AF-65, SFRS2, SFRS3, SRm160, hnRNP A1/A2, and TRA2-β, all acting both in alternative and constitutive splicing. Although these factors may potentially target many genes, studies have focused on specific targets such as CD44 and have not examined more widespread splice defects. The splicing disruptions that we observed apparently affect a larger number of transcripts and are characterized by a loss of splice form regulation. Although this phenomenon might occur as a byproduct of the above mechanism, its association with the mis-splicing of splice factors, prevalently of the constitutive type, leads us to postulate a second process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000011-g007">Figure 7</xref>, box B) in which mis-splicing of general splice factors would cascade into a wider splicing disruption and entropy gains.

This transition may occur preferentially in highly proliferating tumors, where we observed the strongest splicing disruption. Splicing perturbation is knowingly correlated to proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Stickeler1">[31]</xref> however no causal relationship between these events has been identified yet. Perhaps the splicing mechanism has trouble in trying to keep up with the accelerated pace of cell proliferation or a general disorder in splicing is causing failure in the regulation of cell cycle. Independently of any mechanistic hypothesis, splicing entropy measures show that widespread splicing disruption may be prevalent in most cancer tissues. In such a context of high splicing entropy, therapeutic avenues involving the reprogrammation of mis-spliced isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-GarciaBlanco1">[34]</xref> would have a limited interest.

This database classifies 3,106,472 CAGE tags into 450,228 transcription clusters (TC) further grouped into 32,351 transcription units (TU). TCs and TUs are two operationally defined units proposed in FANTOM3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Carninci1">[1]</xref> used to characterize promoters and genes respectively. We considered only those TCs that bore proof from at least 3 different CAGE libraries and 10 transcripts. These TCs were downloaded from the RIKEN website as well as the mappings of CAGE transcripts to these TCs in a given tissue type. This allowed us to create a relational database in which each TC could be queried to display its mapped CAGEs in each tissue type and the TU to which it belongs. For each normal/disease tissue pair we could therefore query a list of TCs common to both tissue types, link these TCs to their specific TUs and obtain the number of CAGEs mapped to a each of these TCs from the normal tissue library and from the disease tissue library.</p><p>Alternative polyadenylation isoforms were downloaded from the EBI ATD database, Human Release 1 (31 May 2005) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-LeTexier1">[25]</xref> at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/atd/humrel1.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/atd/humrel1.html</ext-link>. Here, we only considered poly(A) sites located in the 3′-most exon of the gene because poly(A) sites located in upstream exons can belong to different splice forms. Since alternative splicing and polyadenylation can interfere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Tian1">[37]</xref>, such events cannot be safely attributed to either phenomena. Again, each alternative polyadenylation event had to be supported by three different cDNA libraries and 10 transcripts, giving a total of 206,138 transcripts mapped to 13,367 poly(A) sites for 4400 genes. These 13,367 poly(A) sites were downloaded from the ATD website as well as the mapping of ESTs, cDNAs and SAGES to these isoforms. cDNA and EST transcripts were then linked to the eVOC 2.6 ontology through their Genbank accession identifiers and SAGE transcripts were manually parsed for simple tissue descriptors that were identical to eVOC 2.6 ontology terms (39 descriptors from the Gene Expression Omnibus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000011-Puthier1">[27]</xref>). This allowed us to create a relational database in which each poly(A) isoform could be queried to display its mapped transcripts in each tissue type and the Ensembl gene ID to which it belonged. For each normal/disease tissue pair we could therefore query a list of poly(A) isoforms common to both tissue types, link these isoforms to their specific Ensembl gene identifier and obtain the number of transcripts mapped to a each of these isoforms from the normal tissue library and from the disease tissue library.</p><p>Alternate splice isoforms were also downloaded from the EBI ATD database, Human Release 1. Again, 3 separate libraries and 10 transcripts were required to establish a splice form. Transcripts that mapped to multiple isoforms were excluded from the study bringing the total number of transcripts/isoforms/genes in the database from 808845 / 52742 / 14791 to 444799 / 47308 / 12281. These 47,308 alternative splice sites were downloaded from the ATD website as well as the mapping of ESTs and cDNAs to these isoforms. cDNA and EST transcripts were then linked to the eVOC 2.6 ontology through their Genbank accession identifiers.
