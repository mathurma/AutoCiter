        <p>The study of epithelial morphogenesis is fundamental to increasing our
                    understanding of organ function and disease. Great progress has been made
                    through study of culture systems such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells,
                    but many aspects of even simple morphogenesis remain unclear. For example, are
                    specific cell actions tightly coupled to the characteristics of the cell's
                    environment or are they more often cell state dependent? How does the single
                    lumen, single cell layer cyst consistently emerge from a variety of cell
                    actions? To improve insight, we instantiated in silico analogues that used
                    hypothesized cell behavior mechanisms to mimic MDCK cystogenesis. We tested them
                    through in vitro experimentation and quantitative validation. We observed novel
                    growth patterns, including a cell behavior shift that began around day five of
                    growth. We created agent-oriented analogues that used the cellular Potts model
                    along with an Iterative Refinement protocol. Following several refinements, we
                    achieved a degree of validation for two separate mechanisms. Both survived
                    falsification and achieved prespecified measures of similarity to cell culture
                    properties. In silico components and mechanisms mapped to in vitro counterparts.
                    In silico, the axis of cell division significantly affects lumen number without
                    changing cell number or cyst size. Reducing the amount of in silico luminal cell
                    death had limited effect on cystogenesis. Simulations provide an observable
                    theory for cystogenesis based on hypothesized, cell-level operating
                    principles.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Epithelial cells perform essential functions throughout the body, acting as both
                    barrier and transporter and allowing an organism to survive and thrive in varied
                    environments. Although the details of many processes that occur within
                    individual cells are well understood, we still lack a thorough understanding of
                    how cells coordinate their behaviors to create complex tissues. In order to
                    achieve deeper insight, we created a list of targeted attributes and plausible
                    rules for the growth of multicellular cysts formed by Madin-Darby canine kidney
                    (MDCK) cells grown in vitro. We then designed in silico analogues of MDCK
                    cystogenesis using object-oriented programming. In silico components (such as
                    the cells and lumens) and their behaviors directly mapped to in vitro components
                    and mechanisms. We conducted in vitro experiments to generate data that would
                    validate or falsify the in silico analogues and then iteratively refined the
                    analogues to mimic that data. Cells in vitro begin to stabilize at around the
                    fifth day even as cysts continue to expand. The in silico system mirrored that
                    behavior and others, achieving new insights. For example, luminal cell death is
                    not strictly required for cystogenesis, and cell division orientation is very
                    important for normal cyst growth.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epithelial morphogenesis is fundamental to the development and functional
                specialization of tissues and organs. Tight regulation of tissue size, shape and
                polarization is critical for normal organ development and function. Disruption of
                these regulatory mechanisms leads to an array of diseases including autosomal
                dominant polycystic kidney disease, stenosis, and cancer. Epithelial cells, such as
                Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, cultured in a 3D matrix of natural basement
                membrane components, can recapitulate in vitro many of the in vivo growth
                characteristics of epithelial organs. They are thus valuable model systems for
                studying the cellular mechanisms of in vivo epithelial morphogenesis. Their
                phenotypic simplicity coupled with accumulated knowledge of their molecular biology
                provide excellent case studies for gleaning needed insight into how molecular events
                and environmental feedback pathways at subcellular levels lead to cell- and
                cyst-level phenotype. These model systems lend themselves to computational analysis
                and modeling as the means to gain that insight and improve our understanding of
                organogenesis.</p>
      <p>To achieve that goal, we must first develop explanatory and easily challenged
                computational, mechanistic models. In biological research, explanatory mechanistic
                models generally precede predictive mechanistic models. The operating principles of
                explanatory mechanistic models of the type described herein are hypotheses about how
                we think phenomena are generated. The models are part of frameworks for generating
                and testing mechanistic hypotheses, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Kim1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Kim2">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While many aspects of MDCK cyst formation are well understood, quantitative data for
                cystogenesis has been lacking. The most recent computational models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Kim1">[1]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Gin1">[4]</xref> relied on
                previously published quantitative data that described a few aspects of MDCK cyst
                growth in collagen cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Wang1">[5]</xref>. There is limited data available on the dynamics of cell
                number, cyst and lumen size, and mean cell size in Matrigel cultures. That caused
                previous models to assume that cell size remains constant. The presented data
                demonstrate that cell size varies during the course of cyst growth.</p>
      <p>An objective of the project was to couple in vitro and in silico model systems to
                achieve a deeper understanding of cell behavior during MDCK cystogenesis within 3D
                Matrigel cultures. Of specific interest were the roles played by, and the timing of
                polarization, apoptosis, and lumen expansion. In order to improve our understanding
                of the link between individual cell behavior and cystogenesis, we proceeded in
                parallel on two fronts. We undertook new in vitro experiments designed to provide a
                more temporally and spatially fine-grained record of cell-level events during the
                first ten days of MDCK cystogenesis. These experiments and their results are
                described in this report. A thorough quantitative analysis of these results revealed
                a third stage of cyst growth after cyst initiation and lumen creation and expansion.
                That stage was characterized by the presence of a new cell state marked by a
                decrease in cell division rate and cessation of the decrease in cell size observed
                in previous stages. We refer to a cell in that state as being
                “stabilized”.</p>
      <p>We also developed and iteratively refined abstract, spatially fine-grained,
                multi-attribute, mechanistic, in silico, MDCK cell analogues (ISMAs) capable of
                cystogenesis. To create and validate ISMAs, we merged two modeling techniques while
                introducing several novel features. Following rounds of iterative mechanism
                refinement (including falsification and validation), time-dependent measures of
                several in silico cystogenesis phenomena, including sizes of cells, cysts, and
                lumens, cell number, and lumen number, became quantitatively indistinguishable from
                corresponding in vitro measures. The process led to two successful ISMAs that had
                similar operating principles but relied on different mechanistic hypotheses for how
                cells stabilized. In one, cells relied on information about the lumen. In the other,
                transition to the stabilized state was a simple timed event. Independent in vitro
                experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Zheng1">[6]</xref>,
                which used molecular interventions to alter the axis of cell division in two
                different ways, provided data that challenged ISMA mechanisms and the predictions of
                the cystogenic consequences of such interventions. ISMA mechanisms survived the
                falsification challenge: measures of cystogenesis during simulation experiments
                mimicking both interventions were quantitatively similar to in vitro data. This
                further supported our hypothesis that the cause-and-effect relationships
                (mechanisms) occurring within ISMAs during in silico cystogenesis (and thus their
                morphogenic agenda) have in vitro counterparts, both in the presence and absence of
                mechanistic interventions. By challenging these in silico mechanisms we better
                understand their in vitro cellular counterparts.</p>

        <p>In order to study the process of cyst development in detail, MDCK cells were
                    grown and observed in 3D Matrigel culture for one to ten days and analyzed
                    quantitatively each day. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g001">Figure 1</xref>, cysts developed in a manner

                    apical surface of the cell) during the first two days of growth and all cells
                    polarized by day 3. Cysts developed single (11 of 20) or multiple (9 of 20)
                    lumens by the end of day 2. Most cyst cross-sections appeared circular. The

        <p>Cell number increased exponentially through day 5. It slowed and increased at a
                    constant rate after day 6. Coincident with that shift, the variance in cell
                    number per cyst increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figure
                        2A</xref>). Cyst and lumen area increased monotonically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Mean cell size
                    decreased at a constant rate through day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and then leveled off at roughly
                    the same time that cell division slowed. Mean cell size increased slightly
                    following the shift. Cell size variance was smallest on days 5–8. We did
                    not find a strong correlation between mean cell size and other cyst
                    measurements, including cell number, lumen size, lumen number, or lumen
                    perimeter/cell number. The ratio of total cellular area to cyst area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) indicated that the
                    portion of cyst occupied by cells decreased as cysts expanded (and thus the
                    portion occupied by lumen increased). The ratio decreased quite steeply between
                    days 5 and 6 with very little overlap; the majority of cysts at day 5 had a
                    ratio higher than 0.6 and the majority of cysts at day 6 had a ratio lower than
                    0.6. These observations taken together indicated a shift in cell behavior
                    occurred at approximately day 5 (referred to hereafter as simply the shift). The
                    data also supports the idea that cell compression during lumen expansion may be
                    a factor triggering cell entry into the stabilized state.</p>

        <title>Lumen percentages in vitro</title>
        <p>During the first day of growth, some cysts developed lumens, while others had no
                    visible lumen. From days 2-10 all cysts had at least one lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Multiple lumens
                    appeared in a number of cysts, but their frequency decreased over time. Previous
                    studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Zheng1">[6]</xref>
                    considered cysts to be “normal” if they contained a single layer of
                    actin and apical membrane markers surrounding a single lumen. We distinguished
                    between single-layer, single-lumen (SLSL) cysts, in which all cells contact both
                    extracellular matrix and lumen; cysts with a single lumen where some cells did
                    not touch the extracellular matrix or the lumen; and cysts with multiple lumens
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g001">Figure 1</xref>). After day 2,
                    the percentage of SLSL cysts ranged between 55% and 85% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), in rough agreement
                    with the 80% of cysts observed by Zheng et al. to be “normal”
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Zheng1">[6]</xref>. In
                    cases where single-lumen cysts did not have a single layer of cells, usually
                    only one or two cells did not contact the lumen or extracellular matrix. These
                    data indicate that the percentage of cysts with multiple lumens decreases over
                    time, likely as smaller lumens merge together into larger. It is possible that a
                    few cysts might increase their lumen number over time even as mean lumen number
                    decreased, but that behavior would only be observed using time-lapse microscopy
                    of individual cysts.</p>

        <title>ISMAs capable of cystogenesis</title>
        <p>In order to create and validate ISMAs, we used a number of modeling techniques

                    <sc>caps</sc> when referring to the latter. Following the Iterative Refinement
                    Protocol (IR Protocol) led to two specifications of <sc>cell</sc> behavior that
                    achieved all targeted attributes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002030-t001">Table 1</xref> and all prespecified Similarity
                    Measures (SMs; described below). They are the lumen stabilized ISMA (LS ISMA)
                    and the timed stabilization ISMA (TS ISMA). There are only three <sc>cell</sc>

                    micromechanisms. The latter are primarily axiom-dependent, and the axioms, in

                    placeholders for even more fine-grained micromechanisms.</p>

              <p>MDCK cells and cysts are the referent. The model system is called an
                                in silico MDCK analogue (ISMA). <bold>A:</bold> a targeted
                                attribute; <bold>S:</bold> an ISMA specification. All listed
                                attributes were achieved. The early version of the ISMA achieved TAs
                                1-4, but was falsified by the quantitative data. The refined ISMA
                                achieved all TAs except 11, which was achieved by both the LS and
                                the TS ISMAs.</p>
            </fn>
          </table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
        <p>The only difference between the LS and TS ISMAs is the mechanism used by
                        <sc>polarized</sc>
                    <sc>cells</sc> to shift to the stabilized state. Within the LS ISMA,
                        <sc>polarized</sc>
                    <sc>cells</sc> use information about the <sc>lumen</sc> to decide when to
                    stabilize. Within the TS ISMA, transition to the stabilized state is a simple
                    timed event (each <sc>cell</sc> used its own internal clock). We did not
                    discover any in vitro observations that would provide a basis for selecting one
                    micromechanism over the other.</p>
        <p>C<sc>ell</sc> operating principles require each <sc>cell</sc> to have knowledge
                    of its internal state and immediate environment, including the size of the
                    neighboring <sc>lumen</sc> (for the LS ISMA). C<sc>ell</sc>
                    <sc>division</sc> is based on factors other than <sc>cell</sc> size. Early in
                    the process, <sc>cyst</sc> size can be independent of <sc>lumen</sc> size. The
                    orientation of <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>division</sc> is extremely important in influencing the formation and number
                    of <sc>lumens</sc> within a <sc>cyst</sc>.</p>
        <p>We explored alternative mechanistic variations, but failed to find others of
                    comparable simplicity capable of achieving all targeted attributes and
                    prespecified SMs. For simplicity we present and discuss measures from LS ISMA
                    simulations within the text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g003">3</xref>)
                    and provide the same simulation measures for TS ISMAs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s001">Figures S1</xref>
                    and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s002">S2</xref>.
                    Results from earlier ISMA that were falsified because they failed to achieve one
                    or more SMs are also discussed.</p>

        <title>Similarity measures</title>
        <p>To provide a validation target for ISMA <sc>cystogenesis</sc> and to compare ISMA
                    and in vitro results, we developed SMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Lam1">[10]</xref>, which quantified the
                    similarity within and between the in silico and in vitro data. We posit that, if
                    in silico data satisfies the SMs, then that data would be indistinguishable from
                    data produced by a repeated in vitro experiment.</p>
        <p>SM1 compared results from individual simulations to in vitro mean values,
                    indicating the similarity of in silico and in vitro results. SM1 is the
                    percentage of in silico observations that fell within±25% of the
                    mean in vitro value for a given measure. SM1 values are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figure 2</xref>. To survive
                    falsification, &gt;50% of simulations must achieve the SM1 target for
                    nine of ten <sc>days</sc>, as detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>. For example, the ±25% range for in vitro cell
                    number at day 3 was 6.7 to 11.1 with a mean of 8.9. Seventy-two percent of
                    simulations had <sc>cell</sc> numbers within that range at <sc>day</sc> 3. SM1
                    values for <sc>cell</sc> number, <sc>cyst</sc> size, mean <sc>cell</sc> area,
                    and the ratio of <sc>cellular</sc> to <sc>cyst</sc> area exceeded 50% at
                    all <sc>days</sc>, so a degree of validation was achieved. The SM1 value for
                        <sc>lumen</sc> size exceeded the 50% cutoff for nine of ten
                        <sc>days</sc>, although the values were lower.</p>
        <p>To facilitate assessing SM1 values and comparing in vitro and in silico data, we
                    specified and used Self-Similarity Measure 1 (SSM1). It measured the similarity
                    between the in vitro mean value and individual in vitro values and thus how
                    closely grouped around the mean the individual in vitro values were. Similar to
                    SM1, SSM1 is the percentage of individual in vitro cyst measures each day that
                    fall within a specified range. SSM1 can be used to evaluate corresponding SM1
                    values. Large SSM1 values are a characteristic of measures having a small
                    variance. Values of SSM1 were larger than the target for all measures except
                    lumen size, indicating that lumen size in vitro varied more extensively about
                    the mean than other quantities.</p>
        <p>SM1 did not consider the variance of the data. To address variance, we specified
                    SM2. It compared the coefficient of variance of in silico and in vitro
                    experiments. SM2 measured the absolute value of the difference between the in
                    vitro and in silico coefficient of variance each <sc>day</sc>. ISMAs survived
                    falsification if SM2&lt;0.15 for nine of ten <sc>days</sc> (strong validation)
                    or &lt;0.25 for eight of ten <sc>days</sc> (medium validation). The current ISMA
                    achieved strong validation for <sc>cell</sc> number, mean <sc>cell</sc> area,
                    and the ratio of cellular to cyst area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s014">Table S1</xref>). It achieved medium validation for
                        <sc>cyst</sc> size and <sc>lumen</sc> size, comparable to SSM1 values.</p>

        <title>Altering cell division orientation in silico dramatically alters cyst

        <p>After the ISMAs achieved the above, targeted attributes, Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Zheng1">[6]</xref> reported
                    measuring the consequences of disrupting cell division orientation on MDCK cyst
                    morphology. Knocking down LGN, which plays a role in spindle orientation during
                    cell division, caused cell division orientation to become random instead of
                    aligning with the axis perpendicular to the cellular plane. The frequency of
                    “normal” cysts decreased from roughly 80% to 20-30%.
                    We added those observations to our targeted attributes list and then explored
                    the degree to which <sc>cyst</sc> morphology following a comparable ISMA
                    intervention would mimic the in vitro results, thus surviving the challenge. We

                    similar to those of Zheng et al. The altered ISMA produced less than 20%

        <p>In a second experiment, Zheng et al. targeted LGN to the apical membrane. So
                    doing rotated the axis of division by 90°, thus reversing cell division
                    orientation. The procedure reduced the frequency of normal cysts to roughly
                    10%. We conducted a similar experiment by modifying ISMAs so that the

        <title>Simulated cyst growth with delayed cell polarization</title>
        <p>Delayed cell polarization is believed to contribute to the differences in cyst
                    growth in Matrigel and collagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-MartnBelmonte2">[9]</xref>, although it is
                    possible that a lower initial rate of cell clustering and a slower growth rate
                    might be factors as well. To explore the effect of delayed <sc>polarization</sc>
                    on ISMA <sc>cystogenesis</sc>, we increased the value of
                        <italic>polarDelay</italic> from 42 (equivalent to 21 hours) to 130
                    (equivalent to 65 hours). Relative to controls, <sc>cell</sc> number increased
                    at an equivalent rate during the first six <sc>days</sc>, but was larger during
                        <sc>days</sc> 7–10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). C<sc>ell</sc>
                    <sc>polarization</sc> (data not shown) and <sc>lumen</sc> formation occurred
                    later than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g008">Figure
                        8B</xref>). The area taken up by <sc>cells</sc> remained roughly constant,
                    but the delay in <sc>lumen</sc> formation and resulting smaller <sc>lumens</sc>
                    caused the ratio of <sc>cellular</sc> area to total <sc>cyst</sc> area to be
                    significantly larger than control values during <sc>days</sc> 2-8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s008">Figure S8</xref>).
                    Not surprisingly, there were fewer single and multiple <sc>lumen</sc>
                    <sc>cysts</sc> during the first three <sc>days</sc>. When <sc>lumen</sc>
                    formation began, however, it often resulted in multiple <sc>lumens</sc>
                    (&gt;80% for <sc>days</sc> 4–6); SLSL <sc>cysts</sc> were observed
                    infrequently. As <sc>lumens</sc> expanded and merged during the later stages of
                    growth, the frequency of SLSL <sc>cysts</sc> increased. The percentage of
                        <sc>dying</sc>
                    <sc>cells</sc> not contacting the <sc>matrix</sc> was significantly larger at

                    <sc>died</sc> as <sc>lumen</sc> expansion occurred (data not shown). Some of
                    these in silico results reflect those observed within growth in collagen, but it
                    seems unlikely that delayed cell polarization in vitro is solely responsible for

                    no evidence of behavioral differences between cells within single and multiple
                    lumen cysts. We could not establish a causative connection between the slowing
                    of cell division and the change in cell size. The evidence indicates that
                    initial lumen expansion is somewhat isochoric: early lumen expansion is
                    primarily a consequence of cell shrinkage. After an interval of lumen expansion
                    and cell shrinkage lasting about six days, cell behavior changes: cell size
                    stabilizes and cells begin to stretch as the lumen continues to expand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g001">Figure 1</xref>); cell division slows
                    dramatically; the expanding lumen becomes the primary driver of cyst size; and
                    the variance in both cell area and cyst size increases.</p>

        <title>Iterative process</title>
        <p>Iteratively constructed ISMAs quantitatively mimicked a targeted set of in vitro

                    corresponding measures of MDCK cystogenesis over ten days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g003">3</xref>, &amp; 5). The pathways and proteins that
                    play influential roles in cell behavior during MDCK cystogenesis are objects of
                    active research and are increasingly well understood. However, knowledge of how
                    specific cell actions and events are choreographed during cystogenesis is still
                    limited. The latter knowledge is needed to begin establishing causal linkages
                    between molecular level events and systemic phenotype.</p>
        <p>Previous analogues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Kim2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Grant1">[3]</xref> used a simple representation of a cell: each
                        <sc>cell</sc> occupied a single 2D hexagonal grid space. They were falsified
                    when we added qualitative observations about changes in cell size and shape to
                    our targeted attributes list (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002030-t001">Table 1</xref>). To mimic these newly targeted attributes, we needed
                        <sc>cells</sc> to be more fine-grained. To generate the current ISMA, we
                    began with an in silico analogue that had achieved a degree of validation and
                    then conducted in vitro experiments designed to challenge and possibly falsify
                    it. We then reengineered the in silico system to reflect, explore, and challenge
                    new insight provided by the fresh in vitro data. We engineered new analogues
                    using the cellular Potts model (CPM), which provided several capabilities,
                    including enabling <sc>cell</sc> size and shape change. To slow the increase in
                        <sc>cell</sc> number after <sc>day</sc> 6, we introduced a stable
                        <sc>cell</sc> state.</p>
        <p>We envision the above in silico-wet-lab cycle continuing indefinitely. It is
                    straightforward to explore the consequences of in silico mechanistic
                    interventions. If these interventions result in altered system behaviors
                    (predictions), it may suggest new in vitro experiments designed to test them.
                    Examples include the effect of delayed polarization on cyst phenotype, the lack
                    of noticeable changes when cell death is inhibited, and the causal link between
                    lumen size and cell stabilization. Furthermore, we expect a change in cell state
                    (cell stabilization at day 6) to be accompanied by measurable changes in gene
                    expression profiles and biochemical signaling.</p>

        <title>Improved analogue</title>
        <p>The ISMA illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g004">Figure
                        4</xref> achieved all targeted attributes. It was preceded by two earlier
                    versions. These ISMAs differed in the mechanism used to initiate <sc>cell</sc>
                    stabilization. We hypothesized that in vitro cells might use knowledge of their
                    internal geometry to sense their perceived stretch and subsequently stabilize.
                    One early analogue, the geometrical mechanism ISMA (GM ISMA), directly tested
                    this hypothesis; each <sc>cell</sc> used measures of its area and geometry to
                    determine when to shift to the stabilized state. To achieve a degree of
                    validation required the use of an axiom specifying that stabilized
                        <sc>cells</sc> would be more likely than <sc>polarized</sc>
                    <sc>cells</sc> to <sc>die</sc> when not in contact with <sc>matrix</sc>. This
                    axiom was implemented in order to decrease the number of <sc>cells</sc> within
                    the <sc>lumen</sc> and thus increase the number of SLSL <sc>cysts</sc>. The GM
                    ISMA was falsified when targeted SMs for the percentage of single
                    <sc>lumen</sc>, multiple <sc>lumen</sc>, and SLSL <sc>cysts</sc> were
                    strengthened to those achieved in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s009">Figures S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s010">S10</xref>). It
                    was falsified because the time at which <sc>cells</sc> stabilized was too
                    variable; some <sc>cells</sc> stabilized early, others much later, resulting in
                    very few SLSL cysts (data not shown).</p>
        <p>A second version, called the timed stabilization ISMA (TS ISMA), used an internal
                    clock to signal <sc>cell</sc> stabilization, resulting in a uniform
                    stabilization time and reducing the variance in <sc>cyst</sc> size. The TS ISMA
                    survived falsification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s001">Figure S1</xref>), providing evidence that
                    stabilization time influences SLSL <sc>cyst</sc> percentages. The GM ISMA axiom
                    specifying that stabilized <sc>cells</sc> would be more likely than
                        <sc>polarized</sc>
                    <sc>cells</sc> to <sc>die</sc> when not in contact with <sc>matrix</sc> was not
                    needed. The TS ISMA was capable of generating high percentages of SLSL cysts
                    even without this axiom, and so the axiom was removed in that and subsequent
                    ISMAs.</p>
        <p>Although the TS ISMA survived falsification, we were not aware of any in vitro
                    evidence suggesting existence of an equivalent internal clock-based mechanism.
                    If such a mechanism does exist, it might be molecularly equivalent to that of
                    cell polarization. Genes that regulate cellular senescence can suppress the cell
                    cycle, and the sirtuin protein SIRT1 is involved in cellular senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Campisi1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Wang2">[13]</xref>. It is
                    possible a cell-autonomous timing mechanism could exist that depends on the
                    regulation of SIRT1 and its downstream targets, as detailed in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s018">Text S1</xref>. We
                    hypothesized that a mechanism that used the geometry of the <sc>lumen</sc>
                    instead of the geometry of individual <sc>cells</sc> to signal <sc>cell</sc>
                    stabilization might bridge that gap and still produce a low variance in
                    stabilization times. We developed the lumen stabilized ISMA (LS ISMA) described
                    within this report to test that hypothesis and discovered that in addition to
                    surviving falsification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figure
                        2</xref>) it generated stabilization variance between the GM and TS ISMAs.
                    We can surmise a mapping between the <sc>lumen</sc>-based stabilization
                    mechanism and a functionally equivalent in vitro mechanism in which apical
                    sensory input to each cell provides it with information that correlates to lumen
                    size. Current evidence supports the hypothesis that cells in the cyst wall can
                    sense lumen size. One mechanism utilizes the tension generated at the luminal
                    membrane by membrane stretching. This tensional information is transduced by the
                    subapical F-actin network, which acts both as a scaffold for maintaining luminal
                    integrity, as well as a region for aggregation of recycling endosomes that
                    regulate the protein and lipid composition of the apical plasma membrane. Thus,
                    regulators of this F-actin network can regulate lumen and cyst size. Potential
                    molecular mechanisms are detailed in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s018">Text
                    S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>We should seek additional, in silico mechanisms that are equally effective in
                    enabling ISMAs to achieve validation targets. Given phenomena, what hypothetical
                    generators (and measures) might generate them? Studying an inverse mapping
                    requires multiple, seemingly plausible hypotheses, which then compete against
                    each other during simulation experiments as done here. After falsification and
                    validation using the IR Protocol, those that survive spawn additional, more
                    refined hypotheses. Having multiple mechanistic options for realizing the same
                    behaviors may be biomimetic in that it marginally increases system robustness.
                    An example of a potential additional in silico mechanism is one that uses
                    time-dependent dynamic parameters, which might assist in the exploration of
                    finer-grained, intracellular molecular behaviors.</p>
        <p>ISMAs currently contain a small number of parameters that can have implicitly
                    dynamic values (such as the time that elapses between <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>division</sc> events). They change when <sc>cells</sc> change state. In
                    general, however, all parameters are fixed for the duration of the simulation.
                    Expanding the set of targeted attributes may force consideration of time varying
                    parameter values. If, for example, in vitro data were targeted that demonstrated
                    the build-up of certain proteins along the plasma membrane, dynamic variables
                    could be implemented that controlled the amount of the <sc>protein</sc>
                    counterpart within the analogue.</p>

        <title>Challenging ISMA predictions</title>
        <p>ISMAs had already achieved all targeted attribute when the work of Zheng et al.
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Zheng1">[6]</xref> was
                    published. Results from their studies provided an independent challenge to ISMA
                    mechanisms and their robustness. The simulation results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g006">Figure 6</xref> are a consequence of two different
                    simulation interventions: making the <sc>cell</sc> axis of <sc>division</sc>
                    random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) and
                    reversing the <sc>cell</sc> axis of <sc>division</sc> (rotating it
                        90°)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).
                    These predictions are fully consistent with the in vitro results of Zheng et al.
                    As previously stated, they defined a normal cyst as one with actin staining at
                    the apical cell surfaces surrounding a single lumen. Included in that definition
                    are our SLSL <sc>cysts</sc> and <sc>cysts</sc> with a single <sc>lumen</sc>. In
                    Zheng et al., when cell division was randomized, the percentage of cysts with
                    single lumens at day 4 dropped from 81.9% to 21.5%, a different of
                    60.4%. In ISMA simulations, when <italic>divisionReg</italic> was changed
                    from 1 (ordered <sc>division</sc>) to 0 (random <sc>division</sc>) the
                    percentage of <sc>cysts</sc> with a single <sc>lumen</sc> dropped from
                    94% to 46%, a difference of 48%, which is quite similar to
                    the decrease observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, when the axis of division was reversed, the percentage of
                    cysts with a single lumen dropped from 81.9% to 11.5%, a
                    difference of 70.4%. Within the ISMA, when <italic>divisionReg</italic>
                    was changed from 1 to 3 (reversed division), the percentage of <sc>cysts</sc>
                    with a single <sc>lumen</sc> dropped from 94% to 14%, a difference
                    of 80%. In addition, the in silico results provide a prediction of in
                    vitro behavior that could be challenged through in vitro experimentation. When
                        <sc>division</sc> is reversed within the LS ISMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s005">Figure S5A</xref>)
                        <sc>cell</sc> number continues to increase after day 6, most likely because
                    the numerous small <sc>lumens</sc> do not reach a sufficient size to cause
                        <sc>cell</sc> stabilization. In strong contrast, when <sc>division</sc> is
                    reversed within the TS ISMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s011">Figure S11-2</xref>) <sc>cell</sc> number stops
                    increasing at day 5 and remains stable thereafter. Future experiments of the
                    type conducted by Zheng et al. that quantify cytogenesis over longer intervals
                    would provide evidence supporting one or the other mechanistic hypothesis.</p>

                    cystogenesis. At the systemic level, we have excellent cystogenesis similarity
                    over ten days for multiple measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g003">Figures 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g005">5</xref>). Further analogue improvement will, following additional cycles
                    of the IR Protocol, allow <sc>intracellular</sc> events to become concretized
                    and increasingly fine-grained, thus enabling quantitative in silico-to-in vitro
                    mappings at multiple levels.</p>
        <p>All specified events were necessary and essential for achieving targeted SMs. For
                        <sc>cell</sc>-level events, the mappings are clear: they are direct and
                    quantifiable. I<sc>ntracellular</sc> events, axioms, and protocols are below the
                    current level of resolution. There is no requirement that a specific
                        <sc>intracellular</sc> event, axiom, or protocol has a cell-level
                    counterpart. We simply hypothesize that the <italic>set</italic> of
                        <sc>intracellular</sc> events, axioms, and protocols—a
                        <sc>cell</sc>'<sc>s</sc> operating principles—has an in vitro
                    counterpart, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g009">Figure 9</xref>. For some <sc>intracellular</sc> events, conceptual
                    mappings are clear. Examples include <sc>cell</sc> initiates <sc>dying</sc>,
                        <sc>death</sc> advances, and decrement <italic>polarCounter.</italic> For

                    The expectation is that, in moving forward, as axioms are replaced by concrete,
                    interacting components (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Tang1">[14]</xref> and the <italic>future experiments</italic>

            <p>Left: MDCK cell cultures are the referent wet-lab systems. During
                            experiments, cells draw on genetically controlled operating principles,
                            and cystogenesis is the result. Influential mechanistic details are
                            reflected in the collected data. Right: an abstract mechanistic
                            description, a set of targeted attributes, and specifications paired to
                            those attributes direct analogue design. Software components are
                            designed, specified, coded, verified, and assembled guided by that
                            mechanistic description. The product of the process is a collection of
                            abstract mechanisms rendered in software. A clear mapping is intended
                            between ISMA <sc>cells</sc>, their axioms and operating principles, and
                            MDCK <sc>cell</sc> and <sc>intracellular</sc> details. Relative
                            similarity is controlled in part by parameterizations. Importantly, that
                            mapping can be concretized iteratively. Compilation and source code
                            execution gives rise to a working ISMA. Its dynamics are intended to
                            represent abstractly corresponding dynamics (both observed in movies and
                            believed to occur) within cultures during ten-day experiments. That
                            mapping can also be concretized iteratively. Measures of
                                <sc>cystogenesis</sc> provide time series data that are intended to
                            be quantitatively similar (according to prespecified criteria) to
                            corresponding measures of MDCK cell cystogenesis. Achieving increasingly
                            stringent SMs provides degrees of validation.</p>

        <p>A good example of a project in which <sc>intracellular</sc> events are
                    incorporated and to some degree mapped back to those in vitro, is the IBCell

                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Rejniak2">[16]</xref>. It
                    is a biomechanical model of MCF-10A cell cystogenesis in which proteins on the
                    outer cell membrane and the extracellular matrix are specifically simulated. The
                    IBCell model successfully reproduced some aspects of cystogenesis, but it
                    remains unclear whether the <sc>intracellular</sc> details are necessary or
                    could be replaced by coarse-grained components. The quantitative data used to
                    validate the model lacked the level of resolution necessary to falsify
                    intracellular mechanisms.</p>

        <title>Cell death and the timing of cell polarization</title>
        <p>Surprisingly, <sc>cysts</sc> with little or no <sc>cell</sc> death can still be
                    well organized with a single <sc>lumen</sc>. Reducing <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>death</sc> rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g007">Figure
                        7</xref>) altered <sc>cystogenesis</sc> details only marginally, primarily
                    because <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>death</sc> frequency was already low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Lin1">[17]</xref> hypothesized that apoptosis is
                    crucial for lumen formation in MDCK cysts, but they reached that conclusion
                    based on observations of cystogenesis in collagen culture only.
                    Martín-Belmonte et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-MartnBelmonte2">[9]</xref> observed that
                    apoptosis within Matrigel cultures is less frequent than within collagen
                    cultures. Within ISMA simulations, earlier <sc>lumen</sc> formation results in
                    more organized <sc>cyst</sc> growth and fewer <sc>cells</sc> that <sc>die</sc>
                    after losing contact with the <sc>matrix</sc> once <sc>lumens</sc> have formed.
                    It is possible that apoptosis acts simply as a cleanup mechanism within MDCK
                    cysts, but the degree to which it is utilized depends on the environment, the
                    rate of cell growth, and the timing of polarization. Our experiments reducing
                    the rate of <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>death</sc> showed that although the rate of <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>death</sc> within <sc>cysts</sc> during growth is normally quite low,
                        <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>death</sc> still contributes to controlling <sc>cell</sc> number and
                    maintaining SLSL <sc>cysts</sc>. It is possible that environmental adjustments
                    may provide conditions in which MDCK cell cystogenesis produces normal SLSL
                    cysts without requiring cell death, as occurs in human alveolar type II
                    epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Yu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Kim3">[19]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Relative to cystogenesis in Matrigel, cells grown in collagen produce smaller
                    cysts with fewer cells and delayed polarization. That delay might play a role in
                    formation of smaller cysts. However, ISMA experiments showed that delaying
                        <sc>polarization</sc> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g008">Figure
                        8</xref>) increased cell number and decreased the percentage of
                        <sc>cysts</sc> with single <sc>lumens</sc>. We take those observations as
                    strong evidence that delayed cell polarization alone is insufficient to account
                    for that difference in cystogenesis within collagen and Matrigel cultures.</p>

        <title>Future in vitro experiments</title>
        <p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g009">Figure 9</xref>, a
                    goal is to build, expand, and validate in silico mechanistic networks that map
                    to plausible causal linkages between intracellular details and features of MDCK
                    cell phenotype in culture. A prerequisite is to have <sc>cells</sc> capable of
                    achieving increasingly fine-grained and expanding coverage of MDCK cell,
                    cluster, and cyst behaviors under different conditions. Advances in imaging
                    technology have made doing so easier. Similar coverage will be needed of
                    intracellular (subcellular) dynamics, including the behaviors of cell components
                    under different conditions. We anticipate that studies of in vitro MDCK cell
                    cystogenesis using high-resolution, time-lapse microscopy will reveal new
                    behavioral details at each level. Recent studies have employed confocal
                    time-lapse microscopy to understand lumen formation, but only imaged cells for
                    eight hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Ferrari1">[20]</xref>. Ewald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Ewald1">[21]</xref> set the standard for
                    long-term time-lapse microscopy in their work on the elongation of mouse mammary
                    ducts, in which they captured individual images every 15 minutes for five days,
                    using high-sensitivity cameras to avoid phototoxicity.</p>
        <p>There is ample evidence that tension within the extracellular matrix influences
                    epithelial cell behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Paszek1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Wells1">[23]</xref>. Paszek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Paszek1">[22]</xref> demonstrated that
                    increasing matrix stiffness resulted in tumorigenic behavior in MCF-10A cells.
                    It seems reasonable to expect changes in MDCK cell, cluster, and/or cyst
                    behaviors as Matrigel stiffness, density, and additives are changed. Experiments
                    similar to those within <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Paszek1">[22]</xref> conducted with MDCK cells and for longer durations
                    are needed to expand ISMA coverage of MDCK phenotype in important ways.</p>
        <p>Although the underlying in vitro molecular mechanisms to which the TS and LS ISMA
                    map remain unclear, in vitro experiments may indicate one mechanism as being
                    more plausible. Careful analysis of images generated through time-lapse
                    microscopy is expected to be informative. If the elapsed time between individual
                    cyst polarization and stabilization of division rate or mean cell size are
                    similar between cysts, that would be supportive of an internal clock mechanism.
                    However, if the interval varied between cysts, that would falsify such a
                    mechanism. If mean lumen size when division rate and cell size have stabilized
                    are similar between cysts, that would support the shift mechanism based on lumen
                    size. Experiments are suggested in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s018">Text S1</xref> to

        <title>Future in silico experiments</title>
        <p>Five directions for in silico experiments present themselves. The first two
                    require seeking contradictory or supportive literature evidence of in silico
                    experiments. 1) Exploring the consequences of parameter changes will provide
                    insight into ISMA's mechanism-phenotype relationships for which there may
                    be biological counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Kim1">[1]</xref>. A full suite of parameter change experiments was
                    conducted using the LS-ISMA; results are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s011">Figure S11</xref>.
                    One example is to explore the consequences of changing
                        <italic>deathRateEpi</italic> and <italic>deathRateLumen</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s011">S11</xref>),
                    including setting both to 0. Another is to vary <italic>lumenGrowthRate</italic>
                    to explore the effect of increased or decreased <sc>lumen</sc> expansion on in
                    silico <sc>cystogenesis</sc> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Addition of any of several
                    compounds to the culture media in vitro will stimulate cyst expansion. Examples
                    include cholera toxin and forskolin. 2) Modify axioms and operating principles
                    to simulate targeted mechanistic interventions. One example (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>) is to modify the way in which
                        <sc>cells</sc> calculate their axis of <sc>division</sc>. Another is to
                    modify how <sc>matrix</sc> is represented in order to explore consequences of
                    altered <sc>matrix</sc> properties on <sc>cystogenesis</sc>. Currently,
                        <sc>matrix</sc> is simply a grid space state. Matrix could be represented
                    using a CPM “cell” that offers resistance to <sc>cell</sc>
                    advancement. So doing opens the door to exploration of a variety of
                        <sc>matrix</sc>-<sc>cell</sc> interactions that could map to proteins
                    altering local matrix properties. 3) Systematically expand the targeted
                    attributes while keeping <sc>cells</sc> atomic. Movies, such as Video S1 from
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-MartnBelmonte2">[9]</xref>
                    along with the current literature, contain examples of many behaviors beyond the
                    scope of the current ISMAs. Adding any one of the following to the list of
                    targeted attributes will falsify the current ISMAs. At the cell level: when
                    cells undergo mitosis, they enlarge temporarily and then return to a smaller
                    size; some cells (and cysts) move around during the early stages of
                    cystogenesis; some cells migrate toward each other and cluster together before
                    initiating division; typically, when cells die in contact with matrix, they are
                    flushed into the luminal space where they shrink and disappear. At the cyst
                    level: cysts spin. The process was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Ferrari1">[20]</xref> and recently modeled in
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Marmaras1">[24]</xref>.
                    Cyst growth may have an additional later stage characterized by significantly
                    slowed expansion, rather than continuing to grow steadily as predicted by the
                    ISMA. The dynamics of lumen merging are more complex than the merging events
                    that occur during simulations. Also, lumens change shape and move within cysts
                    during the initial stages of growth.</p>
        <p>4) Increase realism by transforming <sc>cells</sc> from atomic to composite
                    objects. The axioms used by <sc>cells</sc> are placeholders for more
                    fine-grained micromechanisms. The latter can be instantiated in future ISMA
                    descendents. Before we can turn our attention to intracellular processes, we
                    need new ISMAs in which <sc>cells</sc> are composite (and eventually
                    hierarchical) analogues that can achieve essentially the same, targeted SMs as
                    the current ISMAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figures 2</xref>
                    and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g003">3</xref>). Previous reports
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Tang1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Kim3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Hunt1">[25]</xref> explained
                    that an in silico analogue (such as the current ISMA) that quantitatively mimics
                    many cell-level phenomena can be used to begin the sequential process of
                    drilling down and establishing plausible, causal linkages between phenotype and
                    molecular level details. Using cross-model validation procedures, the atomic
                        <sc>cell</sc> is replaced by a composite <sc>cell</sc> where phenomenal
                    axioms are replaced by concrete micromechanisms involving interacting objects
                    that map to subcellular processes and/or components in the referent. 5) Once we
                    have the preceding composite <sc>cells</sc>, we can expand the list of targeted
                    attributes to include subcellular and intracellular behaviors. Alternatively,
                    expanding the list of targeted attributes can require transforming
                        <sc>cells</sc> from atomic to composite objects. Examples of subcellular and
                    intracellular behaviors include the amount and location of polarization
                    proteins, organelle movement, the organization of the mitotic spindle, formation
                    of a pre-apical patch, location-dependent lipid compartments within the
                    membrane, etc. During cell polarization (as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-MartnBelmonte1">[8]</xref>), PTEN moves to the
                    apical membrane, where it converts PIP3 to PIP2, which binds to Anx2 and assists
                    in the recruitment of Cdc42 to the apical membrane. The task at this stage,
                    while adhering to a strong parsimony guideline, is to add new mechanisms and
                    details that enable validation against the new, targeted attributes, while
                    retaining all of those mechanisms and behaviors that enabled validation during
                    earlier cycles of the IR Protocol. So doing will enable the in silico
                    exploration, falsification, and validation of increasingly complex in vitro MDCK
                    cell behaviors, which will ultimately correlate to in vivo phenotypes of
                    developing epithelial organs.</p>
        <p>We hypothesize that the local cause-and-effect relationships (mechanisms)
                    occurring in ISMAs during execution, and thus their morphogenic agenda, have in
                    vitro counterparts. Challenging these alternative hypotheses can be a focus for
                    future in vitro experiments and ISMA refinements.</p>

        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Through careful application of the IR Protocol, analogues of MDCK cystogenesis in
                    cultures (ISMAs) were developed, falsified, refined, and validated against
                    novel, multi-attribute quantitative data. ISMAs were based on software
                    specifications that enabled in silico behaviors during simulation to achieve
                    degrees of validation: to be mapped quantitatively to measures of cystogenesis
                    (targeted attributes). Those specifications also enabled hypothesizing that ISMA
                    operating principles, axioms, components, events, and mechanisms have in vitro
                    counterparts. Predictions of substantive mechanistic changes were verified by
                    independent experiments. ISMAs were used to explore and test hypotheses about
                        <sc>cell</sc> and <sc>cyst</sc> dynamics. The above, coupled in vitro and in
                    silico experiments led to four insights. 1) The axis of <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>division</sc> significantly affects <sc>lumen</sc> number without changing
                        <sc>cell</sc> number or <sc>cyst</sc> size. 2) Reducing the amount of
                        <sc>luminal</sc>
                    <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>death</sc> had limited effect on <sc>cystogenesis</sc>. 3) Later stages of
                    cystogenesis, marked by a decrease in the rate of cell division and cessation of
                    the decrease in mean cell size, can be explained by the presence of a new cell
                    state (called stabilized), which differs in a few key behaviors. 4) The same,
                    multi-attribute phenotype can be a consequence of two fundamentally different
                    mechanisms that, in silico, only alter the mechanism of <sc>cell</sc>
                    stabilization. By providing a new way of thinking about cystogenesis, ISMA
                    simulations have provided an impetus to explore novel aspects of epithelial
                    morphogenesis.</p>

        <title>In vitro methods</title>
        <p>A single cell suspension of MDCK cells was plated in duplicate on a layer of
                    100% Matrigel basement membrane (BD Biosciences) in the presence of
                    2% Matrigel in the media. Cysts were allowed to grow for the indicated
                    duration then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then stained
                    as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-OBrien2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Yu2">[26]</xref>. Briefly, cells were stained with a monoclonal
                    antibody against gp135/podocalyxn, and a polyclonal antibody against
                    β-Catenin. F-actin and nuclei were stained with Alexa-labeled phalloidin and
                    Hoechst 33342 respectively. Each day, 20 cysts from the duplicate plates were
                    selected at random and imaged using a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal
                    microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Images were acquired sequentially in four separate
                    channels.</p>
        <p>Cell number was determined by counting the nuclei, when visible, and actin
                    borders when not. Cyst and lumen perimeter were traced using ImageJ and the size
                    of the cyst and lumen within each cross section was calculated using the analyze
                    tool. Cellular area was found by subtracting lumen area from cyst area; mean
                    cell area was found by dividing cellular area by the number of cells; and the
                    ratio of cellular area to cyst area was found by dividing cellular area by cyst
                    area. Standard deviations and Similarity Measure values (defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>) were calculated using R. The number
                    of lumens in each cyst was found by counting the discrete spaces within the cyst
                    bordered by gp135/podocalyxn and actin.</p>
        <p>The data generated by the in vitro experiments was quantitatively consistent with
                    results from previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Zheng1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-MartnBelmonte2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Kim4">[27]</xref>, as well as
                    being internally consistent. The goal of conducting the in vitro experiments was
                    to provide a particular quantitative perspective on MDCK cystogenesis. We sought
                    an abstract mechanistic explanation of one set of cytogenic trajectories.
                    Repeated in vitro experiments using a different batch of cells could result in
                    distinct cytogenic trajectories, which might not be explained by the current
                    ISMAs. Understanding and simulating such different trajectories is outside the
                    scope of this project.</p>

        <title>ISMA uses</title>
        <p>An early task in any modeling effort is to state near- and long-term uses; one
                    must then strive to follow a model development path intended to achieve those
                    uses. When dealing with biology, having explanatory mechanistic models
                    necessarily precedes having predictive mechanistic models. This project is an
                    important, early step in developing explanatory mechanistic models of
                    cystogenesis. A truly useful explanatory mechanistic model is one in which we
                    can observe putative cause-effect events at several layers as they unfold. Given
                    those considerations, we envisioned six near-term ISMA uses. 1) Instantiate and
                    challenge hypotheses about mechanisms of cystogenesis by MDCK cells under
                    different culture conditions. 2) Make it easy to follow mechanistic processes
                    and trace cause-effect relationships. 3) Achieve measures of
                        <sc>cystogenesis</sc> during ISMA executions of increasingly autonomous
                        <sc>cells</sc> that are quantitatively similar to referent measures (i.e.,
                    they achieve targeted SMs). 4) Achieve increasing overlap of an MDCK cell
                    culture's phenotype by an ISMA phenotype. 5) For validated ISMAs, explore
                    the consequences of mechanistic interventions on measures of
                        <sc>cystogenesis</sc>. 6) Expose possible gaps in our knowledge of MDCK cell
                    cystogenesis. Implicit in these uses is the ability of ISMA behaviors under
                    different conditions to stand as predictions of MDCK cell and cyst behaviors
                    under comparable conditions.</p>
        <p>The preceding are prerequisites for achieving six long-term ISMA uses. 1) Enable
                    replacing ISMA operating principles with concrete mechanisms composed of
                    interacting components. So doing is required to enable hierarchical linkage of
                    molecular level details with specific phenotypic attributes. 2) Execute in
                    silico experiments that test the effect on ISMA <sc>cystogenesis</sc> of
                    simulated chemical and genetic interventions that affect <sc>cell</sc>
                    behaviors. 3) Enable continuous refinement of increasingly trustable, complex,
                    biomimetic mechanisms that stand as plausible explanations for increasingly
                    large sets of multi-attribute, multi-source wet-lab data. 4) Represent
                    uncertainty at multiple levels, including uncertainty in mechanistic hypotheses;
                    provide plausible representations of sources of variability in referent data and
                    phenomena. 5) Enable straightforward redeployment and adaptation of ISMA
                    components to represent other cell types and their behaviors; examples include
                    MCF-10A and primary mouse breast organoids. 6) Enable concrete translations
                    between in vitro knowledge and epithelial diseases such as autosomal dominant
                    polycystic kidney disease and cancer.</p>

        <p>Components and mechanisms mapped as closely as possible to components and
                    mechanisms in the referent system. ISMAs were composed of <sc>cells</sc>,
                        <sc>luminal</sc> space, and <sc>extracellular</sc>
                    <sc>matrix</sc>. We set parameters such as the rate of <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>division</sc> and the initial size of <sc>cells</sc> to map to quantities
                    within the in vitro system. Simulation began with 2-4 <sc>cells</sc> (to mimic
                    the observed number of initial cells in vitro) on a 2D 100×100 hexagonal
                    grid. C<sc>ells</sc> expanded in size and divided using the CompuCell3D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Cickovski1">[28]</xref> cellular
                    Potts model architecture and customized code. Each <sc>cell</sc> occupied
                    multiple locations on a hexagonal grid, thus allowing <sc>cells</sc> to expand,
                        <sc>divide</sc>, change shape, and move in a realistic manner (Rejniak et
                    al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Rejniak2">[16]</xref> used
                    an alternative method for enabling cell shape change). We coupled that with
                    features of the agent-oriented modeling approach used successfully by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Tang1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Engelberg1">[29]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Lam2">[31]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Except as noted, simulations ran using the parameter values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002030-t002">Table 2</xref>. A simulated
                        <sc>day</sc> mapped to an in vitro day and consisted of 48 simulation
                    cycles, equivalent to 30 minutes per cycle. Drawing on several years of prior
                    experience experimenting on MDCK cultures, we specified that when SM1 (defined
                    in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>) &gt;0.5 for nine of ten days,
                    the results can be considered to be within the range of experimental and
                    biological variability. Specifically, when SM1 was achieved, simulation results
                    were taken to be experimentally indistinguishable from values obtained from an
                    independently repeated in vitro experiment. Empirical parameter tuning was used
                    to obtain frequencies of SLSL <sc>cysts</sc> comparable to that observed in
                    vitro. When SM targets were not achieved, that specific mechanism was falsified.
                    SMs also allowed for ISMA validation and falsification when new attributes were
                    added to the target list (discussed below).</p>

        <title>Iterative Refinement Protocol</title>
        <p>The Iterative Refinement Protocol (IR Protocol), described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Tang1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Kim3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Hunt1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Engelberg1">[29]</xref>,
                    provided the foundation of our methods. Based on the results of prior
                    experiments and literature review, we selected an initial group of qualitative
                    attributes to target and simulate (the first few in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002030-t001">Table 1</xref>). We implemented a simple ISMA that
                    reproduced them, thus achieving an initial degree of validation. We then added
                    new data, expanding the set of targeted attributes. So doing falsified the
                    simple analogue. That judgment was based on observation (for qualitative
                    attributes) and values of the prespecified SMs (for quantitative attributes).
                    The manner in which the first analogue was falsified informed us how to develop
                    an improved version that would survive falsification. During subsequent cycles,
                    we added new data or features from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002030-t001">Table 1</xref> to the targeted set. So doing often
                    resulted in falsification of the then-current ISMA. On some occasions, it was
                    clear that an incrementally more fine-grained set of mechanisms and/or
                    components would be needed to achieve the specified SMs. On other occasions, we
                    undertook an empirical search of parameter space in search of new sets of
                    parameter values that would reestablish validation. When that search failed, new
                    mechanisms, sometimes more fine-grained, were developed. That iterative process
                    ended with the attributes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002030-t001">Table 1</xref> and the corresponding in silico specifications.</p>
        <p>The IR Protocol has a number of benefits. Chief among them is that once an ISMA
                    is validated against targeted data, additional data can be added and the
                    analogue reengineered without invalidating existing mechanisms. The new data
                    will falsify the current ISMA by design, but a successful revision will survive
                    falsification by both new and existing data. Because in silico components and
                    mechanisms map to their in vitro equivalents, it is often the case that only a
                    subset of ISMA components and/or operating principles must be modified to mimic
                    both new and original phenomena. Examples include adding a new <sc>cell</sc>
                    state and replacing one axiom with two more specific axioms. Because of the
                    networked nature of all mechanistic details, each ISMA change requires some
                    retuning of the parameterizations of several already existing (unmodified) ISMA
                    features.</p>
        <p>The IR Protocol consists of the following steps: first, specify a list of
                    targeted attributes, which forms the basis for experimental hypotheses. Devise a
                    specification that maps in silico components and operating principles to cell
                    culture counterparts. The operating principles are expected to enable
                        <sc>cells</sc> to exhibit behavior that is closely analogous to that
                    observed in vitro. Implement the analogue in code and execute it to deduce
                    predictions about the in silico and in vitro system. As stated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Engelberg1">[29]</xref>,
                    analogue execution is a form of deduction, where the behavior of the analogue
                    follows logically from the premises embodied by its initial conditions and input
                    data. In some cases, this deduction will yield obviously invalid results, which
                    falsifies the current list of operating principles and prompts the modification
                    of mechanistic hypotheses. Once the analogue cannot be falsified by data
                    specific to the current list of targeted attributes, add one or more new,
                    targeted attributes and repeat the IR Protocol.</p>
        <p>The process facilitates mechanism exploration, leading toward deeper insight into
                    biological counterparts. Undertaking a series of tightly coupled in silico and
                    in vitro experiments further increases the confidence that the results of ISMA
                    intervention experiments can stand as useful predictions of MDCK counterparts.
                    When there is sufficient ISMA and MDCK cystogenesis similarity, we hypothesize
                    there is corresponding mechanistic similarity. Consequently, results of ISMA
                    intervention experiments will stand as predictions of in vitro phenomena
                    following corresponding in vitro interventions. Some of those predictions will
                    merit in vitro follow-up.</p>

        <title>Agent-oriented approach</title>
        <p>An advantage of using targeted attributes and specifications is the flexibility
                    of their implementation. We chose to implement the ISMAs using an agent-oriented
                    approach as explained below and described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Hunt1">[25]</xref>, but their key aspects
                    include object-orientation, component mapping, spatial orientation, relational
                    grounding and striving for component autonomy. Agent-oriented models are
                    frequently implemented using object-oriented programming techniques, which allow
                    the designer to create individual computational objects corresponding to agents
                    and components within the specification. Components and mechanisms are mapped to
                    analogous components and mechanisms within the referent. So doing makes
                    translating in vitro and in silico observations back and forth more intuitive
                    and less complex. Individual agents can serve as analogues for in vitro
                    components. Agents are quasi-autonomous and they possess their own internal
                    control flow and execute actions independent of enclosing agents. Grounding is
                    defined as the units, dimensions, and/or objects to which a variable or model
                    constituent refers. When grounding is relational, variables, parameters, and I/O
                    are in units defined by other model components. When grounding is absolute,
                    variables, parameters, and I/O are in real-world units like seconds and
                    µg/ml. One advantage of using an agent-oriented approach with relational

                    (CPM). A CPM “cell” is not limited to a one-to-one correspondence
                    between objects and grid locations. The CPM extends cellular automata so that
                    each grid location contains an index specifying which simulation object contains
                    that location. A CPM with 100 grid locations can contain anywhere from 1 to 100
                        <sc>cells</sc>. This modification allows simulations to address
                        <sc>cell</sc> size, shape change, and <sc>cell</sc>-<sc>cell</sc> adhesion.
                    During a simulation cycle, the Potts agent calls a pseudorandom index change
                    algorithm that randomly selects a user-specified number of locations and
                    evaluates whether each will remain indexed to its current <sc>cell</sc> or
                    change to be indexed to another <sc>cell</sc>. If the location remains indexed
                    to the current <sc>cell</sc>, the grid remains unchanged. When a location's
                    index changes, that location and the “energy” of the system are
                    updated.</p>
        <p>To calculate whether a location changes index from one <sc>cell</sc> to another,
                    ΔG is calculated; it is the change in “energy” if that location

                    When <italic>r</italic>&lt;<italic>p</italic>, the change is accepted and the

        <title>Cells compute their target size using a value of ideal area</title>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>, we observed that prior
                    to cells stabilizing in vitro, their size correlated with the size of the cyst
                    and its cell number. We hypothesized that operation of yet-to-be identified
                    micromechanisms provides each cell with a target size. We speculated that a cell
                    might use information such as the tension between it and neighboring cells,
                    lumen pressure, and the ratio of lumen and matrix contact area in order to
                    update its target size. To mimic the decrease in mean cell area observed in
                    vitro, we developed and used an algorithm that is a placeholder for
                    yet-to-be-designed, concrete micromechanisms that can be implemented in a future
                    ISMA. Each individual <sc>cell</sc> adjusted its size and shape so that a target
                    area W, the projected wedge area (a wedge that includes the portion of the
                    perimeter in contact with <sc>matrix</sc> and terminates at the <sc>cyst</sc>
                    center), would move toward or equal an ideal value. The parameter
                        <italic>wedgeArea</italic> was a value based on the early
                    (pre-stabilization) 169 µm<sup>2</sup> area observed in vitro. An ISMA
                    calculated W using the following formula:</p>
        <p>
                    <disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002030.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>
                </p>
        <p>A is the area of the <sc>cell</sc>, M is one-half the number in <sc>cell</sc>
                    grid edges in contact with <sc>matrix</sc>, and L is one-half the number in cell
                    grid edges in contact with <sc>lumen</sc>. This formula assumes that
                        <sc>cysts</sc> are somewhat circular. Variations in actual <sc>cell</sc>
                    size caused by non-circular <sc>cysts</sc> resulted in variance in <sc>cell</sc>
                    area similar to that observed in vitro. The <sc>cell</sc> subtracted W from
                        <italic>wedgeArea</italic> and set its target change in area to the
                    resulting value (with a final maximum value of <italic>wedgeArea</italic>). Use
                    of this algorithm during early simulation cycles caused mean <sc>cell</sc> area
                    to decrease and <sc>cyst</sc> area to increase, mimicking observed in vitro data
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002030-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Once <sc>cells</sc> stabilized, they no longer used the above equation. Instead,
                        <sc>cells</sc> strove to maintain an area that increased only slightly as
                    contact with the <sc>lumen</sc> increased. We speculated that cells within cysts

        <p>A correlation was observed between mean cell size and the rate of cell division
                    in vitro, but a causal link was not apparent. Individual cells may sense the
                    area of matrix contact in part through β1-integrin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Yu2">[26]</xref>. They may sense
                    the area of lateral cell-cell contact in part using catenins and cadherins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Nathke1">[35]</xref>. That
                    information may influence whether a cell divides or not. As stated in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>, tension transduced by the
                    subapical F-actin network could allow cells to sense the size of the lumen. Such
                    information supported our decision to use <sc>lumen</sc> size as a signal for
                        <sc>cell</sc> stabilization. Each simulation cycle, a <sc>cell</sc>
                    bordering <sc>matrix</sc> and <sc>lumen</sc> queried the <sc>lumen</sc> for its
                    size. When that value ÷ 1000 was greater than the parameter
                        <italic>stableRatio</italic>, the <sc>cell</sc> changed to the stabilized

        <title>Cell clustering and cell death</title>
        <p>In vitro data analysis revealed that when the cultures began growing, the mean in
                    vitro cell number was about 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002030.s017">Table S4</xref>), indicating that a small amount of
                    clustering took place after the cells were plated. That was expected because in
                    Matrigel culture suspended cells settle on the layer of 100% Matrigel and
                    thus most cysts grow in the same plane. Accordingly, simulations began with a
                    single <sc>cell</sc>, but at simulation cycle 1, the
                        <italic>cycleCounter</italic> of that <sc>cell</sc> was reduced to 1,
                    causing it to <sc>divide</sc> during the following simulation cycle. In
                    addition, since in vitro cells are not always at the beginning of their cell
                    cycle when plated, the value of <italic>cycleCounter</italic> for the two

        <p>Cell death is an important factor in MDCK cystogenesis. However, it is not clear
                    that it is required for cyst formation. In order to validate that <sc>cysts</sc>

                    <sc>death</sc> for normal <sc>lumen</sc> formation, the amount of <sc>cell</sc>
                    <sc>death</sc> observed in silico was quantified and compared to that observed
                    in vitro. In vitro analysis of cell death was conducted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-MartnBelmonte2">[9]</xref>: MDCK cysts were

                    lumen expansion. TJ<sc>s</sc> exist where two <sc>cells</sc> contact each other
                    and a <sc>lumen</sc>. A TJ is two points—one in each neighboring
                        <sc>cell</sc>—adjacent to a point within a <sc>lumen</sc> (see and

                        <sc>lumen</sc> and then uses the acceptance function to accept or reject
                    that change. If the change is accepted, the TJ becomes <sc>lumen</sc>, and the
                    neighboring point becomes a new TJ.</p>

        <title>Scaling observations from 2D to 3D</title>
        <p>We recorded aspects of in vitro cyst growth by obtaining cross-sectional images
                    taken through the center of cysts. These images were necessarily a 2D
                    representation of a 3D structure. Based on the symmetry observed within the
                    cross section, in addition to separate analysis of 3D structures, we believe
                    that cysts were roughly symmetrical in 3D. Using this information, we
                    extrapolated 3D values for total cell number, cyst volume, and lumen volume from
                    the measured values of cross-sectional cell number, cyst area, and lumen area.
                    We found that the trends observed for cell number and mean cell area held when
                    the system was projected into 3D. If future targeted attributes required
                    specific modeling in 3D, we could take advantage of the 3D capabilities of
                    CompuCell3D, addressing considerations raised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002030-Galle1">[39]</xref>.</p>

          <p>Mean cell number per day for cysts grown in Matrigel. Numbers in bold italic
                        are measured, mean values and non-bold numbers are projected values.
                        Projected values were found by multiplying or dividing the measured mean
                        values by the scaling factor of 1.56. During the first four days of growth,
                        the number of cells increased by a constant factor of 1.4 to 1.8 per day,
                        with a value of 1.56 minimizing the percent error between projected and
                        measured mean values. Using that scaling factor, the number of cells at day
                        0 was estimated to be 2.1, indicating that some clustering took place within
                        the Matrigel culture. To reflect this observation, ISMAs implemented
