        <p>Three different Wnt signaling pathways function to restrict the anterior neuroectoderm state to the anterior end of the sea urchin embryo, a mechanism of anterior fate restriction that could be conserved among deuterostomes.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Patterning the neuroectoderm along the anterior–posterior (AP) axis is a critical event in the early development of deuterostome embryos. However, the mechanisms that regulate the specification and patterning of the neuroectoderm are incompletely understood. Remarkably, the anterior neuroectoderm (ANE) of the deuterostome sea urchin embryo expresses many of the same transcription factors and secreted modulators of Wnt signaling, as does the early vertebrate ANE (forebrain/eye field). Moreover, as is the case in vertebrate embryos, confining the ANE to the anterior end of the embryo requires a Wnt/β-catenin-dependent signaling mechanism. Here we use morpholino- or dominant negative-mediated interference to demonstrate that the early sea urchin embryo integrates information not only from Wnt/β-catenin but also from Wnt/Fzl5/8-JNK and Fzl1/2/7-PKC pathways to provide precise spatiotemporal control of neuroectoderm patterning along its AP axis. Together, through the Wnt1 and Wnt8 ligands, they orchestrate a progressive posterior-to-anterior wave of re-specification that restricts the initial, ubiquitous, maternally specified, ANE regulatory state to the most anterior blastomeres. There, the Wnt receptor antagonist, Dkk1, protects this state through a negative feedback mechanism. Because these different Wnt pathways converge on the same cell fate specification process, our data suggest they may function as integrated components of an interactive Wnt signaling network. Our findings provide strong support for the idea that the sea urchin ANE regulatory state and the mechanisms that position and define its borders represent an ancient regulatory patterning system that was present in the common echinoderm/vertebrate ancestor.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The initial regulatory state of most cells in many deuterostome embryos, including those of vertebrates and sea urchins, supports anterior neural fate specification. It is important to restrict this neurogenic potential to the anterior end of the embryo during early embryogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms by which this re-specification of posterior fate occurs are incompletely understood in any embryo. The sea urchin embryo is ideally suited to study this process because, in contrast to vertebrates, anterior–posterior neuroectoderm patterning occurs independently of dorsal-ventral axis patterning and takes place before the complex cell movements of gastrulation. In this study, we show that a linked, three-step process involving at least three different Wnt signaling pathways provides precise spatiotemporal restriction of the anterior neuroectoderm regulatory state to the anterior end of the sea urchin embryo. Because these three pathways impinge on the same developmental process, they could be functioning as an integrated Wnt signaling network. Moreover, striking parallels among gene expression patterns and functional studies suggest that this mechanism of anterior fate restriction could be highly conserved among deuterostomes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Wnt signaling pathways play fundamental roles in many developmental processes. One of the earliest and most crucial of these roles is the activation of gene regulatory programs that specify different cell fates along the embryo's primary anterior–posterior (AP) axis. Recent comparative analyses suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an ancient AP patterning mechanism that establishes posterior identity in most metazoan embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Adamska1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Petersen1">[9]</xref>. In invertebrate deuterostome embryos, which include cephalochordates, urochordates, hemichordates, and echinoderms, localized determinants cause stabilization of β-catenin in posterior blastomeres. This stabilized β-catenin enters nuclei in which it activates genes that specify endomesoderm, marking the site of gastrulation at what corresponded to the vegetal pole of the egg and forming the posterior end of the developing embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Darras1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Logan1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Imai1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Holland1">[11]</xref>. In the sea urchin embryo, in which the molecular mechanisms of endomesoderm specification are best understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Peter1">[12]</xref>, the first evidence of Wnt signaling after fertilization is the presence of β-catenin in the nuclei (nβ-catenin) of posterior cells, beginning at the 16- to 32-cell stage. During the next few cleavages, a detectable gradient of nβ-catenin forms in the posterior half of the embryo, with the highest concentration at the posterior pole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Logan1">[4]</xref>. This gradient of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is both necessary and sufficient to activate the gene regulatory networks that establish mesoderm and endoderm cell fates in a posterior-to-anterior wave during late cleavage stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Davidson1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wikramanayake2">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling also transforms the initial regulatory state that specifies anterior neuroectoderm (ANE) development in those deuterostome embryos in which it has been examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Gaspard1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Yaguchi1">[22]</xref>. In the sea urchin embryo, we refer to this neuroectoderm as ANE because it becomes restricted to a region derived from the animal pole of the egg, which is located opposite to the posterior end of the embryo (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Angerer1">[23]</xref>). The initial regulatory state of early sea urchin embryos activates ANE specification by the 32-cell stage, when genes encoding the earliest ANE regulatory proteins are expressed broadly throughout the anterior half of the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Yaguchi1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wei1">[24]</xref>. These early factors include Six3, which is expressed at the anterior end of bilaterian embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Steinmetz1">[25]</xref> and has been shown by functional studies to be critical for the specification of anterior-most neuroectoderm in diverse embryos including <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Posnien1">[26]</xref>, sea urchins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wei1">[24]</xref>, zebrafish, and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Lagutin1">[27]</xref>. Beginning around the 60-cell stage, a progressive posterior-to-anterior down-regulation of ANE factor gene expression in most of the anterior half of the embryo occurs by an unknown mechanism that requires posterior Wnt/β-catenin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Yaguchi1">[22]</xref>. This process continues during blastula stages until the ANE regulatory state is confined to a disk of cells around the anterior pole of the mesenchyme blastula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wei1">[24]</xref>. Interestingly, an unknown signal from posterior Wnt/β-catenin signaling also appears to be necessary to pattern the anterior ectoderm along the AP axis in <italic>Saccoglossus kowalevskii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Darras1">[2]</xref>, which belongs to the hemichordates, a sister clade to echinoderms.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, Six3 activates a large cohort of genes in the sea urchin ANE that are orthologs of genes expressed in the vertebrate ANE (forebrain/eye field) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), raising the possibility that the common ancestor of sea urchins and vertebrates may have shared this ANE regulatory program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wei1">[24]</xref>. Similar to the sea urchin embryo, an initial widespread regulatory state in late blastula/early gastrula stages of vertebrate embryos supports expression of genes encoding early anterior forebrain/eye field factors throughout the presumptive neuroectoderm, including <italic>six3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Foley1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Seo1">[29]</xref>. Simultaneously, secreted antagonists from the organizer block bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling on the dorsal side and a high-to-low, posterior-to-anterior gradient of nβ-catenin forms in the presumptive neuroectoderm. This Wnt/β-catenin signaling gradient is part of a mechanism that activates genes encoding posterior neuroectoderm factors while down-regulating anterior (forebrain/eye field) factors in the posterior neuroectoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Kiecker1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Nordstrom1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Varga1">[21]</xref>. By these mechanisms, the neural plate is formed and expression of the presumptive forebrain/eye field factors is restricted to cells at its anterior end, where Wnt antagonists protect them from posteriorization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wilson1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Leyns1">[33]</xref>. Multiple Wnts, Fzl receptors, and Wnt antagonists (i.e., Wnt8, Wnt3a, Wnt1, Fzl8, and Dkk1) have been implicated in posteriorization of the neuroectoderm in vertebrate embryos, as well as members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), retinoic acid (RA), and transforming growth factor–beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Foley1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wilson1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Kudoh1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Thisse1">[35]</xref>. However, the exact functions of these pathways in AP neuroectoderm patterning have been difficult to determine because of their earlier functions as well as the complex cell movements of gastrulation during this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Foley1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wilson1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Beddington1">[36]</xref>. Moreover, the interactions among these various pathways in AP neuroectoderm patterning are not well understood.</p>

      <p>Recent studies suggest that early AP neuroectoderm patterning in vertebrate embryos is independent of information from the dorsal organizer. In both <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish, the initial widespread regulatory state promotes neuroectoderm specification throughout most of the embryo in the absence of β-catenin, which blocks dorsal organizer formation, as well as BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7. Expression of neuroectoderm markers is radialized around the AP axis in these embryos, but remarkably they retain normal AP neuroectoderm patterning, and the ANE expands posteriorly when both maternal and zygotic Wnt/β-catenin function is blocked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Reversade1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Varga1">[21]</xref>. Interestingly, in the sea urchin embryo, the action of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in early patterning of the neuroectoderm along the AP axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Yaguchi1">[22]</xref> is also separate and distinct from the dorsal-ventral patterning mechanism because it occurs before Nodal and BMP signaling are activated and is required for their expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Duboc1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Yaguchi2">[40]</xref>. The inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and consequently the loss of expression of Nodal and BMP, causes a large majority of cells to differentiate into ANE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Yaguchi1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wei1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Yaguchi3">[41]</xref>. Thus, the developmental regulatory mechanisms used by vertebrate embryos for ANE development have striking similarities to those used by sea urchin embryos and may therefore represent an ancestral deuterostome mechanism.</p>
      <p>Here we show that the Wnt-dependent restriction of neuroectoderm to the anterior pole involves not only Wnt/β-catenin but also a series of linked steps mediated by Wnt/JNK signaling through Wnt1, Wnt8, and Fzl5/8, the homolog of vertebrate Fzl8. Coordinated progression of signaling through these Wnt pathways and activation of the secreted Wnt antagonist Dkk1 in anterior-most blastomeres establish the definitive ANE around the anterior pole. Signaling through a second Wnt receptor, Fzl1/2/7, and its activation of PKC suppress Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/JNK ANE restriction activities to coordinate the correct temporal progression of ANE restriction. Collectively, signaling through three different Wnt signaling pathways provides precise spatiotemporal control of neuroectoderm AP patterning along the AP axis.</p>

        <p>Previous studies have shown that restriction of <italic>foxq2</italic> expression to the anterior pole depends on posterior Wnt/β-catenin signaling. However, Wnt/β-catenin signaling has never been detected in the anterior half of the embryo (the presumptive ectoderm, blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g001">Figure 1Ja</xref>), suggesting that an intermediate signal(s) downstream of posterior Wnt/β-catenin signaling must mediate this second phase of ANE restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g001">Figure 1Jb versus Jc</xref>; the gray region in this and subsequent figures represents the posterior ectoderm and the orange arrows indicate the second phase of restriction).

        <p>To determine whether Fzl5/8 signaling has a role in neuroectoderm AP patterning, we injected embryos either with morpholinos targeting Fzl5/8 or with mRNA encoding a C-terminal truncated form of the receptor (ΔFzl5/8) that acts as a dominant negative by competing for Wnt ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Croce1">[45]</xref>. In contrast to embryos injected with Axin or Tcf-Eng mRNA, those expressing ΔFzl5/8 mRNA had normal <italic>foxq2</italic> transcript levels and distributions at the 32-cell stage (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2Aa,Af</xref>), suggesting that Fzl5/8 signaling is not required for the initial Wnt/β-catenin-dependent down-regulation of <italic>foxq2</italic> mRNA in the posterior half of the embryo. Further evidence that Fzl5/8 is not required for early Wnt/β-catenin activity is provided below. However, at mesenchyme blastula stage (24 hpf), ΔFzl5/8-injected embryos expressed <italic>foxq2</italic> ectopically throughout the anterior half of the embryo, indicating that the second phase of its restriction to the anterior pole requires Fzl5/8 function (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2Ab,Ag</xref>). Expression of <italic>foxq2</italic> also was not correctly restricted in two different Fzl5/8 morphants, although the phenotype was less pronounced (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2Ab,Ag</xref> versus <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s003">Figure S3D</xref>,E). We used ΔFzl5/8 for further studies because it gave the more penetrant phenotype, likely because it blocked signaling through both maternal and zygotic Fzl5/8. Importantly, eliminating expression of <italic>six3</italic>, the critical upstream ANE regulator, from the posterior ectoderm also required functional Fzl5/8 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2Ad,Ai</xref>). Furthermore, the transcript levels per embryo for genes in the 24 hpf Six3-dependent ANE regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) were significantly elevated in ΔFzl5/8-containing mesenchyme blastula embryos. Interestingly, one of these was zygotic <italic>fzl5/8</italic> mRNA itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2Ac,Ah</xref>), indicating that Fzl5/8 function is required to down-regulate <italic>fzl5/8</italic> mRNA levels in the posterior ectoderm. Finally, 3-d pluteus larvae injected with ΔFzl5/8 had an expanded thick neuroepithelium with a greatly increased number of serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2Aj</xref>). In contrast, the thickened neuroepithelium in normal pluteus-stage embryos was restricted to a small region that produced only 4–6 serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2Ae</xref>). These observations indicate that a Fzl5/8 signaling-dependent process eliminates the ANE regulatory state required for serotonergic neural development from the posterior ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to the ubiquitous maternal and anterior zygotic expression of <italic>fzl5/8</italic> at mesenchyme blastula stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s002">Figure S2e</xref>–h), it was also expressed in a ring of nonskeletogenic mesenchyme cells (24 hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figures 2Ac</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s002">S2B</xref>h). Previously, Croce et al. (2006) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Barr1">[46]</xref> showed that Fzl5/8 signaling in these posterior cells works through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway to initiate primary invagination movements later during gastrulation. This observation raised the possibility that the earlier ANE restriction process mediated by Fzl5/8 in posterior ectoderm may also depend on the JNK pathway. <italic>jnk</italic> mRNA was present ubiquitously during ANE restriction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s002">Figure S2C</xref>), and indeed, <italic>foxq2</italic> failed to restrict to the anterior pole in embryos injected with a splice-blocking JNK morpholino (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). This JNK morphant phenotype was weaker than the ΔFzl5/8 phenotype (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), probably because some normal JNK transcripts persisted in the embryo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s003">Figure S3J</xref>). It is also possible that maternally synthesized JNK protein persisted in these embryos. As an additional test, we treated embryos with the specific JNK inhibitor, (L)-JNKI1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Barr1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Borsello1">[47]</xref>, beginning at fertilization, which produced embryos expressing <italic>foxq2</italic> throughout the anterior half of the embryo, mimicking exactly the ΔFzl5/8 phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2, cf. Ag,Al</xref>). Moreover, <italic>fzl5/8</italic> and <italic>six3</italic> expression was not restricted to the anterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2Am,An</xref>), and these embryos also had an expanded, thickened neuroepithelium and an increased number of serotonergic neurons, as seen in ΔFzl5/8-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2Aj</xref>). These results indicate that the second phase of ANE restriction that down-regulates the ANE regulatory state in the anterior half (i.e., the posterior ectoderm) depends on Fzl5/8 function. Moreover, they suggest that JNK activity transduces a Wnt signal X through this Wnt receptor, the production of which depends on Wnt/β-catenin activity in the posterior half of the embryo (signal X, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Wnt1 and Wnt8 Signals Restrict the ANE to the Anterior Pole</title>
        <p>To identify the link between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Fzl5/8, we first searched for genes encoding Wnt ligands that are expressed by the 60-cell stage (i.e., the beginning of the second phase of ANE restriction) in posterior blastomeres and that also depend on Wnt/β-catenin activity. We confirmed the previously reported expression profile of <italic>wnt8</italic>, which is activated by Wnt/β-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Minokawa1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wikramanayake3">[49]</xref>: At the 60-cell stage, <italic>wnt8</italic> was expressed in both the micromeres and the adjacent blastomere tier (veg<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g003">Figure 3Aa</xref>). Similarly, <italic>wnt1</italic> expression was first detected midway through the 60-cell stage (9 hpf) in the micromeres, and it also depended on nβ-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g003">Figures 3Aa</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s003">S4A,C</xref>). As development progressed, <italic>wnt8</italic> expression first moved into the next most anterior tier of blastomeres (veg<sub>1</sub>) and then, during late blastula stages (18 and 24 hpf), into both veg<sub>1</sub> and overlying posterior ectoderm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g003">Figure 3Ac,Ad</xref>). <italic>wnt1</italic> expression continued in the micromeres until midblastula stages (15 hpf) after which it, too, progressively moved to more anterior blastomeres until it reached the endoderm/ectoderm boundary during later blastula stages (24 hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g003">Figures 3Ac,Ad</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s004">S4A</xref>). Thus, genes encoding the secreted ligands Wnt1 and Wnt8 were expressed in posterior cells when the second phase of ANE restriction begins in the posterior regions of the anterior hemisphere. As restriction proceeded, <italic>wnt8</italic> continued to be expressed near cells expressing ANE marker genes, whereas <italic>wnt1</italic> expression was more posterior. In order to evaluate whether these secreted ligands were required for ANE restriction in posterior ectoderm, we performed knockdown experiments by injecting either of two different morpholinos designed against each. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, embryos injected with either Wnt1 or Wnt8 morpholinos failed to down-regulate <italic>foxq2</italic> expression in posterior ectoderm. ANE restriction was more strongly perturbed in Wnt1 morphants, even though the cells producing it were more distant from the site of action than those producing Wnt8. This raised the possibility that Wnt1 is necessary for later Wnt8 expression. However, this was not the case because, at blastula stage (16 hpf), Wnt8 expression was normal in Wnt1 morphants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). The converse was also true: <italic>wnt1</italic> expression did not depend on Wnt8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s004">Figure S4E</xref>). We conclude that production of each of these ligands depends on Wnt/β-catenin signaling, but they do not depend on each other but act in parallel in ANE restriction.</p>

        <p>These results suggest that Wnt1 and Wnt8 spatiotemporally link posterior Wnt/β-catenin signaling to Fzl5/8-mediated down-regulation of ANE factors in the posterior ectoderm. To test this hypothesis, we first showed that overexpressed Wnt1 or Wnt8 completely eliminated <italic>foxq2</italic> expression in the ANE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g003">Figure 3Cb,Cd</xref>). We then tested whether this <italic>foxq2</italic> down-regulation required active Fzl5/8. Strikingly, ΔFzl5/8 strongly blocked the suppression of <italic>foxq2</italic> expression mediated by either Wnt1 or Wnt8 (100% rescue of Wnt1 or Wnt8 misexpression phenotype; <italic>n</italic> = 63 and 67, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g003">Figures 3Cc,Ce</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s005">S5Bb,Bd</xref>). These results strongly support the conclusion from the Wnt1 and Wnt8 loss-of-function analyses that Fzl5/8-mediated ANE restriction in the posterior ectoderm requires these ligands. Furthermore, suppression of <italic>foxq2</italic> expression by both Wnt 1 and Wnt8 also required JNK activity, since the JNK inhibitor rescued the loss-of-ANE phenotypes produced by misexpression of Wnt8 (81% of embryos rescued; <italic>n</italic> = 126)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g003">Figure 3Ca versus Cf</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, Wnt1 (55% of embryos had low to normal <italic>foxq2</italic> expression; <italic>n</italic> = 83) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s005">Figure S5A</xref>).

Although the architecture of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway downstream of Fzl receptors is not yet well established, one important player in other systems is conventional Protein Kinase C (PKC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-vanAmerongen1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Gao1">[51]</xref>.

Similar to Fzl1/2/7 morphants, <italic>foxq2</italic> expression was never initiated in embryos treated with the inhibitor continuously from fertilization to mesenchyme blastula stage (24 hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g004">Figure 4Ao–r</xref>). Moreover, <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>fzl5/8</italic> were not expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g004">Figure 4As,At</xref>), and in a large majority of embryos (36/39) serotonergic neurons did not develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g004">Figure 4Au</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s003">Figure S3I</xref>a versus Ic), showing that neural differentiation was severely compromised in treated embryos. While these experiments demonstrate that activation of PKC is required for the ANE regulatory state and that Fzl1/2/7 is required for that activation, they do not conclusively prove that Fzl1/2/7 signals through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway because PKC activation can occur by other mechanisms. We conclude that Fzl1/2/7 signaling and PKC activity are each essential for early neuroectoderm specification.</p>

        <title>Fzl1/2/7 Signaling and PKC Activity Antagonize the ANE Restriction Mechanism</title>
        <p>Our findings that a Wnt signaling branch utilizing Fzl1/2/7 and PKC activity is necessary for <italic>initiating expression</italic> of upstream ANE regulatory factors was entirely unexpected because at early stages, Wnt signaling is thought to antagonize this process. We hypothesized that Wnt signaling through this receptor is necessary either for the expression of regulatory genes that specify the ANE or for antagonizing the ANE restriction mechanism from the very earliest stages. To distinguish between these alternatives, we first asked whether Fzl1/2/7 signaling is part of the maternal mechanism that can drive ubiquitous expression of ANE regulatory genes in the absence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Within each of three batches of embryos, we injected one set of fertilized eggs with Axin mRNA, a second set with Fzl1/2/7 morpholino, and a third with both Fzl1/2/7 morpholino and Axin mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). As shown above, <italic>foxq2</italic> was expressed throughout the embryo in the absence of nβ-catenin, whereas it was completely undetectable in more than 90% (52/57) of embryos lacking Fzl1/2/7. However, it was expressed at high levels throughout all Fzl1/2/7-deficient embryos (47/47) when Wnt/β-catenin signaling was also blocked. These results indicate that maternal factors are still capable of activating <italic>foxq2</italic> in embryos lacking Fzl1/2/7 and that the loss of <italic>foxq2</italic>/ANE fate in Fzl1/2/7 morphants requires a functional Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus, Fzl1/2/7 signaling is not a positive regulator of the initial maternal regulatory state that supports ANE specification, but rather it inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin-dependent ANE restriction mechanism.</p>

        <p>To test if Fzl1/2/7 also antagonizes the Fzl5/8-JNK-dependent second phase of ANE restriction, we asked whether blocking Fzl5/8 or JNK function could rescue ANE specification in embryos lacking Fzl1/2/7 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Similar to the above experiments, in three different batches of embryos, we found that blocking the function of either Fzl5/8 or the JNK pathway rescued the expanded expression of <italic>foxq2</italic> in 99% (<italic>n</italic> = 72) or 93% (<italic>n</italic> = 70), respectively, of embryos also lacking Fzl1/2/7. These results suggest that Fzl1/2/7 antagonizes Fzl5/8-JNK-mediated ANE restriction. In the final set of experiments, we tested whether PKC signaling also antagonizes Fzl5/8-JNK-mediated ANE restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Using the same approach, we injected one set of fertilized eggs with ΔFzl5/8, treated a second with the PKC inhibitor, and a third was treated with PKC inhibitor and injected with ΔFzl5/8. Blocking the function of Fzl5/8 in these embryos rescued the expression of <italic>foxq2</italic> in a large majority of embryos (77% rescue; <italic>n</italic> = 83), demonstrating that, like Fzl1/2/7, PKC antagonizes the ANE restriction mechanism by antagonizing Fzl5/8 signaling. Collectively, these results support the idea that the Fzl1/2/7-dependent suppression of Fzl5/8-mediated ANE restriction works through PKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g005">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>
        <p>The data suggest that Fzl1/2/7 signaling antagonizes Fzl5/8-JNK-mediated down regulation of genes necessary for ANE specification. Because Fzl1/2/7 functions as early as the 32-cell stage to maintain expression of ANE markers, it might also antagonize Fz5/8 indirectly by down-regulating Wnt/β-catenin activity. To test this possibility, we measured the level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in 120-cell embryos (12 hpf) during the early stages of ANE restriction using the TCF-luciferase reporter plasmid, TopFlash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Korinek1">[54]</xref>. Three different batches of embryos that had been injected with ΔFzl5/8 or treated with PKC inhibitor showed no significant difference in TopFlash activity when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that neither of these proteins affects early Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In contrast, TopFlash activity increased ∼2.5-fold on average in embryos lacking Fzl1/2/7 compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that signaling through Fzl1/2/7 negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin activity in cleavage-stage embryos. Recently published experiments showed that introduction of mRNA encoding a dominant negative form of Fzl1/2/7 caused a <italic>reduction</italic> in TopFlash activity in cleavage-stage embryos and a loss of endoderm specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Lhomond1">[55]</xref>. While this appears to conflict with our results, it is important to realize that interference with Fzl1/2/7 activity by misexpression of ΔFzl1/2/7 can interfere with the function of maternal Fzl1/2/7, whereas Fzl1/2/7 morpholino cannot. In keeping with this, embryos in which zygotic Fzl1/2/7 synthesis was blocked with a morpholino still expressed Wnt1 and Wnt8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), whereas these are not expressed in embryos injected with ΔFzl1/2/7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Lhomond1">[55]</xref>. Thus, in Fzl1/2/7 morphants, these Wnt ligands up-regulate Wnt/β-catenin- and Wnt/Fzl5/8-mediated ANE restriction, whereas the absence of these ligands in ΔFzl5/8-containing embryos leads to a reduction in Wnt/β-catenin activity. Collectively, these data suggest that Fzl1/2/7 signaling and PKC activity provide a buffer that limits the rate of ANE down-regulation by both of these Wnt signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g005">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>
        <p>A possible concern in the ΔFz5/8 and ΔFz1/2/7 experiments is that elevating the levels of these proteins might influence the balance of signaling between the Wnt signaling pathways, for example, by competing for common components. To test this possibility, we overexpressed either wild-type Fzl5/8 or Fzl1/2/7 mRNA. In both cases, embryos developed normally and had normal <italic>foxq2</italic> expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). Next we showed that elevating the levels of Fzl1/2/7 mRNA did not change ΔFzl5/8's ability to prevent ANE restriction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s006">Figure S6B</xref>) or prevent elimination of the ANE by excess Wnt1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). Taken together these data indicate that the levels of endogenous Fzl receptors are not limiting. These data contrast with the Wnt1 and Wnt8 misexpression results, which showed that excess ligand can dramatically up-regulate ANE restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g003">Figure 3Cb,d</xref>), suggesting that it is the levels of Wnt ligand in time and space and not those of the Wnt receptors that control the ANE restriction mechanism</p>

        <title>Dkk1 Antagonism of Wnt Signaling Protects the Final ANE Territory</title>
        <p>Around the mesenchyme blastula stage (24 hpf), restriction of the ANE is complete and it constitutes a separate regulatory domain at the anterior end of the embryo with well-defined borders. Expression of <italic>fzl5/8</italic> is also restricted to this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">Figure 2</xref>), raising the question of why Fzl5/8-mediated signaling does not continue to down-regulate the ANE regulatory state there. We hypothesized that the secreted Wnt antagonist, Dkk1, might play a role because, in most of the major clades, competition between anterior Wnt antagonism by Dkk1 and posterior Wnt signaling has been shown to regulate cell fates along the primary (AP) axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Niehrs1">[8]</xref>. Very low-level <italic>dkk1</italic> expression was detectable as early as the 120-cell stage by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), and increased during the time of ANE restriction, reaching maximal levels by the mesenchyme blastula stage (24 hpf).

Thus, <italic>dkk1</italic> was expressed at the right time and place to prevent anterior Wnt-mediated ANE down-regulation.

        <p>To test whether Dkk1 protects the ANE regulatory state from Wnt-mediated down-regulation, we monitored the expression of a set of genes encoding ANE regulatory factors in Dkk1 morphants at mesenchyme blastula stage by in situ hybridization. Each of the genes tested was severely down-regulated in these embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g006">Figures 6Cg–k</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001467.s003">S3H</xref>), and no serotonergic neurons developed in 4-d plutei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g006">Figure 6Cl</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of Dkk1 mRNA prevented restriction of <italic>foxq2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g006">Figure 6Db</xref>) and rescued <italic>foxq2</italic> expression in embryos also overexpressing <italic>wnt1</italic> mRNA (88% rescue; <italic>n</italic> = 65) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g006">Figure 6Dc versus d</xref>). Together these results indicate that Dkk1 can block the Wnt1/Fzl5/8-JNK-dependent ANE restriction mechanism. Interestingly, overexpression of Dkk1 also rescued <italic>foxq2</italic> expression in Fzl1/2/7 morphants (98% rescue; <italic>n</italic> = 64) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g006">Figure 6Ec,Ed</xref>), suggesting that it may interfere with either Wntβ-catenin or Fzl5/8 signaling or both. There is some support for both possibilities. First, Dkk1 likely inhibits Fzl5/8 activity because the morphological phenotype (unpublished data) and <italic>foxq2</italic> expression pattern (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g001">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">2Ag</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g006">6Db</xref>) of Dkk1 mRNA-injected embryos were more similar to those of embryos lacking functional Fzl5/8 than to those lacking Wnt/β-catenin signaling (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g006">Figure 6Db</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g001">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g002">2Ag</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The data presented here show that patterning the neuroectoderm along the AP axis of the early sea urchin embryo depends on an elegant spatiotemporal coordination and integration of the activities of three different Wnt signaling pathways. Throughout this process, a balance is achieved between the initial regulatory mechanisms that can specify the ANE ubiquitously, those that subsequently suppress it in posterior regions, and those that limit ANE suppression. The consequence is that ANE tissue is stably positioned only at the anterior pole of the embryo by the mesenchyme blastula stage. To summarize our current model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g007">Figure 7</xref>), the first phase of ANE restriction requires Wnt/β-catenin and occurs very rapidly in posterior blastomeres by the 32- to 60-cell stage. Wnt/β-catenin signaling simultaneously activates expression of Wnt1 and Wnt8; these cells and these ligands initiate the second phase of ANE down-regulation in the posterior ectoderm (non-ANE ectoderm in the anterior hemisphere) by activating the Fzl5/8-JNK pathway, beginning around the 60-cell stage. As development progresses, Wnt1 and Wnt8 mRNAs accumulate in more anterior blastomeres, behind the front of ANE down-regulation. Whether these secreted ligands diffuse to the overlying ectoderm to directly activate Fzl5/8 or whether they act indirectly to stimulate production of other Wnt ligands that signal through this receptor is not known. Regardless, it is clear that Wnt1, Wnt8, Fzl5/8, and JNK are all required for full ANE down-regulation in the posterior ectoderm and suppression of transcription of <italic>fzl5/8</italic> itself. Clearly, Fzl5/8 plays a pivotal role in the ANE restriction process because it is necessary not only for the second phase of ANE restriction but also to stop that process in the third phase of ANE patterning when Fzl5/8 signaling leads to the expression of the Wnt receptor antagonist Dkk1 at the anterior pole. Thus, the coordination between the timing of auto-repression of <italic>fzl5/8</italic> transcription and activation of Dkk1 by Fzl5/8 ensures that this negative feedback loop reproducibly defines the ANE at the anterior pole of the embryo by mesenchyme blastula stage (24 hpf). The relative timing of Dkk1 production in the anterior ectoderm and ANE restriction in the rest of the embryo is critical and carefully controlled by a third Wnt pathway working through Fzl1/2/7 and PKC activities that limit Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/JNK functions during the first two phases of ANE clearance.</p>

          <p>(A) The <italic>y</italic>-axis monitors the progress of spatial restriction of the ANE (blue), and the <italic>x</italic>-axis indicates the developmental timing of ANE restriction. Each image represents the position of the ANE in time and space. (Step 1) Initially, the maternal regulatory state in the absence of Wnt signaling supports ANE specification throughout the embryo. Then, nβ-catenin signaling in the posterior half of the embryo activates an unknown negative regulatory activity that blocks the accumulation of ANE factors, either by blocking their transcription directly or the activity of their ubiquitously expressed maternal activators. (Step 2) As development progresses, posterior nβ-catenin activates production of at least two Wnt ligands, Wnt1 and Wnt8, that are necessary to initiate the ANE restriction mechanism in posterior ectoderm beginning at the 60-cell stage. These secreted ligands signal through the Wnt receptor, Fzl5/8, activating the JNK pathway. The Wnt/JNK pathway progressively down-regulates expression of ANE factors during early blastula stages in all but the most anterior ectoderm. During Step 1 and possibly Step 2, Fzl1/2/7 signaling attenuates the nβ-catenin- and Fzl5/8-JNK-mediated down-regulation of ANE factors, preventing complete shutdown of ANE specification. PKC activity also antagonizes Fzl5/8-JNK-mediated ANE restriction, downstream of Fzl1/2/7 signaling. (Step 3) Expression of Wnt8, Wnt1, and/or another ligand X is activated in more anterior blastomeres. These ligands continue Fzl5/8-mediated ANE restriction until the late blastula-stage embryo activates production of the secreted Wnt antagonist, Dkk1, via Fzl5/8. Through negative feedback, Dkk1 limits Fzl5/8 activity, thereby defining the borders of the ANE. Orange arrows indicate the Wnt/β-catenin-mediated mechanism, gray arrows indicate the Wnt/JNK mediated mechanism, and red indicates Fzl1/2/7 and PKC interactions.

      <p>Because all of these Wnt pathways affect the same developmental process (i.e., the specification of ANE versus non-ANE fates along the primary axis), they may function as components of an interactive Wnt signaling network rather than as separate pathways with different roles. Yet it appears that posterior Wnt/β-catenin and anterior Wnt/JNK signaling define two adjacent early regulatory domains in the sea urchin embryo. While our data suggest that these two signaling pathways activate different downstream regulatory programs in order to down-regulate ANE factors, both pathways are linked spatially and temporally by the activities of at least two common signaling components, Wnt1 and Wnt8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wikramanayake3">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Sethi1">[56]</xref>. These results are in keeping with recent evidence that individual Wnt ligands are able to activate distinct Wnt signaling branches, often in the same or adjacent territories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Cha1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Tao1">[59]</xref>. However, it remains to be determined whether Wnt1 and/or Wnt8 act directly on cells in the anterior hemisphere in the ANE restriction process, although it is interesting that <italic>wnt8</italic> expression moves into posterior ectoderm cells as ANE factors move out. Alternatively, Wnt1 and Wnt8 may act indirectly by reinforcing the nβ-catenin gradient in the anterior-most cells of the posterior half of the embryo (i.e., near the equator), activating production of an unidentified intermediate Wnt ligand that is secreted from even more anterior cells and that activates Fzl5/8 signaling.</p>
      <p>We found that the cardinal ANE regulatory genes, <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>foxq2</italic>, are not expressed in Fzl1/2/7 knockdowns. This unexpected phenotype is the exact opposite of the ANE expansion produced by interference with Wnt/β-catenin, Fzl5/8, and JNK signaling. The function of Fzl1/2/7 begins as early as the 32-cell stage, around the time that nβ-catenin is first detectable in posterior blastomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Logan1">[4]</xref> and at least 2 h before the ANE restriction process mediated by Fzl5/8 and JNK is observed. Since Fzl1/2/7 signaling significantly suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signaling during early cleavage stages, we propose that it reduces Wnt/β-catenin-dependent Fzl5/8 and JNK activities. This model suggests that Fzl1/2/7 signaling is essential for controlling the rate of progression of the ANE restriction mechanism along the AP axis, providing a “timing buffer” that prevents premature elimination of the ANE regulatory state during the early cleavage and blastula stages. We propose that one function of this Fzl1/2/7 “timing buffer” is to allow sufficient Fzl5/8-dependent accumulation of Dkk1 in the ANE by later blastula stages to protect it from Wnt signals and define its borders.</p>
      <p>Since Fzl1/2/7 does not appear to signal through either the Wnt/JNK or the Wnt/β-catenin pathways during ANE restriction, we propose that it transduces signals through the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway. This mechanism may be similar to the situation in several other systems where Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling affects early development either through the intracellular messengers CamKI, Calcineurin, and the transcription factor, NF-AT, or through PKC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Kestler1">[60]</xref>. Similar to what we report here, the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway has been shown to antagonize Wnt/β-catenin signaling during vertebrate D/V axis specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Kuhl1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Westfall1">[62]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that blocking PKC activity with either an inhibitor or with Fzl1/2/7 morpholino had exactly the same effect on phosphorylated PKC levels and on the Fzl5/8-JNK-dependent re-specification of ANE to ectoderm fate. However, inhibiting the function of Fzl1/2/7 elevated Wnt/β-catenin activity, whereas loss of PKC activity did not. This result suggests that Fzl1/2/7 signaling activates two branches that affect ANE restriction, one that antagonizes early Wnt/β-catenin activity and another, mediated by pPKC, that blocks Fzl5/8-mediated ANE restriction in the anterior hemisphere. Thus, if Fzl1/2/7 mediates Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the sea urchin embryo, it could affect several different downstream parallel pathways, any or all of which are necessary to prevent premature and complete elimination of the ANE regulatory state. Moreover, the involvement of Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in AP neuroectoderm patterning would be a first.</p>
      <p>These considerations suggest that the function of Fzl1/2/7 in the early embryo is context-dependent, and we propose that the balance of information sent by this receptor through different Wnt signaling pathways is essential for correct specification and patterning. Recent data from several laboratories suggest that the same Fzl receptors can activate different Wnt signaling pathways, even in the same cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-vanAmerongen1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Kestler1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Sumanas1">[63]</xref>.

(2012) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Lhomond1">[55]</xref> are consistent with two early roles for Fzl1/2/7 – one stimulating endoderm specification via nβ-catenin through maternal Fzl1/2/7 in posterior blastomeres and another produced by zygotic Fzl1/2/7 that antagonizes early Wnt/β-catenin and subsequent Wnt/JNK signaling through an alternative Wnt pathway (Ca<sup>+2</sup>) that operates throughout the embryo. The balance between these pathways may favor Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the posterior half of the cleavage stage embryo because of localized Wnt/β-catenin pathway-specific co-factors in that part of the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Croce2">[66]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Weitzel1">[67]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Striking parallels are emerging in the regulatory mechanisms that sea urchin and vertebrate embryos use to establish neural regulatory states at the anterior pole. Both embryos require Six3 for anterior neural development and share many homologous factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wei1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Lagutin1">[27]</xref>. Moreover, as shown here, in the absence of Wnt/β-catenin, and consequently of Nodal, BMP, and all other known signaling pathways, the regulatory state of <italic>all</italic> of the cells in the sea urchin embryo supports development of ANE from the very beginning of its specification. These data indicate that an initial ubiquitous maternal regulatory state activates ANE specification and that one of the most important roles of posterior Wnt/β-catenin signaling is to break the symmetry of this neural-promoting state. Similarly, in vertebrate embryos, an initial regulatory state is capable of activating ANE markers throughout the embryo in the absence of Wnt, Nodal, and BMP signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Gaspard1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Reversade1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Yaguchi1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Eiraku1">[68]</xref>. Thus, this initial, broad activation of ANE specification, and its subsequent down-regulation, could be a widely shared property of deuterostome embryos.</p>
      <p>The Wnt-dependent mechanism used for AP neuroectoderm patterning is still incompletely understood in vertebrates, in part because complex cell movements during patterning and the involvement of Wnt signaling in earlier specification events obscure the spatial and temporal relationships among the individual players <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Foley1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Wilson1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Beddington1">[36]</xref>. In vertebrates, the only known Wnt pathway involved in the early restriction of ANE factors to the anterior pole is Wnt/β-catenin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Kiecker1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Nordstrom1">[18]</xref>. Here, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that the anterior Dkk1-posterior Wnt/β-catenin neuroectoderm patterning mechanism observed in vertebrates exists in a nonchordate deuterostome. These data strongly suggest the general Dkk1-Wnt/β-catenin AP patterning mechanism present in extant pre-bilaterian embryos was likely co-opted to pattern the neuroectoderm along the AP axis in the deuterostome ancestor. In addition to a posterior-to-anterior gradient of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, AP neuroectoderm patterning in the sea urchin embryo also requires Wnt/JNK signaling and an additional pathway mediated by Fzl1/2/7 that may function in Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. At present these are completely novel findings, but the fact that orthologs of several Wnt signaling components that function in these additional pathways in sea urchins (Fzl8, Wnt1, Wnt8, Dkk1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g008">Figure 8A,C</xref>) also are involved in posteriorizing the neural plate of vertebrate embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Lekven1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Mukhopadhyay1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Yamamoto1">[69]</xref> raises the possibility that this entire multistep mechanism was present in the common echinoderm/vertebrate ancestor and still operates to specify anterior neural identity in deuterostome embryos. Supporting this view, recent studies in hemichordates indicate that expression of homologues of sea urchin <italic>foxq2</italic>, <italic>sfrp1/5</italic>, and <italic>six3</italic> demarcate an anterior-most region of the embryo that is homologous to the vertebrate anterior neural ridge secondary patterning center <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Pani1">[19]</xref>. Interestingly, these factors are initially broadly expressed and restricted to this region by an unknown mechanism that depends on posterior Wnt/β-catenin signaling and appears to require Fzl5/8 function in the anterior part of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). Moreover, there are similarities in the expression patterns of ANE genes (<italic>dkk1</italic>, <italic>dkk3</italic>, <italic>six3</italic>, <italic>foxq2</italic>) and those specifying endomesoderm (<italic>wnt1</italic> and <italic>wnt8</italic>) between the invertebrate chordate amphioxus and the sea urchin embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001467-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). For example, <italic>foxq2</italic> is initially expressed in a broad region and subsequently restricted to the anterior-most region. It can be completely cleared from this region of the embryo by LiCl treatment, which can elevate Wnt/β-catenin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001467-Holland1">[11]</xref>, raising the possibility that amphioxus also uses the same ANE patterning mechanism. Thus, there is accumulating evidence that the ANE clearance mechanism described here may be used in a wide variety of deuterostomes. However, to date, only the work reported here reveals the intricate, interdependent Wnt signaling mechanisms that are required to confine the ANE regulatory state to the anterior end of the embryo.</p>

          <p>The territorial expression of orthologs in each embryo is shown to the left and right of each diagram. In cases where there is no information concerning the expression pattern of a particular ortholog, it is represented in light gray. Red asterisks designate that functional studies show these factors are involved in AP patterning of the presumptive neuroectoderm. The images of embryos are colored to indicate the expression patterns of <italic>foxq2</italic>, <italic>six3</italic>, <italic>wnt1</italic>, and <italic>wnt8</italic>. (A) ANE factors are initially expressed throughout the presumptive zebrafish neuroectoderm at late blastula/early gastrula stages (left-hand diagram). These ANE factors are progressively down-regulated in posterior regions of the presumptive neuroectoderm (dark gray) during gastrulation by a mechanism involving Fzl8a, Wnt8, Wnt1, and Dkk1, until they are confined to the anterior pole (middle diagram). Factors such as sFrp1 and Dkk3 subsequently pattern the forebrain. The right-hand diagram shows that, in the absence of Wnt/β-catenin and BMP signaling, ANE factors are expressed throughout most of the embryo.
