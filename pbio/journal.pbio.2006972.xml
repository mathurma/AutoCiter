<abstract>
<p>Insulin provides important information to tissues about feeding behavior and energy status. Defective insulin signaling is associated with ageing, tissue dysfunction, and impaired wound healing. In the liver, insulin resistance leads to chronic damage and fibrosis, but it is unclear how tissue-repair mechanisms integrate insulin signals to coordinate an appropriate injury response or how they are affected by insulin resistance. In this study, we demonstrate that insulin resistance impairs local cellular crosstalk between the fibrotic stroma and bipotent adult liver progenitor cells (LPCs), whose paracrine interactions promote epithelial repair and tissue remodeling. Using insulin-resistant mice deficient for insulin receptor substrate 2 (<italic>Irs2</italic>), we highlight dramatic impairment of proregenerative fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) signaling between stromal niche cells and LPCs during chronic injury. We provide a detailed account of the role played by IRS2 in promoting Fgf7 ligand and receptor (Fgfr2-IIIb) expression by the two cell compartments, and we describe an insulin/IRS2-dependent feed-forward loop capable of sustaining hepatic re-epithelialization by driving FGFR2-IIIb expression. Finally, we shed light on the regulation of IRS2 and FGF7 within the fibrotic stroma and show—using a human coculture system—that <italic>IRS2</italic> silencing shifts the equilibrium away from paracrine epithelial repair in favor of fibrogenesis. Hence, we offer a compelling insight into the contribution of insulin resistance to the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease and propose IRS2 as a positive regulator of communication between cell types and the transition between phases of stromal to epithelial repair.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>“Insulin resistance” is a chronic state of reduced sensitivity to the effects of circulating insulin. It is one of the hallmarks of metabolic disease and a consequence of ageing, but insulin resistance is also observed in otherwise healthy individuals after severe trauma/hemorrhage/sepsis, suggesting that it plays a physiological role in modulating the response to injury. Defective insulin signals are linked to impaired wound healing, yet it remains unclear how systemic changes affect locally the cells that coordinate tissue repair. In this study, we used the liver to assess how insulin resistance impacts the injury response in mice. We provide proof of concept that insulin signals are locally integrated by the fibrotic microenvironment surrounding the adult liver stem cells during chronic injury, resulting in the increased expression of epithelial repair signals. Insulin also simultaneously primes stem cells to respond to these stromal growth factors, leading to an increased participation in epithelial repair. Insulin resistance disrupts this local paracrine circuit, resulting in a blunted epithelial response to chronic injury that exacerbates tissue damage. Our model highlights a potential role for insulin in switching the hepatic injury response from a stromal repair process to an epithelial repair process. To our knowledge, our data provide a new perspective from which to reassess how insulin resistance influences fibrosis, wound healing, and tissue remodeling during injury.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Successful wound healing requires coordination between stromal and epithelial cell compartments. Stromal activation lays the groundwork for epithelial repair, producing the appropriate microenvironment and growth factors to facilitate proliferation and remodeling of epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref001">1</xref>]. Metabolic disease is associated with a spectrum of chronic comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and liver disease, as well as defects in wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref003">3</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether insulin resistance affects injury-repair mechanisms in target organs such as the liver, which are otherwise at the forefront of insulin's metabolic actions. The liver parenchyma is highly regenerative and can undergo dramatic tissue remodeling to maintain parenchymal function in the face of chronic injury. Such remodeling is shaped in part by the activation of perisinusoidal cells, such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and periportal mesenchymal cells, such as portal fibroblasts (PFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref004">4</xref>], that expand to produce a fibrotic milieu capable of directing epithelial repair but that also contribute to long-term risk of scarring/fibrosis and hepatic dysfunction. To date, the impact of insulin resistance on the fibrotic stroma, including how it affects the ability of mesenchymal cells to communicate repair signals to the hepatic epithelia, remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate how insulin resistance affects stromal–epithelial repair mechanisms in the liver during chronic injury by knockout of insulin receptor substrate 2 (<italic>Irs2</italic>), a key adaptor protein that couples the insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors to intracellular signaling pathways. <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have normal liver development but severe peripheral insulin resistance that leads to late-onset type II diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref006">6</xref>]. IRS2 is the principle regulator of insulin sensitivity in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref007">7</xref>], cooperating closely with IRS1 to mediate the metabolic response to feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref008">8</xref>]. Aberrant IRS2 expression has been associated with hepatic insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref009">9</xref>] and progression of chronic liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref010">10</xref>], hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref011">11</xref>], and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref012">12</xref>], in which increased IRS2 expression is associated with proliferation, increased cell survival, and disruption of cell-fate signals controlling hepatocyte metaplasia and the expansion of bipotent liver progenitor cells (LPCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref014">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, it remains to be established whether IRS2 plays any role in hepatic wound healing.</p>
<p>Fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) is an important paracrine regulator of tissue morphogenesis during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref016">16</xref>] and during re-epithelialization of cutaneous lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref017">17</xref>]. In the liver, FGF7 is expressed by HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref018">18</xref>] and Thy1 T-cell surface antigen (Thy1)-expressing PFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref019">19</xref>] that produce stromal niche signals to drive epithelial remodeling in response to chronic injury. Fgf7-knockout mice have reduced survival due to liver failure when fed a hepatotoxic diet containing 0.1% 3.5-diethoxycarbonyl-1.4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) because they are unable to support the expansion of adult liver stem cells/LPCs required for the adaptive response to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref020">20</xref>]. LPCs are bipotent epithelial precursors capable of differentiating into cholangiocytes or parenchymal hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref021">21</xref>]. During DDC liver injury, they proliferate to form duct-like structures within periportal tracts, surrounded by fibrotic stromal cells expressing Fgf7. LPCs express Fgfr2-IIIb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref019">19</xref>], the receptor for Fgf7, which is exclusively expressed in epithelia. Amplification of Fgfr2-IIIb occurs in LPCs within the expanding nonparenchymal cell (NPC) fraction during DDC injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref022">22</xref>], and potentiation of Fgfr2-IIIb signaling by overexpression of Fgf7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref019">19</xref>] or Fgf10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref022">22</xref>] drives the dramatic expansion of LPCs and immature hepatocytes within the liver. Fgf7/Fgfr2-IIIb interactions therefore communicate proregenerative signals between stroma and epithelia, with a range that is strictly limited to local paracrine effects because of the high affinity of Fgf7 for heparin-sulphate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix and neighboring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Usually, insulin signals are systemic, but in model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, they also coordinate short-range communication between niche cells and stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref024">24</xref>]. This allows for tissue-specific responses to changing environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref025">25</xref>]. In this study, we show that integration of insulin/IRS2 signals by HSCs and LPCs promotes paracrine crosstalk between the fibrotic stroma and LPCs via Fgf7. We demonstrate that loss of <italic>Irs2</italic> has a negative impact on hepatic wound healing, reducing the capacity of HSCs and LPCs to produce and respond to Fgf7 respectively.</p>

<p>In contrast with the results of messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), immunostaining for Thy1, Elastin, and αSMA tended towards increased expression in <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> livers on day 21, while mesenchymal intermediate filament protein vimentin was similarly induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

In contrast, lack of contact between Gfap+ HSCs and LPCs was observed in <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> livers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Hence, failure to induce Fgf7 coincided with an overall loss of Gfap+ HSCs and loss of association between HSCs and LPCs in portal tracts, whereas we were unable to confirm that stromal PFs were negatively influenced by <italic>Irs2</italic> deletion. However, increased Thy1 staining in <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> livers was partially attributable to the increase in markers of bone-marrow–derived cells; cd45/protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C gene encoding CD45 cell surface antigen (<italic>Ptprc</italic>) and cd117/Proto-oncogene c-kit (<italic>Kit</italic>), on day 7, which coincided with early activation of matrix remodeling factors (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 [<italic>Timp1</italic>] and Matrix metallopeptidase 9 [<italic>Mmp9</italic>]) and MYC proto-oncogene (<italic>cMyc</italic>) and a dramatic early peak in transforming growth factor beta (<italic>Tgf</italic>β)—a master regulator of fibrogenesis and mobilizer of circulating populations of collagen-expressing fibrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s006">S6A Fig</xref>).

In WT mice, rFgf7 robustly activated Fgf7/Fgfr2 signaling as assessed by western blot, demonstrating increased in vivo phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 in whole-liver lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This response to rFgf7 was abrogated in the <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> livers, indicating that they were refractory to Fgf7. Taken together, our findings suggested that <italic>Irs2</italic> played a dual role in (i) promoting stromal expression of Fgf7 and (ii) sustaining sensitivity of the hepatic epithelia to Fgf7 during chronic DDC liver injury by promoting Fgfr2-IIIb expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Interestingly, the timing of <italic>Fgfr2-IIIb</italic> loss in <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (days 14–21) corresponded with a period during which the parenchymal architecture failed to re-epithelialize, as judged by quantitative analysis of β-catenin immunostaining in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), suggesting that in the later stages of DDC injury, <italic>Irs2</italic> was required upstream of Fgf7–Fgfr2-IIIb signaling to driving adaptive epithelial remodeling.</p>

<p>We examined the possibility that IRS2 played a direct role in regulating LPC sensitivity to FGF7 and epithelialization using a human model of bipotent adult liver progenitor cells (HepaRG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref030">30</xref>].

Importantly, the formation of epithelial islands and <italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic> were restored by exogenous expression of a mouse <italic>Irs2</italic> not targeted by the human <italic>IRS2</italic> shRNA construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>); hence, we confirmed a cell-autonomous role for <italic>IRS2</italic> in promoting FGFR2-IIIb expression and differentiation in LPC-like cells.</p>
<p>Culturing of HepaRG cells with recombinant human FGF7 (rhFGF7) accelerated the formation of islands and increased hepatocyte differentiation, as determined by increased albumin/HNF4α and E-cadherin (E-cad) immunostaining, human <italic>APOA2</italic>-promoter (<italic>pAPOA2</italic>)-GFP reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g006">Fig 6F</xref>), and analysis of hepatocyte-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). This occurred downstream of a rapid (3–6 h) and sustained induction in osteopontin/<italic>SPP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), consistent with our in vivo observation that osteopontin/<italic>Spp1</italic> and <italic>Fgf7</italic> were both impaired in <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> livers during injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Importantly, the ability of rhFGF7 to promote expression of osteopontin/<italic>SPP1</italic>, as well as hepatocyte-specific genes such as albumin and <italic>APOA2</italic>, was both insulin and <italic>IRS2</italic> dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g006">Fig 6G</xref>), revealing synergy between these two pathways in driving the differentiation of bipotent progenitor cells. Stable silencing of <italic>IRS2</italic> or omission of supplemented insulin from the medium was sufficient to abrogate the positive long-term effects of rhFGF7 on the hepatogenic program, thus demonstrating a functional requirement for insulin/IRS2 upstream of paracrine FGF7 signaling. Interestingly, rhFGF7 treatment also increased <italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic> expression, highlighting the potential for positive feedback between ligand and receptor—an effect that was also insulin/IRS2 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g006">Fig 6G</xref>) and hence reinforced the conclusion that insulin/IRS2 signaling in LPC-like cells primed FGF7 sensitivity.</p>
<p>Our data supported the hypothesis that insulin/IRS2 signaling was functionally upstream of FGF7-mediated epithelialization of LPCs and highlighted a cell-intrinsic role for <italic>IRS2</italic> in promoting sensitivity to paracrine FGF7 produced by the fibrotic stroma. However, they also revealed that loss of stromal FGF7 could by itself be sufficient to explain a decline in <italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic> expression and epithelialization in a non-cell–autonomous manner as a consequence of reduced positive feedback between ligand and receptor.</p>

<title>Insulin/IRS2 resistance in fibrotic stroma limits hepatocyte differentiation and <italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic> expression in cocultured LPCs</title>
<p>Our results highlighted the potential for a paracrine feed-forward loop in which FGF7 drove LPC differentiation and <italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic> expression, potentiating both epithelialization and FGF7 sensitivity in an insulin/IRS2-dependent manner. To test this hypothesis further and to more rigorously address the role of insulin/IRS2 signaling in the fibrotic stroma, we performed coculture experiments with hHSCs and HepaRG cells, seeding the two cell types together in order to model the intimate heterotypic cell–cell interactions observed between LPCs and their stromal niche in periportal tracts during DDC injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

<p>Consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>FGF7</italic> was indirectly regulated by stromal IRS2, we observed similar levels of <italic>FGF7</italic> in the early stages of LX-2/HepaRG coculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). However, while <italic>FGF7</italic> expression was sustained in cocultures containing normal LX-2 stroma, a significant long-term decline was observed in those that contained <italic>IRS2</italic>-deficient LX-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), demonstrating an indirect role for stromal IRS2 in promoting <italic>FGF7</italic> expression in coculture. The decline <italic>FGF7</italic> expression in the <italic>IRS2</italic>-deficient stromal cocultures also coincided with a striking failure to induce <italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic> on day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed blunted induction of <italic>FGF10</italic> within cocultures containing <italic>IRS2</italic>-deficient stroma (days 10–14), whereas <italic>FGF22</italic> expression was unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s010">S10A Fig</xref>). These data reinforced the notion that FGFR2-IIIb ligands such as FGF7/FGF10 were required to drive expression of their epithelial receptor in LPCs both in vivo and in vitro.</p>
<p>Using the coculture method, we also found that <italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic> and <italic>APOA2</italic> induction by LPCs required insulin signaling via IRS2 within the fibrotic stroma. Knockdown of <italic>IRS2</italic> in LX-2 cells completely abrogated the ability of insulin to potentiate epithelial sensitivity to FGF7 and hepatocyte differentiation within the cocultures, as judged by loss of time-dependent induction of <italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic> and <italic>APOA2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). These results demonstrated a requirement for stromal <italic>IRS2</italic> in the non-cell–autonomous potentiation of FGF7 target genes in HepaRG cells. Moreover, we observed localized expression of FGFR2 in HepaRG at sites of contact with LX-2 cells, suggesting regulation of LPC differentiation by the stroma at close range, consistent with the short-rage paracrine actions of FGF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to further test whether paracrine FGF7 signaling was downstream of <italic>IRS2</italic>-dependent stromal–epithelial crosstalk in hHSC/HepaRG cocultures, we used primary hHSCs, which expressed higher levels of endogenous FGF7 than LX-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Interestingly, we found that both <italic>FGF7</italic> and <italic>IRS2</italic> expression were significantly increased in hHSCs following MitoC-induced cell-cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). This observation provided us with a useful means to modulate endogenous FGF7 expression prior to coculturing the cells with HepaRG. Consistent with the increase in <italic>FGF7</italic> expression, we observed a dramatic enhancement of <italic>APOA2</italic> expression in HepaRG cocultures using hHSCs pretreated with MitoC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Moreover, inclusion in the medium of a competitive FGF7 inhibitor, consisting of a chimeric rFGFR2-IIIb extracellular domain/Human IgG1 crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain protein (rhFGFR2-IIIb-Fc), significantly inhibited <italic>APOA2</italic> expression by HepaRG, confirming APOA2 as a downstream target of paracrine FGF7 and demonstrating a role for FGF7 signaling in driving hepatocyte differentiation in coculture.</p>

<p>The diffusion of FGF7 is highly restricted because of its affinity for heparin-sulphate proteoglycans in extracellular matrix and cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref023">23</xref>]. Consistent with this short-range mode of action, we found that hepatocyte differentiation within the cocultures (judged by HNF4α immunostaining) was spatially limited to sites of contact between HepaRG and vimentin+ hHSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). To explore the properties of the HSC signal driving differentiation within the cocultures further, we developed a short-term bioassay using <italic>APOA2</italic> expression as a functional readout for FGF7 activity.

Importantly, the ability of hHSCs to induce <italic>APOA2</italic> within 48 h in this model was conditional upon the pretreatment of hHSCs with MitoC, confirming that paracrine FGF7 signaling in hHSCs was enhanced by mitotic inactivation.</p>

The equilibrium within the fibrotic stroma between activated and reverted HSCs is therefore central to the regulation of the stromal injury response and has important consequences for liver fibrosis and scarring in the context of chronic injury.</p>
<p>Our data showed that both <italic>FGF7</italic> and <italic>IRS2</italic> expression were induced in hHSCs upon triggering of cell-cycle arrest using MitoC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). MitoC treatment was also accompanied by a phenotypic shift in hHSCs and LX-2s consistent with fibrogenic reversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g009">Fig 9A</xref>), as judged by loss of Collagen 1A1 (<italic>COL1A1</italic>) expression and activation of antiapoptotic heat shock 70 kDa protein 1B (<italic>HSPA1B</italic>), previously identified as a biomarker of HSC reversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref031">31</xref>].

<p>We therefore returned to the LX-2/HepaRG cocultures to assess changes in fibrogenic markers. Using this method, we found that upon coculture with LPC-like cells, control (sh-luc) LX-2 cells underwent a process of time-dependent fibrogenic reversion, during which fibrillar collagen (<italic>COL1A1)</italic> expression was significantly down-regulated and αSMA/<italic>ACTA2</italic> dampened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). In striking contrast to this, we found that silencing of <italic>IRS2</italic> in LX-2 cells abrogated their ability to suppress <italic>COL1A1</italic> in coculture, and we instead observed a dramatic induction of nonfibrillar type III collagen (<italic>COL3A1</italic>) indicative of an activated stromal injury response. Time-dependent switching from myofibroblast marker THY1 to LPC-associated SPP1 was also dampened by silencing of <italic>IRS2</italic> in the stroma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s010">S10B Fig</xref>), and the numbers of GFP-expressing LX-2 cells at the end of the cocultures was increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s010">S10C Fig</xref>). Interestingly, unlike LPC and epithelial repair genes (<italic>SPP1</italic>/<italic>APOA2</italic>/<italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic>), whose expression in coculture was both insulin and IRS2 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g007">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s010">S10 Fig</xref>), changes in fibrogenic/myofibroblast genes <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL3A1</italic>, <italic>ACTA2</italic>, and <italic>THY1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g009">Fig 9D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s010">S10 Fig</xref>) were largely unaffected by omission of insulin from the medium, suggesting the ability of IRS2 to restrain activation of the fibrogenic stroma was insulin independent. We concluded that silencing of <italic>IRS2</italic> in HSCs prolonged their fibrogenic activation in coculture while slowing fibrogenic reversion by MitoC and reducing the survival of mitotically inactivated cells in which FGF7 expression was increased. Thus, IRS2 signaling in the fibrotic stroma served as a switch between states of stromal activation and fibrogenic reversion that potentiated heterotypic paracrine signaling between the two cell types and drove epithelial FGF7 sensitivity in LPCs. Together with our results demonstrating a cell-intrinsic role for <italic>IRS2</italic> in LPCs in promoting FGF7 sensitivity, we proposed a model in which IRS2 exerted multiple proregenerative effects in both stromal and LPC cell compartments that favored epithelial repair over fibrogenesis during chronic liver injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we provide compelling evidence that <italic>Irs2</italic> is required for hepatic wound healing and epithelial repair during chronic DDC feeding in mice and for sustaining local Fgf7/Fgfr2-IIIb signaling. Using human cell models, we have shown that <italic>IRS2</italic> can affect multiple processes in both the fibrotic stroma and bipotent LPC-like cells that impinge upon their abilities to communicate with one another via FGF7 signaling. In addition, coculture studies confirm that <italic>IRS2</italic> deficiency in HSCs disrupts paracrine crosstalk between the stromal niche and LPCs, resulting in failure to induce <italic>FGFR2-IIIb</italic> and epithelialization while simultaneously prolonging fibrogenic activation. Our data therefore support the hypothesis that insulin resistance could lead to defects in hepatic injury repair that exacerbate liver damage and progression of chronic liver disease because of reduced paracrine FGF signaling. These data also have profound implications for our understanding of how systemic insulin signals are interpreted by local injury-repair mechanisms and demonstrate that defects in insulin sensitivity can influence short-range communication between distinct cell types within a tissue, notably between the so-called “niche” and adult stem cells responsible for producing new epithelia.</p>
<p>Interestingly, insulin resistance in human liver disease is associated with increased fibrosis and the appearance of reactive periportal lesions called "ductular reactions" (DRs), in which intermediate “hepatobiliary” progenitors expand surrounded by fibrotic stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref032">32</xref>]. These lesions exhibit striking similarities with those observed in the DDC-injury model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref033">33</xref>], although DRs are a feature of disrepair because of their correlation with poor prognosis. The association between insulin resistance and DRs has been demonstrated in liver disorders including NASH and chronic hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref034">34</xref>], in which defective <italic>IRS2</italic> expression has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref011">11</xref>]. Our results suggest that reduced sensitivity to insulin in patients with chronic liver disease could alter the intrinsic abilities of LPCs to contribute to regenerative processes and lead to a derangement of heterotypic cell–cell interactions that mediate their expansion and differentiation, leading to DRs. Our discovery that <italic>IRS2</italic> silencing in HSCs also promoted fibrogenesis while limiting hepatocyte differentiation and FGFR2-IIIb expression in coculture recapitulated the increase in liver fibrosis and reduced Fgf7/Fgfr2-IIIb expression described in <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice during DDC treatment. Hence, our data suggest that lRS2 signaling may serve as a switch that regulates the transition between phases of stromal and epithelial expansion within DRs by promoting reversion and survival of FGF7-expressing stroma while simultaneously priming LPCs to express FGFR2-IIIb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p>
<p>There is precedent that IRS proteins play an important role in driving epithelial growth via modification of the stromal microenvironment in the liver. NT-157, the allosteric inhibitor of IRS1/2, was recently found to limit colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver by reducing the trophic support received by stromal myofibroblasts or HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref035">35</xref>]. These findings exhibit striking parallels with our results and highlight the potential future impact of our feed-forward paracrine model in the field of cancer biology, in which subversion of injury-repair mechanisms by tumors are well documented. Consistent with this, Irs2 was also recently implicated in a positive feedback loop driving disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis in rodent models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref013">13</xref>]. Interestingly, the study identified hepatic <italic>Irs2</italic> expression as a downstream target of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and Tafazzin (TAZ)—two oncogenic effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway that reversibly control hepatocellular fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref036">36</xref>], LPC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref037">37</xref>], and liver regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref038">38</xref>]. Hence, it seems likely that subversion of Irs2-dependent aspects of the LPC response identified in our study also contribute to the pathophysiology of metabolic liver disease and cancer.</p>
<p>Insulin and FGF7 synergized via <italic>IRS2</italic> to promote osteopontin/<italic>SPP1</italic> expression and sustain hepatocyte differentiation, thus revealing a cell-intrinsic role for insulin/IRS2 in priming and potentiating LPC sensitivity to paracrine FGF7 and other IIIb ligands such as FGF22 and FGF10. Insulin/<italic>IRS2</italic> signaling was required for the formation of “islands” in HepaRG cultures, which expanded because of a process of hepatocyte differentiation and epithelialization and conferred FGF7 sensitivity to the cultures by promoting FGFR2-IIIb expression. Conversely, in DDC-treated <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, the numbers of hepatocytes declined, and the process of re-epithelialization was impaired, as manifested by delayed restoration of the parenchymal architecture, delayed induction of <italic>Epcam</italic>, failure to sustain <italic>Fgfr2-IIIb</italic>, and failure to expand numbers of small hepatocytes. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>IRS2</italic> promotes hepatocyte differentiation of LPCs in vivo, although this would need to be empirically tested.</p>
<p>We have identified positive feedback between FGF7 and its receptor in HepaRG monocultures as well as HepaRG/HSC cocultures and demonstrated a role for <italic>IRS2</italic> in both cell compartments upstream of FGFR2-IIIb amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g010">Fig 10</xref>). These data were highly consistent with the observed dual failure of Fgf7/Fgfr2-IIIb in <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice during injury and provide new insight into the underlying synergies that help promote epithelial sensitivity to proregenerative stromal growth factors such as Fgf7. Positive feedback between Fgf10 and <italic>Fgfr2-IIIb</italic> has previously been reported during salivary gland development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref015">15</xref>], and in nonmalignant tumors, Fgf7-mediated FGFR2-IIIb expression is thought to play a tumor-suppressive role by promoting epithelial differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref039">39</xref>]. Interestingly, synergy between Fgfr2-IIIb ligands and their receptor has previously been linked to crosstalk with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)—one of the principle effectors of insulin/IGF-1 signaling recruited by IRS2-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref015">15</xref>]. Indeed, inhibition of PI3K/Protein kinase B (AKT) limits hepatocellular reprogramming by Fgf10/Fgfr2-IIIb during DDC injury in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref022">22</xref>], suggesting Irs2 could act upstream of this pathway in promoting cellular plasticity in the liver.</p>
<p>Further to impairment of Fgf7, we also describe reductions in <italic>Fgf10</italic> during DDC injury and in LX-2/HepaRG cell coculture. Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that the IRS2-dependent paracrine feed-forward loop we have identified also involves other stromal FGFR2-IIIb ligands. HSC-derived Fgf10 plays an important role in the expansion of bipotent LPCs during liver development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref040">40</xref>], and both FGF10 and 22 are induced by the fibrotic stroma during DDC injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref022">22</xref>]. A deeper understanding of the indirect nature of how IRS2 regulates these genes within the stroma is therefore needed.</p>
<p>In recent years, FGFs have received increasing attention for their unexpected role in metabolic disease and for their potential to treat metabolic disorders by helping restore insulin sensitivity. FGF1, 19, and 21 have potent (albeit poorly understood) effects on metabolism and insulin signaling, largely through their putative actions in white adipose tissue and the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref041">41</xref>], whereas impaired FGF-receptor signaling is associated with insulin resistance, liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref042">42</xref>], and impaired hepatic regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref044">44</xref>]. Blunted expression of FGF7 has also been previously linked to delayed skin wound healing in genetically diabetic leptin deficient (db/db) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref046">46</xref>]. Our data therefore raise the intriguing possibility that a comparable wound-healing defect may also exist in the livers of <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice following injury, resulting in a breakdown in stromal–epithelial paracrine signaling and consequent failure to coordinate the injury response. Combined future strategies to potentiate hepatic insulin sensitivity and FGF7 signaling may therefore improve patient outcomes by promoting epithelial repair in the liver.</p>
<p>The impact of insulin resistance on the stromal microenvironment in the liver during injury is poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref005">5</xref>], as is the role played by IRS proteins in regulating HSC biology, which involves injury-dependent cycles of myofibroblast activation and cell clearance during so-called "fibrogenic reversion." The model we present to explain impaired stromal induction of Fgf7 in the <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g010">Fig 10</xref>) incorporates how IRS2 influenced fibrogenic reversion and survival of HSCs—only one of several FGF7-expressing stromal subpopulations that respond to DDC injury. However, we also provide evidence that the cellular composition of the fibrotic milieu was different in the livers of <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and leave open the possibility that <italic>Irs2</italic>-deletion affected other resident FGF7-expressing cells such as PFs. Finally, we observed a greater increase in T cells and the incorporation of bloodborne mesenchymal cells, possibly to the detriment of resident stromal cells or simply to compensate for the failure of FGF7-expressing stroma. Fibrocytes from type II diabetic patients have recently been shown to display altered migratory and inflammatory characteristics that could also have contributed to the altered pattern of stromal gene expression and impaired wound healing in our model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006972.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>We show that DDC injury had a negative impact on Gfap+ HSCs in <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Gfap is associated with quiescent or inactivated HSCs; hence, our data are consistent with accelerated turnover/loss of these cells in the livers of <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice due to a combination of reduced survival and/or reduced myofibroblast reversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006972.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Our investigation using hHSCs revealed that <italic>IRS2</italic> protected cells from apoptosis following mitotic inactivation using MitoC, providing a mechanism to explain the dampening of Fgf7 and increased apoptosis observed in the livers of <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice during injury. Interestingly, both <italic>IRS2</italic> and <italic>FGF7</italic> were increased in primary hHSCs upon cell-cycle arrest and fibrogenic reversion while enhancing their ability to drive epithelial differentiation of HepaRG cells in an FGF7-dependent manner in coculture. Similarly, IRS2 was required in LX-2 cells to sustain both FGF7 expression and to allow a process of fibrogenic reversion to proceed in the presence of HepaRG cells. These data provide new evidence to suggest that epithelial repair signals produced by HSCs are increased by a program of cell-cycle arrest or cell death, two processes that are more closely aligned with stromal reversion than myofibroblast activation. Given that the regulation of <italic>FGF7</italic> expression by the fibrotic stroma is poorly understood, we propose the hypothesis that fibrogenic reversion, rather than myofibroblast activation, drives FGF7 expression during injury and that IRS2 preferentially favors reversion and survival of HSCs tasked with stimulating epithelial repair. Future work by this laboratory will seek to further test this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Fluorescence immunostained cells/cryosections were analyzed using the “INcell 1000” imaging platform and software (GE Healthcare) where indicated. Individual cells were identified by Hoechst staining. Threshold analysis was used to determine the expression of the following markers: <italic>pAPOA2</italic>-GFP, albumin, CYP3A4, HNF4α, Ki67, Spp1, and Vimentin. For replicate well/tissue sections, at least 20 fields were randomly analyzed for each replicate. PFE tissue sections were imaged using Pannoramic Viewer (3DHISTEC) and analyzed with FIJI software; β-catenin staining was quantified using FIJI (histogram function) to calculate modal pixel intensity.</p>

<title>Hepatocyte ploidy</title>
<p>Interpolation of DNA content in HNF4α/Hoechst-stained liver sections was performed using a methodology developed by our laboratory using INcell 1000 (GF Healthcare) that enabled in situ approximation of hepatocyte ploidy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). DNA content was calculated for all circular hepatocyte nuclei (nuclear elongation value &gt; 0.8) as a combined function of Hoechst nuclear fluorescence intensity (DNA density) and nuclear volume (calculated as a spherical function of nuclear radius). Hepatocyte ploidy was then calibrated using circular HNF4α− NPC cell population within the tissue as a 2n control. The 2c hepatocyte population was defined as the population of HNF4α+ nuclei within the 19.99 μm<sup>2</sup>–34.99 μm<sup>2</sup> nuclear size range with a nuclear circularity index &gt;0.8.</p>

<p>Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) with DNaseI Digestion. Liver tissue was preprocessed using Trizol (MilliporeSigma). For experiments using cells, RNA from duplicate wells were analyzed. First-strand synthesis was performed using EcoDry Premix (Takara, Kusatsu, Japan), and real time-PCR was carried out in LightCycler 480 II (Roche) using SYBR PreMix ExTaq (Mi RNaseH Plus, Takara). Reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed in triplicates for all RNAs analyzed. Primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006972.s013">S3 Table</xref>.

<title>Loss of hepatocytes in <italic>Irs2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice during chronic DDC liver injury corresponds with failure to activate small “2c” hepatocyte populations.</title>
<p>(A–B) Analysis of hepatocyte ploidy in HNF4α immunolabelled liver sections. (A) High-content imaging was used to generate frequency, size, and morphometry profiles of HNF4α+ nuclei based on quantification of Hoechst DNA staining in liver tissue sections. Upper panel shows representative images of hepatocyte nuclei of different sizes and shapes, with smaller nuclei (&lt;75 μm<sup>2</sup>) tending to have greater circularity indices (&gt;0.8), whereas larger nuclei tended to be bilobular. We observed discrete peaks in nuclear “circularity” (I–IV) that we hypothesized corresponded to the major ploidy groupings in the liver: 2n, 4n, 8n, and 16n. Data shown from untreated WT livers (<italic>n</italic> = 4, 1.35 × 10<sup>4</sup> HNF4α+ nuclei per animal). (B) To test this hypothesis, all nuclei were gated for circularity (&gt;0.8), and DNA content was calculated for peaks I–V as a function of interpolated nuclear volume and Hoechst intensity (formula below). Using HNF4α− NPCs as an internal 2n control, we confirmed that populations I–IV accurately represented 2c, 4c, 8c, and 16c hepatocyte populations, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 4, 1.1 × 10<sup>4</sup> HNF4α+ nuclei per animal). This original methodology to describe hepatocyte ploidy in situ was then applied to WT and Irs2<sup>−/−</sup> livers during DDC feeding.
