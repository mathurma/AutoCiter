<p>When water is scarce, trees invest in the moderate carbon cost of supporting defensive ants to avoid the potentially high carbon cost of extremities being eaten.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Abiotic environmental variables strongly affect the outcomes of species interactions. For example, mutualistic interactions between species are often stronger when resources are limited. The effect might be indirect: water stress on plants can lead to carbon stress, which could alter carbon-mediated plant mutualisms. In mutualistic ant–plant symbioses, plants host ant colonies that defend them against herbivores. Here we show that the partners' investments in a widespread ant–plant symbiosis increase with water stress across 26 sites along a Mesoamerican precipitation gradient. At lower precipitation levels, <italic>Cordia alliodora</italic> trees invest more carbon in <italic>Azteca</italic> ants via phloem-feeding scale insects that provide the ants with sugars, and the ants provide better defense of the carbon-producing leaves. Under water stress, the trees have smaller carbon pools. A model of the carbon trade-offs for the mutualistic partners shows that the observed strategies can arise from the carbon costs of rare but extreme events of herbivory in the rainy season. Thus, water limitation, together with the risk of herbivory, increases the strength of a carbon-based mutualism.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The strength of ecological interactions, measured as the costs or benefits sustained by each species, depends on the environmental context in which the interaction occurs. Stressful environmental conditions should favor trading between species that can produce a given resource or service at the lowest cost. Mutualisms, in which both interacting species incur a net benefit, may thus strengthen under stressful conditions. Here we examine an ant–plant mutualism, in which plants provide food and housing for ants and ants defend plants against leaf-eating insects, along a four-fold annual precipitation gradient comprising tropical sites in Mexico and Central America. We show that the strength of the mutualism, in terms of carbon investment by plants and leaf defense by ants, increases as water availability decreases. Carbon shortages are more frequent where water is scarce and increase the risk that plants will die if all of their leaves are eaten by herbivores. Trees appear to invest more in ant defenders when water is scarce to insure themselves against extreme herbivory. Water availability thus indirectly determines the outcomes of this ant–plant mutualism, which suggests that the increasing frequency of extreme climate events in the tropics will have important ecological consequences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mutualistic species interactions contribute to multiple ecosystem functions by driving processes as diverse as dispersal, pollination, defense, and nutrient transfer. Environmental context frequently determines the levels of investments made by mutualists. For example, low-quality environments should amplify mutualism if the cost to each partner of obtaining a limiting resource independently is higher than that of receiving the resource from the mutualistic partner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Thrall1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Bronstein1">[2]</xref>. The question then becomes: for a given mutualism, what determines environmental quality? In some cases, environmental quality can be defined simply by the availability of the resource being exchanged. For example, plant–mycorrhizal mutualisms are stronger when nitrogen and phosphorus are limiting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Johnson1">[3]</xref>. In addition, fungal endophytes can confer drought resistance to plant hosts, promoting stronger mutualism under water stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Cheplick1">[4]</xref>. However, there are few known cases of mutualism strength mediated by a limiting resource that is not directly involved in the mutualistic exchange.</p>
<p>Ant–plant interactions are classic examples of defense mutualisms: plants provide ants with food (and, in myrmecophytic plants, nesting space), and ants protect plants from herbivores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Heil1">[5]</xref>. Environmental context determines how much ants improve plant performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Rosumek1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Chamberlain1">[8]</xref>. In particular, the abiotic environment, approximated by latitude, appears to affect the outcomes of ant–plant interactions in different communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Rosumek1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Chamberlain1">[8]</xref>. Abiotic effects are difficult to discern across communities, however, because such effects can be confounded with biotic macro-patterns, such as the latitudinal diversity gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Trager1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Chamberlain1">[8]</xref>. The few previous studies of abiotic effects within particular ant–plant species pairs have suggested that water stress can mediate plant performance and investment in ants. In one study, ants benefited nectar-producing <italic>Inga</italic> plants only in sunny microhabitats, perhaps by preventing water stress caused by herbivorous thrips in high sun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Kersch1">[9]</xref>. In another study, myrmecophytic <italic>Acacia</italic> plants produced more extrafloral nectar in the dry season, which resulted in higher ant activity and aggression against herbivores than in the rainy season <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-GonzlezTeuber1">[10]</xref>. Interestingly, this increase in nectar production and ant aggression in the dry season actually coincided with a lower risk of herbivory than that occurring in the rainy season. This suggests that plants may invest more in ant defense when they are water stressed because the costs of herbivory under water stress are particularly high, and leaves are harder to replace when resources are scarce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Coley1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Plant carbon limitation may be an important physiological mechanism mediating plant response to water stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Wiley1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-McDowell1">[13]</xref>, but it is not clear how carbon limitation affects plant–animal mutualisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Laird1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Folgarait1">[15]</xref>. Sustained water limitation causes plants to close stomata and reduce leaf area, which should increase the risk of carbon starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-McDowell2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Adams1">[17]</xref>. Such carbon stress would be exacerbated by leaf-area loss from herbivory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Because ants defend the leaves but represent a carbon cost to plants, plants under water stress should invest more in ant defenders if (1) water stress indeed leads to reduced carbon availability and (2) the carbon cost of maintaining ant colonies is lower than the cost of leaf herbivory.</p>

<title>Schematic of relationships among water, carbon, and mutualistic carbohydrate allocation strategies.</title>
<p>Trees and protective ants engage in an indirect exchange of carbon. Trees produce carbohydrates by photosynthesis and use them for growth, reproduction, and to support the scale insects that feed the defending ant colony. Water is necessary for trees to produce leaves and affects the efficiency with which leaves produce carbohydrates. Ants use carbohydrates to make sterile workers and reproductives. Workers defend the tree leaves from herbivory, and thereby protect the carbon source. Arrows denote positive effects; lines that end in Ts denote negative effects. In this study, we examine these relationships to test whether water stress leads to carbon stress and thereby increases the strength of the ant–plant mutualism.</p>

<p>An attractive system for studying these issues is provided by the myrmecophytic tree <italic>Cordia alliodora</italic> (Boraginaceae), which is found in tropical forests from Mexico to Argentina. In Mesoamerica, the most common ant symbiont is the <italic>C. alliodora</italic>–specialist <italic>Azteca pittieri</italic> (Formicidae: Dolichoderinae) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle1">[18]</xref>. Trees do not directly feed the ants but instead host phloem-feeding scale insects, whose sugar-rich excretions (known as “honeydew”) provide the ants with carbohydrates; trees must host scale insects to maintain ant colonies, and ants defend trees most effectively when densities of scale insects are high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle2">[19]</xref>. Thus, scales can be considered part of the tree's investment in defense. The trees also produce housing for ants in cavities at stem nodes (domatia), but the scale insects represent the primary cost to the trees for maintaining a defensive ant colony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle3">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>In seasonally dry tropical forests, where <italic>C. alliodora</italic> evolved and the mutualism is most common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Rymer1">[21]</xref>, trees are deciduous and remain leafless throughout the annual dry season. Deciduous tropical trees face a particularly high risk of carbon starvation because they respire year-round at high temperatures (∼30°C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Adams1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Janzen1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Marshall1">[23]</xref> but add to their carbon pools only during the rainy season. Tropical-rainfall seasonality alters the sizes of tree carbon pools within a site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Newell1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Wrth1">[25]</xref>, but to our knowledge, no study has documented intraspecific variation in the carbon pools of tropical trees at sites with different precipitation regimes. (One study looked for such variation but did not find it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Poorter1">[26]</xref>.) For <italic>C. alliodora</italic>, carbon stored from photosynthesis during the rainy season must be sufficient for dry-season respiration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Adams1">[17]</xref>, leaf flush in the next rainy season <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Poorter1">[26]</xref>, year-round maintenance of scale insects that feed defending ant colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle2">[19]</xref>, and the tree's own reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Wrth1">[25]</xref>. Ant colonies must be maintained year-round to provide effective anti-herbivore defense in the rainy season (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we tested whether the strength of an ant–plant mutualism, measured as investment by trees in scale insects that feed ants and by ants in defense of leaves, is related to water availability across ∼2,300 km of Mesoamerica from Mexico to Costa Rica. We investigated the relationships among water, carbohydrates, and mutualistic traits across this gradient to test whether water stress leads to carbon stress, and whether carbon stress affects carbohydrate allocation strategies by the mutualists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We first asked whether precipitation was correlated with mutualistic investments by trees and ants. We then asked whether trees store more carbon, and experience a lower risk of carbon starvation, at sites where precipitation is higher and the growing (rainy) season is longer. Finally, to investigate when the cost of herbivory during the rainy season is high enough for trees to invest carbon in ant defense, we modeled carbon-allocation trade-offs for trees and ants in rainy seasons of different durations associated with different precipitation regimes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To test whether water limitation leads to increased strength of a defense mutualism, and if so how, we studied the symbiosis between <italic>C. alliodora</italic> trees and <italic>Azteca</italic> ants in 26 Mesoamerican sites encompassing a four-fold precipitation gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001705-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s012">S1</xref>). In contrast to precipitation, temperature increases only weakly with latitude (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.09, slope = 0.15, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s013">Table S2</xref>), and plant-available soil nutrients do not co-vary along the gradient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s014">Table S3</xref>). We controlled for differences in light availability among sites in our analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s015">Table S4</xref>). In the dry forests along the Pacific Mesoamerican coast, annual precipitation is positively correlated with the duration of the rainy season; dry seasons are longer at drier sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s001">S1</xref>).</p>

<p>The mutualism between trees and ants was stronger in drier sites than in wetter sites across the 26 surveyed locations from Mexico to Costa Rica (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Trees supported more scale insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), and ant colonies were correspondingly larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle2">[19]</xref> in drier sites than in wetter sites. Colony size increased faster than the number of scale insects with water stress, such that ant colonies at a drier site (Chamela) tended fewer scale insects per worker ant than ants at a wetter site (Santa Rosa) (scale insects per ant = 0.25±0.02 in Chamela and 0.44±0.05 in Santa Rosa; <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.004). In contrast to the number of worker ants, colonies did not produce more female reproductives at drier sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s016">Table S5</xref>). Nitrogen isotopes indicated that ants fed at the same trophic level relative to host trees and scale insects at a drier and a wetter site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s003">Figure S3A</xref>); ant tissues also contained equivalent percent carbon and nitrogen at different sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s003">Figure S3B</xref>–C). Ants defended trees more effectively in drier sites, responding more quickly to a disturbance to their host tree than in wetter sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s004">S4</xref>). In ant-exclusion experiments conducted at three sites encompassing the extremes of the precipitation gradient, herbivory was significantly lower on leaves with ants than on leaves without ants in two of the driest sites (∼774 mm-rain/y) but not in a wetter site (∼1702 mm-rain/y) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Behavioral assays of activity and responsiveness indicated that ants were more likely to find herbivores and chase them from trees in drier sites than in wetter sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

<p>To test whether trees experiencing drier conditions retained smaller carbon pools, we measured total nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) in <italic>C. alliodora</italic> trees in two sites that differed two-fold in annual precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Main stems and roots were the primary NSC storage tissues at both sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s017">Table S6</xref>). We found that, as predicted, tree starch pools in main stems were significantly smaller in the drier site than in the wetter site at the end of the dry season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s017">Table S6</xref>). Additionally, at the end of the dry season, main stems contained a higher ratio of sucrose to starch in the drier site than in the wetter site, which reduced the difference between sites in total NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s006">Figure S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s017">Table S6</xref>). The conversion of starch to sucrose maintains osmotic balance during severe water stress and is the first stage of carbon-pool depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Marshall1">[23]</xref>, which increases the probability of carbon starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-McDowell1">[13]</xref>. Between-site differences were mirrored by seasonal differences within the drier site, where starch reserves were significantly depleted over the course of the dry season and sucrose∶starch ratios increased concomitantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Differences in carbon pools were attributable to differences between sites in water limitation, not to differences in leaf area, temperature, nutrients, or light (Figures S7 and S8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s013">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s014">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s015">S4</xref>).</p>

<p>Tree NSC pools at both sites exhibited strong seasonal patterns. Trees exhibited the lowest levels of NSCs in the early rainy season shortly after flushing new leaves (i.e., stored carbohydrates are invested in new growth) and the highest levels of NSCs in the early dry season when growth slows and leaves are still present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Wrth1">[25]</xref>. Shorter growing seasons at drier sites than at wetter sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s001">Figure S1</xref>) led to larger NSC pools in the drier site, where trees had stopped growing, than in the wetter site, where trees continued to grow, in late October 2009 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s006">Figure S6</xref>). In the week preceding this tissue collection, it rained 6 mm in the drier site and 40.2 mm in the wetter site; in the month following tissue collection, it rained 0 mm in the drier site and 314.9 mm in the wetter site. The time of tissue collection thus represented the early dry season in the drier site but the late rainy season in the wetter site. Twig NSCs mirrored patterns in main stems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s006">Figure S6</xref>), but twigs varied less in the dry season and more in the late rainy/early dry season than main stems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s017">Tables S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s018">S7</xref>).</p>
<p>For trees at drier sites to invest more carbon in ant defenders even when they face a greater risk of carbon starvation, the cost of leaf herbivory must be higher than the cost of ant defenders. To investigate when this is the case, we modeled the indirect carbon trading between trees and ants, via scale insects and leaf defense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g001">Figure 1</xref>), in rainy seasons of different length. We compared two models, an “insurance” model in which ants protect trees from rare and extreme events of herbivory, and a “chronic herbivory” model, in which ants protect trees from sustained herbivory throughout each rainy season. In the insurance model, extreme defoliation forces the tree to produce new foliage, which costs the tree time for photosynthesis, whereas in the chronic-herbivory model, herbivory reduces the equilibrium leaf area for the duration of the rainy season. In both models, we concentrate on the cost of sustaining an ant colony during the rainy season, when colonies grow and reproduce, rather than during the dry season, when they do not (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s019">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>The insurance model predicted, as we observed, that shorter rainy seasons led to stronger mutualism by means of smaller tree carbon pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), more carbohydrate allocated to ants by trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), and larger ant colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) that use more of their tree-provided carbon to produce defending ant workers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, this model is consistent with recent demonstrations that ants are costly to plants at short timescales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Frederickson1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Stanton1">[28]</xref> because the relevant selective events shaping the mutualism (i.e., complete defoliation) are predicted to be catastrophic and rare (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s009">Figure S9</xref>). In the insurance model, mutualism strength can increase with water limitation even if the probability of defoliation decreases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s009">Figures S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s010">S10</xref>). The chronic herbivory model predicted, contrary to what we observed, that rainy-season length alone had no effect on mutualism strength, and that mutualism strength should decrease with water limitation if the rate of defoliation also decreases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s019">Text S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s011">Figure S11</xref>). The difference in the predictions of the two models can be explained by the timescale of herbivory relative to rainy-season length. In the chronic herbivory model, ant defense benefits the tree more when the rainy season is longer, because the leaf area saved from herbivory has longer to produce more total carbon. In contrast, in the insurance model, ant defense benefits the tree more when the rainy season is shorter, because the time necessary for leaf replacement following complete defoliation is a greater proportion of the total rainy season. Therefore, according to the insurance model, trees exposed to the risk of extreme herbivory should invest more in their ant defenders when there is less time each year to produce vital carbon.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mutualistic interactions should be stronger under resource-poor conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Thrall1">[1]</xref>, but empirical support for this prediction has been restricted to mutualisms whose currency of exchange is the limiting resource itself. In this study, we have shown that the strength of an ant–plant mutualism increases with water stress across 26 sites spanning 2,300 km of Mesoamerican seasonal forests. These data are consistent with previous studies of other ant–plant mutualisms, suggesting a positive link between water stress and mutualism strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Kersch1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-GonzlezTeuber1">[10]</xref>. Our results indicate both that these changes result from increased carbon stress on plants in drier sites and that such plants invest more carbon in their ant defenders when faced with the risk of extreme herbivory. We suggest that an abiotic variable, precipitation, and a biotic variable, herbivory, together drive macroscale patterns in the strength of a plant–animal mutualism by means of indirect effects on plant carbon availability.</p>
<p>Extreme drought causes large-scale tree mortality in the tropics via physiological mechanisms that depend on feedback between carbon shortages and hydraulic failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-McDowell3">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Phillips1">[30]</xref>. The seasonal trends that we detected in <italic>C. alliodora</italic> NSC pools are comparable to those reported from a dry forest in Panama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Wrth1">[25]</xref>. However, in contrast to the previous study, we detected significant reductions in starch and higher sucrose∶starch ratios in main stems in the late dry season at our drier site (where annual precipitation is ∼1,000 mm lower than in Panama). This suggests that even in the absence of drought (precipitation in 2008 preceding our late-dry-season measurements was higher than average at the Chamela site; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), trees at drier sites are water stressed during the dry season, which reduces starch pools and increases the risk of carbon starvation. Years of extreme drought may thus create intense selective pressure for trees to produce sufficient carbon during the rainy season; such pressure should also lead to increased investment in leaf defense. A study of variation in hydraulic traits among three populations of <italic>C. alliodora</italic> found that trees from drier sites were significantly more resistant to drought-induced embolism than trees from wetter sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Choat1">[31]</xref>. Resistance to embolism is often a genetic trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Choat1">[31]</xref>, so <italic>C. alliodora</italic> hydraulic traits may have adapted to local water availability, despite high gene flow across the tree's range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Petit1">[32]</xref>. An interesting and unanswered question is whether and how selection may also act on tree carbon-allocation traits.</p>
<p>How do trees alter their carbon investment in ant defenders in this system? Colonies of <italic>A. pittieri</italic> ants are not limited by nesting space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle2">[19]</xref>, and trees do not produce food rewards directly. We hypothesize that trees can indirectly alter their investment by changing phloem chemistry, which affects scale-insect success and attractiveness to ants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Berenbaum1">[33]</xref>,). Direct evidence for such a plant strategy in any system is scarce, but it is almost certainly true that myrmecophytic plants have evolved defenses against scale insects, given that nearly 90% of symbiotic ant–plant systems also contain ant-tended scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Davidson1">[35]</xref>. Indeed, the ubiquity of these associations suggests that scales play a key role in the evolution of ant–plant symbioses, perhaps by providing ants with nutrients that are scarce in the plants themselves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Douglas1">[36]</xref>. Phloem may contain few of the secondary metabolites typically associated with plant defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Douglas2">[37]</xref>, but studies of phloem chemistry are extremely limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Douglas1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Douglas2">[37]</xref>, and primary metabolites should be particularly effective in defense against sedentary insects, such as scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Berenbaum1">[33]</xref>. The quality of honeydew that ants receive is closely related to phloem quality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Douglas2">[37]</xref>, so ants should be able to detect and respond to changes in phloem content. Previous work in other systems has shown that hemipterans respond to phloem nutrient content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Berenbaum1">[33]</xref> and that plant genotype determines honeydew attractiveness to ants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Mooney1">[34]</xref>. Thus, although ants may directly control the number of scale insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle2">[19]</xref>, decisions about how many scales to tend could be driven by the quality of honeydew that the ants receive. Future work is needed to clarify the roles of constitutive and induced defenses in plant phloem, and of the possible effects on ant behavior.</p>
<p>Our finding that ants are better defenders at drier sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s005">Figure S5</xref>) suggests positive mutualistic feedback from the ants in response to an increased supply of tree carbon at drier sites. Although ant colonies tended more scales at drier sites, ants did not increase their own fitness at the tree's expense: colonies produced more sterile workers that defend plants, not more female reproductives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s016">Table S5</xref>). These changes in ant life-history strategies and behavior could be ecological, or ants may genetically adapt to local conditions. Local adaptation is facilitated by restricted gene flow, and unlike their host trees, <italic>A. pittieri</italic> ants exhibit pronounced genetic structure in Mesoamerica <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle1">[18]</xref>. Consistent with the possibility that genetic lineages of <italic>A. pittieri</italic> are locally adapted, northern and southern <italic>A. pittieri</italic> lineages do not overlap in their precipitation niches, and genetic divergence does not correspond simply to isolation by distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle1">[18]</xref>. The next step will be to ask whether ant defensive behaviors exhibit phylogenetic patterns consistent with local adaptation of mutualistic strategy.</p>
<p>We have focused here on the apparent role of carbon in regulating the mutualistic exchange between trees and ants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Two alternative hypotheses to explain the negative relationship between scale-insect abundance and annual precipitation deserve consideration. First, water availability could have independent, direct effects on both plants and ants. If ants are directly water stressed, they might tend more scales to obtain water at drier sites. Our results indicate that this is unlikely, because ant-colony size and the number of scale insects increased concomitantly with water stress, such that ants at drier sites actually tended fewer scale insects per ant (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). Second, a currency besides carbon could regulate ant–plant mutualistic exchange. For example, ants can provide plants with nitrogen and other nutrients (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Defossez1">[38]</xref>), and arboreal ants may themselves be nitrogen-limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Davidson2">[39]</xref>. We have suggested previously that <italic>A. pittieri</italic> ants obtain their nitrogen primarily from dead insects and guano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle2">[19]</xref>, sources that could vary substantially among sites. Arguing against a key role for nutrients other than carbon, however, is that our data have consistently shown nonsignificant differences in nutrient content of both plants and ants between sites (Figures S3 and S8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s014">Table S3</xref>). Nitrogen-isotope data showed that ants at different sites were trophically indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The <sup>15</sup>N-to-<sup>14</sup>N isotope ratio was higher at our drier site than at our wetter site, a difference that may be driven either by precipitation regime <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Schuur1">[40]</xref> or by other factors, such as soil sources and associated microbial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Robinson1">[41]</xref>. The result relevant to our study, however, is that the relative increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001705.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from plants to scale insects to worker ants was constant among sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s003">Figure S3</xref>), which indicates that differential nitrogen limitation does not drive geographic variation in ant behavior in this system.</p>
<p>Recent research has indicated that ant colonies require much more carbohydrate than protein for colony growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Wilder1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Dussutour1">[43]</xref>. An open question is whether differences between sites in scale-insect diversity, and consequent differences in overall honeydew composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Dhami1">[44]</xref>, can alter ant behavior. <italic>Cryptostigma</italic> spp. and <italic>Paraputo</italic> spp. are the most abundant scale-insect genera tended by <italic>A. pittieri</italic> throughout Mesoamerica <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Pringle2">[19]</xref>, but honeydew chemistry can be species-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Dhami1">[44]</xref>, and this deserves attention in future studies. Whatever the chemical differences in honeydew between sites, however, ants received significantly more carbohydrates at drier sites than at wetter sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001705-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Our model suggests a mechanism whereby carbon-stressed trees accrue a fitness advantage by this increased carbon investment in ant defenders.</p>
<p>According to our model, bet-hedging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Seger1">[45]</xref> by trees subjected to variation in growing-season length could drive the evolution of differences in carbon investment in this mutualism. Rare but extreme events should be particularly important selective agents in long-lived organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Gutschick1">[46]</xref>. Our results indicate that infrequent and extreme herbivory, as opposed to chronic, low-level herbivory, best explains the evolution of tree and ant mutualistic strategies in different precipitation regimes. In drier habitats, trees sustain the moderate cost of the symbiosis with ants and scales to avoid the potentially high cost of extreme herbivory. The importance of extreme herbivory to the evolution of symbiotic ant–plant mutualisms was previously proposed in an African system where elephants occasionally tear down entire trees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Stanton1">[28]</xref>. In contrast, insects are the primary herbivores in our system. Outbreaks of herbivorous insects are better documented in temperate forests than in tropical ones, but such events are also important in the tropics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-VanBael1">[47]</xref>. Indeed, although relatively low herbivory of <italic>C. alliodora</italic> is typical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001705.s009">Figure S9</xref>), we have also observed occasional complete defoliation of some trees at our study sites over the past six years. We propose that although extreme herbivore outbreaks are rare, such events will occur at least once within the lifetime of a long-lived tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Gutschick1">[46]</xref>, such as <italic>C. alliodora</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Finegan1">[48]</xref>. Further long-term studies of herbivory in the tropics are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Overall, our work suggests that the drought-induced risk of carbon starvation in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Wiley1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-McDowell2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Adams1">[17]</xref> influences the ecological outcomes of an ant–plant mutualism. Because carbon is the primary currency of plant mutualistic exchange, carbon limitation may be an important physiological mechanism mediating plant mutualistic strategies in many systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Laird1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Folgarait1">[15]</xref>. Biotic extremes that operate synergistically with abiotic extremes can produce crucial selective events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Gutschick1">[46]</xref>, and herbivore outbreaks may often coincide with extreme drought <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-VanBael1">[47]</xref> to affect plant trait evolution. It is significant that the key abiotic variable that alters interactions in this system, precipitation, is a climatic one that is likely to change dramatically over the coming years. As extreme climatic events increase in frequency with climate change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001705-Christensen1">[49]</xref>, ecological and evolutionary responses of reproductive individuals to physiological stress will drive changes in the outcomes of species interactions and ecosystem function.</p>

<p><bold>Time lag between host–plant colonization and a defensive ant colony.</bold> Ants defend against herbivores only during the rainy season when the tree has leaves. For trees to replace their ant colonies between rainy seasons, ant colonies would need to grow large enough to be active defenders within 1 year. We planted 144 two-year-old, greenhouse-grown, ant-free seedlings in the field in 2009 and followed them for the next 3 years (2010–2012), checking every 6 months whether plants had a defending colony. At the end of 3 years, 89 of the plants (62%) had survived and of these 28 (31%) had defending colonies. For these 28 plants, it took significantly longer than 12 months for colonies to become defensive (<italic>Z</italic> = −5.37, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p>
