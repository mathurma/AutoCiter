In parallel, TAP-MS studies (tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectroscopy) have been successful at identifying physical protein interactions that can indicate proteins participating in the same molecular complex. Here, we propose a method for the joint learning of protein complexes and their functional relationships by integration of quantitative genetic interactions and TAP-MS data. Using 3 independent benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that this method is &gt;50% more accurate at identifying functionally related protein pairs than previous approaches. Application to genes involved in yeast chromosome organization identifies a functional map of 91 multimeric complexes, a number of which are novel or have been substantially expanded by addition of new subunits. Interestingly, we find that complexes that are enriched for aggravating genetic interactions (i.e., synthetic lethality) are more likely to contain essential genes, linking each of these interactions to an underlying mechanism. These results demonstrate the importance of both large-scale genetic and physical interaction data in mapping pathway architecture and function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Biologists are currently producing large amounts of data focused on physical and genetic protein interactions. Physical interactions dictate the architecture of the cell in terms of how direct associations between molecules constitute protein complexes, while genetic interactions define functional relationships through cause-and-effect relationships between genes. Both of these types of interactions can indicate shared protein functions; however, these two types of interactions are commonly non-overlapping, making their interpretation difficult. Along these lines, it has been noted that genetic interactions commonly occur between members of the same protein complex as well as between functionally related complexes. Here, we present an integrated framework that incorporates both types of interactions to generate large maps of protein complexes as well as highlight connections between related complexes. The ability to rapidly integrate these two types of data in an automated fashion can accelerate the discovery of new members of protein complexes as well as identify functionally related cellular components.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (ES14811), the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (GM070743), and a Sandler Family Fellowship.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic interactions are logical relationships between genes that occur when mutating two or more genes in combination produces an unexpected phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Avery1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Hereford1">[3]</xref>.

A recent variant of SGA termed E-MAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Schuldiner2">[9]</xref> has made it possible to measure continuous rates of growth with varying degrees of epistasis (based on imaging of colony sizes). “Aggravating” interactions are indicated if the growth rate of the double gene deletion is slower than expected, while for “alleviating” interactions the opposite is true <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Drees1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-StOnge1">[11]</xref>.</p><p>One popular method to analyze genetic interaction data has been to hierarchically cluster genes using the distance between their genetic interaction profiles. Clusters of genes with similar profiles are manually searched to identify the known pathways and complexes they contain as well as any genetic interactions between these complexes. This approach has been applied to several large-scale genetic interaction screens in yeast including genes involved in the secretory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Schuldiner1">[8]</xref> and chromosome organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Collins1">[6]</xref>. Segré et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Segre1">[12]</xref> extended basic hierarchical clustering with the concept of “monochromaticity”, in which genes were merged into the same cluster based on minimizing the number of interactions with other clusters that do not share the same classification (aggravating or alleviating).</p><p>Another set of methods has sought to interpret genetic relationships using physical protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Beyer1">[13]</xref>. Among these, Kelley and Ideker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Kelley1">[14]</xref> used physical interactions to identify both “within-module” and “between-module” explanations for genetic interactions. In both cases, modules were detected as clusters of proteins that physically interact with each other more often than expected by chance. The “within-module” model predicts that these clusters directly overlap with clusters of genetic interactions. The “between-module” model predicts that genetic interactions run between two physical clusters that are functionally related. This approach was improved by Ulitsky <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Ulitsky1">[15]</xref> using a relaxed definition of physical modules. In related work, Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Zhang1">[16]</xref> screened known complexes annotated by the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) to identify pairs of complexes with dense genetic interactions between them.</p><p>One concern with the above approaches, and the works by Kelley and Ulitsky in particular, is that they make assumptions about the density of interactions within and between modules which have not been justified biologically. Ideally, such parameters should be learned directly from the data. Second, between-module relationships are identified by separate, independent searches of the network seeded from each genetic interaction. This “local” search strategy can lead to a set of modules that are highly overlapping or even completely redundant with one another. Finally, genetic interactions are assumed to be binary growth/no growth events while E-MAP technology has now made it possible to measure continuous values of genetic interaction with varying degrees of epistasis. Here, we present a new approach for integrating quantitative genetic and physical interaction data which addresses several of these shortcomings. Interactions are analyzed to infer a set of modules and a set of inter-module links, in which a module represents a protein complex with a coherent cellular function, and inter-module links capture functional relationships between modules which can vary quantitatively in strength and sign. Our approach is supervised, in that the appropriate pattern of physical and genetic interactions is not predetermined but learned from examples of known complexes. Rather than identify each module in independent searches, all modules are identified simultaneously within a single unified map of modules and inter-module functional relationships. We show that this method outperforms a number of alternative approaches and that, when applied to analyze a recent EMAP study of yeast chromosome function, it identifies numerous new protein complexes and protein functional relationships.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of Genetic and Physical Networks</title><p>We first sought to quantitatively confirm whether, and to what degree, physical and genetic interactions could indicate common membership in a protein complex. To provide genetic data for analysis, we obtained the previously-published results from a large E-MAP of yeast chromosomal biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Collins1">[6]</xref>. This study consisted of genetic interactions measured among 743 genes (including 74 essential genes), yielding quantitative values for 182,669 gene pairs (66% of all possible pair-wise measurements). Each gene pair was assigned an S-score, where positive scores indicate protein pairs for which the double mutant grows better than expected (i.e., an alleviating interaction) and negative scores indicate pairs for which the double mutant grows worse than expected (i.e., a synthetic sick/lethal or aggravating interaction) where the expectation is that the double-deletion of unrelated proteins will have a growth rate equivalent to the multiplicative product of the two individual growth rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Phillips1">[17]</xref>.

By comparing the magnitudes of enrichment between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000065-g001">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>, it is apparent that extreme S-scores are at least as indicative of co-complex membership as strong PE-scores, if not more so (∼100-fold enrichment versus ∼50-fold enrichment, respectively). Together, these exploratory findings suggest that the physical and genetic information can indeed provide a basis for the identification of protein pairs involved in the same complex.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000065-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000065.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Combining physical and genetic interactions to define protein complexes.</title><p>Correspondence of the physical interaction score (A) and the genetic interaction score (B) with the known small-scale, manually annotated protein complexes in MIPS.

For the modules defined by each method, accuracy versus coverage is plotted over a range of values for tuning the module size (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Accuracy is estimated as the fraction of protein pairs in a predicted module that are in a gold-standard set; coverage is estimated as the number of gold-standard pairs that fall in the same predicted module.

To investigate this possibility, we extended HCL to incorporate physical interactions in a straightforward fashion, by merging only those clusters which share a physical interaction between them (HCL-PE). Although this approach outperformed hierarchical clustering without physical interactions, it was outperformed by the present approach by at least 50% across the three metrics.

Identification of “alleviating” modules is expected, since subunits of a complex operate together and the phenotypic effect of removing any pair of proteins in a complex should be no worse than removing any single protein individually. The presence of aggravating interactions within modules was more intriguing. One way in which aggravating interactions could occur among the subunits of a complex is if its function is essential, i.e., the loss of the complex's function causes a lethal phenotype. In these cases, some protein subunits should be encoded by essential genes, while other subunits might be redundant and thus essential in pairwise combinations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Boone1">[20]</xref>.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that essential genes are more likely in aggravating modules, we analyzed both MIPS small-scale complexes and our learned modules for the presence of essential genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000065-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We found that 80% of aggravating MIPS complexes contained an essential gene, compared to only 20% of alleviating MIPS complexes (a four-fold increase). Similarly, of the aggravating modules determined by our approach, 55% contained an essential gene compared to only 21% of alleviating modules (a 2.6-fold increase). These results are not correlated with module size, as the median size of aggravating learned modules is less than the median size of alleviating learned modules. They suggest that, regardless of the technique for identifying complexes, those containing essential genes tend to be composed of primarily aggravating genetic interactions. Mechanistically, this might occur through a variety of means, including proteins with separate but functionally redundant roles in maintaining complex integrity, or subunit substitution by paralogous proteins.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000065-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000065.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Aggravating complexes are more likely to contain essential genes.</title><p>The percentage of complexes that contain at least one essential gene is shown, for various groups of complexes defined within small-scale complexes in MIPS (left three bars) or complexes identified in this study (right three bars).

RAD6-C is functionally connected with two other complexes, SWR-C and COMPASS.

Interactions between RAD6-C and SWR are aggravating, suggesting synergy or redundancy towards an essential cellular function. Interactions between RAD6-C and COMPASS are alleviating, suggesting they operate in a potentially serial fashion.

First, genetic interaction data alone can yield substantial information about molecular pathways. Functionally similar proteins often have similar profiles of genetic interaction, a feature we have previously exploited to identify functional interactions between complexes as well as to identify new members of complexes based on a combination of weak physical and genetic data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Kelley1">[14]</xref>. On the other hand, the ability to detect complexes can be greatly improved by adding information about protein physical interactions. Even the straightforward HCL-PE method was able to greatly improve the accuracy and coverage according to most metrics, while the greatest performance was achieved by the improved probabilistic framework we have presented in this study. This framework has led to the inclusion of YKL023W as a potential new member of the SKI complex and YGR071C in a complex with VID22/TBF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000065-g002">Figure 2</xref>), for a total of 84 novel protein subunit assignments to complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000065.s003">Dataset S1</xref>). Both of these examples have both physical and genetic support and would have been missed by an approach based on either type of interaction alone.</p><p>Future work may seek to incorporate yet additional types of linkages such as protein-DNA interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Berger1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Harbison1">[35]</xref>, kinase-substrate phosphorylations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Ptacek1">[36]</xref>, or other genetic perturbation data such as eQTLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000065-Brem1">[37]</xref>. There are also opportunities to refine the modeling framework further. Here, a gold-standard set of complexes was used to explicitly learn the relationship between physical interactions, genetic interactions, and module membership. This supervised approach could be extended to also learn which features best indicate the inter-module functional relationships, perhaps through curation of a gold-standard set of interacting complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Problem Definition</title><p>We analyze the interaction data to infer <italic>a set of protein modules</italic> and <italic>a set of inter-module links</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000065-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).
