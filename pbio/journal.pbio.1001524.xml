        <p>In yeast and humans, interaction of a nuclear pore protein with promoters alters chromatin structure and allows RNA polymerase II to bind, poising them for faster reactivation for several generations.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The interaction of nuclear pore proteins (Nups) with active genes can promote their transcription. In yeast, some inducible genes interact with the nuclear pore complex both when active and for several generations after being repressed, a phenomenon called epigenetic transcriptional memory. This interaction promotes future reactivation and requires Nup100, a homologue of human Nup98. A similar phenomenon occurs in human cells; for at least four generations after treatment with interferon gamma (IFN-γ), many IFN-γ-inducible genes are induced more rapidly and more strongly than in cells that have not previously been exposed to IFN-γ. In both yeast and human cells, the recently expressed promoters of genes with memory exhibit persistent dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) and physically interact with Nups and a poised form of RNA polymerase II. However, in human cells, unlike yeast, these interactions occur in the nucleoplasm. In human cells transiently depleted of Nup98 or yeast cells lacking Nup100, transcriptional memory is lost; RNA polymerase II does not remain associated with promoters, H3K4me2 is lost, and the rate of transcriptional reactivation is reduced. These results suggest that Nup100/Nup98 binding to recently expressed promoters plays a conserved role in promoting epigenetic transcriptional memory.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cells respond to changes in nutrients or signaling molecules by altering the expression of genes. The rate at which genes are turned on is not uniform; some genes are induced rapidly and others are induced slowly. In brewer's yeast, previous experience can enhance the rate at which genes are turned on again, a phenomenon called “transcriptional memory.” After repression, such genes physically interact with the nuclear pore complex, leading to altered chromatin structure and binding of a poised RNA polymerase II. Human genes that are induced by interferon gamma show a similar behavior. In both cases, the phenomenon persists through several cell divisions, suggesting that it is epigenetically inherited. Here, we find that yeast and human cells utilize a similar molecular mechanism to prime genes for reactivation. In both species, the nuclear pore protein Nup100/Nup98 binds to the promoters of genes that exhibit transcriptional memory. This leads to an altered chromatin state in the promoter and binding of RNA polymerase II, poising genes for future expression. We conclude that both unicellular and multicellular organisms use nuclear pore proteins in a novel way to alter transcription based on previous experiences.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a conserved macromolecular structure that mediates the essential transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Suntharalingam1">[1]</xref>. The NPC is an 8-fold symmetric channel derived from ∼30 proteins associated with cytoplasmic filaments and a nucleoplasmic “basket” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Rout1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Alber1">[3]</xref>. Natively unstructured NPC proteins rich in phenylalanine-glycine repeats line the channel of the NPC and interactions of these proteins with transport factors facilitates selective transport of proteins and mRNPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Rout1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Aitchison1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Hulsmann1">[6]</xref>. Proteins that make up the basket-like structure on the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC and the fibrils on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC play key roles in regulating nuclear transport and mRNP remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Aitchison1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Murphy1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Nuclear pore proteins also physically interact with chromatin to regulate transcription of certain genes. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, many active genes physically interact with nuclear pore proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brown1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Casolari2">[11]</xref>. Interaction with the NPC has been proposed to promote stronger transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Kalverda1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Capelson1">[16]</xref>, to mediate epigenetic regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Guan1">[19]</xref>, to promote chromatin boundary activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Ishii1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Kalverda2">[21]</xref>, and to provide negative feedback in signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Green1">[22]</xref>. However, the exact biochemical nature of these roles, their generality, and their conservation is unclear.</p>
      <p>In yeast, some of the inducible genes that relocate from the nucleoplasm to the NPC upon activation [such as <italic>GAL1</italic> (GenBank Accession CAA84962.1) and <italic>INO1</italic> (GenBank Accession CAA89448.1)] remain at the nuclear periphery for multiple generations after repression, a phenomenon called epigenetic transcriptional memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner2">[17]</xref>. The persistent association of genes with the NPC is not associated with transcription, but promotes faster reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-TanWong1">[23]</xref>. In the case of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes, this leads to significantly faster reactivation compared with activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Kundu1">[24]</xref>. This is not always true; in the case of the <italic>INO1</italic> gene, perhaps because of the rate at which cells sense the activating signal (inositol starvation) during reactivation, the rate of reactivation is slower than the rate of activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>. However, interaction with the NPC after repression specifically promotes <italic>INO1</italic> reactivation because when it is lost, the rate of reactivation is slowed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Active <italic>INO1</italic> and recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> interact with the NPC by distinct mechanisms. Interaction of active <italic>INO1</italic> with the NPC involves <italic>cis</italic>-acting “DNA zip codes” called gene recruitment sequences (GRSs) in the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Ahmed1">[15]</xref>. Interaction of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> with the NPC is independent of the GRSs and requires a different zip code called a memory recruitment sequence (MRS), as well as the histone variant H2A.Z (GenBank Accession CAA99011.1) and the nuclear pore protein Nup100 (GenBank Accession CAA81905.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>, which is homologous to Nup98 in metazoa. Whereas GRS-mediated interaction of active <italic>INO1</italic> with the NPC promotes stronger transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Ahmed1">[15]</xref>, MRS-mediated interaction of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> with the NPC promotes incorporation of H2A.Z into the promoter and allows RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to bind, poising the gene for future reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>. Mutations in the MRS, loss of H2A.Z, or loss of Nup100 specifically block interaction of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> with the NPC, leading to loss of RNAPII from the recently repressed promoter and slower reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>. However, these mutations have no effect on the rate of initial activation or the ultimate steady-state levels of <italic>INO1</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-TanWong1">[23]</xref>. Thus, the interaction of genes with the NPC can both promote stronger expression and, by a distinct mechanism, poise recently repressed genes for future reactivation.</p>
      <p>Stress-inducible genes utilize a related type of transcriptional memory. Previous exposure of yeast cells to high salt leads to faster activation of many genes induced by oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Guan1">[19]</xref>. Similar to <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory, this effect persists for four to five generations, suggesting that salt stress establishes an epigenetic change that promotes the rate of activation of these genes. The faster rate of activation of these genes is dependent on the NPC protein Nup42 (GenBank Accession EEU07798.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Guan1">[19]</xref>. MEME analysis of the promoters of 77 genes exhibiting stress-induced transcriptional memory identified a DNA element very similar to the <italic>INO1</italic> MRS element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Guan1">[19]</xref>. <italic>GAL</italic> gene transcriptional memory has been suggested to depend on the NPC-associated protein Mlp1 (GenBank Accession CAA82174.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-TanWong1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Philippe1">[25]</xref>. Therefore, although there are some gene-specific features, aspects of the molecular mechanism of <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory are shared by diverse yeast genes.</p>
      <p>Nuclear pore proteins also interact with metazoan genes to promote their transcription. Inhibiting histone deacetylase activity using trichostatin A in human cells leads to derepression of hundreds of genes, many of which physically interact with the NPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brown1">[8]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, nuclear pore proteins interact with the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus, the X chromosome in male flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Kurshakova1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Vaquerizas1">[28]</xref>, and genome-wide, thousands of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Kalverda1">[9]</xref>. However, in metazoans, some nuclear pore proteins localize both at the NPC and in the nucleoplasm and genes that interact with nuclear pore proteins can localize either at the nuclear periphery or in the nucleoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Capelson1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Rabut1">[29]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, of the 18,878 genes that interact with the nuclear pore protein Nup98, 3,810 interacted exclusively with NPC-associated Nup98 and 11,307 interacted exclusively with nucleoplasmic Nup98 (GenBank Accession NP_651187.2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Kalverda1">[9]</xref>. As in yeast, the interaction of genes with nuclear pore proteins also promotes transcription in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Kalverda1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Capelson1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we sought to explore the role of nuclear pore interactions with genes in promoting transcriptional memory in humans. HeLa cells treated with IFN-γ show much faster and stronger expression of certain target genes if they have previously encountered IFN-γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Boehm1">[30]</xref>. This effect persists for up to four cell divisions (96 h), suggesting that it is epigenetically inherited through mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gialitakis1">[31]</xref>. This phenomenon is also associated with changes in chromatin structure; dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) remains associated with the promoter of the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-inducible gene <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> for up to 96 h after treatment with IFN-γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gialitakis1">[31]</xref>. Here, we have determined the scope of IFN-γ transcriptional memory in human cells and compared it with the molecular mechanisms of <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory in yeast. Hundreds of the genes that are induced by IFN-γ exhibit transcriptional memory. Following expression, yeast and human genes that exhibit transcriptional memory are marked by H3K4me2 and associate with both a poised RNAPII and Nup100/Nup98 (GenBank Accession AAH12906.2) for up to four generations. Loss of Nup100 in yeast, or transient knockdown of Nup98 in HeLa cells, leads to loss of RNAPII and H3K4me2 from recently expressed promoters and a slower rate of reactivation of genes that exhibit memory. Thus, Nup100/Nup98 is required for epigenetic transcriptional memory, a mechanism conserved from yeast to humans.</p>

To explore the nature of RNAPII that is associated with the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter, we monitored the association of preinitiation complex (PIC) components before, during, and after expression of <italic>INO1</italic>. We performed ChIP using strains expressing Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP)-tagged components of TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, TFIIH, TFIIK, TFIIS, and Mediator from cells grown in long-term repressing (+inositol), activating (−inositol), or recently repressed (−ino→+ino, 3 h) conditions. None of these PIC components bound to the long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). However, like RNAPII, the PIC components TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH bound to the promoter both when the gene was active and after repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, three PIC components interacted with the active promoter, but not the recently repressed promoter: the TFIIK component Kin28 (GenBank Accession CAA64904.1, the kinase that phosphorylates serine 5 on the CTD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Rodriguez1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Feaver1">[33]</xref>, the TFIIS component Ctk1 (GenBank Accession CAA81980.1, the kinase that phosphorylates serine 2 on the CTD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Lee1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Myers1">[36]</xref>, and the Mediator component Gal11 (GenBank Accession CAA99056.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Dotson1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Myers1">[36]</xref>.

Together, these results suggest that a novel, partially assembled PIC associates with the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter.

        <p>We used ChIP to examine the association of RNAPII with the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter before (uninduced), during (induced), or at various times after treatment with IFN-γ [48 h (∼2 cell divisions) and 96 h (∼4 cell divisions) postinduction]. Prior to IFN-γ treatment, RNAPII was not associated with the promoter or the coding sequence of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> and <italic>CIITA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This is consistent with the undetectable levels of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> and <italic>CIITA</italic> mRNA before IFN-γ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). During IFN-γ treatment, RNAPII associated strongly with the promoter and the coding sequence of both <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> and <italic>CIITA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). After removing IFN-γ, RNAPII remained associated with the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter, but not the coding sequence, for up to 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). RNAPII did not associate with <italic>CIITA</italic> after removing IFN-γ and the levels of RNAPII associated with <italic>GAPDH</italic> (GenBank Accession AAH83511.1) promoter and coding sequence were consistent under all three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> memory correlates with persistent RNAPII binding to the previously induced promoter through at least four cell divisions.</p>
        <p>Following treatment of cells with IFN-γ, the signaling and transcriptional response can persist even after washing, presumably because of persistent association of IFN-γ with the IFN-γ receptor and signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s002">Figure S2A and B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Choi1">[37]</xref>. For this reason, we trypsinized and split the cells after removing IFN-γ in all of our experiments, which leads to the levels of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> mRNA returning to baseline levels within 6 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Likewise, treatment of HeLa cells with IFN-γ immediately after trypsinizing did not result in expression of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), suggesting that trypsin digestion blocks IFN-γ signaling. Thus, the association of RNAPII with the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter is not due to persistent expression. This is consistent with loss of RNAPII from the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> coding sequence after removing IFN-γ and splitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also tested if previous expression of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> is necessary for transcriptional memory. Exposure of cells to IFN-γ for 2 h, followed by splitting the cells, does not result in significant <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). However, this brief exposure to IFN-γ is sufficient to induce a faster rate of reactivation 48 h later (∼2 cell divisions; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Thus, previous expression of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> is not necessary to induce future transcriptional memory.</p>
        <p>In metazoans, transcription is regulated both by blocking RNAPII recruitment and by blocking RNAPII elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Core1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Esnault1">[42]</xref>. In the latter case, RNAPII binds to the promoter, initiates transcription, and then pauses at the 5′ end of the gene due to regulation by negative elongation factor (NELF; GenBank Accession AAI10499.1) and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF; GenBank Accession BAA24075.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gilchrist1">[43]</xref>. This paused RNAPII is phosphorylated on Ser5 of the CTD, but unphosphorylated on Ser2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Core1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Komarnitsky1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Sims1">[45]</xref>. Transcription of such genes is stimulated by recruitment of the kinase P-TEFb, which phosphorylates Ser2 and allows elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Peterlin1">[46]</xref>. In yeast, ChIP using a monoclonal anti-phospho serine 5 antibody (mAb 4h8) recovers active, but not recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We performed ChIP using mAb 4h8 to ask if the RNAPII associated with the previously expressed <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter is postinitiation or preinitiation. Ser5 phosphorylated RNAPII bound to the active <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter in cells exposed to IFN-γ, but not with the previously expressed <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter after removal of IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, similar to yeast <italic>INO1</italic>, the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter associates with a preinitiation form of RNAPII for several cell divisions after removing IFN-γ.</p>

        <p>Cluster 1 includes 218 genes that were modestly induced during activation and more strongly induced during reactivation (see average behavior in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This cluster was strongly enriched for genes involved in inflammation and genes regulated by infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s012">Table S3</xref>). Cluster 2 includes 403 genes that were induced equivalently during activation and reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This cluster was enriched for GO terms associated with innate immunity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s013">Table S4</xref>). Cluster 3 includes 42 of the most strongly induced genes that were, nonetheless, induced more rapidly during reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This cluster includes <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, arrow) and was highly enriched for GO terms associated with cytokine signaling generally and IFN-γ signaling in particular (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s014">Table S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Many of the genes in Cluster 1 and most of the genes in Cluster 3 displayed mRNA profiles consistent with transcriptional memory. We analyzed genes from each of these clusters by RT qPCR to confirm this behavior. The Cluster 1 gene <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic> (GenBank Accession AAA59770.1) and the Cluster 3 genes <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> (GenBank Accession AAA59837.1) and <italic>OAS2</italic> (GenBank Accession AAH10625.1) displayed significantly faster and/or stronger activation in cells previously exposed to IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s005">Figure S5B</xref>–D). <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic> and <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> encode the HLA class II histocompatibility antigen DQα and DPβ chains, respectively, and <italic>OAS2</italic> encodes a 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Volpi1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Marie1">[52]</xref>. However, the clustering algorithm did not result in perfect segregation of genes with memory from genes without memory; the gene <italic>CIITA</italic>, which does not exhibit obvious transcriptional memory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s005">Figure S5A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gialitakis1">[31]</xref>, was within Cluster 1. Regardless, these results suggest that a large subset of the genes induced by IFN-γ exhibit stronger or more rapid induction in response to IFN-γ if the cells have been previously exposed to IFN-γ.</p>
        <p>To test if other genes that exhibit memory are regulated by the same mechanism as <italic>HLA-DRA</italic>, we used ChIP against RNAPII and Nup98 before, during, and after IFN-γ treatment. Both RNAPII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s005">Figure S5E</xref>) and Nup98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) bound to the promoters of <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic>, <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic>, and <italic>OAS2</italic> for up to 96 h (∼4 cell divisions) after removing IFN-γ. Neither RNAPII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s005">Figure S5E</xref>) nor Nup98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) bound to the coding sequences of these genes after removal of IFN-γ.

        <title>Transcriptional Memory in Yeast and Humans Is Associated with Changes in Histone H3 Methylation</title>
        <p>Transcriptional memory in yeast and humans is associated with changes in chromatin.

        <title>Dimethylation of Histone H3 Lysine 4 Is Required for <italic>INO1</italic> Transcriptional Memory</title>
        <p>We next asked if the machinery responsible for methylation of H3K4 was required for other aspects of <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory; namely, poised RNAPII association and localization at the nuclear periphery after repression. In yeast strains lacking either the histone methyltransferase Set1 (GenBank Accession AAB68867.1) or E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6 (GenBank Accession CAA96761.1), all di- and tri-methylation of H3K4 is lost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Dover1">[55]</xref>. Loss of these enzymes did not affect the localization of active <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) or interaction of RNAPII with active <italic>INO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). However, loss of either Set1 or Rad6 specifically disrupted both localization of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and RNAPII binding to the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that H3K4me2 at the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter is required for <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory.</p>
        <p>The MRS is necessary for both incorporation of H2A.Z <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref> and the persistent dimethylation of H3K4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) at the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter. Integration of the MRS at ectopic sites is sufficient to induce H2A.Z deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, we asked if the MRS was also sufficient to induce dimethylation of H3K4 at an ectopic locus. We performed ChIP against H3K4me2 in a strain in which either the MRS or the nonfunctional <italic>mrs</italic> mutant was integrated beside <italic>URA3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>. We observed a robust signal for H3K4me2 associated with <italic>URA3:MRS</italic> but not with <italic>URA3:mrsmut</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) or a control locus (the coding sequence of the repressed gene <italic>PRM1</italic>; not shown). We also observed a small but reproducible increase in H3K4me3 at <italic>URA3:MRS</italic> compared with <italic>URA3:mrsmut</italic>, although this level was significantly lower than the level associated with the active <italic>INO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). Therefore, the MRS is sufficient to induce both H2A.Z incorporation and dimethylation of H3K4, recapitulating the chromatin changes associated with <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory.</p>
        <p>Loss of H2A.Z or H3K4 dimethylation leads to loss of <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory and both of these modifications require the MRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>. We next asked if the methylation of H3K4 at the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter required H2A.Z. In wild-type and <italic>htz1</italic>Δ strains, we observed similar levels of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s006">Figure S6D</xref>) and H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5F</xref>) at the active and recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter. Therefore, dimethylation of H3K4 at the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter requires the MRS, but not H2A.Z. Furthermore, although strains lacking H2A.Z show slower <italic>INO1</italic> reactivation kinetics, loss of peripheral localization of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic>, and loss of RNAPII from the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter after repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>, the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter is still marked by H3K4me2. This suggests that dimethylation of H3K4 occurs upstream of, or independent of, H2A.Z deposition to promote <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory.</p>

        <p>Knockdown of Nup98 had no apparent effect on RNAPII binding to active <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), on the rate of initial activation of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), or on the association of RNAPII with the <italic>CIITA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). However, knockdown of Nup98 blocked binding of RNAPII to the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter following removal of IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and dramatically reduced the rate of reactivation of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). This suggests that Nup98 is required for <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> transcriptional memory.</p>
        <p>Because Nup98 bound to the promoters of the Cluster 1 gene <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic> and the Cluster 3 genes <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> and <italic>OAS2</italic> after removal of IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), we tested the effect of Nup98 knockdown on the transcriptional memory of these genes. Transient knockdown of Nup98 reduced the rate of reactivation of all three genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g006">Figure 6E, F, and G</xref>). In the cases of <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic> and <italic>OAS2</italic>, this effect was specific for reactivation. However, in the case of <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic>, we also observed a slower rate of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Therefore, knockdown of Nup98 affects the transcriptional memory of several human genes, although this effect may not be memory-specific in all cases.</p>
        <p>To explore the role of Nup98 in regulating chromatin structure, we asked if the dimethylation of H3K4 associated with transcriptional memory required Nup98. We performed ChIP against H3K4me2 in cells knocked down for Nup98 and quantified the enrichment of this mark at the promoters of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic>, <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic>, <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic>, <italic>OAS2</italic>, and <italic>CIITA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

        <p>To confirm that the effects of <italic>NUP98</italic> knockdown are specific, we tested the effect of knockdown of <italic>NUP107</italic>, a component of the core channel of the NPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Hoelz1">[56]</xref>, on H3K4 dimethylation of IFN-γ-inducible promoters. Using the same strategy to knockdown Nup107, the protein was effectively depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). H3K4me2 levels associated with the promoters of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic>, <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic>, <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic>, and <italic>OAS2</italic> after removal of IFN-γ remained high in the absence of Nup107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore, the effects of Nup98 knockdown on transcriptional memory were specific.</p>
        <p>We next asked if dimethylation of H3K4 at the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter requires yeast Nup100.

Cells lacking Nup100 exhibited normal trimethylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s008">Figure S8</xref>) and dimethylation of H3K4 at the active <italic>INO1</italic> promoter but did not maintain H3K4me2 at the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Therefore, in yeast and human cells, Nup98/Nup100 is required for maintenance of histone H3 dimethylation during transcriptional memory.</p>
        <p>Dimethylation of H3K4 is generally associated with the 5′ coding sequences of actively transcribed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Pokholok1">[57]</xref>.

This suggests that recognition of H3K4me2 by Set3 is required for <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we further define the molecular mechanism of <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory in yeast and demonstrate that aspects of this mechanism are conserved in human cells. Despite over a billion years of evolutionary time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Feng1">[60]</xref>, in both systems, transcriptional memory requires the interaction of the nuclear pore protein Nup98/Nup100 with recently expressed promoters. This interaction leads to (1) dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 in promoter nucleosomes, (2) binding of a preinitiation form of RNAPII, and (3) faster reactivation. Loss of Nup98 in human cells and Nup100 in yeast leads to loss of H3K4me2 and RNAPII from the recently expressed promoters and a slower rate of reactivation. Therefore, Nup98/Nup100-dependent epigenetic transcriptional memory is a conserved mechanism of transcriptional regulation in both unicellular and multicellular organisms.</p>

        <title>Transcriptional Memory Regulates Transcription Initiation</title>
        <p>Our work suggests that transcription can be regulated at three distinct stages: RNAPII recruitment, transcription initiation, and transcription elongation. In yeast, the primary mechanism by which transcription is regulated is through recruitment of RNAPII/PIC to the promoter and inducible genes tend to be devoid of RNAPII when uninduced or repressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Rhee1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Li3">[64]</xref>. However, under certain circumstances, a preinitiation form of RNAPII can associate with inactive yeast promoters. For example, in stationary phase cells, unphosphorylated RNAPII is associated with hundreds of inactive promoters, and this has been suggested to poise these genes for future activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Radonjic1">[65]</xref>. Likewise, in metazoans, transcription can be regulated both at the level of PIC assembly and after initiation, at the level of transcription elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Core1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Komarnitsky1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Phatnani1">[66]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Lis1">[68]</xref>. Promoter-proximal pausing requires NELF and DSIF and is relieved by recruitment of pTEF-b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Peterlin1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Lis2">[69]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Yamaguchi1">[70]</xref>. Brewer's yeast lacks a homologue of NELF, and there is no conclusive evidence for RNAPII pausing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Giardina1">[71]</xref>. Therefore, promoter-proximal pausing may be a metazoan-specific form of regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Li3">[64]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our results suggest that, for certain genes, the mechanism of regulation depends on the history of the cells. Transcription of such genes is regulated by either preventing RNAPII/PIC recruitment (under long-term repressing conditions) or allowing RNAPII/PIC recruitment but preventing transcription initiation (under recently repressed conditions). In the case of the <italic>INO1</italic> gene, whereas none of the PIC components bound to the long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter, most of them bound to the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This form of PIC is distinct from the PIC that associates with active <italic>INO1</italic>: TFIIK, Mediator, and TFIIS are absent and RNAPII remains unphosphorylated and fails to initiate. Thus, while the regulation of long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> prevents binding of RNAPII and the rest of the PIC, the regulation of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> occurs at a subsequent step. This suggests that the rate-limiting step in derepression is different for long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> and recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic>.</p>

        <title>Transcriptional Memory Is Epigenetically Inherited and Involves Histone Methylation</title>
        <p>In both yeast and humans, transcriptional memory is inherited through cell division. In the case of yeast, the <italic>INO1</italic> gene remains at the nuclear periphery, associated with the NPC for ∼3–4 generations (≥6 h) in both the mother and daughter cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner2">[17]</xref>. Likewise, RNAPII remains associated with the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter over the same number of generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>. HeLa cells exposed to IFN-γ exhibit faster and more robust activation of IFN-γ-inducible genes for up to ∼4 generations (96 h) after removing IFN-γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gialitakis1">[31]</xref>. Binding of RNAPII and Nup98 to, and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 over, the promoters of genes exhibiting transcriptional memory persists over the same number of generations. Therefore, the poised, preinitiation state is heritable through several generations, suggesting that it represents an epigenetic state.</p>
        <p>Changes in chromatin composition and modification are necessary for transcriptional memory and presumably allow binding of RNAPII/PIC to recently expressed promoters in yeast and humans. For genes that display transcriptional memory in both yeast and humans, histone H3 within promoter nucleosomes was unmethylated on lysine 4 prior to induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g007">7</xref>). After expression, histone H3 within promoter nucleosomes was dimethylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g007">7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gialitakis1">[31]</xref>. In human cells, this correlates with lower nucleosome occupancy of the recently expressed <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter compared with the uninduced promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gialitakis1">[31]</xref>. In yeast, a <italic>cis-</italic>acting element necessary for <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory (the MRS) was necessary for dimethylation of H3K4 after repression and insertion of the MRS at an ectopic locus is sufficient to induce both H2A.Z incorporation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref> and dimethylation of H3K4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, loss of the enzymes responsible for H3K4 methylation (Set1 or Rad6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g005">Figure 5</xref>) or recognition of H3K4me2 (Set3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g007">Figure 7</xref>) led to loss of <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory. Although it is still formally possible that Set1 methylates another protein required for transcriptional memory, the connection to the <italic>cis-</italic>acting MRS element and the requirement for Rad6 and Set3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g007">Figure 7</xref>) suggest that Set1 methylation of H3K4 is required for transcriptional memory.</p>

        <title>Nuclear Pore Proteins Affect Chromatin Structure and Promote Transcriptional Memory</title>
        <p>Binding of nuclear pore proteins to the promoters of genes impacts both their transcription and their epigenetic regulation. In yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, nuclear pore proteins interact with the promoters of active genes and this interaction is required for their full expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Kalverda1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Brickner1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Capelson1">[16]</xref>. We have found another role for these interactions. The yeast nuclear pore protein Nup100 is required for <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory and the homologous human protein Nup98 is required for IFN-γ-mediated memory.</p>
        <p>One complication of any experiment manipulating Nup98 levels is that both Nup98 and Nup96 are generated from a single transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Fontoura1">[72]</xref>. After nuclear import, this protein undergoes autocatalytic cleavage, producing two proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Rosenblum1">[73]</xref>. Indeed, knockdown of Nup98 also leads to depletion of Nup96 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Therefore, our results raise the possibility that both Nup98 and Nup96 impact transcriptional memory, especially since Nup96 has been implicated in promoting expression of interferon-responsive genes in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Faria1">[74]</xref> and the Nup96 homologue Nup145C (GenBank Accession P49687) is required for localization of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>. Both Nup96 and Nup98 localize in the nucleoplasm and at the NPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Griffis1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Enninga1">[75]</xref>. Our data suggest that Nup98 plays a direct and specific role: Nup98 binds to the promoters of genes that exhibit transcriptional memory specifically after removal of IFN-γ and knockdown affects reactivation rate without affecting activation rate. Also, although loss of Nup96 is lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Faria1">[74]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Ebina1">[76]</xref>, we did not observe a strong defect in the growth of cells transiently knocked down for Nup98, suggesting that Nup96 function was not completely depleted. And finally, knockdown of Nup107, another component of the same subcomplex of the NPC as Nup96, had no effect on H3K4 dimethylation of promoters of primed genes. We conclude that our data support a role for Nup98, and potentially Nup96, in transcriptional memory. Future work will be required to separate these two roles.</p>
        <p>Phe-x-Phe-Gly repeat proteins that are recognized by mAb 414 interact with the promoter of both active <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> and recently expressed <italic>HLA-DRA</italic>. Nup98, which possesses related repeated motif (Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly), interacts specifically with the promoter of recently expressed <italic>HLA-DRA</italic>. This suggests that active <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> and recently expressed <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> interact with two distinct sets of nuclear pore proteins. This conclusion is very similar to what we have observed for <italic>INO1</italic>; active <italic>INO1</italic> and recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> interact with different Nups, and localization of active and recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery requires different Nups and different DNA elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>. The interaction of active and recently expressed <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> with Nups occurs in the nucleoplasm. Consistent with previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Griffis1">[49]</xref>, this suggests that in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells there are two pools of nuclear pore proteins: a pool at the NPC and a pool in the nucleoplasm. Although the interaction between genes and Nup100 occurs at the NPC in yeast and the interaction with Nup98 occurs in the nucleoplasm in human cells, the biochemical outputs of these interactions are conserved.</p>
        <p>After removing IFN-γ, the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> gene shows increased colocalization with PML bodies, nuclear “dots” that are enriched for the promyelocytic leukemia factor (PML) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gialitakis1">[31]</xref>. PML bodies increase in number after IFN-γ treatment and depletion of PML led to a decrease in both the rate of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> reactivation and loss of H3K4me2 after removing IFN-γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gialitakis1">[31]</xref>. This suggests that relocalization of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> to these structures is required for IFN-γ memory. Foci of Nup98 in the nucleoplasm do not colocalize with PML bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Griffis1">[49]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> may not colocalize with Nup98 foci. It will be important to understand how PML bodies and nuclear pore proteins impact each other in this process.</p>
        <p>The role of H2A.Z in transcriptional memory is controversial. Whereas H2A.Z is required for <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory and is intimately connected to MRS function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Light1">[18]</xref>, loss of H2A.Z affects both the rate of activation and reactivation of <italic>GAL</italic> genes and its role in <italic>GAL</italic> gene transcriptional memory has been challenged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Halley1">[77]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Gligoris1">[79]</xref>. The MRS from the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter is sufficient to induce both incorporation of H2A.Z and dimethylation of H3K4. However, loss of H2A.Z did not block dimethylation of H3K4, suggesting that H3K4me2 occurs upstream of, or in parallel to, H2A.Z deposition. In HeLa cells, we observed only a slight increase in H2A.Z levels associated with the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> promoter after removing IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001524.s005">Figure S5F</xref>). Although a large increase in H2A.Z association is not necessary for H2A.Z to play a role in memory, it is possible that H2A.Z functions as a gene-specific regulator of a more general system to promote reactivation.</p>

        <p>Transcriptional memory plays a broad role in gene priming of IFN-γ-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001524-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Hundreds of genes displayed faster or stronger induction kinetics in cells that have previously been exposed to IFN-γ and that this effect persists for days in rapidly doubling HeLa cells. This suggests that transcriptional memory can qualitatively alter the response of a system to a particular stimulus. If so, it is possible that the response of cells to other stimuli can be modulated by transcriptional memory. For example, similar to the phenomenon of stress cross-protection in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Guan1">[19]</xref>, the rate of induction in response to one cytokine could also be qualitatively or quantitatively altered by previous exposure to a different cytokine. Because transcriptional memory is epigenetically inherited through several cell divisions, it could alter the response of cells, tissues, or whole organisms to persistent or episodic stimuli over long timescales. If so, then it might play an important role in pathological inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Khodarev1">[89]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001524-Wright1">[90]</xref>.</p>
