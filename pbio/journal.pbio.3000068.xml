<abstract>
<p>Mosquito-borne diseases are responsible for several million human deaths annually around the world. One approach to controlling mosquito populations is to disrupt molecular processes or antagonize novel metabolic targets required for the production of viable eggs. To this end, we focused our efforts on identifying proteins required for completion of embryonic development that are mosquito selective and represent potential targets for vector control. We performed bioinformatic analyses to identify putative protein-coding sequences that are specific to mosquito genomes. Systematic RNA interference (RNAi) screening of 40 mosquito-specific genes was performed by injecting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. This experimental approach led to the identification of eggshell organizing factor 1 (EOF1, AAEL012336), which plays an essential role in the formation and melanization of the eggshell. Eggs deposited by EOF1-deficient mosquitoes have nonmelanized fragile eggshells, and all embryos are nonviable. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis identified that exochorionic eggshell structures are strongly affected in EOF1-deficient mosquitoes. EOF1 is a potential novel target, to our knowledge, for exploring the identification and development of mosquito-selective and biosafe small-molecule inhibitors.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Mosquito-borne pathogens infect millions of people worldwide, and the rise in insecticide resistance is exacerbating this problem. A new generation of environmentally safe insecticides will be essential to control insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. One potential route to such novel insecticide targets is the identification of proteins specifically needed for mosquito reproduction. Female mosquitoes feed on blood to produce eggs, which are covered with an eggshell; using RNA interference screening of mosquito-specific genes in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (the mosquito that transmits yellow fever), we identified the eggshell organizing factor 1 (EOF1) protein that plays an essential role in eggshell melanization and embryonic development. Nearly 100% of eggs laid by EOF1-deficient females had a defective eggshell and were not viable. Bleach assays on eggs further confirmed that mosquito-specific EOF1 is required for embryonic development in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. Additional experiments revealed that EOF1 also plays an essential role in eggshell formation in <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (the tiger mosquito, a carrier of Zika virus and dengue fever). We hypothesize that EOF1 has evolved within the Culicidae family to effect eggshell formation and therefore maximize egg survival. The results provide new insights, to our knowledge, into mosquito egg maturation and eggshell synthesis and could lead to key advances in the field of mosquito vector control.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Developing new strategies for vector control is becoming critical because worldwide cases of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-transmitted dengue and Zika virus infections have risen dramatically in the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref003">3</xref>]. Researchers have been investigating metabolic regulation of blood meal metabolism in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes as a strategy for identifying novel protein targets that could be exploited for vector control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref014">14</xref>]. The approach has been focused on biochemical processes that are likely to be required for completion of the gonotrophic cycle in blood-fed mosquitoes, based on what is known about mosquito biology and metabolic regulation in other organisms. Specific genes in these chosen pathways were then systematically knocked down by microinjection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and the resulting phenotypes were characterized in detail by molecular and biochemical approaches.</p>
<p>The insect eggshell is important as a protective layer for embryonic development. Follicle development and eggshell formation in the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquito are tightly regulated in response to blood feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref020">20</xref>]. Once female mosquitoes acquire blood, follicle development is initiated via accumulation of vitellogenin yolk proteins. Mosquitoes contain approximately 100 ovarioles per ovary, which are composed of primary and secondary follicles and a germarium, and the ovarian follicles develop synchronously throughout oogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). A single layer of follicular epithelial cells surrounding the oocyte is mainly responsible for secreting a majority of eggshell structural components. The mosquito eggshell is made from different types of proteins ranging from structural proteins, enzymes, odorant binding proteins, and uncharacterized proteins of unknown function. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> eggshell melanization proteins were identified more than 20 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref021">21</xref>], and several key eggshell enzymes have been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref028">28</xref>]. Moreover, proteomic studies have been performed on purified mosquito eggshells to identify most of the abundant protein components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref030">30</xref>]. However, these descriptive studies have not identified essential eggshell proteins that are required for successful embryonic development and larvae viability.</p>
<p>Genomic sequences of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref031">31</xref>], <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref032">32</xref>], <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref033">33</xref>], and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref034">34</xref>] have been completed. Not surprisingly, many predicted putative proteins identified in the genome of mosquitoes are homologous to proteins of known function studied in other organisms. Proteins that are conserved in a wide variety of organisms are not ideal target molecules as vector control agents because of deleterious effects on nontarget organisms such as vertebrates, pollinating agricultural insects, and beneficial predators. We reasoned that if small-molecule inhibitors could be designed to exclusively target mosquito-lineage–specific proteins, they could be used as biosafe vector control agents. The objective of this study is to identify mosquito-specific proteins that are essential for supporting embryonic development in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes by RNA interference (RNAi) screening. Our findings indicate that eggshell organizing factor 1 (EOF1, AAEL012336) is necessarily required for mosquito eggshell formation and melanization.</p>

<title>Identification of EOF1 as an essential protein for viable embryos</title>
<p>We performed data mining and bioinformatic analysis using the GenBank database to identify putative protein-coding sequences that are only present in the genomes of <italic>Aedes</italic>, <italic>Culex</italic>, and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes using a cutoff for expected value threshold of 1 × 10^(−15). Importantly, the mosquito-lineage–specific genes we identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s009">S1 Table</xref>) were found to be completely absent in evolutionarily closely related organisms, such as phantom midges, true midges, the crane fly, and sandflies within the suborder Nematocera, and thus these genes are not present in other known animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria species. In order to focus on genes that are expressed and likely to encode proteins that could potentially serve as vector control targets, we excluded genes without corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or expressed orthologs in the <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) database. We also excluded mosquito-lineage–specific genes that appear to be members of a multigene family because RNAi knockdown phenotypes may not be immediately obvious because of possible functional redundancy with other gene family members. This highly selected subset of hypothetical mosquito-lineage–specific proteins may have therefore evolved independently and advantageously within the family Culicidae. Systematic RNAi screening of mosquito-specific genes was performed by directly microinjecting the corresponding dsRNA into female <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes 3 days prior to blood feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and the blood-fed female mosquitoes were individually analyzed for their egg phenotypes, fecundity, and viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). 40 mosquito-specific genes were screened (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s009">S1 Table</xref>), and utilizing this experimental approach led to the identification of EOF1, which, upon RNAi knockdown, plays an essential role in the strength and structural integrity of the forming eggshell, as well as its melanization. We hypothesize that EOF1 has evolved within the family Culicidae to affect eggshell formation and melanization and therefore maximize egg survival. We did not observe any defective eggshell in mosquitoes microinjected with dsRNA against 39 other putative genes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, resulting in the production of viable eggs. We also did not observe any significant mortality in response to RNAi against these genes. Thus, we chose to focus on EOF1 in subsequent analyses.</p>

<p>EOF1 sequences found in <italic>Aedes</italic>, <italic>Culex</italic>, and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito species contain an F-box functional motif, and members of the F-box protein family are in general characterized by an approximately 50 amino acid F-box motif that interacts with a highly conserved SKP1 protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref035">35</xref>], suggesting that EOF1 may function to regulate intracellular protein turnover. A further RNAi study on proteins that participate in the SCF complex was not pursued since these proteins that participate in the complex are relatively highly conserved across taxa, and therefore these proteins may not be ideal target proteins to further characterize in mosquitoes. In addition, RNAi knockdown against proteins in the SCF complex may have effects on other proteins that contain the F-box motif. Recent proteomic analysis has identified over 100 mosquito eggshell proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref030">30</xref>], and some of these proteins identified are enzymes that may be involved in catalyzing eggshell melanization and cross-linking reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref028">28</xref>]. However, EOF1 was not previously identified in these mosquito eggshell proteomic studies, indicating that EOF1 may be an upstream regulatory factor of eggshell proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1</xref>, injection of dsRNA-EOF1 had a significant adverse impact on eggshell formation and egg viability. Single-mosquito analysis showed that phenotypes associated with RNAi-EOF1 range from totally nonmelanized and collapsed to truncated and melanized eggs, while untreated and RNAi-firefly luciferase (Fluc) control mosquitoes laid eggs that exhibit uniformly elongated and melanized patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1C–1E</xref>). Approximately 60% of eggs laid by EOF1-deficient mosquitoes did not show any melanization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), while 30% of them had mixed melanization levels ranging from nonmelanized and partially melanized to completely melanized eggshells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). On the other hand, 10% of eggs had completely or partially melanized eggshells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Overall, nearly 100% of eggs from any melanization levels did not reach the larval stage. Single-mosquito analysis also showed that fecundity and viability from eggs of RNAi-EOF1 females were strongly affected by reduced EOF1 function through RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). Bleaching experiments on eggs further confirmed that mosquito-specific EOF1 is required for embryonic development in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Under a light microscope, we observed eggs throughout the 2 h eggshell dechorionation experiment period. In the majority of eggs laid by EOF1-deficient mosquitoes, embryos failed to complete embryogenesis and reach the first larval instar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). It has been shown that when a mosquito embryo advances to form a serosal cuticle within the eggshell, bleach treatment was found to only remove the eggshell, but it cannot digest the serosal cuticle, leaving an intact embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref036">36</xref>]. Thus, if a serosal cuticle has been formed during embryogenesis, the embryo or developed larva should be resistant to bleach treatment. A recently colonized <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> Tucson strain from wild populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref037">37</xref>] also exhibited similar defective egg and embryo phenotypes associated with RNAi-EOF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). We analyzed 15 mosquitoes from each group, and the fecundity (mean ± standard error [SE]) of eggs was 33.3 ± 3.0, 26.4 ± 2.8, and 17.5 ± 1.8 (unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) for untreated, RNAi-Fluc, and RNAi-EOF1, respectively. The lower number of eggs laid by the Tucson strain compared to the Rockefeller strain of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> could likely be due to reduced blood ingestion. The viability of eggs (mean ± SE) was 88.4 ± 2.1, 87.0 ± 1.7, and 2.4 ± 0.9% (unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) for untreated, RNAi-Fluc, and RNAi-EOF1, respectively. Thus, EOF1 protein is essential for complete eggshell formation and embryonic development in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Anautogenous female mosquitoes can undergo multiple gonotrophic cycles by repeating blood feeding, vitellogenesis, and oviposition events. Because EOF1 plays an essential role in eggshell formation, we wondered how long the RNAi knockdown effect of EOF1 lasts from a single dsRNA microinjection. We examined the effect of EOF1 deficiency on eggs in three consecutive gonotrophic cycles in individual containers as designed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. Eggshell melanization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>), fecundity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g002">Fig 2D</xref><italic>)</italic>, and viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) phenotypes are profoundly altered in EOF1-deficient mosquitoes during the first three gonotrophic cycles. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the RNAi-EOF1 effect from a single dsRNA injection remains substantial for the second and even the third gonotrophic cycles. Furthermore, we found that the timing of dsRNA microinjection is important. The dsRNA has to be microinjected a few days prior to blood feeding in both the first and second gonotrophic cycles in order to induce RNAi-mediated EOF1 depletion and produce defective egg phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>EOF1 expression pattern</title>
<p>Since little is known about this mosquito-specific EOF1 gene except for the phenotypes associated with RNAi, we determined the expression pattern of EOF1 at the mRNA level in untreated <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Five tissues including thorax, fat body, midgut, ovaries, and Malpighian tubules were dissected from sugar-fed female mosquitoes at 3 days posteclosion and blood-fed female mosquitoes at 24 and 48 h post-blood meal (PBM). We also examined the mRNA expression in whole bodies of mixed-sex samples of fourth-instar larvae and pupae and adult male mosquitoes. EOF1 is predominantly expressed in ovaries, and the expression is up-regulated in the ovaries by blood feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). qPCR results also indicate that mRNA encoding EOF1 is not strongly detected from larvae, pupae, and adult male mosquitoes. We then examined the pattern of EOF1 expression during the first gonotrophic cycle in detail. Ovaries were isolated at various time points PBM. In ovary samples after 36 h PBM, the primary follicles were carefully isolated from ovaries to exclude nonfollicle ovarian cell types such as muscles and trachea. qPCR data show that EOF1 mRNA expression is up-regulated in response to blood feeding, and the levels remain high even at 14 days PBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Since follicular epithelial cells and nurse cells in the primary follicles undergo apoptosis by around 72 h PBM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), mRNAs encoding EOF1 may likely originate from the unfertilized mature oocytes. EOF1 mRNA distribution in primary follicles was further determined using whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH analysis shows that while three vitelline envelope genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref038">38</xref>] were exclusively expressed in the follicular epithelial cells, EOF1 mRNA transcripts are present in oocyte and nurse cells of primary follicles and weakly expressed in the secondary follicle and germarium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Western blot analysis showed that EOF1 expression is induced in ovaries in response to blood feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). RNAi knockdown level of EOF1 mRNA and protein was confirmed by qPCR and western blot, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Tissue-specific and developmental expression pattern of EOF1 during the first gonotrophic cycle of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes was determined. EOF1 gene expression was analyzed by qPCR using cDNAs prepared from various tissues. Tissues include thorax, fat body, midgut, ovary, and MTs in SF only and 24 and 48 h PBM, as well as Lv, Pp, and M. The pattern demonstrates the ovary-specific EOF1 expression in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. The EOF1 expression levels were normalized to S7 ribosomal protein transcript levels in the same cDNA samples. Data were collected from three different mosquito cohorts. EOF1 expression in fat body at SF was set to 1.0. (B) Detailed EOF1 gene expression in ovaries and follicles were analyzed by qPCR using cDNAs from mosquito ovaries or follicles. Samples from SF to 42 h PBM include entire ovaries, whereas those from 48 h to 14 days PBM include only follicles (primary and secondary follicle cells and germarium) isolated from ovaries to exclude nonfollicle cells in the oviducts and ovarioles. EOF1 expression in ovaries at SF was set to 1.0. (C) EOF1 protein expression pattern in ovaries were determined by western blot analysis using an EOF1-specific polyclonal antibody.

<title>Follicle development in EOF1-deficient females</title>
<p>In <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, EOF1-deficient female mosquitoes had low fecundity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) and laid eggs that were defective in eggshell formation, leading to the embryonic lethal phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1G</xref>).

We examined ovarian follicle phenotypes associated with EOF1 gene suppression by RNAi in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Representative ovaries at 36 h PBM showed that RNAi-EOF1 ovaries contain follicles that undergo caspase-mediated apoptosis indicated by the increase in red-labeled caspase inhibitor, while these dying follicles were not observed in untreated or RNAi-Fluc control ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Approximately 40% of primary follicles in RNAi-EOF1 ovaries showed caspase-mediated apoptosis.

<p>Mature ovaries were dissected from the abdomen of dsRNA-injected mosquitoes and photographed at 96 h PBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g005">Fig 5A–5D</xref>). While not all RNAi-Fluc control mature follicles in ovaries have initiated melanization, we frequently observed that some follicles isolated from RNAi-EOF1 are already partially melanized in the ovaries. The partially melanized phenotype in EOF1-deficient ovaries is accompanied by a loss of structural integrity, and thus we hypothesized that decreased chorionic osmotic control results in this alteration of egg shape. To determine whether the water permeability of the mosquito eggshells was affected in response to EOF1 knockdown, we employed two chemical markers, rhodamine B and neutral red, to stain ovarian follicles. Significant differences in the permeability of both markers in ovaries were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g005">Fig 5E–5J</xref>). While the follicles from both untreated and RNAi-Fluc mosquitoes were only slightly stained, the majority of follicles from RNAi-EOF1 mosquitoes were strongly stained with the markers. Since follicular epithelial cells have been already shed around 72 h PBM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), there is a single oocyte present in each follicle at this developmental stage (96 h PBM).

<title>Ultrastructure analysis of mosquito eggs</title>
<p>EOF1-deficient mosquitoes oviposited eggs with different degrees of eggshell melanization phenotypes that include nonmelanized, partially melanized, and melanized eggs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g002">2C</xref>). Since nearly 100% of eggs oviposited from RNAi-EOF1 females did not undergo complete embryogenesis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g002">2E</xref>), we hypothesized that the defective eggshell might be the primary cause of embryonic death. Light microscopy images of eggs from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> RNAi-Fluc and RNAi-EOF1 mosquitoes revealed that EOF1 may be involved in the specification of the outer chorionic area (OCA) surrounded by the porous nature of the exochorionic network (EN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g006">Fig 6A–6D</xref><italic>)</italic>. Next, we examined the effect of RNAi-EOF1 on the ultrastructure of eggs in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We observed a very similar <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> eggshell ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g006">Fig 6E and 6G</xref>) to other SEM studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref040">40</xref>]. An exochorion outermost layer of the eggshell is characterized by the presence of a single protruding central tubercle (CT) and several minute peripheral tubercles (PTs) in the OCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). However, SEM images showed that the OCA in RNAi-EOF1 eggs is about 6 times larger than eggs of control mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g006">Fig 6E–6H</xref>), suggesting that EOF1 may be involved in specifying the size of the OCA. A majority of eggshell proteins are likely secreted into the perivitelline space from follicular epithelial cells during follicle development in response to blood feeding. However, it is not well known whether the size of the OCA is strictly determined by surrounding follicular epithelial cells. We also observed that each OCA contains multiple miniaturized CT-like structures also surrounded by EN-like structures instead of one predominant CT. The SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the enriched eggshell protein extracts from EOF1-deficient females showed slightly different patterns from those from RNAi-Fluc controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). These differences could account for aberrant exochorionic structure in RNAi-EOF1 eggs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Data mining was performed using all <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> protein sequences available at the GenBank database in early 2015 to identify putative protein-coding sequences that are only present in the genomes of <italic>Aedes</italic>, <italic>Culex</italic>, and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Through RNAi screening of putative mosquito-specific genes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, we identified EOF1 as an essential protein for eggshell formation and melanization. During this course of study, a whole-genome analysis in 37 dipteran species, including midges and sandflies, was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref041">41</xref>]. We performed a TBLASTN search against Nematocera in the Whole-Genome-Shotgun contigs database. A global alignment between mosquito EOF1 and hypothetical proteins detected in culicoid and chaoborus midges shows only about 26%–30% identity, suggesting that it is very difficult to determine whether these highly diverged genes show orthologous relationships. The conserved amino acid residues are present in putative F-box functional domains of these proteins. Taken together, EOF1 may be uniquely evolved in mosquito lineages to play roles in eggshell formation.</p>
<p>We observed that EOF1-deficient mosquitoes lay eggs with different melanization levels, ranging from nonmelanized to completely melanized eggshells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Different level of eggshell melanization in response to RNAi-EOF1 could be possible because of genetic variation. Alternatively, a differential dsRNA uptake by follicles within the ovary could explain the variation in the levels of eggshell melanization. A single layer of follicular epithelial cells surrounding the oocyte is mainly responsible for secreting a majority of eggshell structural components. Since eggshell components are directly secreted into the extracellular space between the oocyte and the surrounding follicular epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), intimate communication between these cells within each ovariole may exist throughout follicle maturation, eventually leading to follicular epithelial cell shedding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), ovulation, and oviposition. In general, mature follicles from mosquitoes do not undergo premature melanization within the ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g005">Fig 5</xref>), and gravid females can hold their mature follicles for a long period of time under adverse environmental conditions and still lay viable eggs, which become melanized after oviposition. Thus, the timing of eggshell melanization may likely be tightly regulated and catalyzed by specific enzymes, and their synthesis, secretion, and activation may be critical for proper melanization and thus survival of embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref028">28</xref>]. A possible explanation for aberrant partial melanization of follicles within the EOF1-deficient ovaries prior to an oviposition event is that a loss of EOF1 function may alter hemolymph permeability of the eggshell, affecting a delicate chemical balance within the oocytes, which in turn trigger other eggshell components to prematurely initiate eggshell melanization processes. In addition to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, we also confirmed that EOF1 plays an essential role in eggshell formation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Given that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> embryogenesis completes by 3 days postoviposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref036">36</xref>], two lines of our experimental evidence suggest that EOF1 may be necessary for complete embryogenesis in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. First, we frequently observed that a majority of eggs deposited by EOF1-deficient mosquitoes collapsed within 16 h, rupturing the oocyte plasma membrane and leaking intracellular contents, including yolk, likely because of incomplete eggshell formation. Second, our bleach assay demonstrates that nearly 100% of eggs from EOF1-deficient mosquitoes with any melanization levels did not reach the larval stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Thus, female mosquitoes without EOF1 produce inviable eggs likely because of incomplete embryogenesis. However, it remains to be determined which specific embryogenesis stage was affected in eggs deposited by EOF1-deficient mosquitoes. SDS-PAGE analysis shows that enriched eggshell proteins from EOF1-deficient eggs slightly differ from those from RNAi-Fluc controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000068.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), and thus an identification of the downstream EOF1-dependent eggshell proteins may lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms for mosquito eggshell formation. Although it is beyond the scope of this study to screen and identify small molecules that specifically target mosquito EOF1, such molecules may have great promise for controlling the mosquito population. Eggshell proteins specifically affected by EOF1-deficient mosquitoes may also be ideal proteins if they exhibit a high degree of sequence divergence to other insect taxa.</p>
<p>Based on the presence of a conserved F-box motif in EOF1, one possibility is that EOF1 is required in the ubiquitin pathway for controlled degradation of one or more proteins that regulate proper timing of eggshell development. Dysregulation of stage-specific ordered events in RNAi-EOF1–injected mosquitoes could lead to collapse of the developmental program at all downstream control points. The finding that RNAi-EOF1 phenotypes are observed three gonotrophic cycles beyond the time of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g002">Fig 2</xref>) indicates that the EOF1 protein may not be resynthesized at the onset of each gonotrophic cycle but rather establishes the eggshell development program when the reproductive phase is initiated in the female mosquito. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g003">Fig 3</xref> support this proposal in that EOF1 mRNA remains at elevated levels in the ovaries of blood-fed mosquitoes, even out to 14 days. Specifically, if EOF1 mRNA was resynthesized with each gonotrophic cycle, then one would expect EOF1 mRNA to be degraded at completion of the gonotrophic cycle in order to restart the process after the next blood feeding, and that does not appear to be the case. Another possibility is that RNAi effects are particularly long-lasting in ovary tissues and continue to abrogate EOF1 synthesis at each gonotrophic cycle. Additional studies are currently underway to distinguish between these alternative hypotheses. Results from these studies could lead to the development of mosquito control applications using novel biosafe mosquitocides that target mosquito-specific proteins required for embryonic development. It may also be possible to use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) gene-drive genetic manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000068.ref046">46</xref>] for the same purpose. If successful, such approaches would eventually result in a decrease in the mosquito population and thus lower the transmission of mosquito-borne viral infections.</p>

<p>A bleach test was performed to determine viability of 4-day-old eggs from RNAi studies. Light microscopic images were taken from RNAi-Fluc and RNAi-EOF1 females immediately prior to the addition of bleach (0 min). We frequently observed that some partially melanized eggs from EOF1 deficient mosquitoes collapsed prior to bleach application. (A) Representative photos were taken 2, 50, 60, 70, and 80 min post-bleach application. The exochorionic structures, including EN, become invisible immediately upon bleach application (2 min). Eyes of the first-instar larvae present in eggs, indicated with white circles, have begun to appear through the partially dechorionated eggshell at 50 min post-bleach application, while weakly melanized eggs from EOF1-deficient mosquitoes disappeared. The eggshell was nearly removed by 80 min after bleach treatment, exposing the fully developed first-instar larvae. Bleach treatment (10%) gently dechorionates eggshell with minimal adverse effects on the embryos due to the presence of the extraembryonic serosal cuticle. (B) Presence of larvae was determined. Overall, the bleach studies showed that eggs from RNAi-Fluc mosquitoes had 92.2% of developed first-instar larvae, while 1.8% of egg deposited by RNAi-EOF1 mosquitoes successfully completed embryogenesis to reach the first larval instar.

<p>(A) Representative eggs are shown from mosquitoes injected with dsRNA-Fluc and dsRNA-EOF1. Mosquitoes were injected with dsRNA at 1 day after adult eclosion. (B) The effect of RNAi-Fluc control or RNAi-EOF1 control on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> fecundity was examined by counting the number of eggs laid by each individual female. Each dot represents the number of eggs oviposited by an individual mosquito (<italic>N</italic> = 15). The mean ± SE are shown as horizontal lines. Statistical significance is represented by stars above each column (unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test; ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). RNAi knockdown of EOF1 in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> females led to the production of nonmelanized abnormal eggs. Note that 55.9% of fully blood-fed RNAi-EOF1 females did not produce mature follicles, and the results are not included in the analysis. (C) Viability of these eggs was determined. Each bar corresponds to egg viability from 10 individual mosquitoes from both groups. (D) <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> (Gainesville strain, MRA-804) obtained from the CDC is presented, showing a distinct single longitudinal white stripe on the dorsal thorax.

<title>Eggshell enrichment and SDS-PAGE protein analysis.</title>
<p>Representative ovaries from mosquitoes injected with dsRNA-Fluc (A) and dsRNA-EOF1 (A′). Mosquitoes were injected with dsRNA targeting EOF1 or Fluc control, and the ovaries were dissected from the injected mosquitoes at 96 h PBM. Ovaries were photographed immediately after dissection in 1× PBS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000068.g005">Fig 5</xref>, RNAi-Fluc control mosquitoes contain mature nonmelanized ovarian follicles, whereas EOF1-deficient mosquitoes contain aberrant prematurely melanized follicles. (B and B′) Images show individual follicles that were removed from ovaries prior to eggshell enrichment. (C and C′) Enrichment of mosquito eggshell was achieved by homogenizing follicles with a Dounce homogenizer (B pestle) and washing cytosolic contents. (D) SDS-PAGE analysis of enriched eggshell proteins. Proteins equivalent to two ovaries were loaded in each well. Red arrows indicate possible eggshell proteins that are affected in response to RNAi-EOF1 compared to RNAi-FLUC control. dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; EOF1, eggshell organizing factor 1; Fluc, firefly luciferase; PBM, post-blood meal; RNAi, RNA interference.</p>
