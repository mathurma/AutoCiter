<p>Accelerated evolution of the human brain and muscle metabolomes reflects our unique cognitive and physical capacities.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Metabolite concentrations reflect the physiological states of tissues and cells. However, the role of metabolic changes in species evolution is currently unknown. Here, we present a study of metabolome evolution conducted in three brain regions and two non-neural tissues from humans, chimpanzees, macaque monkeys, and mice based on over 10,000 hydrophilic compounds. While chimpanzee, macaque, and mouse metabolomes diverge following the genetic distances among species, we detect remarkable acceleration of metabolome evolution in human prefrontal cortex and skeletal muscle affecting neural and energy metabolism pathways. These metabolic changes could not be attributed to environmental conditions and were confirmed against the expression of their corresponding enzymes. We further conducted muscle strength tests in humans, chimpanzees, and macaques. The results suggest that, while humans are characterized by superior cognition, their muscular performance might be markedly inferior to that of chimpanzees and macaque monkeys.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Physiological processes that maintain our tissues' functionality involve the generation of multiple products and intermediates known as metabolites—small molecules with a weight of less than 1,500 Daltons. Changes in concentrations of these metabolites are thought to be closely related to changes in phenotype. Here, we assessed concentrations of more than 10,000 metabolites in three brain regions and two non-neural tissues (skeletal muscle and kidney) of humans, chimpanzees, macaque monkeys, and mice using mass spectrometry-based approaches. We found that the evolution of the metabolome largely reflects genetic divergence between species and is not greatly affected by environmental factors. In the human lineage, however, we observed an exceptional acceleration of metabolome evolution in the prefrontal cortical region of the brain and in skeletal muscle. Based on additional behavioral tests, we further show that metabolic changes in human muscle seem to be paralleled by a drastic reduction in muscle strength. The observed rapid metabolic changes in brain and muscle, together with the unique human cognitive skills and low muscle performance, might reflect parallel mechanisms in human evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metabolites, small molecules with molecular weight typically less than 1,500 Daltons, encompass a broad range of compounds that includes building blocks of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipid membranes, energy and chemical group carriers, and neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules. Changes in metabolite concentrations closely reflect changes in the physiological states of tissues and cells. Thus, knowledge of metabolite concentration changes specific to human tissues may be instrumental to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying evolution of the human phenotype. Genomic and gene expression surveys have demonstrated how comparative studies of humans and closely related primate species can lead to identification of evolutionarily, physiologically, and medically relevant features characteristic of humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Brawand1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Enard1">[2]</xref>, including changes related to metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Grossman1">[3]</xref>. Indeed, several physiological features specific to humans imply possible metabolic adaptations. For instance, evolution of a large brain in humans, which consumes 20% of the total body energy at rest, has been suggested to involve changes in energy distribution among tissues, as well as adaptation to a nutrition-rich diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Aiello1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-HerculanoHouzel1">[5]</xref>. Similarly, emergence of endurance running in hominid ancestry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Bramble1">[6]</xref> may have added another constraint to human metabolic evolution.</p>
<p>Despite the potential significance of metabolic changes to evolution of the human phenotype, few studies of human-specific metabolic features exist. Previous studies, although limited to 21 and 118 metabolites measured in brains of humans, chimpanzees, and macaque monkeys, revealed extensive metabolite concentration differences among species affecting approximately 50% of the assessed compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Fu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Khaitovich1">[8]</xref>. To further deepen our understanding of metabolite concentration changes accompanying recent human evolution, as well as to shed light on the general dynamics of metabolome evolution, we conducted a comprehensive metabolome survey across five tissues of humans, chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, and laboratory mice based on over 10,000 metabolic compounds. In each species, we examined metabolite concentrations in three brain regions, prefrontal cortex (PFC), primary visual cortex (V1), and cerebellar cortex (CBC), as well as in the kidney cortex and thigh skeletal muscle of 14 adult healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s016">Table S1</xref>). Small molecules present in the tissue samples were assayed using the following methodologies: (<italic>i</italic>) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), (<italic>ii</italic>) positive mode liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ([+]LC-MS), and (<italic>iii</italic>) negative mode liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ([−]LC-MS). The effects of postmortem delay, as well as environmental effects characteristic of the industrialized human lifestyle—a diet rich in fat and sugar content, low levels of exercise, and high levels of social stress—were assessed using the same set of metabolite measurements in 14 additional macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s017">Table S2</xref>). In total, metabolite measurements were performed in 365 tissue samples. To test the reliability of metabolite measurements further, a subset of samples from four individuals per species per tissue was measured using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) as an alternative procedure. Metabolic measurements were accompanied by the measurements of the expression of enzymes using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in a subset of 120 tissue samples.</p>

<title>Metabolome Quantification</title>
<p>Across these datasets, we quantified a total of 10,615 peaks (mass spectrometry features), which were detected in at least one tissue of one species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Among them, 1,535 could be annotated using metabolite standards or computationally matching the metabolite features to metabolite database entries. As all human and most chimpanzee samples were not collected immediately after death, we removed from further analysis 636 peaks with concentrations affected by postmortem delay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s018">Table S3</xref>). These peaks were identified in comparison between macaque samples collected with (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and without (<italic>n</italic> = 17) postmortem delay (<italic>q</italic>&lt;0.01 in at least one tissue, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Out of 371 metabolites detected in the independent CE-MS experiment, 265 were detected by the LC-MS and GC-MS methodologies. The concentration profiles of these metabolites across the different species showed significant agreement among methodologies in all tested tissues (Wilcoxon test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<p>Examination of metabolite concentration variation by means of principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear separation of samples of all four species according to the three major organs—brain, kidney, and muscle—in each dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g001">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Within each tissue we could further observe grouping according to species identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). Accordingly, of the 10,615 detected metabolite peaks, 92% showed significant concentration differences among tissues (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;1%), using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Further, 80% of peaks showed significant concentration differences among the four species and 61% among primates (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, FDR&lt;2%), indicating large scope and potential functional importance of metabolome divergence among species. By contrast, the effects of sex, age, and tissue preservation on metabolite concentration variation were substantially smaller: on average &lt;1, 12, and 8% of all the assayed metabolite peaks were affected by one of these factors, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g001">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s019">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Metabolome Differences among Tissues</title>
<p>To examine the metabolic differences among tissues further, we sorted 9,603 metabolite peaks that showed significant concentration differences among the tissues into 13 metabolite clusters using nonsupervised hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

The largest proportion of metabolite concentration profiles was muscle-specific (41%), almost 2-fold more than brain-specific (23%) and kidney-specific (18%).</p>

<p>All clusters contained metabolic changes enriched in specific pathways (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), many of them associated with known tissue-specific functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s020">Table S5</xref>). To test whether the metabolite concentration differences among tissues could be confirmed against differences in the expression of their corresponding enzymes, we measured transcript levels in 120 of the 365 tissue samples using RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s016">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s021">S6</xref>). In this dataset we detected expression of 17,913 protein-coding genes that could be mapped among primate species (16,398 between primates and mouse), with 3,820 (3,720) of them linked to metabolites based on the Human Metabolome Database Version 3.0 (HMDB) annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s006">Figure S6</xref>). By combining metabolite concentration and gene expression measurements, we showed that pathways containing excess of tissue-specific metabolic profiles also showed significant over-representation of corresponding tissue-specific gene expression profiles in all 13 metabolite clusters (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). Specifically, clusters containing metabolites and enzymes showing brain-specific profiles were enriched for, among others, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and the synaptic vesicle cycle; muscle-specific profiles for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation; and kidney-specific profiles for aldosterone-regulated water reabsorption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s020">Table S5</xref>). Thus, metabolite concentration differences among tissues could be confirmed by expression-level differences in corresponding genes, and these metabolite concentration differences represent some of the known functional properties of the tissues.</p>

<title>Metabolome Divergence among Species</title>
<p>To inspect metabolic divergence among species, we sorted 9,356 metabolite peaks that showed significant concentration differences among the four species (ANOVA, species or tissue–species terms, permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, FDR&lt;2%) into species-specific categories within each of the five tissues, as well as within composite tissue categories: cerebral cortex (PFC+V1) and brain (PFC+V1+CBC). The greater number of samples belonging to cerebral cortex and brain, compared with individual tissue categories, results in the greater statistical power of tests performed on these composite tissue samples. For this reason, throughout the study we compared the relative proportions of change among species within each tissue, without comparing the differences in species-specific change among composite and individual tissues. As a result, we found that in all tissues metabolic divergence on the chimpanzee, macaque, and mouse evolutionary lineages could to a large extent be explained by genetic distances among these species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Glazko1">[9]</xref> (Pearson <italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.88, <italic>n</italic> = 21, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). By contrast, the extent of metabolic divergence on the human evolutionary lineage differed substantially among tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g003">Figure 3a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Human-specific metabolic divergence in the V1 cortical region and kidney was similar to chimpanzee-specific divergence in these tissues and could be predicted from regression fit of metabolic divergence based on phylogenetic divergence times of the three nonhuman species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). By contrast, in the brain, PFC, and skeletal muscle, human-specific metabolic divergence exceeded chimpanzee-specific divergence by 4.0-, 4.2-, and 8.4-fold respectively. This excess was significantly greater than expected from phylogenetic time-based divergence estimates (linear regression <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). In fact, human-specific metabolic divergence in the sampled thigh skeletal muscle (mainly vastus lateralis) and PFC exceeded average metabolic divergence seen in the mouse tissues. This indicates that during the last 6–7 million years of human evolution, human muscle metabolome underwent greater change than the mouse metabolome did over the approximately 130 million years separating mice from the common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and macaques.</p>

<title>Species-specific metabolic change.</title>
<p>(a) Proportions of metabolite concentration changes on the four species evolutionary lineages. The phylogenetic tree above the bars shows the human (red) and chimpanzee (orange) evolutionary lineages, the lineage connecting the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees with macaques (gray), and the lineage connecting the common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and macaques with mice (blue). The colors within the bars show proportions of metabolite peaks with concentration changes specific to the corresponding lineages. (b) Relationship between species-specific metabolite concentration divergence in each tissue and the corresponding phylogenetic distances in million years (MY). The linear regression between metabolite concentration divergence and phylogenetic distances represented by the dashed line was calculated based on the proportions of metabolite peaks with significant concentration divergence on the corresponding lineage for the three nonhuman species (represented by circles). Asterisks colored according to the tissues show the proportions of metabolite peaks with significant concentration divergence on the human lineage relative to the chimpanzee linage.

The plot is based on the 4,698 metabolite peaks that showed significant concentration differences in any tissue in the three primate species (<italic>t</italic>-test, permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). The columns represent metabolite peaks; the rows represent 190 tissue samples sorted by species and tissue identity. For each peak, concentration level in a given sample was normalized to the concentration across all samples of other primate species within the same tissue (base 2 logarithm-transformed ratios).

<p>The remarkable excess of human-specific metabolic divergence in the skeletal muscle, PFC, and in the brain as a whole, but not in V1 or the kidney, could be clearly visualized when grouping all species-specific metabolic changes found on the human, chimpanzee, and macaque evolutionary lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g003">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s022">Table S7</xref>). This result was also observed for the three mass spectrometry datasets analyzed separately, was robust at various statistical significance cutoffs, could be validated by metabolite measurements overlapping between LC- and GC-MS techniques, was valid for both annotated and unannotated metabolite peaks, and was not affected by exclusion of metabolites with low concentration levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s023">Tables S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s024">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s025">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s008">Figures S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s009">S9</xref>). More importantly, human-specific metabolic changes showed significant agreement with expression profiles of the linked metabolic enzymes in all tissues except one (CBC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g003">Figure 3d</xref>). Similarly, significant agreement between metabolite concentration and enzyme expression profiles was seen on the macaque evolutionary lineage for tissues containing large numbers of macaque-specific metabolic changes: V1, kidney, cerebral cortex, whole brain, and skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>All groups of metabolites showing species-specific concentration levels in different tissues were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database resource (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s026">Table S11</xref>). Of the 115 KEGG pathways containing an excess of species-specific metabolic changes, 100 contained at least one enzyme showing a consistent species-specific expression pattern in the RNA-seq data. Furthermore, in 61 of the 100 pathways, the metabolites and enzymes that showed consistent species-specific profiles were directly linked, while only 12 pathways would be expected by chance (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). At the individual pathway level, 44 pathways contained significant excess of enzymes with matching species-specific expression profiles either directly or indirectly linked to the corresponding species-specific metabolites (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s026">Table S11</xref>) while only seven pathways would be expected by chance (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01).</p>
<p>Among the 47 pathways that contained an excess of human-specific metabolic changes supported by enzyme expression, 20 were found in the PFC and 9 in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s027">Tables S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s028">S13</xref>). Based on shared metabolites, these pathways could be further grouped into functional units. Human-specific metabolic changes in the PFC included two such units: <italic>(i)</italic> translational metabolism (valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, selenocompound metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis); and <italic>(ii)</italic> neurotransmitter signaling (dopaminergic synapse, cocaine and amphetamine addiction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g004">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s029">Table S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s010">Figure S10</xref>).

<title>Extent of Environmental Effects on Metabolome Composition</title>
<p>Could the stark excess of human-specific metabolic changes found in some of the examined tissues be caused by environmental factors, such as diet, stress, or physical activity? To address this, we performed metabolome measurements in 12 additional macaque monkeys (male, 2–14 years old) that were subjected to conditions designed to reproduce some aspects of the modern human lifestyle. Specifically, the test macaques were placed indoors in solitary standard size cages with no dietary change (stress and exercise factors: condition 1, <italic>n</italic> = 6) or with an additional dietary change to a cooked diet with high sugar and fat content (stress, exercise, and diet factors: condition 2, <italic>n</italic> = 6) for a 1-month period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s017">Table S2</xref>). Similar dietary changes introduced over a shorter time interval in mice were previously shown to reproduce some of the gene expression differences observed between human and chimpanzee livers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Somel1">[10]</xref>. Prior to this treatment, the test macaques, as well as all other macaques used in this study (standard condition: controls, <italic>n</italic> = 17), were fed a balanced plant-based diet and housed in family groups in spacious outdoor enclosures. Environmental differences between test macaques and macaques kept at standard conditions had only a modest effect on metabolite concentrations: a total of 37 and 78 metabolic peaks were affected in at least one of the five tissues by condition 1 and condition 2, respectively (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). By contrast, an average of 3,674 and 4,840 metabolic peaks showed equally significant differences in comparisons between control macaques and six randomly selected chimpanzee or human individuals, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g004">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s013">Figure S13</xref>). The metabolic changes that were induced by environmental effects showed significant enrichment in 19 KEGG pathways (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s034">Table S19</xref>) containing a total number of human-specific metabolic change (68 peaks) significantly higher than expected in randomly sampled pathways (permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). The significant overlap between environmentally induced and human-specific metabolic changes indicates that, despite the limited scope and duration of the environmental change, it nevertheless did capture some of metabolic effects of the modern human lifestyle. The extent of metabolic changes induced by environmental perturbation was, however, limited and constituted less than 3% of all human-specific metabolic changes identified in our study.</p>

<title>Muscular Strength Differences among Primates</title>
<p>The relatively small effect of the short-term environmental changes on metabolite concentrations in macaque tissues indicates that the extraordinary human-specific metabolic divergence observed in skeletal muscle, PFC, and brain might reflect the phenotypic differences between humans and other species. We hypothesize that rapid metabolic evolution in brain and skeletal muscle is associated with unique cognitive and physical abilities of humans. While cognitive functions clearly distinguish humans from other primates, to our knowledge only anecdotal observations exist suggesting that human muscular strength could be inferior to that of other primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Bauman1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Scholz1">[15]</xref>. To investigate this, we conducted a series of experiments aimed at providing an approximate estimate of muscular strength in a pulling task accomplished by humans (<italic>n</italic> = 42), chimpanzees (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and macaques (<italic>n</italic> = 6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s015">Movie S1</xref>). The task consisted of pulling suspended adjustable weights in a setup involving both upper and lower parts of the body and conducted in a procedure allowing us to estimate the maximum pulling strength of an individual. In this test humans showed substantially inferior performance compared with chimpanzees and macaques, with an average strength difference of almost 2-fold (Wilcoxon test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001871-g004">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s035">Table S20</xref>). Prolonged training is known to increase human strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Westcott1">[16]</xref>, therefore the tested humans included 16 individuals engaged in regular physical activities, among them five university team basketball players and four professional climbers. By contrast, all tested nonhuman primates were raised in captivity and were never subjected to physical training. Many additional factors including ones potentially favoring nonhuman primates, such as difference in muscle mass distribution between front and hind limbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Thorpe1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Zihlman1">[18]</xref>, as well as ones favoring humans, such as motivation to perform, could not be accounted for in our experiment. The inability to control nonhuman primates' motivation hinders the exact quantification of the muscular strength difference between humans and nonhuman primates, even in a highly controlled experimental setup. Nonetheless, our results indicate the existence of systematic differences in muscle performance between humans and nonhuman primates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study provides several novel insights into the nature and the potential mechanisms of metabolic evolution. First, we demonstrate that while metabolic divergence among mammalian species tends to reflect genetic distances among species, stark exceptions to this rule exist. Specifically, we show that the metabolomes of PFC and skeletal muscle have undergone 4- and 7-fold greater divergence, respectively, on the human evolutionary lineage than expected from genetic divergence. Notably, this observation contrasts with evolutionary divergence at the transcriptome level where overall transcriptome divergence largely follows genetic distances in all tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s014">Figure S14</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, we show that metabolite concentrations are largely buffered against environmental changes, such as temporary change in diet, physical activity, and living conditions. While this is true for tissues assessed in our study—brain regions, kidney, and muscle—this observation might not apply to tissues closely interacting with the environment, such as liver and blood. Moreover, exposure to altered environmental conditions over a longer time span could result in more pronounced changes. Nevertheless, the 2 months' exposure of macaques to “human-like” environmental conditions did recapitulate some human-specific metabolic changes, indicating the relevance of our environmental tests.</p>
<p>The third and perhaps most unexpected observation is a striking excess of human-specific metabolic divergence in skeletal muscle. While excess of human-specific metabolic divergence in brain or brain regions such as PFC might relate to cognitive functions unique to humans, the functional significance of extreme metabolic divergence of human skeletal muscle is less apparent. Our results suggesting a major difference in muscular strength between humans and nonhuman primates provide one possible explanation for this phenomenon. In humans, muscle tissue is known to have variable fiber-type composition, reflecting differences in individuals' physiology and physical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Simoneau1">[19]</xref>. Since different muscle fiber types have different functional and metabolic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Saltin1">[20]</xref>, systematic difference in fiber-type composition between human and other primate species could explain our observations of extensive metabolic differences and reduced human muscular strength. To assess this hypothesis, we measured fiber-type composition in nine adult chimpanzee individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001871.s036">Table S21</xref>). Variation in fiber-type composition observed among chimpanzees was, however, indistinguishable from that observed among humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Simoneau1">[19]</xref>. Thus, differences in fiber-type composition between humans and nonhuman primates are not likely to explain the extensive metabolic divergence, as well as difference in strength, observed in our study. Further experiments are needed to investigate the exact extent of muscle performance differences between humans and nonhuman primates, as well as the link between changes in muscle performance and muscle metabolite composition on the human lineage. On the molecular level, such experiments could involve isolation of individual muscle types or functional groups and testing of their contractile properties. On the organism level, more controlled experiments could inspect recruitment of particular muscles in motion and quantify their performance based on their volume and level of activation.</p>
<p>While the molecular mechanism linking metabolic divergence with changes in muscular strength on the human evolutionary lineage cannot be determined based on our observations alone, we hypothesize that metabolic evolution of human muscle and brain metabolomes may have occurred in parallel. Studies demonstrating a connection between aerobic exercise and cognitive performance in humans of different age indicate that these two organs might be metabolically related <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Hillman1">[21]</xref>. Furthermore, it was also previously suggested that rescaling of energetically expensive organs, such as the gut, allowed the development of a larger brain in human evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Aiello1">[4]</xref>. Our results indicate that the reallocation of energy to energetically costly human brains may have required further decrease in energy expense in the skeletal muscle, at least during peak performance. Combined with previous observations of decreased bone robustness potentially reflecting a decline in muscular strength on the human evolutionary lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Ruff1">[22]</xref>, it is plausible that human brain and muscle were evolving in a reciprocal manner to adjust to the increasing energy demands of the growing brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-HerculanoHouzel1">[5]</xref> and to adapt to new types of physical activities requiring greater endurance, both characteristic of modern humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Bramble1">[6]</xref>. While differences in muscle energy consumption between humans and other primates are currently unknown, we speculate that metabolic coevolution of muscle and brain may require either an overall decrease in muscle energy consumption or, alternatively, a shift to alternative energy sources, such as lipids, thus realizing more glucose for an energy-demanding human brain. Accelerated changes in metabolite concentrations in brain and skeletal muscle on the human evolutionary lineage may, therefore, represent some of the molecular underpinnings of this evolutionary process.</p>

Written consent for the use of human tissues for research was obtained from all donors or their next of kin. All subjects were defined as healthy controls by forensic pathologists at the corresponding tissue bank. All subjects suffered sudden death with no prolonged agonal state. Chimpanzee samples were obtained from the Alamogordo Primate Facility, New Mexico, USA, the Anthropological Institute &amp; Museum of the University of Zürich-Irchel, Switzerland, and the Biomedical Primate Research Centre, the Netherlands. Rhesus macaque samples were obtained from the Suzhou Experimental Animal Center, China. All nonhuman primates used in this study suffered sudden deaths for reasons other than their participation in this study and without any relation to the tissue used. Mouse samples were obtained from the mouse facility at Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences. All mouse individuals were from the C57/BL6 strain with no genetic modifications. Since mouse measurements were used solely to compare the pace of metabolic and genetic divergence among species, underestimation of metabolic and genetic variation within mouse species because of their genetic homogeneity does not affect the main results of our study.</p>
<p>The PFC samples were dissected from the anterior part of the superior frontal gyrus, a cortical region approximately corresponding to Brodmann area 10. The V1 samples were dissected from the calcarine cortex (human and chimpanzee) or the occipital lobe (macaques), corresponding to Brodmann area 17. The CBC samples were dissected from the lateral part of the cerebellar hemispheres. In all brain samples we took special care to dissect gray matter only. The kidney samples were dissected from the renal cortex. Muscle tissue was dissected from thigh skeletal muscle, mainly vastus lateralis. All tissues were snap-frozen after dissection and stored at −80°C without thawing.</p>
<p>Each tissue sample was of approximately 100 mg of weight and was extracted from the frozen postmortem tissue on dry ice without de-freezing.

<p>Macaques from condition 1 and condition 2 groups were transferred from the standard living conditions (control condition) into individual standard-size cages located in a temperature-controlled room (24±2°C) with lights on 12 hours each day (700–1900). The cage size was close to 1 m<sup>3</sup> and largely limited their space for movement. The diet of condition 1 monkeys was kept unchanged and was the same as the diet of monkeys from the control group. The diet of condition 2 monkeys was based on cooked food, consisting of 100 g rice, one medium size egg, 50 g peanuts, 15 g sugar, and 100 g potato daily, which amounted to the total energy of approximately 1,060 calories. The animals accepted this type of food and the diet was maintained unchanged for 1 month until the animals were humanely killed.</p>

In this procedure the GC-MS chromatograms were exported as NetCDF files (ANDI MS format) using Leco ChromaTOF software (version 3.25) with the following settings: baseline subtraction just above the noise (1.0), peak width broadening with width-to-time (w/t) of 3.5/0 seconds—6.0/1,400 seconds, and without smoothing. Peak smoothing (nine data points) and alignment were performed within msPeak for each mass trace separately using peak spread and peak gap to neighboring peaks.</p>
<p>To limit the potential technical artifacts, we employed a multistep peak filtering procedure to all MS datasets. The LC-MS datasets were filtered according to the following criteria:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p>retention time (RT) ≥0.6 min,</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>peaks present in ≥80% of pooled samples with an intensity of ≥1,000 arbitrary units (AU),</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>peaks showing consistent concentration levels in the first two pooled samples of the LC-MS datasets, which corresponds to the maximal time that any of the samples were kept in the autosampler before measuring,</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>peaks present at the level of ≥10,000 AU in ≥50% of samples of any particular species and tissue.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>Before applying the last filtering criterion, outlier samples were removed from the datasets. Outliers were identified based on PCA plots and included nine samples in the [+]LC-MS and [−]LC-MS datasets. This filtering procedure resulted in 4,458 [+]LC-MS peaks and 2,956 [−]LC-MS peaks satisfying all the criteria, which corresponds to 6% of the initially registered peaks.</p>
<p>The GC dataset was filtered according to following criteria:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p>peaks distinct from the background, which we define as a measurable peak width at the level of 10% of its apex,</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>RT of a peak in all samples within the range of 2 min around the median RT of this peak,</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>RT outside of the range of 0.75 min of the RTs of any of the used internal standards (IS) RTs or, if the peak shares the same mass with any of the IS, outside of the range of 1.5 of the RT of this IS,</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>peak level ≥3,000 AU in ≥50% of samples of samples of any particular species and tissue,</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>peaks with the same mass and RT differing by ≤0.5 were classified as overlapping and removed.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>Before applying criteria 4, nine outlier samples identified based on PCA analysis were removed from the dataset. The filtering resulted in 3,201 peaks in this dataset, representing 9% of the initial peak set.</p>
<p>In the quantitative part of our analysis, we used the entire set of unannotated peaks satisfying the above quality criteria. This set was narrowed down to the identified molecules in further functional analysis.</p>

<title>Normalization</title>
<p>All peak concentration values were log transformed and quintile normalized. The normalization was performed on groups of samples belonging to the same tissue, an approach that was selected out of several other methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Bolstad1">[25]</xref> according to normalization-quality measures of peak variation within samples of the same tissue and species.</p>

<title>RNA-seq Reads Alignment and Mapping</title>
<p>We used Bowtie2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Langmead1">[26]</xref> with a default parameter setting to align the reads to the respective genomes: human version hg19, chimp panTro3, rhesus rheMac2, and mouse version mm9 from the Ensembl66 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Flicek1">[27]</xref>. Bowtie2 reports up to two possible alignments for each read. For further analysis we kept reads with alignment score &gt;150 and, among those that mapped to two locations, only those with a difference in alignment score ≥5. Among reads that mapped to an exon and exon junction, those with higher scores were kept. The one that mapped to an exon was kept if the scores were equal. Following this procedure, we obtained 24.1 M mapped reads per sample on average. Gene expression was quantified as (N*100)/(L-99) where N is the number of reads aligned to gene exons and L is the total length of the gene exons. We used the liftOver tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Kuhn1">[28]</xref> to map the human genome onto the genomes of the other three species. Comparison of gene expression among three primate species was based on the genome mapping reported by the liftOver tool. For reconstruction of the mouse and human junctions, we additionally used mouse genome annotation and homology information. In the comparison of mouse to other species, we restricted the set of genes' exons to those that could be mapped among all four species. In the comparison of gene expression among primates, we used a larger set of genes' exons that could be mapped among the three primate species. As a cutoff for a minimal level of expression of the analyzed genes, we selected the 5% quintile of all gene nonzero expression levels in all samples.</p>

<title>Hierarchical ANOVA</title>
<p>We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify metabolite peaks showing significant concentration level differences among species or tissues, or significant species–tissue interaction term (F-test <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). ANOVA was performed on all samples and on the samples of primates only (primate test). For peaks showing a significant proportion of variation explained by species and species–tissue terms in ANOVA, we performed an additional <italic>t</italic>-test to identify the species in which the metabolite peak concentration levels were significantly different from the other species. Metabolite peaks significant in the primate ANOVA test were tested for peak specificity to any primate species; peaks significant in the ANOVA test performed on all species samples were tested for mouse-specific concentration levels. In the <italic>t</italic>-test, samples from each tissue were tested separately. In each test, peak levels of a given species were compared with the peak levels in the samples of the remaining species—other primates if the tested species were primate, all primates if the tested species was mouse. ANOVA and <italic>t</italic>-test significance levels were corrected for multiple testing and the FDR levels at different nominal test significance levels were estimates by sample label permutations. Peaks showing <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 and FDR&lt;5% in 1,000 permutations were considered significant.</p>
<p>In addition to the initial set of five tissues that the samples were collected from, we defined two composite neural tissues obtained by <italic>in silico</italic> grouping of specific brain regions: cortex tissue was defined as a combination of two cortical regions: PFC and V1; brain tissue was defined as a combination of all three brain regions. In the <italic>t</italic>-test used to identify species-specific peak concentration levels in these tissues, all samples of the composite tissues were used.</p>
<p>In analyses of species-specific metabolic changes unique to the five individual tissues used in this study, we excluded metabolite peaks with concentration levels specific to a given species and showing the same direction (increase or decrease) of change in multiple tissues within three tissue groups: <italic>(i)</italic> PFC and V1; <italic>(ii)</italic> cortex and CBC; <italic>(ii)</italic> brain, kidney, and muscle.</p>

<title>Identification of Environment- and Postmortem Delay-Induced Metabolite Concentration Changes</title>
<p>In order to identify metabolite peaks with concentration levels altered by changes in diet, stress, and physical activity in macaques, we performed a <italic>t</italic>-test on the tissue samples from condition 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 6) or condition 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 6) macaque individuals and the control tissue samples of all macaque individuals with unaltered environmental conditions (<italic>n</italic> = 17) in each tissue. Peaks showing significant difference (<italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) in condition 1 or condition 2 samples and showing the same direction of change in the human samples (elevated or decreased) were classified as affected by environmental change in condition 1 or condition 2, respectively. The overlap with human-specific metabolite concentration changes was determined as an overlap of environment-induced changes in a given tissue, and metabolite concentration differences showing the same direction (elevated or decreased) in this tissue in the human samples as compared with the control macaques.</p>
<p>In order to identify metabolite peaks with concentration levels altered by postmortem delay, we quantified the differences in peak concentration levels in each tissue between the macaque samples from individuals living in control conditions collected with 4- and 6-hour postmortem delay (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and macaque samples from individuals living in control conditions collected with less than 15 min postmortem delay (<italic>n</italic> = 17). Peaks showing concentration differences in the top or bottom 5% quintile of all peak differences between postmortem samples and control samples were excluded from further analyses in the respective tissue.</p>

<title>Clustering of Metabolite Concentration Differences among Tissues</title>

<title>Gene Expression Analysis</title>
<p>Based on the gene expression measurements of the 120 tissue samples we searched for genes showing expression profiles specific to a particular tissue and specific to a particular species in a given tissue. For each gene we calculated the mean difference of its expression level between every pair of tissues and between every pair of species in each tissue. Genes showing differences in expression level in a particular tissue compared with all other tissues, or species compared with all other species in the same tissue, within the upper or lower 5% quintile (10% quintile in the tissue comparison) of the difference distribution were classified as tissue-specific or species-specific in a given tissue respectively.</p>

<title>Peak Annotation and Pathway Analysis</title>
<p>We used accurate mass searches with a mass tolerance of 5 ppm, allowing [M+H], [M+NH<sub>4</sub>] and [M+Na] as possible adducts in positive ionization mode samples and [M−H] and [M+Formic acid-H] in negative ionization mode samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Giavalisco1">[23]</xref>. The obtained m/z values were then searched against the HMDB database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Wishart1">[29]</xref> for annotation of the [+]LC-MS and [−]LC-MS datasets. For the annotation of the GC-MS dataset, all of the GC-MS dataset chromatograms were processed and aligned as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Huege1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Krall1">[31]</xref> using several reference compound libraries of commercially available authentic standards measured on the employed GC-MS system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Krall1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Schauer1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>We used the resulting annotation to assign the metabolites to specific KEGG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001871-Kanehisa1">[34]</xref> pathways and inspected metabolic pathways overrepresented in the two types of metabolite groups found in our analysis: clusters of all peaks and peaks showing species-specific concentration levels in different tissues. We used metabolite annotation from both HMDB and KEGG databases to link the metabolites to metabolic pathways. Hypergeometric test (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, permutation <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) was used to identify pathways with significant overrepresentation of metabolites belonging to a specific metabolite group, as compared with other metabolites measured in our study. In the search for KEGG pathways with significant overrepresentation of metabolites showing species-specific concentration profiles, we used all metabolites measured in this study as a background for the hypergeometric and permutation tests. In the search for KEGG pathways with significant overrepresentation of metabolites from 13 metabolite clusters, we used all metabolites belonging to clusters with concentration profiles specific to tissues different from the tissue of the tested cluster as a background for the hypergeometric and permutation tests.</p>

<title>Agreement between Metabolite and Gene Expression Data</title>
<p>We assessed the agreement between metabolite concentration levels and expression of their linked enzymes. Among genes detected in the transcriptome data, we extracted those reported by the KEGG database as enzymes linked, based on reaction information, to the metabolites measured in our metabolite datasets. Next, we tested the overrepresentation of enzymes with expression profiles matching concentration profiles of metabolites among: <italic>(i)</italic> enzymes annotated in pathways with significant overrepresentation of metabolites showing species-specific concentration profiles in a tissue, as well as pathways with significant overrepresentation of metabolites from tissue-specific metabolite clusters; <italic>(ii)</italic> enzymes directly linked to metabolites based on KEGG annotation in the tissue-specific clusters or the species-specific metabolites.</p>
<p>In the pathway-based analysis <italic>(i)</italic> we tested both the overrepresentation of pathway enzymes with a corresponding expression profile, as well as pathway enzymes with a corresponding expression profile directly linked to the pathway metabolites with species-specific concentration profile or belonging to a tissue-specific cluster. In the link-based analysis <italic>(ii)</italic> we tested only the overrepresentation of enzymes showing corresponding expression profiles directly linked to the cluster metabolites or species-specific metabolites in KEGG annotation. In this test, in an iterative procedure, we randomly sampled sets of metabolites of the same size as the tested metabolite group—species-specific or tissue-specific cluster metabolites—and calculated the proportion of enzymes of the matching expression profile among all enzymes connected to the sampled metabolite. In the random permutations, we only used metabolites reported to interact with any of the enzymes measured in our transcriptome analysis. In the analysis of clusters and cluster pathways, the metabolites were sampled from all metabolites belonging to clusters with concentration profiles specific to a tissue different from the tissue of the tested cluster. The proportion of enzymes with the corresponding expression profile linked to the tested metabolite group—pathway <italic>(i)</italic> or cluster <italic>(ii)</italic>—was compared with the proportion obtained in the sampling test.</p>

<title>Metabolite and Pathway Functional Groups</title>
<p>To facilitate functional analysis of metabolites showing species-specific concentration profiles in different tissues and KEGG pathways with significant overrepresentation of these metabolites, we grouped pathways according to shared metabolites into functional units. Following the pathway enrichment analysis, in each species-specific metabolite group, metabolites belonging to two or more KEGG pathways and sharing more than two-thirds of the overrepresented pathways were incrementally grouped into functional units until no two metabolites sharing sufficient numbers of pathways could be grouped together. This process resulted in functional units and metabolite groups representing different metabolic functionality.</p>

<title>Muscle Strength Measurements</title>
<p>We designed an experimental setup for testing muscular strength of humans, chimpanzees, and macaques that would be applicable to all three species to a similar extent. Specifically, the measurements were conducted using a simple mechanical apparatus consisting of a sliding shelf attached to a handle on one side, and suspended adjustable weights on the other side of the shelf. In chimpanzee and macaque experiments, the handle was placed inside a cage and the individual was encouraged to displace the shelf (by pulling from the handle) to bring food within her reach. Pulling on the handle required the individual to lift the respective weight attached to the shelf by engaging both upper and lower body parts. The strength of the pull was registered by an electronic scale placed on the shelf and attached to a rope connecting the handle and the weight. In order to register the maximal pulling force, the electronic scale was continuously filmed by a camera placed on the moving shelf. With each individual's successful pull, the amount of weight attached to the device was increased. After several failed attempts by an individual to pull a certain weight, the amount of food on the device was increased. The maximum pull force measured by the electronic scale divided by the individual's body weight was used as a normalized measure of an individual's strength.</p>
<p>For nonhuman primate experiments, six healthy male macaques of 5–6 years of age with body mass 7–10 kg and five chimpanzees (three females and two males) of 8–11 and 37 years of age and body mass 32–55 kg were tested. All selected individuals had no medical history or reported abnormal behavior and were healthy during the strength experiments. Macaques were borrowed from breeding facilities at Suzhou Experimental Animal Center, China, where the tests were performed, and returned to the breeding facility after the tests. Macaque monkeys, prior to the muscle tests, were housed in spacious enclosures of approximately 120 m<sup>3</sup>. Each enclosure hosted a group of approximately 20 individuals and contained multiple objects used for climbing. Chimpanzee tests were performed at the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Zoo, Germany. The Zoo enclosures are large and contain objects imitating a natural chimpanzee environment, including climbing facilities.</p>
<p>For human experiments, a total of 42 human individuals were tested. Thirty-six of them were tested using the Suzhou apparatus and eight using the Leipzig apparatus. Human individuals included 29 adults 17–34 years of age with a wide span of body mass between 42 and 127 kg (mean 64 kg±15 kg SD). Among these individuals, four were professional climbers and 12 were engaged in regular physical activities. In addition, we tested 15 teenagers (13–14 years, seven females, eight males, body mass 43–69 kg, mean 53 kg±7 kg) with ages corresponding to the ages of the tested macaques and some of the tested chimpanzees. For all teenagers participating in this study, we obtained written consent from their parents in addition to the subjects' assent.</p>
