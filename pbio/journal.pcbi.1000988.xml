<p>Copy-number variations (CNVs) are widespread in the human genome, but comprehensive assignments of integer locus copy-numbers (<italic>i.e.</italic>, copy-number genotypes) that, for example, enable discrimination of homozygous from heterozygous CNVs, have remained challenging. Here we present CopySeq, a novel computational approach with an underlying statistical framework that analyzes the depth-of-coverage of high-throughput DNA sequencing reads, and can incorporate paired-end and breakpoint junction analysis based CNV-analysis approaches, to infer locus copy-number genotypes. We benchmarked CopySeq by genotyping 500 chromosome 1 CNV regions in 150 personal genomes sequenced at low-coverage. The assessed copy-number genotypes were highly concordant with our performed qPCR experiments (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.94), and with the published results of two microarray platforms (95–99% concordance). We further demonstrated the utility of CopySeq for analyzing gene regions enriched for segmental duplications by comprehensively inferring copy-number genotypes in the CNV-enriched &gt;800 olfactory receptor (OR) human gene and pseudogene loci. CopySeq revealed that OR loci display an extensive range of locus copy-numbers across individuals, with zero to two copies in some OR loci, and two to nine copies in others. Among genetic variants affecting OR loci we identified deleterious variants including CNVs and SNPs affecting ∼15% and ∼20% of the human OR gene repertoire, respectively, implying that genetic variants with a possible impact on smell perception are widespread. Finally, we found that for several OR loci the reference genome appears to represent a minor-frequency variant, implying a necessary revision of the OR repertoire for future functional studies. CopySeq can ascertain genomic structural variation in specific gene families as well as at a genome-wide scale, where it may enable the quantitative evaluation of CNVs in genome-wide association studies involving high-throughput sequencing.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human individual genome sequencing has recently become affordable, enabling highly detailed genetic sequence comparisons. While the identification and genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms has already been successfully established for different sequencing platforms, the detection, quantification and genotyping of large-scale copy-number variants (CNVs), <italic>i.e.</italic>, losses or gains of long genomic segments, has remained challenging. We present a computational approach that enables detecting CNVs in sequencing data and accurately identifies the actual copy-number at which DNA segments of interest occur in an individual genome. This approach enabled us to obtain novel insights into the largest human gene family – the olfactory receptors (ORs) – involved in smell perception. While previous studies reported an abundance of CNVs in ORs, our approach enabled us to globally identify absolute differences in OR gene counts that exist between humans. While several OR genes have very high gene counts, other ORs are found only once or are missing entirely in some individuals. The latter have a particularly high probability of influencing individual differences in the perception of smell, a question that future experimental efforts can now address. Furthermore, we observed differences in OR gene counts between populations, pointing at ORs that might contribute to population-specific differences in smell.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Structural variants in the human genome, such as CNVs or balanced inversions, represent a major form of variation with widespread functional consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Zhang1">[1]</xref>. Numerous surveys mapping CNVs at varying levels of resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Sebat1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Iafrate1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Kidd1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref> have created a comprehensive CNV inventory, with the latest survey reporting 1,098 CNVs on average between two individuals spanning nearly 0.8% of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref>. Collectively, the list of reported CNVs presently involves 8,410 loci (Database of Genomic Variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Iafrate1">[3]</xref>, DGV) when applying the frequently used operational definition for CNVs, <italic>i.e.</italic>, gains and losses of segments 1 kb or larger in size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Feuk1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent studies have associated CNVs with various phenotypes, including benign and disease-related phenotypes such as cancer, HIV-1/AIDS susceptibility, autoimmunity, and complex disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Zhang1">[1]</xref> and references therein). Yet, while different conceptual approaches for CNV-discovery have been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Chiang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Yoon1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Ye1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Lee1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel2">[13]</xref> most CNV analysis approaches presently do not distinguish CNVs based on the copy-number of the underlying DNA segment, <italic>i.e.</italic>, its <italic>copy-number genotype</italic>, a distinction that is crucial for leveraging CNV assignments for studies focusing on genome evolution and genotype-phenotype associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref>. For example, copy-number genotypes enable distinguishing <italic>bi-allelic</italic> loci (<italic>i.e.</italic>, loci at which in addition to the reference allele either a single duplication or a single deletion allele is observed) from <italic>multi-allelic</italic> loci (<italic>i.e.</italic>, loci with more than one variant, such as deletion and duplication, or multiple duplications). Furthermore, in bi-allelic loci copy-number genotypes allow discriminating <italic>heterozygous</italic> from <italic>homozygous</italic> CNVs. Such information is crucial in association studies, where the failure to assign locus copy-numbers or to discriminate heterozygotes from homozygotes limits the statistical power. Recently, improvements in microarray technology have led to advances in CNV analysis by facilitating the ascertainment of copy-number genotypes in genomic regions amenable to hybridization by high-resolution comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH) or state-of-the-art SNP/CNV hybrid array platforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref>. While microarrays have advantages in enabling CNV ascertainment at high-throughput and low-cost, their resolution can be limited in CNV-rich regions involving segmental duplications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Sharp1">[15]</xref> (SDs). This might be because of probe cross-hybridization issues, which may reduce the number of effective oligonucleotide probes that can be designed for these regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Urban1">[16]</xref>. Indeed, commercial microarray-based approaches for copy-number genotyping are restricted to genomic loci for which probes are available at sufficient densities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref>, while custom array designs may compensate for probe densities with the remaining limitation of relying on regions for which effective probes can be designed.</p>
<p>Recent breakthroughs in ‘Next Generation Sequencing’ (NGS) technologies have stimulated the development of computational approaches that enable the discovery of CNVs with excellent quantitative and spatial resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Chiang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Yoon1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Ye1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Lee1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel2">[13]</xref>. In this regard, several studies have demonstrated that the sequencing depth-of-coverage of NGS reads can be employed for CNV-discovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Chiang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Yoon1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Campbell1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Xie1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Alkan1">[19]</xref>. For example, Xie <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Xie1">[18]</xref> and Chiang <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Chiang1">[8]</xref> described CNV-discovery approaches conceptually related to array-CGH analysis, whereby the read-depth in genomic intervals is compared between pairs of samples to detect CNVs as relational changes in studies involving case/reference setups (<italic>e.g.</italic>, cancer tissue <italic>vs.</italic> healthy tissue). Furthermore, Alkan <italic>et al.</italic> recently reported an elegant read-count based approach for mapping locus copy-number differences in large (≥20 kb) SDs using high-coverage (6 to 20-fold coverage) NGS data, by equating averaged and rounded read-counts in individual samples with integer locus copy-numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Alkan1">[19]</xref>. However, with recent advances enabling sequencing hundreds of genomes in studies focused on population genetics or genotype-phenotype correlations, a statistical framework for copy-number genotyping will soon become a prerequisite to enable the probabilistic ascertainment of CNV sets in NGS-based association studies. To be useful for genome-wide association studies, a NGS-based copy-number genotyping approach needs to provide absolute locus copy-number estimates in a sample-specific manner and needs to be able to determine confidence values for each copy-number genotype (to maximize statistical power). Furthermore, it should enable accurate ascertainment of a wide range of CNVs, including rare and common ones, and including those at the 1–20 kb size-range, a highly abundant CNV size-class <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel1">[4]</xref>. Lastly, the ability to utilize low-coverage (<italic>i.e.</italic>, ≤4× coverage) NGS datasets, <italic>i.e.</italic>, datasets such as the ones generated by the ‘1000 Genomes Project’ (1000GP; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://1000genomes.org" xlink:type="simple">http://1000genomes.org</ext-link>), will be a crucial asset for such a copy-number genotyping approach, given that sample number and sequencing coverage will be at a constant tradeoff in future association studies.</p>
<p>Here, we present CopySeq, a statistical framework for copy-number genotype inference from low-coverage genomes, which is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://embl.de/~korbel/copyseq/" xlink:type="simple">http://embl.de/~korbel/copyseq/</ext-link>. As a benchmark we used CopySeq to genotype a set of CNVs previously analyzed with microarrays and obtained excellent genotyping concordances for CNVs across a wide size-range. In addition, as a proof-of-principle we used the approach to infer copy-number genotypes in the largest human gene family, with many genes and pseudogenes embedded within SDs: <italic>i.e.</italic>, we analyzed the &gt;800 olfactory receptor (OR) genes and pseudogenes in the human genome. OR genes form one of the most genetically variable and rapidly evolving protein-coding gene families and display a strong enrichment for CNVs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Nozawa1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Hasin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Young1">[22]</xref> compared to most other gene families. Thus, the OR gene family represents an appealing model for assessing copy-number genotype ascertainment using low-coverage sequencing and for studying the effect of CNVs on protein coding loci. Owing to the comparative nature of earlier studies, CNVs in ORs were thus far mostly reported as <italic>gains</italic> and <italic>losses</italic> relative to an arbitrarily chosen reference sample, and for most ORs no absolute locus copy-number assignments have been reported so far. Thus, the full nature and extent of copy-number variation in ORs remained unknown. Notably, it is presently unclear to what degree single deletions or duplications (<italic>i.e.</italic>, bi-allelic) or multiple recurrent CNV-formation events (<italic>i.e.</italic>, multi-allelic) affect particular OR loci, an information that is crucial for functional analyses as multiple alleles can reduce signals in association studies. Our analysis of ORs using CopySeq revealed a widespread diversity in integer locus copy-numbers in human OR loci in the 150 individuals assessed. We report a segregation of copy-number variable OR loci into bi-allelic, multi-allelic, and non-variable CNVs, with notable population differences in some OR loci. In addition, our analysis enabled us to address and further dissect genomic biases that may influence the extent of CNVs affecting ORs, including functional (genes <italic>vs.</italic> pseudogenes), DNA sequence context (non-repetitive <italic>vs.</italic> repetitive DNA), and evolutionary (‘<italic>young</italic>’ <italic>vs.</italic> ‘<italic>ancient</italic>’ ORs) biases.</p>

<title>A statistical framework for copy-number genotyping in NGS data</title>
<p>CopySeq enables the inference of copy-number genotypes in genomic loci suspected to differ in copy-number (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The first step undertaken by CopySeq, termed <italic>locus selection</italic>, involves the definition of putative CNV loci. Loci may be selected based on biological considerations, <italic>e.g.</italic>, to enable copy-number genotyping comprehensively in previously published CNV sets, or in a more focused manner in candidate loci of an association study. Following locus selection, the <italic>mappability assessment</italic> step assesses the mappability of all <italic>k</italic>-mer subsequences of the selected loci to identify sequence stretches that are unambiguously (uniquely) mappable with short reads, <italic>i.e.</italic>, such with no exact duplicate sequence in the reference genome. This step assures exclusion of (1) unspecific reads and (2) reads originating from paralogous sequences. Then, in the <italic>read-mapping</italic> step DNA reads are aligned onto the reference genome, and only unique matches retained, using a fast read-mapper such as the MAQ or BWA algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Li1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Li2">[24]</xref>. Lastly, the <italic>copy-number genotyping</italic> step measures the locus-specific read-depth in the mappable sequence fraction and infers copy-number genotypes for each sample by relating the resulting read-depth value to the expected locus read-depth after correction for GC-content biases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Li3">[25]</xref> using a smoothing spline-based approach. In particular, CopySeq uses a Gaussian classifier that regards discrete locus copy-numbers as probability distributions and infers copy-number genotypes with confidence scores (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The copy-number genotype thereby indicates the diploid copy-number of a locus of interest in a given genome. In the case of bi-allelic CNVs, this enables distinguishing homozygous from heterozygous CNVs (<italic>e.g.</italic>, heterozygous deletion = ‘1’ copy; homozygous deletion = ‘0’ copies; homozygous reference allele, or ‘no deletion’ = ‘2’ copies).</p>

<p>Optionally, CopySeq incorporates redefined boundaries (or breakpoints) of CNVs, available for confined CNV subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Lam1">[26]</xref>, prior to the <italic>copy-number genotyping</italic> step by applying different conceptual approaches: <italic>i.e.</italic>, ‘paired-end mapping’ (PEM), which identifies CNVs from paired reads that map abnormally onto the reference genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel1">[4]</xref>; or ‘breakpoint-junction sequence analysis’ (BJA), which detects CNVs by aligning sequence reads onto CNV breakpoint-junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Lam1">[26]</xref>. The rationale for applying such boundary-redefinition approaches is that accurate (<italic>i.e.</italic>, redefined) CNV-boundaries facilitate the proper interpretation of read-depth data, thus enabling more accurate copy-number genotype inference (see below).</p>

<p>To assess the performance of CopySeq on low-coverage genome sequences we acquired NGS data from 150 individuals with different ancestries, <italic>i.e.</italic>, genomes that were recently sequenced at low coverage in the 1000GP pilot phase 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s021">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>): 52 unrelated African individuals with ancestry from Nigeria (Yoruba from Ibadan; YRI); 53 Asians, including 29 unrelated Chinese individuals from Beijing (CHB) and 24 unrelated Japanese from Tokyo (JPT; we analyzed all 53 Asian individuals together as the “CHB+JPT” group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Frazer1">[27]</xref>); and 45 individuals of European ancestry from Utah (CEU), USA, including 42 unrelated individuals and 3 members of a parent-offspring trio.

<title>Assessing the genotyping concordance of 500 CNVs on chromosome 1</title>
<p>To evaluate CopySeq, we first assembled known CNVs from human chromosome 1, for which copy-number genotypes were previously inferred with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref> (a SNP/CNV hybrid microarray platform).

Out of 100 CNVs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref> with a median size of 6.8 kb (mean = 11.2 kb), only one CNV displayed less than 500 mappable 36-mers and thus was excluded (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We found that most CNV loci were covered by an appreciable number of sequencing reads, with a mean of 685 reads (median = 418). CopySeq was used to generate 14,850 (99 loci times 150 samples) copy-number genotypes in this CNV set, with inferred locus copy-numbers ranging from ‘0’ copies up to ‘5’ copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s025">Table S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s009">Figures S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s010">S9</xref>). The copy-number genotypes displayed an excellent genotyping concordance of 98.9% with the Affymetrix-array based results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s023">Tables S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s026">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s027">S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g002">Figures 2ABC</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s019">S18A</xref>). Note that by assuming that array-based genotypes are correct, genotyping concordances achieved with CopySeq can be considered as lower bound estimates for genotyping accuracies (note that discordances in specific genotypes could obviously be either due to errors in the array-based genotypes or due to errors in CopySeq's genotypes). In general, deletion genotypes inferred by CopySeq yielded higher concordances than duplication genotypes. We quantified this by calculating the positive predictive value (PPV) for deletions (99.6%) and duplications (89.1%) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s028">Table S8</xref>), suggesting that while both deletions and duplications are identified at high accuracy, duplications are more difficult to ascertain than deletions by CopySeq, microarray-based genotyping, or both methods.</p>

<p>We also estimated genotyping concordances for various different CNV size cutoffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and, as expected, observed an increase in concordance between CopySeq and Affymetrix-arrays with CNV size. However, high concordances were obtained also for relatively small CNVs (<italic>e.g.</italic>, 97.5% for CNVs 1–2 kb in size), suggesting the applicability of CopySeq across a wide CNV size-range in 3–4× coverage sequence data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we combined CopySeq with PEM and BJA (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), and found that CNV-boundary redefinition with PEM or BJA leads to improved genotyping concordances. Specifically, when applying PEM we measured a genotyping concordance with Affymetrix-arrays of 99.6%, and when applying BJA we measured a concordance of 99.7% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s022">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s029">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s030">S10</xref>) – although the numbers of CNVs ascertained was comparably low for BJA and PEM, as for many loci the CNV-boundaries were unknown. A further advantage of CNV-boundary redefinition is that it can help untangle complex CNV loci, as we exemplified below.</p>
<p>We also compared CopySeq's copy-number genotypes to genotypes recently inferred with a high-resolution Agilent oligonucleotide array-CGH platform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref> through analyzing 401 CNV regions on chromosome 1 with a median size of 3.1 kb. Conrad <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref> analyzed 450 individuals out of which 149 overlapped with our study. Our analysis resulted in an excellent, albeit slightly weaker genotyping concordance of 89.1% – with small CNVs displaying higher concordances than large CNVs and some CNVs displaying 0% concordance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s035">Tables S15</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s019">Figure S18B</xref>). When looking for the source of the discordance we found that many of the disagreeing copy-number genotypes occurred in large (&gt;10 kb) CNVs embedded in SDs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>). Altogether, four of these large CNVs were ascertained both by the Agilent and the Affymetrix platform. We found that whereas in all four regions the Agilent CGH arrays tended to agree with CopySeq in a relative sense (mean Pearson correlation coefficient 0.78), Agilent array-CGH was for all four CNVs discordant with both the Affymetrix SNP arrays and CopySeq in terms of the absolute copy-number reported (note that absolute copy-numbers agreed between CopySeq and Affymetrix arrays in these regions; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s037">Table S17</xref>). To improve the comparability between the platforms, we thus reasonably excluded CNVs intersecting with SDs when analyzing the Agilent array-CGH based results. This led to an overall improved copy-number genotyping concordance of 94.8% between CopySeq and Agilent array-CGH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s036">Table S16</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we compared CopySeq to Alkan <italic>et al.</italic>'s approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Alkan1">[19]</xref>, which interprets averaged read-depths as locus copy-numbers (<italic>i.e.</italic>, depth-of-coverage analysis without probabilistic genotyping model). We used CopySeq to analyze published short sequence reads from a single African male individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Bentley1">[28]</xref> which previously had been analyzed with regard to copy-number variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Alkan1">[19]</xref>, and obtained a better concordance with Affymetrix SNP array-based copy-numbers for CopySeq (97.2%) than for depth-of-coverage analysis without genotyping model (80.2%). As suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Alkan1">[19]</xref> these concordance estimations excluded SD regions, as Alkan <italic>et al.</italic>'s approach infers copy-numbers in SDs as a genome-wide sum across all paralogous loci, rather than separately for each paralog (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s038">Table S18</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we randomly picked eighteen common CNVs and subjected them to quantitative PCR (qPCR) validation in three individuals each. The CNV sizes ranged from 707 bp to 127 kb (median size 3.7 kb) and most copy-number genotypes (65%) in these eighteen regions differed from the homozygous reference copy-number of ‘2’. In total, 49 out of 54 (91%) copy-number genotypes were supported by the qPCR experiments, results that were in good agreement with the genotyping concordances determined based on the microarray platforms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s039">Table S19</xref>). We further compared CopySeq's results to a set of loci that had previously been analyzed by fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Alkan1">[19]</xref>, with the FISH results validating CopySeq's copy-number genotypes in four out of five assessed loci (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s041">Table S21</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we tested the effect of sequencing coverage on CopySeq's performance by generating sub-coverage datasets (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, and 30×) of the high-coverage (∼40×) NA18507 genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Bentley1">[28]</xref> and assessed to what extent the genotype concordance with two complementary microarray platforms changed with coverage (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>). Although, unsurprisingly, genotyping accuracies improved with increasing coverage, low-coverage (3–4×) genomes displayed only a minor decrease in accuracy compared to a 30–40× genome (0.8–1.6%; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s017">Figure S16</xref>), suggesting low-coverage sequencing offers an excellent tradeoff between cost, throughput, and sensitivity in variant detection. We also assessed the effects sequencing errors may have on CopySeq's genotypes in low-coverage data, and found their influence to be minor (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Measuring copy-number genotypes in olfactory receptor (OR) loci across 150 individuals</title>
<p>Our initial assessment of CopySeq suggested an excellent accuracy in genomic regions ascertained with microarrays. Given that in principle any genomic region mappable by unique sequence reads can be analyzed with CopySeq, we next specifically assessed CopySeq's performance in a set of relatively hard-to-ascertain regions. Namely, as a proof-of-concept, we assessed genomic loci associated with the largest human gene family – <italic>i.e.</italic>, the 388 OR gene and 463 OR pseudogene loci, most of which are not ascertained by state-of-the-art commercial genotyping array platforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref>.

<p>We analyzed the OR loci as ∼3 kb regions encompassing the single-exon open reading frames (ORFs) and downstream as well as upstream sequence stretches (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We assessed the mappability of reads onto OR loci and excluded only ∼5% (22 genes and 21 pseudogenes) from our analysis, as they displayed less than 500 mappable 36-mers per locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s002">Figure S1</xref>).

<title>Constructing a personalized locus copy-number map of ORs in 150 individuals</title>
<p>We analyzed 808 mappable OR loci in 150 humans using CopySeq to construct a comprehensive and accurate OR locus copy-number map. Eleven of these loci are on chromosome X and thus naturally differ in copy-number between females and males. We thus focused in our analyses, described below, on CNVs in the 797 remaining autosomal regions, and made use of the eleven X-chromosomal regions for optimally setting the parameters of the method (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the Q-value; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Altogether, CopySeq inferred 4,573 loci with a copy-number different from the homozygous reference allele, which fell into 313 copy-number variable OR loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s024">Table S4</xref>). These involved 2,137 deletions (autosomal locus copies of ‘0’ to ‘1’) and 2,436 duplications (‘3’ and up to ‘9’ locus copies; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). We excluded six out of the 313 autosomal copy-number variable OR regions, on the basis of previous reports that these loci, or their closest paralogs in the genome, likely represent extremely rare CNVs in the reference genome, or alternatively mis-assemblies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Young1">[22]</xref> (these six loci displayed no, or very few, reference alleles). The remaining 307 loci were classified into 265 bi-allelic CNVs (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 135 bi-allelic deletions and 130 bi-allelic duplications) and 42 multi-allelic CNVs based on their inferred locus copy-numbers in 150 individuals (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The fraction of variable OR genes and pseudogenes is 33% (130/387) and 38% (137/464), respectively.

Pair-wise copy-number differences between all samples were calculated, and average copy-number differences across all pair-wise comparisons determined. The y-axis indicates the inter-individual copy-number difference as a percentage of the maximum average copy-number difference, and the x-axis indicates the percentage of all copy-number variable (polymorphic) OR loci for each OR frequency rank step.

The Affymetrix arrays ascertain ∼5% (46) of the autosomal 3 kb OR loci, allowing us to compare ∼5,400 copy-number genotypes in OR loci across the 118 overlapping samples. Indeed, copy-number genotypes reported in McCarroll <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref>, ranging from 0 to 6, show a strong correlation with our genotype calls (Pearson correlation = 0.91; <italic>P</italic>&lt;2.2e-16). We estimated a CNV false discovery rate of 1.7% (26/1561) and a sensitivity of 75% (1535/2061) for CopySeq (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), under the conservative assumption that the microarray-based calls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref> contain no false positives as well as no false negatives. Furthermore, under the same conservative assumption we estimated positive predictive values (or PPV) of 97% (683/704) for deletions and 99% (852/857) for duplications in the OR loci.

<p><italic>Third</italic>, we used qPCR to obtain independent validation results for our copy-number genotypes in 10 individuals across five loci, by assessing 50 copy-number genotypes through experimental validation (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Three of the five loci were randomly picked and two specifically selected since they displayed particular wide ranges in copy-number genotype (<italic>i.e.</italic>, up to ‘9’ copies). The loci further included regions that can reasonably be regarded as particularly hard to ascertain: <italic>i.e.</italic>, &gt;90% of the nucleotides overlapped with SDs in four loci; four loci displayed multi-allelic CNVs; and ∼50% (24/50) of the assessed copy-number genotypes corresponded to duplications. Nonetheless, measured correlations with CopySeq's copy-number genotypes were excellent for the qPCR measurements (Pearson correlation = 0.96, <italic>P</italic>&lt;2.2e-16; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s033">Table S13</xref>). Among these, we found that correlations were of high magnitude for CopySeq's genotypes including the extreme copy-number of ‘9’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), which suggests that CopySeq enables generating copy-number genotypes accurately over a wide range of locus copy-numbers.

<title>Comprehensive analysis of the OR copy-number map</title>
<p>Having established the accuracy of CopySeq in OR loci we next performed a global analysis of our OR copy-number map. First, we related deletions and duplications to previously published CNVs, <italic>i.e.</italic>, to CNVs reported in the DGV (version from December 2009) and in a recent microarray-based analysis of OR loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Hasin1">[21]</xref> currently not included in DGV. We found that 199 of the identified 307 copy-number variable autosomal OR loci overlap with already published CNVs. 50 out of 52 commonly variable OR loci (<italic>i.e.</italic>, such with reference allele frequency &lt;95%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s023">Table S3</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>) had previously been reported. The remaining 108 OR loci were previously not reported to vary in copy-number; this included 99/108 (92%) rare CNVs (allele frequency &lt;1.0%). Obviously, future surveys examining larger numbers of individuals are likely to report further rare CNVs affecting ORs.</p>
<p>Our genotype frequency analysis further revealed several instances in which the majority of individuals displayed a non-reference allele. Given the importance of establishing a common and comprehensive OR repertoire for functional studies we analyzed these cases in detail, first by calculating CNV allele frequencies in all bi-allelic loci. This analysis suggested that in eight OR loci (including, for instance, OR2BH1P) the reference allele represented a minor allele (<italic>i.e.</italic>, reference allele frequency &lt;50%); two of these loci involved genes (see below). Furthermore, we estimated reference allele frequencies in multi-allelic loci by assuming the presence of the homozygous reference allele if a locus copy-number of ‘2’ was inferred (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>). This analysis revealed that in one multi-allelic OR pseudogene locus (OR11J2P) the reference sequence appears to represent a minor frequency allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s023">Table S3</xref>). Moreover, we estimated confidence intervals (95%) for reference allele frequencies and identified five additional loci (<italic>e.g.</italic>, OR4A45P) that are situated in transition between minor and major alleles, <italic>i.e.</italic>, with an alternative allele frequency close to 50% (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We next analyzed in further detail OR loci that displayed unusual (<italic>i.e.</italic>, non-reference) copy-number genotypes in the vast majority of samples. In particular, our results indicated that OR4C3 and OR4C5 genes as well as the OR4C4P pseudogene (all located in one genomic interval on chromosome 11) are duplicated in most (&gt;95%) individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s023">Table S3</xref>). We mined an alternative assembly of the human genome and found a close duplication (95% identity) of this genomic interval at another, distinct location on chromosome 11, suggesting that the reference genome version at the original interval may either be based on a rare deletion in the region (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>), or may potentially represent a mis-assembly of the reference (as recently discussed in Young <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008). Whichever the case might be, absence of the common allele sequence from the reference genome and the high sequence identity between the duplicated segments, resulted in mapping of all reads originating from both loci onto one locus. Notably, we also identified a segment on chromosome 12 which contained three OR pseudogenes (OR7E140P, OR7E148P, OR7E149P) that were homozygously deleted in all European and Asian individuals, but were present in the Yoruba individuals with ∼36% allele frequency. The absence of orthologs of these pseudogenes in chimpanzee and orangutan suggests that they likely represent a recent human-specific insertion.</p>
<p>In addition, we assessed whether common, rather than rare CNVs are responsible for the majority of measured inter-individual OR copy-number differences. We thus ranked copy-number variable OR loci by the frequency at which they displayed an alternative (CNV) allele and recomputed the inter-individual OR copy-number differences. We found that a small number of relatively common variants affecting OR loci were responsible for most of the ascertained variation: <italic>i.e.</italic>, the ∼15% most commonly variable loci captured approximately ∼80% of the inter-individual copy-number differences, and the ∼50% most common loci captured ∼95% of the differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, common CNVs lead to most inter-individual differences in OR copy-number and thus may have a relatively strong impact on variation in smell perception in humans; these common variants thus represent attractive candidate regions for future association studies.</p>
<p>We mostly analyzed CNVs in an OR locus-by-locus basis. It is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, however, that CNVs present at high frequency (<italic>i.e.</italic>, OR loci that frequently display CNGs other than ‘0’) tend to cluster, suggesting that they may form CNV hotspots or correspond to <italic>large</italic> CNVs spanning multiple loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Hasin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Young1">[22]</xref>. We thus assessed consecutive CNV calls in annotated genomic OR clusters, assuming that adjacent OR loci that are both involved in a duplication or are both involved in a deletion, respectively, may potentially be explained by a single <italic>large</italic> CNV. This analysis revealed that ∼36% of CNV events involve single-OR-locus CNVs, whereas the remaining (potentially <italic>large</italic>) CNVs may span at least two adjacent OR loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s024">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Deletions are particularly likely to have an impact on smell perception, as they may abrogate OR function. In our set, we found that 14.5% (56/387) of the OR genes harbored at least one deletion allele, and in 5.9% (23/387) of the OR loci, deletions were observed with an allele frequency &gt;1.0%. Homozygous deletions are of particular interest due to their potential phenotypic effects. We found that these are widespread with 25% of the analyzed individuals displaying at least one homozygous OR gene deletion and some individuals displaying up to four such ‘holes’ in their functional OR content. To obtain an inclusive list of alleles responsible for holes in the human OR repertoire we also mined the 150 individuals for SNPs associated with OR gene inactivation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, those causing segregating pseudogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Menashe1">[29]</xref>) and identified 24 previously known and 49 novel SNPs resulting in altered OR gene start and stop codons (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s032">Table S12</xref>). The list of inactivating genetic variants, including locus deletions and segregating pseudogenes, covers ∼15% and ∼20% of the OR gene repertoire, respectively. These genetic variants represent excellent candidates for future association studies on olfaction.</p>

<title>Studying genomic biases with regard to CNVs in OR loci</title>
<p>We next used CopySeq to obtain insights into how region-specific genomic biases may have shaped the genomic distribution of CNVs affecting ORs. First, we compared the relative CNV abundance between OR pseudogenes and OR genes. In this regard, both random drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Nozawa1">[20]</xref> and selective constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Hasin1">[21]</xref> have been implicated in influencing the distribution of CNVs in OR genes and pseudogenes. Our analysis of copy-number genotypes indicated that pseudogenes generally show more variance in locus copy-number than genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Selective constraints can be assessed by examining deletions, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the removal of functional genes, as deletions are more often deleterious than duplications and thus are more biased away from functionally relevant genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Zhang1">[1]</xref> and references therein). We found that on average less genes (3.8 per individual, <italic>i.e.</italic>, 1.0% of the OR gene set) than pseudogenes (9.5 per individual, <italic>i.e.</italic>, 2.0%) were deleted per individual, a trend that was significant (2-fold relative depletion; <italic>P</italic> = 0.009 based on a permutation test; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>). Furthermore, 0.4 genes (0.1% of the OR gene set) and 3.9 pseudogenes (0.8% of the set) were homozygously deleted in each individual (8-fold relative depletion; <italic>P</italic> = 0.004, permutation test). Both trends persisted, but lost significance when excluding the 7E subfamily, a rapidly evolving OR subfamily with 85 members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Newman1">[30]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>). Thus, while selective constraints acting on OR genes may in part explain the distribution of CNVs in OR genes and pseudogenes, these constraints are not extensive for the OR family, and formational biases presumably contributed to the observed genomic distribution of CNVs affecting ORs (for example, we note that the proportion of multi-allelic loci among CNV loci is similar between OR gene and OR pseudogene loci, <italic>i.e.</italic>, in each case about 5%).</p>
<p>In contrast to previous surveys, CopySeq enabled us to comprehensively assess whether multi-allelic CNVs and bi-allelic CNVs affect OR loci in different sequence contexts. In particular, we assessed to what extent bi-allelic and multi-allelic CNVs occur in SDs. The enrichment of copy-variable ORs in SDs (90/307) was significantly higher compared to non-variable ORs (86/464) (∼1.6-fold; <italic>P</italic>&lt;1e-4, permutation test). Our results revealed that particularly multi-allelic OR loci were strongly enriched in SDs (3.5-fold over non-variable OR loci; <italic>P</italic> = 0, chi-square = 44.9, chi-square test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s013">Figure S12</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a 4.3-fold enrichment for loci displaying high copy-number genotypes (‘5’ and more copies; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s016">Figure S15</xref>) and a 2.7-fold enrichment for loci displaying both deletions and duplications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s013">Figure S12</xref>). This association is possibly due to the predisposition of regions rich in SDs to show recurrent CNV formation by non-allelic homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Sharp1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, CopySeq enabled us to dissect the contribution of evolutionarily <italic>young</italic> and more <italic>ancient</italic> ORs to copy-number variation in OR loci. It was reported that <italic>young</italic> ORs (some of which correspond to SDs) are particularly prone to be affected by CNVs, with <italic>young</italic> loci defined both based on the presence of paralogs sharing high sequence identity and based on the lack of one-to-one orthologs in the chimpanzee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Hasin1">[21]</xref>. Our analysis revealed that <italic>young</italic> ORs affected by CNVs mainly lie in multi-allelic loci. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g007">Figure 7</xref> multi-allelic loci displayed a significant enrichment for ORs with high sequence identity paralogs compared to both bi-allelic loci and non-variable loci (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the average sequence identity to the closest paralog was 84.5% in the multi-allelic loci and ≤73% in both the non-variable or bi-allelic loci, respectively; the differences are significant with <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001; t-test). Furthermore, multi-allelic ORs displayed a &gt;2-fold enrichment for ORs lacking a one-to-one ortholog in chimp compared to each other group (the differences were significant with <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001; Chi-square test). Possible explanations for the differences include selective constraints and formational biases, both of which likely vary among different genomic regions.</p>

<title>Population-specific aspects of OR copy-number variation</title>
<p>We next assessed whether CNVs affecting OR loci display differences among individuals from diverse ancestries. Even when excluding rare CNVs that were identified only once amongst all individuals we observed 19 CNVs only in the analyzed Africans, 18 only in the Asians, and 10 only in the Europeans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Furthermore, we carried out principal component analysis (PCA) of the copy-number genotypes generated across all 265 bi-allelic autosomal CNV loci. The PCA yielded a visible separation of the African group from the combined group of Europeans and Asians by the first two principal components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s014">Figure S13A</xref>), and a separation of all three ethnic groups when analyzing the second and third component (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s014">Figure S13B</xref>). Note that the better distinction of Africans from European and Asian groups is in line with the well documented bottleneck effect, as evident from multiple large scale SNP studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Frazer1">[27]</xref>. When examining the failure of the first component to separate the three ethnic groups we identified a common bi-allelic deletion spanning three OR genes (OR4C11, OR4P4, OR4S2) and two OR pseudogenes, which drove the separation into three visible clusters by the first component (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s014">Figure S13</xref>). The three clusters represent the average OR locus copy-number genotype, with the left cluster representing the homozygous reference allele, the central cluster the heterozygous deletion, and the right cluster the homozygous deletion, respectively. The PCA and further analysis showed that all African individuals analyzed in our survey have at least one copy of the allele, whereas 7–10% of Europeans and Asians have all three functional OR genes homozygously deleted. In this regard, for example, a deletion, which encompassed the OR52E8 gene, was observed with appreciable allele-frequency (18%) in the Africans, whereas the allele was not observed in the other populations. Overall our PCA analysis of bi-allelic loci reflects findings from previously published SNP results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Frazer1">[27]</xref>, even though we used only 265 bi-allelic loci in our PCA analysis as opposed to hundreds of thousands of SNPs. Lastly, CopySeq enabled us to examine population differences in the distribution of bi-allelic and multi-allelic OR loci: indeed, in at least 11 OR loci CNVs were observed as multi-allelic in one population and bi-allelic in another (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Dissecting a multi-allelic OR CNV region</title>
<p>We reasoned that the spatial resolution of NGS data may enable us to further dissect complex multi-allelic OR loci, <italic>i.e.</italic>, loci in which different CNV alleles coincide in the same genomic segment. Dissecting multi-allelic loci represents a crucial step to inform future association studies that examine the functional impact of each CNV allele separately. As a proof-of-principle we applied CNV-boundary redefinition to analyze a genomic interval containing the adjacent genes OR51A4 and OR51A2, which in some individuals form a fusion gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel1">[4]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g003">Figure 3BCD</xref>). In particular, since the sequenced breakpoints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel1">[4]</xref> of the deletion leading to the gene fusion fall into the respective OR coding regions, we inferred copy-number genotypes with CNV-boundary redefinition based on breakpoint-junction analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g003">Figure 3BCD</xref>). Our analysis with CopySeq revealed that while the deletion is a variant with ∼32% allele frequency, an additional duplication comprising only the OR51A2 gene is also frequently present, <italic>i.e.</italic>, was genotyped in 6 individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s024">Table S4</xref>). Thus, applying CopySeq with CNV-boundary redefinition can help facilitate the dissection of multi-allelic CNV loci.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have developed a computational approach, CopySeq, that discovers copy-number variable loci and subsequently assesses their locus copy-number in NGS data, using a rationale based on formal hypothesis testing. As such, CopySeq may facilitate analyzing CNVs in NGS-based genome–wide association studies. Our analyses revealed an excellent concordance of CopySeq with microarray platforms, qPCR experiments, and FISH experiments, suggesting high genotyping accuracy. We note that one possible source for discrepancies between array-CGH and CopySeq in CNVs intersecting with SDs might be the heuristic transformation of microarray intensity data in SDs into genotypes by population-wise clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref>. CopySeq does not apply population-wise clustering nor do its calls depend on comparing read-depths with reference samples for normalization. This makes CopySeq particularly suitable for genotyping CNVs in single individuals or for genotyping rare alleles (<italic>i.e.</italic>, cases where too few data exist for population-wise clustering).</p>
<p>While arrays are presently widely applied for CNV analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-WellcomeTrustCaseControlConsortium1">[31]</xref> we foresee that in the near future with the completion of the 1000GP and other large-scale NGS projects there will be more genomes sequenced than such for which comprehensive array-based genotyping data will be available. Consequently, we anticipate that in the future, NGS-based genotyping of CNVs is likely to be widely applied. NGS data are generated in a genome-wide fashion and sequencing data can be re-interpreted without requiring experimental re-design to enable accurate copy-number genotyping, once new high-confidence CNV sets are becoming available (<italic>e.g.</italic>, following the assembly of new sequence insertions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Kidd2">[32]</xref>). We expect that in the future, CopySeq will be applied along with CNV discovery approaches such as paired-end mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel1">[4]</xref> to combine the advantages of copy-number genotype ascertainment with accurate CNV discovery and CNV-boundary redefinition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we demonstrated that CopySeq accurately infers copy-number genotypes in SD regions (regions known to be hard to ascertain for genetic variants), <italic>i.e.</italic>, in the OR gene family that is rich in highly identical paralogs. Our analysis of 150 individuals afforded the first comprehensive ascertainment of locus copy-numbers in the OR gene family. We found that more than a third of the human reference OR repertoire varies in copy-number across individuals and described many novel CNVs. Our first comprehensive report of copy-number genotypes in these regions provides a valuable resource for the community, since genotypes are an important prerequisite in associating CNVs with odor perception. While previous reports demonstrated an enrichment of variable ORs in SDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Young1">[22]</xref>, our analysis revealed that multi-allelic and bi-allelic OR loci are differentially affected by SDs. In some cases, we furthermore observed distinct OR gene counts in different populations. We note that while many more individuals need to be genotyped before population-specificity of these variants can be confirmed, allele frequency differences are likely to contribute to population differences in smell-perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Wysocki1">[33]</xref>. Also, while other studies hypothesized that OR genes and pseudogenes evolved in a neutral fashion by genomic drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Nozawa1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Young1">[22]</xref>, our data suggest weak evolutionary pressures acting on OR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000988-g004">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s018">S17</xref>).</p>
<p>We further observed an abundance of OR genes that are dysfunctional in a subset of the individuals analyzed. In this regard, OR deletion alleles and SNPs leading to gene pseudogenization are widespread, <italic>i.e.</italic>, about 15% and 20% of the functional OR repertoire harbor such variants, respectively. These inactivating variants represent attractive candidates for future association studies focusing on odorant perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Menashe1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Keller1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>While CopySeq enables probabilistic copy-number genotyping in NGS data, it still has its limitations. One limitation of CopySeq is that it is confined to sequences already present in the reference genome – a limitation that will likely diminish soon, when more alternative human genome assemblies will become available. Furthermore, only unambiguously mappable sequences are considered by CopySeq. In this regard, ∼1% of the human genome is in very recently segmentally duplicated regions with &gt;99.5% identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-She1">[35]</xref> – a fraction in which most short DNA reads will be non-unique. These regions are presently excluded by CopySeq. However, we reasonable expect that this limitation will diminish soon, as longer and more easily mappable reads (150 bp, or longer) are presently becoming the standard in NGS. In fact, in the upcoming main phase of the 1000GP human genomes will be sequenced mostly with paired-ends, with each end 100–150 bp in size or longer, which will facilitate the application of CopySeq in recently duplicated regions. Also, longer reads will enable the fine-mapping of CNV breakpoints and consequently will enable CNV-boundary redefinition (<italic>e.g.</italic>, by BJA) for a larger fraction of CNVs than is presently possible.</p>
<p>Very recently duplicated regions (&gt;99.5% identity) can already be analyzed with Alkan <italic>et al.</italic>'s approach, which considers non-unique genomic mapping positions. Nevertheless, in non-SD regions we found that CopySeq displayed higher concordances than Alkan <italic>et al.</italic>'s approach with Affymetrix array-based locus copy-numbers (97.2% <italic>vs.</italic> 80.2%). Possible reasons for the improved concordance of CopySeq may be an increased accuracy of a statistical copy-number genotyping framework compared to depth-of-coverage analysis without a probabilistic genotyping model. In addition, CopySeq's genomic <italic>k</italic>-mer filtering scheme may have contributed to its improved concordance by removing read-depth specific noise originating from distant paralogs.</p>
<p>Finally, our inference and validation of genetic variants may guide the way to similar analyses for other difficult-to-ascertain CNV regions, such as the medically relevant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Zhang1">[1]</xref> <italic>CCL3L1</italic>, β-defensin, and <italic>FCGR</italic> loci (see, for example, our analysis in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s001">Text S1</xref> with regard to the <italic>FCGRB</italic> locus on chromosome 1). Furthermore, CopySeq can be easily adapted to genome-wide scale analyses. As thousands of human genomes are becoming sequenced in the context of biomedical research studies (<italic>e.g.</italic>, cancer genomes or constitutional abnormalities), there is a strong need for accurate copy-number genotyping approaches operating on NGS data.</p>

<title>Definition of human olfactory receptor loci</title>

OR loci included the ∼1 kb intron-less coding region as well as non-coding segments up- and downstream, <italic>i.e.</italic>, 100 bp of 5′-sequence and 2 kb of 3′-sequence.

In particular, for a predefined locus <italic>i</italic>, in individual <italic>j</italic>, and using the mappability map <italic>k</italic> (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>k</italic>-mer size <italic>k</italic>) the expected locus read-depth <italic>E<sub>ijk</sub></italic> for invariant locus <italic>i</italic> is estimated with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000988.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>u<sub>ik</sub></italic> is the number of <italic>k</italic>-mers within locus <italic>i</italic> that are unique in the genome, <italic>N<sub>j</sub></italic> is the number of uniquely aligned sequence reads against the reference genome in individual <italic>j</italic>, and <italic>G</italic> is the size of the genome (2,858,018,193 nucleotides in hg18, excluding the mitochondrial DNA).</p>

<title>Copy-number genotyping: Locus copy-number inference</title>
<p>To generate genotype calls, CopySeq models copy-number genotypes as probability distributions accounting for locus-length, copy-number genotype, and sample-dependent noise. Specifically, copy-number genotype probability distributions are modeled as Gaussian distributions that incorporate both a Poisson variance term that depends on the read-depth of a locus, as well as an additional global (background) variance term that does not depend on locus length and copy-number genotype. The mean of each Gaussian is set according to expected values of the locus read-depth ratio, where the expected value for the locus read-depth ratio is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000988.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with <italic>m</italic> being a specific copy-number genotype among <italic>c</italic> possible copy-number genotypes <italic>C<sub>0</sub>…C<sub>c</sub></italic>.

Furthermore, the paired-end library insert size was ∼3 kb, a reasonable insert size for analyzing OR loci, which may recombine by non-allelic homologous recombination involving ∼900 bp ORFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Hasin1">[21]</xref>. To initiate the CNV-boundary redefinition for CNV-loci of interest, we required a reciprocal overlap of &gt;51% between microarray-based CNV coordinates of the chromosome 1 test set and the CNV-breakpoints as inferred by PEM. BJA was carried out using a library of ∼1,800 SVs with sequenced breakpoints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Lam1">[26]</xref>, and applying the same overlap criteria (&gt;51%) as for the PEM data. When applying PEM or BJA we reasonably assumed, based on previously published observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Korbel1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Lam1">[26]</xref>, that in bi-allelic CNV loci breakpoints are identical across analyzed individuals; thus, CopySeq was able to use redefined CNV-boundaries in all individuals when assessing bi-allelic CNVs (note that BJA and PEM cannot be applied in the case of multi-allelic CNV loci, as CNV boundaries may differ in recurrent CNV formation events).</p>

<title>Estimation of genotyping concordance with microarray-based studies</title>
<p>To assess the concordance of CopySeq-based copy-number genotypes with array-based copy-number genotypes we obtained data from two previous array-based surveys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref>. The sample overlap between our study and the array-based studies is high with 118 (McCarroll <italic>et al.</italic>) and 149 (Conrad <italic>et al.</italic>), respectively. <italic>Genotyping concordance</italic> is defined as the number of copy-number genotypes that display <italic>exactly identical</italic> values (<italic>e.g.</italic>, copy-number genotype = ‘4’) between two studies, divided by the total number of copy-number genotypes that have been inferred. Each locus was tested in all individuals where data was available. In a small number of cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s024">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s025">S5</xref>, and data submitted with the array-based studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Conrad1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-McCarroll1">[14]</xref>) no copy-number genotypes were inferred at a given confidence score threshold (‘NA’); these specific tests were obviously not considered when estimating genotyping concordance.

<title>Copy-number genotype validation by qPCR</title>
<p>Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Hasin1">[21]</xref>. Each experiment was carried out with 40 cycles and ended with a melting curve step to verify product specificity. Reactions with more than one peak in the melting curves were removed from further analysis. To address experimental variability due to primer differences and fluctuation in DNA concentration, we used a copy number-invariable gene (DSCR1) for normalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Hasin1">[21]</xref> and repeated each reaction at four DNA concentrations of 1, 2, 4, and 8 ng, in duplicates; the four concentrations allowed us to estimate the primer efficiency. Importantly, qPCR does not provide a measure of an absolute amount of material, but rather a comparison between samples. Thus, when analyzing a qPCR experiment we used copy-number genotypes inferred by CopySeq as an anchor point for calculations. Correlations were obtained from measuring copy-number differences across individuals at a given locus. Subsequent analyses were carried out as follows: (1) we calculated a matrix of pairwise Ct differences between all sample pairs for each OR and for DSCR1, at every DNA concentration separately. (2) To account for fluctuations in Ct arising from experimental procedures (<italic>e.g.</italic>, fluctuation in DNA concentrations or pipetting), we subtracted the DSCR1 based difference matrix from the OR difference matrix. We refer to the resulting matrix as the <italic>corrected difference matrix</italic>. (3) We combined data from all four concentrations by averaging the true pairwise Ct difference for each sample pair at every locus. (4) For each sample and locus, we used the predicted values from the other 9 samples as anchor, and thus computed 9 estimates for each genotype. For the transformation we used the experimentally estimated primer efficiency values. We then averaged the 9 values for each sample at each locus before calculating correlations.

Also, both primer pairs for this locus show the same results and confirm the conclusion made. B. OR11K1P: chr15:19,818,218–19,821,246. Missing data points: CopySeq, none; Conrad et al., NA12003; McCarroll et al., NA11920, NA12045, NA12716. The relative difference of up to 1.55 delta-Ct between DNAs (stdev of delta-Ct between DNAs over all three experiments≤0.09 Ct) and the clustering into several subgroups suggests a multi-allelic CNV, as predicted by CopySeq and McCarroll et al., rather than the absence of a CNV, as predicted by Conrad et al. C. OR5H5P: chr3:99,398,645–99,401,669. Missing data points: CopySeq, none; McCarroll et al., NA11920, NA12045. The almost identical Ct values (maximum difference of 0.23 delta-Ct) in the normal Ct range between all DNAs suggests absence of a CNV, as called by CopySeq, rather than the existence of a homozygous or heterozygous deletion, as inferred by McCarroll et al. (the latter would have resulted in a clear difference in qPCR values, as observed in (A)). D. OR4N4: chr15:19,883,737–19,886,784. Missing data points: CopySeq, none; McCarroll et al., NA11920, NA12045, NA12716. Clear Ct differences between samples support the multi-allelic copy-number genotype calls from both CopySeq and McCarroll et al. for this locus. However, missing data points for McCarroll et al. does not enable us to draw a final conclusion as to which copy-number genotype calls are in better agreement with the qPCR results.</p>

<p>Approximately linear dependency between locus copy-number and read-depth ratio. This figure shows the distribution of adjusted read-depth ratios for 99 CNV loci on chromosome 1 among 118 individuals for which we had prior information in terms of copy-number genotype assignments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Sebat1">[2]</xref>, i.e., individual densities were generated by using the previously published genotype information and grouping our read-depth data according to the genotype assignments in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Sebat1">[2]</xref>. Copy-number densities are indicated by colors (left to right): ‘0’, red; ‘1’, orange; ‘2’, grey; ‘3’, blue; ‘4’, purple. Thus, for example, all loci classified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Sebat1">[2]</xref> having CNG = ‘0’ appear in the density plot in the red density class. The number of data points per density class is: ‘0’ = 322, ‘1’ = 888, ‘2’ = 10,184, ‘3’ = 100, ‘4’ = 21. The plot shows that the expected read-depth ratio mean of a copy-number genotype class scales approximately linearly with copy-number. The mean read-depth ratio values for the copy-number genotype classes (i.e., ‘0’ = 0.11, ‘1’ = 0.54, ‘2’ = 0.99, ‘3’ = 1.44, ‘4’ = 1.96) show good correspondence with the theoretical expected values (‘0’ = 0, ‘1’ = 0.5, ‘2’ = 1, ‘3’ = 1.5, and ‘4’ = 2). Of note, this analysis is obviously heavily depending on the genotype assignments made in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000988-Sebat1">[2]</xref>.</p>

<p>Individuals analyzed in this study and numbers of filtered sequencing reads considered. All analyzed individuals were recently sequenced in the “pilot 1 project” of the 1000GP at relatively low sequencing coverage. Samples for which high-quality sequencing data were available included one parent-offspring trio of European ancestry, which consisted of father (NA12891), mother (NA12892), and daughter (NA12878). 20 samples were excluded based on the total variance of G+C-adjusted read-depth ratios that we measured in the normalization loci (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000988.s005">Figure S4B</xref>).
