Here, we ask whether putative orthologs of TFs, from bidirectional best BLAST hits (BBHs), are evolutionary orthologs with conserved functions. We show that BBHs of TFs from distantly related bacteria are usually not evolutionary orthologs. Furthermore, the false orthologs usually respond to different signals and regulate distinct pathways, while the few BBHs that are evolutionary orthologs do have conserved functions. To test the conservation of regulatory interactions, we analyze expression patterns. We find that regulatory relationships between TFs and their regulated genes are usually not conserved for BBHs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> K12 and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacillus subtilis</named-content>.

Using literature searches and sequence analysis, we show that these changes in expression patterns reflect changes in gene regulation, even for evolutionary orthologs. We conclude that the evolution of bacterial regulation should be analyzed with phylogenetic trees, rather than BBHs, and that bacterial regulatory networks evolve more rapidly than previously thought.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Living organisms use transcription factors (TFs) to control the production of proteins. For example, the bacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> contains a TF that prevents it from making enzymes that degrade lactose when lactose is absent. Bacterial genomes encode a huge diversity of TFs, and except in a few well-studied organisms, the function of these TFs is not known. To predict the function of a TF, biologists often search for a similar TF, from another organism, that has been characterized. It is generally believed that orthologous TFs—TFs that are derived from the organisms' common ancestor—will have conserved functions. The authors show that a commonly used method to identify orthologous TFs gives misleading results when applied to distantly related bacteria: the “orthologous” TFs are evolutionarily distant, they sense different signals, and they regulate different pathways. Biologists often predict, more specifically, that orthologous TFs will regulate orthologous genes. However, the authors show that even in more closely related bacteria, where the orthologous TFs do have conserved functions, these specific predictions are often incorrect. It seems that gene regulation in bacteria evolves rapidly, and it will be difficult to predict regulation in diverse bacteria from our knowledge of a few well-studied bacteria.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Price MN, Dehal PS, Arkin AP (2007) Orthologous transcription factors in bacteria have different functions and regulate different genes.

For example, when can information about gene regulation be transferred from model organisms to sequenced relatives? How does transcriptional regulation evolve in bacteria, and how do the transcription factors (TFs) themselves evolve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b005">5</xref>]? Because a single bacterial genome may encode hundreds of TFs, including dozens of representatives of a single family of regulators, analyzing the evolution of these TFs is not straightforward. Indeed, we will show that a popular method in comparative genomics gives misleading results when applied to TFs.</p><p>The first step in most comparative genomics analyses is to identify corresponding genes, or orthologs. Orthologs are formally defined as homologous genes that diverged from a common ancestor by vertical descent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b006">6</xref>]. Orthologs contrast to paralogs, i.e., genes that diverged by gene duplication, and xenologs, i.e., homologous genes whose history of divergence includes one or more horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. As strictly defined, orthology describes the evolutionary relationships of genes, not their functional relationships. Thus, orthologous genes need not necessarily have conserved functions. Although orthology is often thought of as a one-to-one relationship between two genes from different organisms, evolutionary orthology allows for more complex relationships: for example, two recently duplicated genes in one organism are evolutionary co-orthologs of the corresponding gene from a lineage that did not experience the duplication event.</p><p>However, in studies of bacterial evolution, this evolutionary definition of orthology is not generally used. Because of high rates of HGT, many genes are xenologs rather than orthologs. Unfortunately, identifying all instances of HGT is quite difficult, and different methods give contradictory results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b007">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is clear that HGT is widespread, and there is agreement that many or most of the genes in extant bacteria were acquired by HGT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b010">10</xref>].</p><p>Instead of evolutionary orthology, most workers in the field use an informal concept of functional equivalence: orthologs are homologous genes that are closely related and are predicted to have the same or closely related function. Due to the lack of functional data for most genes, orthologs are defined as bidirectional best BLAST hits (BBHs) or are obtained from higher-level BLAST-based approaches such as collections of orthologous groups (COGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b011">11</xref>]. This operational definition of orthology has the advantage that functionally corresponding genes can be considered as being equivalent regardless of the details of their evolutionary history. However, because most of the genes being considered are known only from the genome sequence, it is difficult to know if they actually have corresponding functions. Thus, using predicted functional equivalence as a basis for orthology has been criticized for lacking rigor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b012">12</xref>]. Another problem with BBHs is that, because of uneven evolutionary rates, the best BLAST hit may not be the nearest homolog in the evolutionary tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>We wondered how the concept and practice of orthology, whether defined by evolutionary analysis or by expected functional equivalence, applies to TFs. The most popular methods for assigning orthology are BBHs and COGs. The COG approach is less useful for studying TFs because it collapses large families of TFs into single orthology groups. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> K12 has 45 members of the LysR group (COG583) that respond to a wide variety of signals and regulate different sets of genes.</p><p>On the other hand, many studies have used BLAST-based orthologs to study regulation in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b016">16</xref>]. These studies assume that regulation is conserved, so that orthologous TFs will regulate orthologous genes. However, because bacterial genomes often contain many members of a TF family, we suspected that ortholog assignment by BBHs would often give misleading results. The presence of large families indicates that TFs often duplicate, and a best-hits approach will select the least-diverged duplicate as an ortholog. Also, if all of the close homologs have been deleted, then distant homologs will still be present, and one of these distant homologs may be a spurious BBH. In bacteria, paralogous TFs usually have different functions, and transcriptional regulatory networks can evolve rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b004">4</xref>], so in either case, the homolog's function will likely have changed. In contrast, evolutionary analyses of orthology consider all genomes, rather than just two at a time, so these errors can be avoided.</p><p>Nevertheless, BLAST-based orthologs have successfully been used to identify conserved regulatory sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b016">16</xref>] and to link clusters of similar regulatory sequences (“motifs”) with the TFs that bind those sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b017">17</xref>]. We argue that these analyses have succeeded because they focused on closely related bacteria, such as the family of Enterobacteria, within which duplication and change of function have had less time to occur. Indeed, conserved regulatory sequences are much more likely to be found when only close relatives are considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b018">18</xref>]. This illustrates another reason why BLAST-based orthologs have been effective in this context, which is that motif searching will usually return results only for those genes whose regulation is conserved. If the regulation has changed, then these methods will usually return no results, rather than incorrect results.</p><p>More recently, evolutionary studies have examined the conservation of TFs and their regulated genes across distantly related bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b005">5</xref>]. These studies used putative orthologs from BBHs to determine the presence and absence of TFs, and predicted that orthologous TFs will regulate orthologous genes if both orthologs are present. (These studies did not search for conserved regulatory sequences.) At the larger phylogenetic distances considered by these studies, BBHs might give misleading results.</p><p>Here, we test the BBHs of the characterized TFs of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> by both evolutionary and functional criteria. To test whether the BBHs are evolutionary orthologs, we built phylogenetic trees for all BBHs of TFs between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content>. To determine whether regulation is maintained between BBHs, we systematically examined characterized TFs and expression data from organisms at a range of phylogenetic distances from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>. We found that the orthology assignments for TFs from distantly related bacteria (e.g., bacteria from different divisions) are unreliable: more often than not, the BBHs are not evolutionary orthologs and have different functions. Furthermore, expression data suggest that regulatory interactions are often not conserved, even at closer phylogenetic distances and even when the genes concerned are evolutionary orthologs. We found experimental evidence in the literature and evidence in the genome sequence to confirm some of these changes. Thus, gene regulation appears to evolve more rapidly than previously thought.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>“Orthologous” Transcription Factors between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content></title><p>We first examined the putative orthologs, from BBHs, for TFs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> K12 and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content>.

We show four typical examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030175-g002">Figure 2</xref>. First, betI and pksA are not evolutionary orthologs because both genes have complex evolutionary histories and at least three HGT events separate the two genes. The relationship between cynR and ywbI, or between nagC and xylR, also includes HGT events on one or both sides, as well as gene duplication events. Finally, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> phoB is the BBH of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content> resD, but resD has paralogs that are probably more closely related to each other than they are to phoB. Because these genes belong to a large and diverse family, and because larger trees have poor support values (unpublished data), it is difficult to know if resD and its paralogs are evolutionary co-orthologs of phoB, although the HGT of yclJ is partial evidence against this. It is also possible that the root of the tree could lie between phoB and resD, so that they are evolutionary orthologs, but if distant family members (e.g., cpxR and ompR from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>) are included in the tree, then phoB, resD, and the paralogs all group together (unpublished data), which suggests otherwise. In any case, the presence of these closer paralogs shows that the BBH is misleading. Indeed, one of resD's paralogs (phoP) has a similar function as phoB, but because it is more diverged, it is not the BBH. Overall, 24 BBHs were rejected as evolutionary orthologs because the trees showed multiple events of HGT or gene duplication, including at least one HGT event, and four BBHs were rejected as one-to-one evolutionary orthologs purely because of closer paralogs.</p><p>Among the seven remaining BBHs, two of them (yjdG/yufM and yjeB/yhdE) show conservation within close relatives of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and seem to have been transferred between them, so we classified these as xenologs. Another BBH, birA, shows conservation within Bacilli and within γ-Proteobacteria (the division that contains <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>), but it seems to have been transferred between Bacilli and Archaea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b023">23</xref>]. Because of this ancient transfer event, we also classified birA as a xenolog. We classified the remaining four BBHs (dnaA, fur, lexA, rpoN/sigL) as evolutionary orthologs, although there may yet be ancient HGT events that we did not detect.</p><p>For 23 of the 35 BBHs, the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content> member of the BBH (or a close homolog) has been studied experimentally. We defined a BBH as having a conserved function if both TFs respond to the same signal, or, if the signal is not known, we asked whether they regulate one or more corresponding pathways. We did not consider the TFs' DNA binding specificity or whether the regulated genes were homologous. Functional comparisons for five BBHs are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030175-t001">Table 1</xref>.

(The details of this analysis are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030175-sd002">Text S2</xref>.) For example, it has been proposed that crp and fnr are global regulators throughout the prokaryotes, including Archaea, and that these have been conserved from the common ancestor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b005">5</xref>]. However, both crp and fnr have characterized BBHs that have different functions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030175-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030175-sd002">Text S2</xref>).</p><p>Another analysis reports that crp and fnr are present in an “alternating pattern” outside of the Proteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b004">4</xref>]. We suggest that this is an artifact of BBHs: distantly related members of the crp/fnr family will have BLAST hits to both genes, and one of them will have a higher score and be a BBH, but which one has the higher score is not biologically meaningful. To confirm this hypothesis, we built a phylogenetic tree of all BBHs of crp and fnr from the MicrobesOnline database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b025">25</xref>], using MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b026">26</xref>] and quicktree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b027">27</xref>]. Within this tree, we looked for clades of genes that were from closely related species, which indicates that the genes are orthologs or recent paralogs, but which contained BBHs of both crp and fnr. We found clades with inconsistent BBHs within Lactobacillales, Streptococcus, Synechococcus, and δ-Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030175-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Because these clades contain genes from related organisms, errors in the phylogenetic tree are not a plausible explanation for these inconsistencies. Thus, BBH ortholog assignments for crp and fnr are misleading. This example also illustrates how errors from analyzing only two genomes at a time (as with BBHs) are easily apparent once more information is considered.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030175-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030175.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Bidirectional Best Hits of crp and fnr Are Not Orthologs</title><p>We show selected clades from a phylogenetic tree of all BBHs of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> crp and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> fnr.

Furthermore, because genes that are in the same operon will have similar expression patterns even if the predicted regulation for the genes is incorrect, when computing the average expression for the regulon, we considered only genes that are not likely to be in the same operon as the target gene. More precisely, we excluded genes if they are predicted to be in the same operon as the target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b030">30</xref>] or if they are on the same strand as and are within 10 kilobases of the target gene.

For all of these species, the expression data shows a strong difference between operon pairs and random pairs (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup>, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030175-sg001">Figure S1</xref> for the cumulative distributions).

One caveat in our analysis is that a gene–regulon correlation might be low not because of an erroneous prediction for the gene of interest but instead because of erroneous predictions for other members of the regulon, and so the coexpression ratio might understate the accuracy of the predictions. Another caveat is that for genes that are under complex control, the loss of regulation by a single TF might eliminate most of the coexpression, even if the other regulatory predictions for that gene are correct.</p><p>To convert the relative coexpression ratio of 0.49 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030175-g005">Figure 5</xref>F) to an error rate, we took the subset of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> network that has BBHs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> and randomly shuffled a varying proportion of it to introduce “errors.” We then computed the relative coexpression for these “predictions” in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> as compared with the unshuffled (true) regulation. We found that the relative coexpression ratio of 0.49 corresponds to about 65%–80% of individual regulatory interactions being correct, or about 45%–75% of genes having all of their predicted regulation being correct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030175-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). So, it appears that the relative coexpression corresponds roughly to accuracy at the gene level, and that the predictions for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> do have a high error rate. These error rates are consistent with a phylogenetic footprinting study that included <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> K12 and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> MR-1 and reported that only 35%–70% of BBH promoters contained conserved sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b018">18</xref>].</p><p>Another caveat in our analysis is that coexpression may be conserved even when the mechanism of regulation has changed.

They used gene–gene correlations rather than gene–regulon correlations, and they used a different set of regulatory interactions, but we also found weaker coexpression when we used gene–gene correlations and when we used their set of regulatory interactions (unpublished data). It appears that they included pairs of genes that are in the same operon in their set of within-regulon pairs. Including such pairs would have greatly increased the number of strongly correlated predictions in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">V. cholerae</named-content> (unpublished data).

When we examined these operons, we found a variety of evidence that the difference in gene expression patterns reflects a true difference in gene regulation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content>, which we summarize below. For a detailed discussion of each operon, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030175-sd003">Text S3</xref>.</p><p>First, seven of the 12 operons are regulated in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> by arcA and/or by fnr. These regulators are evolutionary orthologs between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> (unpublished data), but they are reported to have different roles in the two organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b033">33</xref>]. For example, the sdh operon is regulated by arcA in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> but not in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b032">32</xref>], as predicted by our gene-expression analysis. Furthermore, in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>, arcA's activity is controlled by the sensor histidine kinase arcB, but arcB is not present in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> genome. Because <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> can use a much wider variety of electron acceptors than <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> can, it is not surprising that these global regulators of anaerobic or microaerophilic growth would have evolved different roles. These examples also illustrate how evolutionary orthologs can have somewhat different functions.</p><p>Second, a few of the regulated genes, and one of the regulators (fliA), are not evolutionary orthologs—the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> genes are distantly related to their <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> counterparts, and the BBHs are separated by multiple HGT events. Given this complex evolution, it is not surprising that regulation would not be conserved. In the case of fliA, experimental reports from other γ-Proteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b035">35</xref>] confirm that the regulon is not conserved across these HGT events (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030175-sd003">Text S3</xref> for details).</p><p>Third, in several cases, we found evidence for a change in operon structure, so that the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> gene is not expressed from the same promoter as in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>. We have previously shown that changes in operon structure often lead to changes in gene expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b036">36</xref>]. For example, the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> operon argCBH is regulated by argR. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> MR-1, the gene cluster has expanded to argCBFGH. There is a strong and conserved putative argR binding site upstream of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> argB (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030175-sd003">Text S3</xref>), and argC is not coexpressed with argB in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> MR-1 (<italic>r</italic> = −0.21).

As another example, in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> the clpPX operon is transcribed from an rpoH-dependent promoter, and clpP and clpX are considered to be heat shock genes. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content>, however, both clpP and clpX are slightly downregulated in response to heat shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b037">37</xref>].

We examined all BBHs of TFs between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content>, all BBHs of characterized TFs between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and α,β-Proteobacteria, and in the gene expression analysis, all BBHs of TFs between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and closer relatives at varying phylogenetic distances within the γ-Proteobacteria. We found that in bacteria from different divisions or different phyla, these BBHs are often not true evolutionary orthologs. Although the few BBHs that are evolutionary orthologs usually have conserved functions, BBHs with complex evolutionary histories usually have different functions: they respond to different signals and regulate different pathways. Even when the BBHs are one-to-one evolutionary orthologs and respond to the same signals, there are only a few cases where the BBHs regulate orthologous genes.</p><p>When we examined orthologs of TFs between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and other γ-Proteobacteria, we found that, at this closer evolutionary distance, most of the BBHs are evolutionary orthologs, but they regulate different genes. In particular, we found that using orthology to predict transcriptional regulation has significant error rates. We estimated an error rate of about 30% for predicting regulation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> MR-1 based on BBHs to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>, and because coexpression can be conserved even when the mechanism of regulation has changed, the actual error rate may be higher. Although orthology is not, by itself, a reliable predictor of transcriptional regulation, it could probably be combined with comparative analysis of promoter regions and with expression analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b040">40</xref>] to give more accurate results.</p><p>In any case, our results suggest that gene regulation evolves rapidly. We also identified nine high-confidence cases where the regulation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> is not conserved in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content>. Many of these cases involve evolutionary orthologs, and, in all of these cases, the BBHs of the TF and the regulated gene probably have similar functions. Given more expression datasets and TF location data, it should soon be possible to identify large numbers of regulatory changes. It will be interesting to see what the functional consequences of these regulatory differences are and whether the differences in gene regulation are adaptive.</p><p>Our findings support the conclusion that “bacterial regulatory networks are extremely flexible in evolution” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b004">4</xref>]. Because the use of BBHs has concealed many cases of flexibility by creating false orthologs out of regulators that play different roles, the true rate of evolution must be even higher. More broadly, it is proposed that regulatory networks evolve by “embedding orthologous genes in different types of regulatory motifs” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b005">5</xref>]. However, given the high rates of false orthologs from BBHs, we suspect that the horizontal transfer, duplication, and loss of TFs are dominant features in the evolution of bacterial TFs.</p><p>It is less clear how the methodological problems we have discussed here affect other conclusions from previous evolutionary studies that relied on BBHs. It is reported that there is little [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b005">5</xref>] or no [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b004">4</xref>] tendency for TFs to be maintained or lost together with their regulated genes. However, while performing detailed phylogenetic analyses of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> regulators, we found more than 20 cases where a TF has been horizontally transferred together with adjacent genes that it regulates (Price, Dehal, and Arkin, unpublished). We suggest that false positives from BBHs are sufficiently common to conceal this effect.</p><p>Similarly, these authors find little difference between global regulators and more specific regulators in their tendency to be conserved. In contrast, we argue that global regulators evolve rapidly, but other regulators evolve even more rapidly. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that most of the global regulators in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> have been inherited vertically since the divergence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content>, but most other TFs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> have arisen by HGT or gene duplication after that divergence (Price, Dehal, and Arkin, unpublished). Again, false orthologs could be concealing the true difference.</p><p>Our results also imply that it will not be possible to predict the precise function of TFs in bacterial genomes by homology alone. Because of the rapid divergence of TF function, most annotations from BBHs are probably incorrect. This kind of error affects model organisms as well: for example, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content> msmR appears to be named from a rather distant homolog in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Streptococcus mutans</named-content> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030175-sd001">Text S1</xref>). Evolutionary analyses can identify most of the functional orthologs among the BBHs, but these are few. For example, of the 159 characterized TFs in RegulonDB 5.6, 35 have BBHs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content>, just nine of those have conserved functions, and seven of those nine are evolutionary orthologs or simple xenologs. For α,β Proteobacteria, which are more closely related to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>, there are about 40 BBH TFs per genome, and about half of the BBHs are functional orthologs, which would give about 20 predictions per genome.

In contrast, other workers require the domain structure of the protein to be unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b004">4</xref>]. The two definitions give very similar results for TFs, both because the coverage requirement usually forces the domain structures to match, and because TF families are so large that best hits usually have the same domain structure.

We also inferred HGT from the presence of close homologs in related bacteria and the absence of close homologs in species of intermediate relatedness (e.g., the absence of betI from distant γ Proteobacteria in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In these cases we required that at least two loss events would otherwise be required to explain the pattern of presence/absence across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b046">46</xref>]. We also required that a small change to the gene tree (e.g., a single interchange) would not eliminate the putative HGT event. Because most HGT events are across greater distances, using a higher threshold for the number of loss events would rarely affect a gene's classification (e.g., examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Also, we did not count losses in the highly reduced genomes of the insect endosymbionts (Buchnera, Candidatus Blochmannia, and Wigglesworthia) against this threshold of two losses.</p><p>Another issue in interpreting the gene trees is that the root of these trees is unknown. In the presence of HGT, there is no reliable way to choose an outgroup, and so the root of the tree cannot be determined. However, if our goal is to determine if HGT has occurred, then we can assume that HGT has <italic>not</italic> occurred and try to falsify that hypothesis. Thus, we used the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> gene as an outgroup for identifying HGT into the Firmicutes, and we used the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content> gene as an outgroup for identifying HGT into the Proteobacteria. Even if the implied rooting is incorrect, this will only affect the direction of the HGT event, and not the existence of HGT.</p><p>To identify gene duplication events, we assumed that distant relatives of the genes (i.e., relatives that are more diverged than the BBHs are from each other) could be used as an outgroup. Because most of the TFs that we considered belong to large families, it is unlikely that the root that was implied by this method was misleading. In particular, it is not likely that the root would lie between the paralogs, in which case the BBHs could be one-to-one evolutionary orthologs. (For example, resD and phoB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030175-g002">Figure 2</xref> could be evolutionary orthologs if the true root lies between resD and yclJ.) In general, we cannot rule out this possibility. If the common ancestor of the paralogs was acquired by HGT, however, as in the case of nagC and mlc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030175-g002">Figure 2</xref>), then a root between the paralogs becomes implausible, as it implies that the gene family was invented recently within a single group of bacteria, was highly conserved and duplicated within those bacteria, and yet proliferated by HGT and rapid divergence to many other groups of bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Identifying characterized TFs.</title><p>To identify characterized TFs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>, we used RegulonDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b022">22</xref>] and EcoCyc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b019">19</xref>].

Gene–regulon correlations remove noise by averaging over the expression patterns of genes in the putative regulon, they allow us to determine which genes have changed regulation, and they eliminate a bias toward large and weak regulons that would arise from the naive use of gene–gene correlations.</p><p>First, gene–regulon correlations remove noise. For example, suppose that a predicted regulon is noisy, and contains four true positives and four false positives. When we average these expression profiles together, the contribution of the false positives will cancel out, because they are (probably) not correlated with each other. Thus, the four true positives with consistent expression will dominate the average, and so the average will be roughly correct, albeit with reduced intensity because half of it is from the false positives averaging each other out. When we compute the gene–regulon correlation, however, the correlation coefficient ignores the intensity of the input vectors, and so the gene–regulon correlations will (mostly) reflect the similarity of each gene to the true positives. We could average over gene–gene correlations instead, but that merely averages the noise, it doesn't reduce it. In our hypothetical scenario, 3/4 of the gene–gene comparisons will give low correlations, while only 1/2 of the gene–regulon correlations will give low correlations.</p><p>Second, gene–regulon correlations are interpretable. In the above example, half of the genes will still have high gene–regulon correlations, while from gene–gene correlations, most of the gene–gene correlations would be low, and it would not be clear which genes' expression patterns have changed. In practice, most of the gene–regulon correlations are computed using genes from several other operons (unpublished data), so these benefits of gene–regulon correlations are relevant.</p><p>Third, gene–gene correlations are biased toward large regulons, because the number of pairs within a regulon grows as the square of the regulon's size. For example, if we examine the coexpression of pairs of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> genes that are regulated by the same set of TFs and are not likely to be in the same operon, then for 29% of the pairs, both genes are regulated only by rpoE and not by any other TFs, at least as far as is reported in RegulonDB. In contrast, genes that are regulated only by rpoE account for only 9% of the gene–regulon correlations. The pairs of genes that are regulated only by rpoE are not correlated with each other—the mean gene–gene correlation is only 0.06, while the mean of the other gene–gene correlations within regulons is 0.20. Thus, if we used distributions of gene–gene correlations to examine the quality of predictions, almost a third of the distribution would be noise from this source, while with gene–regulon correlations, only a tenth of the distribution is noise from this source. This illustrates how using gene–regulon correlations reduces the effect of large regulons that are not coexpressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Microarray data.</title><p>Microarray data for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> K12, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. oneidensis</named-content> MR-1, and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content> were taken from a previous compilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030175-b036">36</xref>].

Despite this variation in dataset size, the extent of the difference between operon pairs and random pairs was about the same in all five datasets (Kolmogorov-Smirnov D-statistic = 0.53–0.61).</p><p>For all of the microarray datasets, we analyzed normalized log-ratios (that is, the logarithm of the estimated fold-change in RNA levels between two conditions). Normalization methods are described in the data sources. We also subtracted the mean log-ratio from each experiment before we calculated correlation coefficients between genes. We only computed correlation coefficients for pairs where both genes had data for at least ten experiments. To compute gene–regulon correlations, we also required at least ten experiments, and we only used experiments that had data for both the gene and for at least half of the other members of the regulon.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030175-sg001" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030175.sg001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Cumulative Distributions for Gene Expression Correlations for Adjacent Genes in Operons, for Gene-Regulation Correlations, and for the Correlation of Random Pairs of Genes</title><p>This is the same data as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030175-g005">Figure 5</xref>, but showing the cumulative distribution rather than the histogram.</p><p>(46 KB EPS)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030175-sg002" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030175.sg002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>The Relative Coexpression Ratio for Regulatory Networks with Errors</title><p>We introduced random changes into the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> regulatory network and measured the relative coexpression ratio.
