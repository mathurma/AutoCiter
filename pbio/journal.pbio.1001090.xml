        <p>Patients affected by chronic inflammatory disorders display high amounts of soluble CD95L. This homotrimeric ligand arises from the cleavage by metalloproteases of its membrane-bound counterpart, a strong apoptotic inducer. In contrast, the naturally processed CD95L is viewed as an apoptotic antagonist competing with its membrane counterpart for binding to CD95. Recent reports pinpointed that activation of CD95 may attract myeloid and tumoral cells, which display resistance to the CD95-mediated apoptotic signal. However, all these studies were performed using chimeric CD95Ls (oligomerized forms), which behave as the membrane-bound ligand and not as the naturally processed CD95L. Herein, we examine the biological effects of the metalloprotease-cleaved CD95L on CD95-sensitive activated T-lymphocytes. We demonstrate that cleaved CD95L (cl-CD95L), found increased in sera of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients as compared to that of healthy individuals, promotes the formation of migrating pseudopods at the leading edge of which the death receptor CD95 is capped (confocal microscopy). Using different migration assays (wound healing/Boyden Chamber/endothelial transmigration), we uncover that cl-CD95L promotes cell migration through a c-yes/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI3K-driven signaling pathway, which relies on the formation of a CD95-containing complex designated the MISC for <italic>Motility-Inducing Signaling Complex</italic>. These findings revisit the role of the metalloprotease-cleaved CD95L and emphasize that the increase in cl-CD95L observed in patients affected by chronic inflammatory disorders may fuel the local or systemic tissue damage by promoting tissue-filtration of immune cells.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The “death receptor” CD95 (also known as Fas) plays an essential role in ensuring immune tolerance of self antigens as well as in the elimination of the body's cells that have been infected or transformed. This receptor is engaged by the membrane-bound ligand CD95L, which can be released into blood circulation after cleavage by metalloproteases. Hitherto, most of the studies on the CD95 signal have been performed with chimeric CD95Ls that mimic the membrane-bound ligand and exhibit a level of aggregation beyond that described for the metalloprotease-cleaved ligand. Multi-aggregated CD95L elicits a caspase-driven apoptotic signal. In this study, we observe that levels of soluble and naturally processed CD95L in sera of patients suffering from lupus correlate with disease severity. Strikingly, although this soluble CD95L fails to trigger cell death unlike its chimeric version, it induces a “non-canonical” Ca<sup>2+</sup>/c-yes/PI3K-dependent signaling pathway that promotes the transmigration of T-lymphocytes across the endothelial barrier. These findings shed light on an entirely new role for the soluble CD95L that may contribute to local or systemic tissue damage by enhancing the infiltration of activated T-lymphocytes. Overall, these findings underline the importance of revisiting the role of this “apoptotic cytokine” in the context of chronic inflammatory disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Screening for death inducers led to the discovery of the receptor CD95, which was initially cloned and described as a death receptor belonging to the TNF-R family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Trauth1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Itoh1">[2]</xref>. Since CD95 is devoid of enzymatic activity, both aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Siegel1">[3]</xref> and conformational modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Scott1">[4]</xref> of the receptor are crucial to recruit the adaptor protein FADD, which in turn aggregates initiator caspases-8 and -10. On binding of CD95L to CD95, the death receptor clusterized and polarized in a structure designated the CD95-CAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Cremesti1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Grassme1">[6]</xref>. The local concentration of caspases is followed by their cleavage and the release in the cytoplasm of active caspases culminating in the induction of an apoptotic signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Hughes1">[7]</xref>. We and others showed that depending on the extent of CD95 mobilization, it is possible to convert CD95 into a non-apoptotic signaling receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Legembre1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Wajant1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Expression of the CD95 ligand, CD95L, is tightly controlled and is found at the plasma membrane of activated T-lymphocytes and NK cells where it participates in immune surveillance and in peripheral tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Strasser1">[11]</xref>. As a consequence, failure of the CD95/CD95L signalling leads to auto-immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Bidere1">[12]</xref> and increased risk of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Muschen1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Straus1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent evidence pinpointed that CD95L behaves as a chemoattractant molecule for neutrophils and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Chen1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Letellier1">[17]</xref> and for malignant cells in which the CD95-mediated apoptotic signal is non-productive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Barnhart1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Kleber1">[19]</xref>. Nonetheless, the biological role of CD95L has to be clarified due to the fact that physiologically, the ligand is present under two main forms with different stoichiometries. Whereas the membrane-bound CD95L induces a potent apoptotic signal, the physiological and pathological role of the metalloprotease-cleaved CD95L remains poorly defined. Indeed, most studies on CD95L are focused on membrane-bound or engineered CD95L, which multimerizes and thereby efficiently triggers cell death. Initial studies focusing on the apoptotic signal induced by CD95 showed that the homotrimeric CD95L behaves as a competitive inhibitor of its membrane-bound counterpart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Schneider1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Suda1">[21]</xref>. More recently, the antagonist role of cleaved CD95L (cl-CD95L) has been challenged by Strasser's group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-OReilly1">[22]</xref>. Indeed, they found that ectopic expression of the soluble CD95L in a CD95L-deficient mouse strain dramatically aggravated the lupus-like disease and the occurrence of histiocytic sarcoma compared to mice<sup>gld/gld</sup> expressing a mutated CD95L incapable of CD95 binding. As a consequence, we may envision that soluble CD95L promotes autoimmunity and tumorigenesis through unknown non-apoptotic activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-OReilly1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Cell migration is a multifactorial and multi-step process involving the formation of lamellipodia/pseudopodia, cell body contraction, and tail retraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Ridley1">[23]</xref>. For instance, production of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), formation of actin mesh, and localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise are common features of migrating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Ridley1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Lee1">[24]</xref>. Class I PI3K phosphorylates plasma membrane phospholipids and generates the second messenger PIP3, which serves as docking sites for various signaling factors. The cytosolic serine-threonine kinase Akt binds PIP3 via its pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain) and thus redistributes to the plasma membrane. Once at the membrane, Akt is activated through phosphorylation on two sites by the PI3K-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) on Thr<sup>308</sup> and by mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) complex-2 on Ser<sup>473</sup>.</p>

The initial steps involved in the attraction of these cells remains to be deciphered. Herein, we ascertain that the naturally processed CD95L is increased in SLE patients and this cytokine does not induce the “orthodox” apoptotic signal but rather ignites a c-yes/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI3K signaling pathway, which promotes cell migration.</p>

        <title>The Metalloprotease-Cleaved CD95L Does Not Induce Caspase-8 Activation and Cell Death</title>
        <p>Physiologically, the plasma membrane homotrimeric ligand is released after cleavage of its ectodomain by metalloproteases between either serine 126 and leucine 127 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Schneider1">[20]</xref> or lysine 129 and glutamine 130 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Tanaka1">[26]</xref>. Since a recent study described that the soluble form may contribute to the aggravation of a lupus-like disease in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-OReilly1">[22]</xref>, we explored the effect of cl-CD95L on activated lymphocytes. To produce cleaved CD95L (cl-CD95L), we transfected the epithelial kidney cells 293 with wild type CD95L-encoding cDNA. These cells secrete exosomes, which contain full-length CD95L, and thus contaminate supernatants. Therefore, to eliminate this potential contaminant, supernatants from wild type CD95L-transfected 293 cells underwent an ultracentrifugation step to pellet the secreted vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Schneider1">[20]</xref>. As expected, CD95L-transfected human epithelial kidney 293 cell line produced full-length plasma membrane-bound CD95L (≈40 kDa) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) and pelleted exosomes also contained full-length CD95L (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Cleaved-CD95L was found in exosome-free supernatant at a lower molecular weight (≈30 kDa) than the full-length ligand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In contrast, supernatants harvested from 293 cells expressing a CD95L in which serine 126 and leucine 127 were replaced by glutamic acid (CD95L<sup>S126E/L127E</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Schneider1">[20]</xref>, the putative cleavage site of metalloprotease, exhibited a dramatic decrease in their amounts of soluble CD95L, confirming that CD95L was cleaved between these amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The faint amount of soluble CD95L found in CD95L<sup>S126E/L127E</sup>-transfected 293 cells may be due to the presence of another cleavage site (i.e., Lys129/Gln130) since a shift of this cleavage site has also been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Tanaka1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Next, we confirmed the homotrimeric stoichiometry of the cleaved CD95L using gel filtration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). In the purpose of generating a multi-aggregated and highly cytotoxic ligand, several CD95L-containing constructs have been engineered. As already reported, we have generated a dodecameric CD95L (gel filtration analysis, unpublished data) through the fusion of the extracellular region (a.a. 105 to 281) of CD95L with a dimerization domain (Ig) derived from the LIF receptor gp190 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Legembre2">[27]</xref>. Although the Ig-CD95L triggered induction of the initiator caspase-8 and cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s001">Figure S1C and S1D</xref>), cl-CD95L failed to initiate either cleavage of caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s001">Figure S1C</xref>) or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). Overall, these findings support the conclusion that in contrast to the multi-aggregated forms of CD95L, which mimic the membrane-bound ligand, homotrimeric cl-CD95L does not achieve induction of the “orthodox” CD95-mediated apoptotic signal.</p>

        <title>Cleaved-CD95L Induces the Formation of CD95-CAP</title>
        <p>It has been described that soluble CD95L acts as an inert ligand, which once bound to CD95 competes with the membrane-bound CD95L and prevents the transmission of the apoptotic signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Schneider1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Suda1">[21]</xref>.

Nevertheless, cl-CD95L was able to induce proximal events of the CD95 signal up to the formation of CD95-CAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Strikingly, once incubated with 100 ng/ml (3.3 nM) of cl-CD95L, classical round-shaped activated T-lymphocytes underwent a dramatic alteration of their morphology and emitted pseudopods (red arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Formation of CD95-CAP and pseudopods in the presence of cl-CD95L was also observed with the leukemic T-cell lines H9 and Jurkat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s002">Figure S2A–C</xref>). In contrast, incubation of activated lymphocytes with the dodecameric Ig-CD95L triggered cell blebbing and shrinkage, hallmarks of cells dying through an apoptotic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Alteration of cell morphology and formation of CD95-CAP was not restricted to hematological cells since the fibroblastic PS120<sup>CD95</sup> cell line, derived from PS120, a CD95-deficient cell that has been reconstituted with wild type human CD95 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), also underwent alterations of its morphology in the presence of cl-CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Indeed flat, cubical epithelial shape was converted to bipolar, well-oriented, slanted, fibroblastic appearance following incubation with 100 ng/ml of cl-CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly to lymphocytes, clustering of CD95 was observed at the extremity of the emitted pseudopods in the fibroblastic cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Cleaved-CD95L Induces the Emission of PIP3/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/F-Actin-Containing Pseudopods</title>
        <p>The initial response of a cell to a migration-promoting agent is to emit protrusions in the direction of migration. These protrusions can be large, broad lamellipodia or more slender and filiform structures such as pseudopods and are usually driven by actin polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Ridley1">[23]</xref>. Several studies established that an intracellular calcium rise and an activation of PI3K play a crucial role to achieve cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Derman1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Turner1">[31]</xref>. These signals contribute to the remodeling of actin cytoskeleton, which in association with myosin motors elicits the mechanical process of cell movement. We then investigated whether although unable to trigger caspase activation, cl-CD95L induced remodeling of actin, Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, and activation of the PI3K signaling pathway.</p>
        <p>Using the non-competing molecule Lifeact, a small peptide, which has recently been described to bind polymerized actin and to not interfere with actin dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Riedl1">[32]</xref>, we clearly observed that the pseudopods emitted by leukemic T-cells concentrated a dense meshwork of polymerized actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The serine-threonine kinase Akt is a downstream effector of the PI3K signal and its phosphorylation on its serine<sup>473</sup> is a key feature of its activation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, T-cell lines incubated with cl-CD95L underwent a potent Akt phosphorylation. To confirm that cl-CD95L behaved as an inducer of the PI3K/Akt signal, we analyzed the impact of the naturally processed ligand on the production of the plasma membrane PIP3. For this purpose, we expressed in T-cells a chimeric protein encompassing GFP fused to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt (PH<sub>Akt</sub>-GFP), which possesses a strong affinity to the negatively charged lipid. Addition of cl-CD95L on H9 T-cells promoted production of PIP3 since the cytoplasmic localization of PH<sub>Akt</sub>-GFP in resting cells changed for a plasma membrane reorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Overall these findings highlighted that the naturally processed CD95L activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</p>

            <p>(A) H9 T-cells were transiently transfected with the actin marker Lifeact-GFP. Living cells were harvested (Ficoll) and treated or untreated for 30 min with 100 ng/ml of cleaved CD95L.

Cells were lysed, and for each lane, 100 µg of protein were loaded.

        <p>On the grounds that spatiotemporal distribution of “calcium microdomains” orchestrates directional movement during cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Wei1">[33]</xref>, we further investigated the effects of cl-CD95L on the intracellular distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> using video-microscopy and we established that T-lymphocytes incubated with cl-CD95L revealed significantly higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at the leading edge of the pseudopod (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s004">Figure S4</xref>), beneath the CD95-CAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Activation of a wide variety of plasma membrane receptors elicits a rapid biphasic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response through the induction of phospholipase C (PLC) that generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn activates the IP3-receptors present in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IP3-R activation drives the release of the ER-stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Berridge1">[34]</xref>. The second phase of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is mainly achieved by activation of the store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (SOC) channels in the plasma membrane that induce a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Parekh1">[35]</xref>. In order to address the cl-CD95L-mediated molecular mechanism evoking the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, we first investigated whether PLCγ1 participated in this signal. Phosphorylation of PLCγ1 on its tyrosine 783 indicated that the lipase was activated in the presence of cl-CD95L (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). To prove that PLCγ1 participated in the cl-CD95L-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise, we analyzed the cl-CD95L-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in PLCγ1-deficient T-cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was abrogated in the PLCγ1-deficient T-cells, while it was restored in the PLCγ1-reconstituted counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Second, T-cells pre-incubated with the IP3-R inhibitors, 2-APB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s005">Figure S5C and S5D</xref>) and xestospongin C (unpublished data), failed to mobilize Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of cl-CD95L, indicating that the homotrimeric ligand elicited the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal through activation of PLCγ1 and the subsequent induction of the IP3-receptors.</p>
        <p>In nonexcitable cells, SOC influx is the major Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Parekh1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Lewis1">[36]</xref>. Recently it has been ascertained that two genes, STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) and Orai1, participate in the SOC entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Feske1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Zhang1">[41]</xref>. While STIM1 behaves as an ER-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, Orai1 is a pore-forming component of the SOC channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Prakriya1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Yeromin1">[43]</xref>. To finely identify the molecular mechanism that drives the Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise observed in the presence of cl-CD95L, we first explored whether the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> contributed to the cl-CD95L-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. In T-cell lines bathed in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, the cl-CD95L-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was significantly reduced as compared to regular medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s006">Figure S6A and S6B</xref>). These findings suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx participated in the cl-CD95L-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. To investigate the role played by the SOC channels on the cl-CD95L-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, we analyzed the effect of the pharmacological inhibitor of SOC channels termed BTP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Zitt1">[44]</xref> on this Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Pre-incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with BTP2 reduced the magnitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak and abrogated the Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateau observed in the presence of the metalloprotease-processed cl-CD95L (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s006">Figure S6C</xref>), suggesting that the SOC channels contributed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry upon the addition of cl-CD95L. Next, the role of Orai1 in the cl-CD95L-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was studied. Confocal microscopy revealed that addition of cl-CD95L led to the compartmentalization of Orai1 into the CD95-CAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Substitution of the conserved glutamate in position 106 to an alanine (Orai1<sub>E106A</sub>) results in a non-conducting Orai1 channel acting as a dominant negative construct that abrogates the native SOC current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Vig1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Prakriya1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Yeromin1">[43]</xref>. Consequently, we generated leukemic T-cell clones stably expressing the Orai1 mutant or over-expressing the wild type Orai1 and we assessed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response induced by cl-CD95L. Compared to GFP-expressing control cells, the ectopic expression of Orai1<sub>E106A</sub> dramatically reduced the amplitude and the duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). On the other hand, over-expression of Orai1 resulted in a significant increase in the intensity and the duration of the CD95-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Overall, these findings established that in the presence of cl-CD95L, T-cells elicit a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response through a PLCγ1/IP3R/Orai1 signaling pathway at the leading edge of the emitted pseudopod in a structure that may contribute to cell migration.</p>

        <title>cl-CD95L Promotes Cell Migration through a Death-Domain Dependent Signal</title>
        <p>Next, we addressed the impact of the metalloprotease-processed CD95L on cell migration by using Boyden chamber and wound healing assays. For this purpose, we reconstituted the CD95-deficient PS120 cell line with either wild type CD95 (PS120<sup>CD95</sup>) or death-domain truncated counterpart (PS120<sup>CD95(Δ1-210)</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). In contrast to the parental PS120 or PS120<sup>CD95(Δ1-210)</sup>, PS120<sup>CD95</sup> exhibited a sensitivity towards the multimeric Ig-CD95L (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), which indicated that the intracellular CD95 machinery remained functional in these cells. As expected, cl-CD95L did not trigger cell death in the different PS120 cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Strikingly, we found that in contrast to PS120 and PS120<sup>CD95(Δ1-210)</sup> cells, migration of PS120<sup>CD95</sup> cells was stimulated in the presence of cl-CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>), indicating that a functional death domain was required to mediate the cl-CD95L effects on motility. To confirm the role of cl-CD95L on cell motility, wound-healing assays were carried out. Fibroblasts were grown to confluency, and a “wound” was realized in the cell monolayer. While in the presence of cl-CD95L cells devoid of CD95 or expressing a DD-deficient CD95 failed to fill the gap after 24 h, the CD95-reconstituted PS120 completely healed the “wound” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, incubation with cl-CD95L did not modify the cell proliferation rate (unpublished data).

        <title>Cl-CD95L Causes an Orai1- and PI3K-Dependent Program of Cell Migration</title>
        <p>As the death domain of CD95 was crucial to mediate the motile signal, we next analyzed whether this intracellular region was also mandatory to induce Akt phosphorylation upon addition of cl-CD95L. We did not observe any Akt phosphorylation in PS120<sup>control</sup> and PS120<sup>CD95(Δ1-210)</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Conversely, expression of wild type CD95 restored the transmission of the PI3K/Akt signal upon cl-CD95L addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Since interconnections have been reported between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, we next investigated whether the cl-CD95L-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response contributed to the magnitude of the Akt activation level. To prevent the cl-CD95L-mediated calcium response, cells were pre-treated with the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM and 2-APB, an inhibitor of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) and store-operated calcium (SOC) channels. Inhibition of the cl-CD95L-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response using BAPTA-AM or 2-APB decreased by 60% and 70% the amount of Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), respectively, indicating that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise observed upon addition of cl-CD95L enhanced the activation level of Akt.</p>

            <p>(A) The CD95-deficient fibroblastic cell line PS120 transfected with empty vector (PS120<sup>control</sup>) or reconstituted with either human wild type CD95 (PS120<sup>CD95</sup>) or a death domain-truncated CD95 (PS120<sup>CD95(Δ1-210)</sup>) was incubated with 100 ng/ml of cleaved CD95L for indicated times. Cells were harvested, lyzed, and 100 µg of protein was loaded per lane. Proteins were resolved in a SDS-PAGE and immunoblots were performed. Phosphorylation of the serine<sup>473</sup> on Akt indicates activation of the kinase. Whole Akt is added as loading control.

Cells were then untreated (ctr) or treated for 5 min with 100 ng/ml of cl-CD95L and lysed, 50 µg/ml of protein was loaded per lane, and indicated immunoblots were performed. <italic>Lower panels</italic>: densitometry analyses of the immunoblot bands using ImageJ software and the histograms depict Phospho-Akt/whole Akt ratios. (C) Cell migration of PS120<sup>CD95</sup> was assessed using the Boyden chamber assay.

For each experiment, 10 pictures of the migrating cells were taken and a representative picture was depicted (Bars = 50 µm). (D) Cells were treated as described in (C).

        <p>Next, the role played by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI3K signals in the CD95L-mediated cell motility was investigated. Non-cytotoxic and non-cytostatic amounts of the PI3K inhibitors LY294002, a quercetin analogue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Vlahos1">[45]</xref>, or Wortmannin, a fungal metabolite, dramatically reduced the cl-CD95-mediated cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). Likewise, BAPTA-AM and 2-APB, which both prevented the cl-CD95L-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s005">Figure S5C and S5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s007">S7A and S7B</xref>), significantly impeded cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). Indeed, we found that inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 and Wortmannin reduced cell motility by 75% and 83%, respectively. On the other hand, down-modulation of the CD95-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response by either BAPTA-AM or 2-APB achieved 47% and 71% of cell migration blockade, respectively. We next examined the effects of small-molecule inhibitors of class I PI3Ks to explore the contribution of the different isoforms in the cl-CD95L-mediated cell migration. While the catalytic subunits p110α and p110β are ubiquitously expressed, p110δ and p110γ are found predominately in hematological cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Vanhaesebroeck1">[46]</xref>. By screening for p110 isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s008">Figure S8A</xref>) that could prevent the cl-CD95L-mediated cell migration, we observed that whereas p110-γ was instrumental in both the Akt activation and the transmigration of H9 T-cells across a barrier of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s008">Figure S8B and S8D</xref>), the α and β isoforms orchestrated the motility process in the non-hematological cell line PS120<sup>CD95</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s008">Figure S8C and S8E</xref>). These findings definitively proved that the cl-CD95L-mediated motility signal occurred through the class I PI3K activation and that the implicated isoform varied between hematological and non-hematological cells. Finally, we wondered whether Orai1 contributed to the cl-CD95L-mediated cell migration. To address this question, HEK cells were transiently transfected with either scrambled or Orai1-targeting shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Orai1 knock-down in HEK cells reduced the SOC current by 85% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Kim1">[47]</xref>. Strikingly, the silencing of Orai1 abrogated the cl-CD95L-mediated cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), strongly supporting the conclusion that the Orai1-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry contributed to the motility signal induced in the presence of cl-CD95L. Altogether, these findings underlined that the metalloprotease-cleaved CD95L does not behave as an inert ligand but rather stimulates cell migration through an Orai1/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI3K-dependent mechanism.</p>

        <title>Cleaved CD95L Activates the PI3K/Akt Signal Through the src Kinase c-Yes</title>
        <p>Induction of the CD95-mediated PI3K/Akt response remains poorly defined. However, it is established that activation of PI3K can be reached through activation of src kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Beitz1">[48]</xref>, which are found enriched into sub-domains of the plasma membrane designated lipid rafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Katagiri1">[49]</xref>. In this regard, src kinases are anchored to lipid rafts through the double acylation (i.e., palmitoylation and myristoylation) of their amino-terminal sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Koegl1">[50]</xref>. Lipid rafts were tagged using the amino-terminal domain of the src kinase Lck fused to the fluorescent protein GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Rodgers1">[51]</xref>, and we examined whether cl-CD95L enabled the compartmentalization of CD95 into lipid rafts, meaning in close vicinity of the src kinases. While T-cells displayed a homogeneous distribution of the Lck-GFP probe at the plasma membrane, addition of cl-CD95L partitioned CD95 into lipid rafts at the leading edge of the pseudopod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To follow lipid rafts in activated PBLs, we incubated cells with a fluorescent-conjugated cholera toxin B sub-unit that exhibits strong affinity for the monosialoganglioside GM1, a lipid enriched into lipid rafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Harder1">[52]</xref>. We confirmed that cl-CD95L achieved the partition of CD95 into lipid rafts at the leading edge of the emitted pseudopod in activated PBLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, inhibition of Src kinase activity using the pharmacologic inhibitor PP2 impeded the phosphorylation of Akt, supporting the notion that src kinases were involved in the transduction of the CD95-mediated PI3K/Akt signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). C-yes belongs to the src family and its activity promotes activation of PI3K in glioblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Kleber1">[19]</xref>. Strikingly, in activated PBLs and in the T-cell line H9, we observed that in contrast to the “canonical DISC” formed in the presence of the agonistic antibody APO1-3, addition of cl-CD95L failed to induce the binding of FADD, caspases-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), and -10 (unpublished data) to CD95 but promoted the recruitment of the tyrosine kinase c-yes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, another src kinase termed syk, which is involved in the BCR (B-cell receptor)-mediated PI3K activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Beitz1">[48]</xref>, was not detected in the CD95-containing complex (unpublished data). These findings indicated that binding of cl-CD95L to CD95 reached the formation of a molecular complex devoid of the initiator caspases-8 and -10. In agreement with these latter observations, inhibition of the caspase activity using the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk did not alter Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and cell motility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s009">Figure S9A and S9B</xref>). Next, the role of src kinases in the cl-CD95L-mediated cell motility was explored. Using Boyden chamber and wound healing assays, we demonstrated that the src kinase inhibitor PP2 completely abrogated the cl-CD95L-mediated cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s010">S10A</xref>). Likewise, activated PBLs underwent a significant increase in their migration across a vascular endothelial monolayer in the presence of cl-CD95L as compared with control medium and both PP2 and LY294002 hindered the transmigration process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). To ascertain that c-yes participated in igniting the CD95-mediated motility signal, cells were transduced with c-yes shRNA-encoding lentiviral vectors. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). C-yes silencing prevented the cl-CD95L-mediated Akt activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5G</xref>) and thus abrogated both the cell migration of the non-hematological cell line PS120<sup>CD95</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figures 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001090.s009">S9B</xref>) and the transmigration of T-cells across endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). Overall, these findings provide unique evidence that the naturally processed CD95L elicits a non-apoptotic signal through the formation of a “non-canonical” DISC devoid of FADD and caspases-8/-10 but encompassing the tyrosine kinase c-yes. This newly disclosed molecular complex was designated MISC for motility-inducing signaling complex.</p>

        <title>Incubation of Activated Lymphocytes with Sera of SLE Patients Induces Endothelial Adhesion and Transmigration</title>
        <p>Since in murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) ectopic expression of CD95L leads to a dramatic exacerbation of the disease index, we wondered whether cleaved CD95L was found increased in SLE-affected patients as compared to healthy individuals.

        <p>Next, to address whether CD95L found in sera of SLE patients behaves similarly to the one produced in vitro, we incubated activated PBLs with control or SLE sera and analyzed cell morphology by contrast phase and plasma membrane distribution of CD95 using confocal microscopy. Sera from healthy donors induced neither clustering of CD95 at the plasma membrane nor alteration of the cell morphology, whereas sera from lupus patients dramatically aggregated CD95 at the plasma membrane of activated lymphocytes. Similar to observations obtained with cl-CD95L produced in 293 cells, CD95-CAP was found distributed at the extremity of the emitted pseudopod (see red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, both modification of cell morphology and formation of CD95-CAP were abrogated by pre-incubating cells with anti-CD95 blocking mAb (clone ZB4, unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To decipher whether the increased amount of CD95L found in SLE patients compared to healthy individuals was able to trigger cell motility, titration of CD95L was applied on PS120 and PS120<sup>CD95</sup> and motility was assessed using wound healing assay. Doses of cleaved CD95L as low as 500 pg/ml efficiently promoted cell migration of PS120<sup>CD95</sup> cells, while 250 pg/ml of CD95L was totally inefficient to enhance the basal motile pattern of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). As previously mentioned, cells underwent migration through a CD95-driven mechanism, since CD95-deficient PS120 did not occur in cell migration upon addition of cleaved-CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, 500 pg/ml of soluble CD95L was around the median concentration measured in SLE patients (431 pg/ml), while 250 pg/ml corresponded to the median concentration found in healthy donors (253 pg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Finally, to establish that cleaved-CD95L promotes extravasation of activated T-lymphocytes, a process that is instrumental in accumulating T-cells in inflamed tissues and thus in fuelling the inflammatory process, activated T-lymphocytes were incubated either with SLE or healthy sera and both adhesion on and transmigration across endothelial cells were quantified. In the presence of SLE sera, activated T-lymphocytes underwent a significant increase in their adherence (4±1.21 versus 2±0.4×10<sup>4</sup> cell equivalent, for SLE versus control sera, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) and migration across a vascular endothelial monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001090-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) as compared with T-lymphocytes incubated in sera from healthy donors. In addition, blocking the CD95/CD95L interaction with an anti-CD95 neutralizing mAbs (clone ZB4) impeded both adhesion and transmigration of the activated T-cells. In summary, these findings indicated that the high amounts of cleaved-CD95L found in lupus patients promote T-lymphocyte extravasation and accumulation of the immune cells in inflamed tissues.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Most of the experiments aiming to understand the biological functions of CD95L have focused on its transmembrane moiety or engineered soluble CD95L mimicking the multimerized membrane-bound ligand. However, using the physiological soluble CD95L, which is the result of its membrane shedding, we demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that this cytokine released in the circulation behaves as a potent inducer of non-canonical (caspase-independent) and non-apoptotic signals that causes endothelial transmigration of activated T-lymphocytes. Cleaved CD95L induces the rapid emission of pseudopods in both activated lymphocytes and fibroblastic cells and subsequently promotes cell motility through a c-yes/Orai1/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI3K signal. Recent studies have revealed that a localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise occurs beneath the immune synapse upon the TCR engagement through the activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channel consisting of STIM1 and Orai1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Lioudyno1">[53]</xref>. STIM-1 is an ER-store Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Liou1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Roos1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Zhang1">[41]</xref> that links store depletion to Orai1 aggregation, which in turn leads to the selective Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. In this study, we ascertain that the CRAC channel consisting of the <italic>pore</italic>-forming subunit Orai1 plays a crucial role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry observed in the presence of cl-CD95L. In addition, this Ca<sup>2+</sup> response that promotes the CD95-mediated cell motility does not display a homogeneous cytosolic distribution but instead constitutes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain localized at the leading edge of the cell protrusion emitted by the migrating cells. This heterogeneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> distribution has recently been described as essential in steering cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Wei1">[33]</xref> and we speculate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain observed contiguous to the CD95-CAP may play a similar function. The spatial and temporal co-distribution of the PI3K activity (production of PIP3), actin polarization, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase at the leading edge of the CD95-driven pseudopods suggests interconnections between these different processes. This assumption is supported by the fact that failure to induce a calcium response hinders Akt activation and, as a result, decreases cell migration. Few publications have reported molecular targets linking cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase to Akt activity; for instance, a calmodulin-dependent mechanism in glioblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Shin1">[54]</xref> and a PKCα-dependent process in HUVEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Maffucci1">[55]</xref> enhance Akt phosphorylation and thus activation. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism underlying the modulation of the Akt activity following the formation of polarized Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains remains totally unknown and would require further investigation.</p>
      <p>Upon CD95 engagement, the proximal molecular events leading to activation of the non-canonical PI3K signal remains poorly defined. Here, we underscore that despite the fact that the CD95-mediated PI3K activation occurs through a death domain (DD)-dependent mechanism, FADD and the initiator caspases are not detected in the newly identified CD95-containing complex, suggesting either that another adaptor protein may participate in this CD95-mediated “non-orthodox” signal or that undetectable amounts of FADD remain sufficient to promote both the partition of CD95 into aggregated lipid rafts and the subsequent activation of src kinase yes through a yet unknown signaling pathway. In agreement with this latter notion, it has previously been reported that 2% of the caspase-8 activity is sufficient to redistribute CD95 into lipid raft platform through a ceramide-driven process and thus to evoke the apoptotic signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Rotolo1">[56]</xref>. However, this assumption seems unlikely since inhibition of the caspase activity does not affect either PI3K/Akt activation or cell motility. The newly disclosed CD95-containing complex, which gathers the src kinase c-yes, has been designated MISC for <italic>Mobility-inducing signaling complex</italic> in comparison with the <italic>Death-inducing signaling complex</italic> (DISC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Kischkel1">[57]</xref>. Recent evidence emphasizes that the tyrosine kinase c-src abrogates the caspase-8 activity through its phosphorylation on tyrosine 380, which serves as a docking site for the recruitment and the activation of p85, the regulatory sub-unit of the class IA PI3K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Senft1">[58]</xref>. Nevertheless, the implication of caspase-8 in the recruitment and activation of the PI3K signal remains doubtful in the context of the MISC since no caspase-8 or -10 were detected in this CD95-containing complex. In conclusion, even if the CD95-mediated c-yes activation is instrumental in eliciting PI3K/Akt signal and cell migration, the molecular ordering connecting the src kinase to the activation of PI3K/Akt remains to be clarified.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, redistribution of CD95 into lipid rafts has initially been described as a crucial step in the induction of the apoptotic signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Eramo1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-ScheelToellner1">[64]</xref>. It is tempting to postulate that as we previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Legembre5">[65]</xref>, at least two different types of lipid rafts can be gathered around CD95, and thus, according to the composition of the recruited lipid platform, an opposite signal may be transduced in the presence of cleaved and membrane-bound CD95L. This hypothesis has still to be confirmed, and furthermore, our observations raise the question of how ligands that only diverge by their stoichiometry may account for the partition of CD95 into different types of lipid rafts.</p>
      <p>This new observation not only is important to better appreciate the function of seric CD95L in cell biology but also offers the opportunity to gain insight into mechanisms underlying autoimmune disorders. Soluble CD95L was significantly increased in SLE patients as compared to healthy individuals, and furthermore, the concentration of CD95L was correlated with the activity of the autoimmune disease. We were concerned that the mix of cytokines present in the serum of SLE patients may affect the effect of cl-CD95L. However, we showed that in contrast to sera from healthy donors, soluble CD95L present in SLE patients efficiently achieved clustering of CD95 at the leading edge of the emitted pseudopods, which promoted both adhesion and transmigration across endothelial cells of the activated T-lymphocytes. Overall, the naturally processed CD95L cytokine evokes lymphocyte motility, which may account for the accumulation of cytotoxic T-cells in inflamed areas, causing tissue damages associated with chronic inflammatory disorders. Indeed, cell migration contributes to leukocyte extravasation and metastasis transition, among others, and these cellular mechanisms participate in the chronicity of inflammatory disorders and subsequent malignancy occurrence. Identification of cleaved-CD95L as a cytokine underlying these cellular processes may hold promises of new therapeutical approaches to prevent both tissue infiltration and damages. As a consequence and counter-intuitively, these findings point out that soluble CD95L may accelerate tumorigenesis through the activation of pro-survival, pro-proliferative signals and besides by promoting cell migration.</p>
      <p>In agreement with two recent publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Bivona1">[66]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001090-Chen2">[67]</xref>, the concept of CD95-mediated apoptosis contributing to elimination of unwanted and damaged cells can be revisited. Even if the so-called “death receptor” CD95 is not only dedicated to induce cell death, the molecular mechanisms finely tuning the switch from apoptotic to non-apoptosis signals or vice-versa remain unknown. Herein, we show that a crucial factor monitoring the CD95 signaling pathway is its ligand itself. Indeed, the post-translational modification consisting in the cleavage by metalloprotease of the membrane-bound CD95L creates a new ligand displaying totally different functions. Whereas the membrane-bound CD95L helps to contract the immune response and maintains peripheral tolerance, its metalloprotease-cleaved counterparts released in blood circulation induce non-apoptotic signals promoting cell migration, which plays a pivotal function in inflammation and tumorigenesis.</p>
