<abstract>
<p>The initial host response to fungal pathogen invasion is critical to infection establishment and outcome. However, the diversity of leukocyte–pathogen interactions is only recently being appreciated. We describe a new form of interleukocyte conidial exchange called “shuttling.” In <italic>Talaromyces marneffei</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> zebrafish in vivo infections, live imaging demonstrated conidia initially phagocytosed by neutrophils were transferred to macrophages. Shuttling is unidirectional, not a chance event, and involves alterations of phagocyte mobility, intercellular tethering, and phagosome transfer. Shuttling kinetics were fungal-species–specific, implicating a fungal determinant. β-glucan serves as a fungal-derived signal sufficient for shuttling. Murine phagocytes also shuttled in vitro. The impact of shuttling for microbiological outcomes of in vivo infections is difficult to specifically assess experimentally, but for these two pathogens, shuttling augments initial conidial redistribution away from fungicidal neutrophils into the favorable macrophage intracellular niche. Shuttling is a frequent host–pathogen interaction contributing to fungal infection establishment patterns.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In vertebrates, two phagocytic cell types have long been recognized as key players in the initial host defense response to infection: neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref001">1</xref>]. Neutrophils and macrophages share many features: they are both migratory cells, they phagocytose microorganisms on encountering them, and they have intracellular mechanisms for killing microorganisms. However, although both phagocyte types engulf microorganisms, individual microorganisms interact with neutrophils and macrophages with different species-specific preferences, in different ways, and using different molecular mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref002">2</xref>]. Conversely, the host has evolved diverse cellular strategies for these two different phagocytes to protect against the panoply of potentially pathogenic microorganisms.</p>
<p>The exchange of cytoplasmic material through contact-dependent mechanisms between adjacent cells is currently a topical field in cell biology. An example is the contact-dependent exchange of cytoplasm from macrophage to tumor cells as a metastasis-promoting mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref003">3</xref>], distinct from the cytoplasmic exchange between macrophages and tumor cells that occur via extracellular vesicles and nanotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>During infections, neutrophils and macrophages also engage in intercellular exchanges. Some microorganisms have evolved mechanisms that exploit these to enhance their pathogenicity and promote their spread between phagocytes. For example, <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes induce apoptosis in host neutrophils to then exploit efferocytosis, whereby clearance of dead neutrophils by macrophages leads to subsequent infection of this less-hostile host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref009">9</xref>]. Conversely, neutrophil phagocytosis of debris from dying macrophages is a recently demonstrated method of mycobacterial dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref010">10</xref>]. <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref011">11</xref>] and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref012">12</xref>] can be ejected from host macrophages by nonlytic exocytosis, while macrophage-resident <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref013">13</xref>] and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref014">14</xref>] also can enter new host macrophages through lateral transfer (recently termed metaforosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref015">15</xref>]). The gram-negative bacteria <italic>Francisella tularensi</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> are transferred between macrophages by a process related to trogocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref016">16</xref>]. These scenarios are characterized by death of the donor cell, expulsion of the pathogen from the donor cell without direct contact between donor and recipient phagocyte, or transfer between the same type of phagocyte. None involve transfer by direct contact from a living neutrophil to a living macrophage.</p>
<p>Such interactions provide an opportunity for intracellular pathogens to transfer to a new host cell while minimizing exposure to a potentially hostile extracellular environment. As antibiotic resistance becomes a growing problem, there is an ever-increasing interest in host-pathway–directed anti-infective therapies. Host-dependent processes for pathogen dissemination represent key potential targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Zebrafish have emerged as an ideal model for intravital imaging of leukocyte behaviors during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref018">18</xref>]. They combine the advantages of small size, optical transparency (particularly as embryos and larvae), and suitability for genetic manipulation. Zebrafish phagocytes have been comprehensively characterized in developmental, genetic, and functional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Our recent modeling of fungal infections in zebrafish models have focused on high spatiotemporal resolution intravital imaging of the initial leukocyte–pathogen interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref020">20</xref>]. During these studies, we observed a form of microorganism exchange between neutrophils and macrophages that we believe to be previously undescribed, which we have named “shuttling.” In shuttling, a living donor neutrophil laden with previously phagocytosed fungal spore(s) transfers this cargo to a recipient macrophage through a tethered direct contact, without death of the donor neutrophil. Shuttling is therefore different from all the previously described microorganism exchanges between phagocytes.</p>
<p>In the present study, we comprehensively describe neutrophil-to-macrophage “shuttling.” Studying shuttles presented considerable technical challenges because they could only be identified by directly observing them retrospectively in in vivo live-imaging datasets. To recognize a shuttle, all three phases of the process had to be captured in the imaged volume: initial carriage of a phagocytosed spore within a mobile, living donor neutrophil; the moment of intercellular contact and transfer between neutrophil and macrophage; and the departure of the previously unladen recipient macrophage, now carrying its newly acquired cargo. All three shuttle-defining steps needed to have occurred within the imaged volume, despite the high mobility of the participating cells. Despite this challenge, we comprehensively describe the morphology of shuttling, quantify key parameters of the dynamic transfer process, and identify a key mechanistic determinant by demonstrating that the conidial cell-wall component β-glucan is a fungal-derived molecular signal sufficient to trigger shuttling of particles. Additionally, by replicating this phenomenon using murine phagocytes in vitro, we provide evidence that shuttling is a conserved behavior of both fish and mammalian phagocytes.</p>

<title>Some <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> conidia phagocytosed by neutrophils are “shuttled” to macrophages</title>
<p>While studying leukocyte behavior during the establishment of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> infection following inoculation of live conidia into zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref020">20</xref>], we unexpectedly observed the recurrent direct transfer of conidia from live neutrophils to adjacent live macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s006">S1A and S1B Movie</xref>). The phenomenon was revealed by combining a 3-color fluorescent reporter system (labeling neutrophils in green with enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP], macrophages in red [mCherry], and conidia in blue [calcofluor]) with high-spatiotemporal–resolution live confocal imaging. We called this new form of interphagocyte pathogen transfer “shuttling.” Two defining features of shuttling distinguished it from other previously described forms of pathogen transfer. Firstly, shuttling occurred between live leukocytes, demonstrated by the mobility of both donor neutrophil and recipient macrophage before, during, and after shuttles. Secondly, the dynamic morphology of shuttling suggested purposeful rather than random exchange through a tethered cell-to-cell contact.</p>

<p>To characterize the dynamic morphology of shuttling comprehensively, we systematically collected multiple unselected examples from extensive confocal live-imaging microscopy experiments. To ensure that shuttles were unequivocally distinguished from all other modes of intercellular pathogen transfer, stringent criteria were applied for events to be included in this initial panel. For inclusion as a shuttle, all three phases of donation, transfer, and receipt were required to be unequivocally visualized (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Materials and methods</xref> for full details). The resulting collection of unequivocal shuttles comprised 13 examples of live <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> conidial shuttling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), and as shuttling mechanisms were explored, another 17 unequivocal examples of conidial shuttling and 18 examples of the shuttling of other particles meeting all stringent definition criteria were collected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s013">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Shuttling of live <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> conidia occurred only in the first 2 h of infection establishment (median time of shuttle, 33 min [range 14–97] from commencement of imaging; <italic>n</italic> = 13 shuttles collected in 69 movies; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). In contrast, no <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> shuttles occurred during &gt;181 h of imaging after 2 h postinoculation.</p>
<p>These <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> shuttling examples exhibited morphological features with mechanistic implications. In several cases, the donor neutrophil and/or recipient macrophage formed a highly polarized shape resulting from cell-to-cell tethering around the time of shuttling (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g001">1A, 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g002">2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s006">S1B–S1D Movie</xref>). These drawn-out tethered extensions of neutrophil and macrophage cytoplasm before, during, or after shuttling indicated a focal rather than a whole-of cell “hugging” interaction between them. Furthermore, this tethering confirms that the cells come into direct physical contact for the shuttle rather than merely moving into close proximity and transferring the conidium by expulsion into the extracellular space and rephagocytosis.</p>

<p>To test whether conidial shuttling was specific to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> or a general phenomenon of fungal infection establishment, we assayed for shuttling following inoculation with live <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia, another fungus whose interactions with leukocytes are well studied in zebrafish models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref023">23</xref>] but for which shuttling has not previously been described. Seven unequivocal shuttles of live <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia occurred in 6/22 imaging sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g002">Fig 2D and 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s001">S1B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s007">S2 Movie</xref>). The median time of shuttling was 121 min (range 30–199) following commencement of imaging. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> shuttles exhibited similar features to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> shuttles, including cell-to-cell tethering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s007">S2D Movie</xref>). In 1/7 examples, 2 shuttles occurred in the same imaged volume between different donor neutrophils and macrophages, separated by an interval of 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g002">Fig 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>To exclude the possibility that shuttling was an artifact of labeling conidia with calcofluor, we tested conidia with an alternate label. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia labeled with Alexa Fluor 405 were also shuttled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s007">S2C Movie</xref>). All shuttles occurred from donor neutrophil to recipient macrophage. No macrophage-to-neutrophil shuttles were observed despite looking carefully for them.</p>
<p>Collectively, these observations establish that shuttling is a recurrent form of unidirectional pathogen transfer from neutrophils to macrophages that occurs early in fungal infection establishment. It is not a peculiarity of the host response to a particular fungal pathogen because it occurs with two fungal species.</p>

<title>Incidence of shuttling</title>
<p>Shuttling events meeting our stringent criteria were observed in 20/91 (22%) unselected imaging sequences of &gt;60 min duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). While this ascertainment rate provided a scorable surrogate categorical variable for shuttling incidence, a more biologically relevant measure of the incidence of shuttling would add weight to its biological significance.</p>
<p>One such biologically relevant quantification is the shuttling incidence per conidium at risk of shuttling. This measure, regardless of any macrophage phagocytic activity and recruitment of nonphagocytosing leukocytes, is denominated solely by the number of spore-laden neutrophils in the imaged volume available to act as donors. While this is impossible to determine exactly for any single image series because of neutrophil flux through the imaged volume, it is possible to compute an averaged estimate. For both these fungi, we have previously examined phagocytosis during infection establishment and previously reported that macrophage phagocytosis predominates over neutrophil phagocytosis in the first 3 h following inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref020">20</xref>]. These phagocytosis data resulted from analysis of a subset of imaging files of the current dataset and so provide a basis for estimating an averaged shuttling incidence based on averaged spore-laden neutrophil phagocytosis rates. For <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic>, an average of 1.34 conidia-loaded neutrophils (67 neutrophils at 50 time points) were present at any time in the imaged volume to be available as donors throughout the first 180 min after inoculation (derived from <italic>n</italic> = 10 imaging series, being those 10 series closest to 180 min in length). Hence, 13 shuttles in 69 imaging series means that on average, 14% of spores available in neutrophils for donation were shuttled in 3 h. Also of note is the fact that 5/10 imaging series had only ≤1 spore-laden neutrophil present in the imaged volume during the first 180 min, and hence, these imaging series provided little opportunity for shuttling to occur. For <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic>, neutrophil phagocytosis of conidia was much rarer, as also observed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref021">21</xref>]. An analogous averaged calculation gives an average incidence of 44% for shuttling of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> spores that were available for donation by loaded neutrophils in the 3 h after inoculation (36 neutrophils/50 time points = 0.72 spore-laden neutrophils on average at any time point over 3 h; 7 shuttles in 22 movies).</p>
<p>Calculating the real shuttle incidence is challenging, and these rates are certainly underestimates. The rate depends on the sensitivity of ascertainment, which is constrained by the limitations of the detection method and our stringent definition of shuttling. These two factors together conspire to underestimate shuttle incidence.</p>
<p>Challenges in shuttle detection that contributed to underestimating incidence included (1) shuttles can currently only be recognized by the laborious method of manually observing them in retrospective analysis of imaging datasets; (2) at the magnification required for the subcellular resolution needed to see shuttles, the imaged volume is only a small fraction of the infected volume; and (3) the leukocytes involved are highly mobile and frequently move out of the imaged volume, and hence, the denominators for computing incidence are constantly changing.</p>
<p>Several other observations indicate that shuttles are not rare. If shuttles were rare, it would be unlikely that multiple examples would occur together or in the same imaging sequence. However, 5/20 datasets contained examples of multiple shuttles: either 2–3 spores being shuttled together or in quick succession or asynchronously from the same or several different donor neutrophils (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g002">2B, 2C, 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g003">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s006">S1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s007">S2F, S2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s008">S3A–S3C</xref> Movies).</p>

<p>The stringent criteria applied to ensure only unequivocal shuttles were included also means that the shuttle incidence is likely to be underestimated. Multiple events that were probably shuttles were excluded from this initial panel of unequivocal shuttles (see examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s009">S4 Movie</xref>). There were probable shuttles for which the conidium could not unequivocally be resolved as within the donor neutrophil rather than adherent to it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s002">S2A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s009">S4A Movie</xref>). The criterion most often not met was clear visualization of the donor–recipient cell-to-cell contact at the point of conidial transfer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s009">S4C–S4D Movie</xref>). This scenario included instances in which a phagocytosed particle appeared to be deposited by the neutrophil into extracellular space and was then subsequently taken up by a macrophage. In some imaged volumes, a large number of highly active neutrophils and macrophages were attracted to the inoculated spores, and it was impossible to separate what was happening, although many spores were initially within neutrophils that ended up in macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s002">S2D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s009">S4D Movie</xref>). All imaging datasets collected for these studies have been included in the denominator of our unselected series despite such features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s013">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>From these data and considerations, we conclude that although the detection of shuttling is laborious and challenging, shuttling itself is not a rare phenomenon. For both these fungal pathogens, those spores that are initially phagocytosed by neutrophils have a substantial chance of being shuttled to macrophages in the first 3 h of infection establishment.</p>

<title>Shuttling involves phagosome transfer</title>
<p>We previously reported the transfer of neutrophil cytoplasm to macrophages in the context of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref024">24</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that shuttling could also involve transfer of donor neutrophil cytoplasmic components to the recipient macrophage. To test specifically whether neutrophil membrane was also transferred, we imaged shuttling in transgenic (<italic>Tg</italic>) macrophage-expressed gene 1 (<italic>mpeg1</italic>):<italic>mCherry-CaaX/</italic>myeloid-specific peroxidase (<italic>mpx</italic>):<italic>EGFP-CaaX)</italic> embryos, in which the fluorescent labeling of neutrophils and macrophages is localized to the membrane via a prenylation motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s008">S3 Movie</xref>). Cross-sectional fluorescence intensity profiling of conidia in these transgenic lines demonstrated that prior to shuttling, about-to-be shuttled conidia reside within membrane-bound compartments within the neutrophil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Observation of shuttled conidia in macrophages immediately following transfer demonstrated that green fluorescent signal surrounding the spore, attributable to the neutrophil membrane, was also transferred to the macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>This provides direct evidence that shuttled conidia are located in a membrane-lined subcellular neutrophil compartment, likely to be a neutrophil phagosome, that is shuttled in its entirety to the recipient macrophage. The rapid decay of the cytoplasmic neutrophil reporter fluorophore signal following shuttling suggests that within the macrophage it is either quenched because of pH change or that the structure of the shuttled phagosome and its component proteins are rapidly destroyed by the macrophage. Further evidence that shuttled particles reside within the acidified phagolysosome environment of donor neutrophils before shuttling and recipient macrophages after shuttling was generated from an in vitro assay using murine leukocytes (see below).</p>

<title>Phagocyte motility confirms that living cells participate in shuttling</title>
<p>Our previous studies demonstrated that phagocytes exhibit lineage- and site-specific spatiotemporal responses during establishment of fungal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref020">20</xref>]. We asked whether shuttling occurred “on the fly” between fast-moving cells or whether cells slowed down and “parked” to engage in this intercellular interaction.</p>
<p>We first focused on the scenario in which <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> conidia were delivered into the somite. To characterize the overall picture of leukocyte movement in which shuttling occurred, we used 4-dimensional cell tracking in Imaris software (Bitplane; Andor Technology, Belfast, UK) to extract and plot cell coordinates in time and space. We interrogated these data using the open source programming language R as has been used to analyze leukocyte swarming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref025">25</xref>]. In this scenario, neutrophils started to migrate towards the infection site soon after inoculation with conidia, while macrophage migration initiated later, during the second hour postinfection. Overall, neutrophils exhibited more rapid motility than macrophages at all times and in all directions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Phagocytosis of conidia upon arrival at the site of infection was associated with a reduction in migration velocity for both neutrophils and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>To focus on the subset of phagocytes engaging in shuttling within this melee of phagocyte activity, we developed “ShuttleFinder,” a MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) program based on “PhagoSight” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref026">26</xref>] that performs spatiotemporal tracking of conidia and reports the color of their immediate surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). ShuttleFinder did not facilitate automatic shuttle discovery because of the high number of disjointed tracks and a high number of false positives. However, it enabled the paths of conidia that were shuttled to be displayed in 2-dimensional space and time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4Bi</xref>) and 3-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4Bii</xref>). This demonstration of conidial translocation showed the extent to which the donor neutrophils and recipient macrophages in which shuttled spores resided were mobile prior to and following the shuttle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next assessed whether cell velocity changed during shuttling by manually examining the displacement of neutrophils and macrophages relative to the shuttle site over fixed 5-min intervals for the 20-min period before and after shuttles. Neutrophil displacement was significantly less for the 5-min period immediately before a shuttle than the period just after shuttling, indicating a faster neutrophil directional velocity immediately following shuttling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Furthermore, neutrophil displacement from the shuttle site by 20 min after shuttling was at least as great as that at 20 min before, confirming that shuttling neutrophils remained as actively mobile as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The ongoing movement of neutrophils after shuttling strongly indicates that the donor neutrophil remained alive.</p>
<p>Macrophages also moved towards and away from the shuttle point, confirming their viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). As expected, for shuttles of both conidial types, macrophage average directional velocity over the 20 min after shuttling was significantly slower than that of the departing neutrophils (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic>: 1.1 ± 0.5 versus 2.0 ± 1.2 μm/min, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0251; <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic>: 1.1 ± 0.4 versus 1.8 ± 1.0 μm/min, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0388; one-tailed <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Over longer periods of time, recipient macrophages were highly mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), also confirming their ongoing viability throughout the shuttling process.</p>
<p>The 20 shuttles of live spores meeting all stringent definition criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) suggested that shuttling continues the process of conidial dissemination. In 16/20 cases, the donor neutrophil entered the field during the imaging period, and hence, it had picked up its spore for donation elsewhere. Furthermore, in 18/20 cases, the recipient macrophage separated from the donor neutrophil before the image sequence finished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>In summary, these data show that neutrophils slow down to donate conidia for shuttling and speed up on departing, remaining viable throughout the process. The recipient macrophages also remain actively mobile throughout the shuttling process. The mobility of shuttling cells before and after shuttling contributes to the ongoing process of spore dissemination during infection establishment.</p>

<title>Shuttling is a purposeful interaction that involves sustained intercellular communication</title>
<p>We considered the possibility shuttling might be a chance event rather than purposeful interaction. If shuttling occurred by chance alone, then the number of shuttles would be expected to be a function of the number of conidia delivered. However, shuttles occurred in fields that had initially as few as &lt;4 conidia and as many as 75–100 conidia for both fungal species, and we could not resolve a trend based on the number of conidia initially in the imaged volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>We also hypothesized that if shuttling were purposeful rather than a random event, then this would be reflected by purposeful intercellular interactions. Shuttling is characterized by multiple polarized interactions between the donor neutrophil and the recipient macrophage prior to the shuttle, indicating sustained and purposeful prior cell–cell communication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s006">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s007">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s008">S3</xref> Movies). To quantitatively test the hypothesis that the degree of intercellular interaction between shuttling leukocytes was unusually extensive, we compared the duration of neutrophil–macrophage contacts that ended with a shuttle to randomly selected nonshuttling contacts. This analysis revealed that shuttling cells stay in contact for a significantly longer period prior to shuttling than is otherwise the case for random neutrophil–macrophage interactions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). This observation is consistent with there being signals bringing the donor and recipient cells together prior to shuttling. Furthermore, it indicates that these signals are different from those that attracted the leukocytes to migrate to the site of infection.</p>

<title>Pathogen-dependent shuttling kinetics indicates a conidial determinant</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the molecular mechanism driving shuttling likely involved fungal determinants.

Although we observed no obvious morphological difference between shuttles of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia (suggesting that the mechanism driving shuttling is fundamentally the same for both), the kinetics of shuttling events differed for the two species. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> shuttles occurred predominantly in the first hour after inoculation, whereas <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> shuttles happened at later time points (<italic>p</italic> = 0.016) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).

<p>This important observation indicates that although shuttling is a general phenomenon in fungal infection establishment, because the kinetics of shuttling is specific to the fungal species, determinants of the molecular mechanism reside in properties of the conidia themselves.</p>

<title>β-glucan is a fungal determinant sufficient for shuttling</title>
<p>Because shuttling was independent of conidial viability, we hypothesized that the spore-derived signal for shuttling was either from the shape or size of the particle or was a chemical component of the fungal cell wall such as chitin or β-glucan.</p>
<p>To test whether particle size was sufficient to trigger shuttling, we microinjected 1.7- to 2.2-μm fluorescent particles (approximating the size of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia) into the tail somite of 2–3 days postfertilization (dpf) zebrafish embryos. Although the beads were actively phagocytosed by both neutrophils and macrophages, no shuttling events were observed (approximately 60 h of imaging, 19 experiments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). During these experiments, we frequently observed efferocytosis of entire bead-laden neutrophils by macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s010">S5B Movie</xref>). While the neutrophil EGFP fluorescent signal was rapidly lost following engulfment, the bead-conjugated fluorophore signal persisted. These experiments determined that being a particle of a particular size was not sufficient to induce shuttling and that leukocyte phagocytic behavior towards inert beads was demonstrably different to their response to fungal conidia. This indicates that shuttling is a behavior driven at least in part by a chemical signal residing within the conidium itself.</p>
<p>The cell wall of fungal conidia is primarily composed of polysaccharides (chitin and glucans) and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref027">27</xref>]. The β-glucan class of polysaccharides are a major component of the conidial wall and are highly immunostimulatory, so they represented a promising candidate shuttling mediator. We confirmed that β-glucan was exposed on the surface of the ungerminated <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia as prepared as for shuttled inoculates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), making β-glucan a candidate fungal stimulus for shuttling. To test whether β-glucan was sufficient to induce shuttling, we first looked for shuttling of zymosan particles. Zymosan particles are approximately 3 μm in diameter and are a derivative of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cell wall, a rich source of β-glucan glucose polymers. We observed 3 unequivocal shuttles from approximately 30 h of imaging over 6 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>). Because zymosan is predominantly β-glucan, these data suggested that β-glucan may be a spore-derived signal sufficient for shuttling.</p>
<p>To more rigorously test the ability of β-glucan itself to trigger shuttling, we tested whether coating plastic beads in β-glucan conferred on them the ability to be shuttled. While uncoated beads were not shuttled (0 shuttles in 19 experiments), beads coated with β-glucan were shuttled at relatively high frequency (10 shuttles during 22 experiments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g006">Fig 6B and 6D</xref>). Furthermore, treating β-glucan–coated beads with a mixture of β-glucanase enzymes (including endo/exo-1,3-β-D-glucanase and β-glucosidase) significantly reduced the rate of shuttle ascertainment from 10 shuttles in 22 experiments to 3 shuttles over 24 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>As a genetic model, we also tested Δ<italic>gel1</italic>Δ<italic>gel7</italic>Δ <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> α-glucosidase 1(<italic>cwh41</italic>) <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> spores, which are deficient in their cell-wall β-glucan content because of mutation of their <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> β-1,3-glucanosyltransferase (<italic>gel</italic>) genes (62.6% and 42% of wild type at 37 °C and 50 °C, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref028">28</xref>]. The shuttle ascertainment rate for conidia from the mutant strain trended lower compared to wild-type <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> (27.3% in wild type versus 14.8% in mutant), but this difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), likely because the approximately 50% remaining β-glucan on the conidial cell wall remained sufficient to trigger shuttling.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that β-glucan is a fungal-wall–derived molecule that is sufficient to trigger shuttling signals.</p>

<title>Shuttling also occurs between mammalian neutrophils and macrophages</title>
<p>Our studies in zebrafish revealed that shuttling was a conserved host response to different species of fungi. We also observed shuttling between murine neutrophils and macrophages, indicating that this behavior was conserved between phagocytes from different host species, including higher vertebrates such as mammals.</p>
<p>Shuttling between murine phagocytes was observed in an in vitro assay. Primary mouse bone marrow neutrophils were preloaded with Alexa-Fluor-488–labeled zymosan added to mouse bone-marrow–derived macrophages and imaged over time. The transfer of zymosan particles from living neutrophils to macrophages was observed in a similar fashion to that observed in the zebrafish in vivo model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>).</p>

<p>These data indicate that shuttling is a conserved behavior of phagocytes in vertebrates from zebrafish to higher mammalian models and is relevant to host–pathogen interactions during establishment of fungal infections in mammals.</p>
<p>We employed this in vitro system to verify that shuttled particles were truly intracellular prior to and after their shuttling, using zymosan particles labeled with pHrodo, a dye that is nonfluorescent at neutral pH but fluoresces at acidic pH, as occurs in maturing phagosomes. The dataset comprises two independent 5-h imaging sequences capturing 3 fields per well, imaged at 3-min intervals, in which 164 shuttles were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g008">Fig 8A–8D</xref>). Initially, there were many nonfluorescent intracellular particles, but progressively, all pHrodo-stained zymosan particles within neutrophils and macrophages fluoresced, indicating they were now within intracellular acidic environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g008">Fig 8A–8C and 8E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s011">S6C–S6E Movie</xref>). Consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref030">30</xref>], a generally weaker pHrodo signal in neutrophils than macrophages indicated that the neutrophil phagosomes were less acidic than macrophage phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g008">Fig 8A–8C and 8E</xref>). All 164 shuttled particles displayed pHrodo fluorescence in the donor neutrophil at a level significantly above background, indicating that before shuttling, they were within an acidified intracellular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g008">Fig 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s011">S6C–S6E Movie</xref>). Within the recipient macrophage, the shuttled particle remained in an acidic environment that became progressively more acidic, reflected by a progressively stronger pHrodo fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g008">Fig 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s011">S6C–S6E Movie</xref>). These data confirm that shuttled particles are not merely adhered to the donor cell but originate from within acidified donor neutrophil phagosomes. Furthermore, they are transferred to macrophage phagosomes that undergo further maturation with acidification.</p>

<p>The incidence of shuttling was determined for these in vitro assay conditions. At the densities of donor neutrophils, recipient macrophages, and zymosan particle loading rates used in these experiments, shuttling rates over 5 h were 4.8 and 20.0 shuttles per 100 loaded neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s014">S2 Table</xref>). As the shuttles occurred through the entire 5-h ascertainment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), this averages to 1 and 4 shuttles/100 loaded neutrophils/h. This provides further evidence that shuttling is a prevalent interaction between zymosan-laden neutrophils and macrophages.</p>
<p>Dectin-1 is considered the major β-glucan receptor in mammalian systems, although other cell-surface β-glucan–binding molecules also exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref032">32</xref>]. We therefore used our in vitro shuttling assay to test whether Dectin-1 expression was required for recipient macrophages to accept zymosan shuttles from neutrophils by using macrophages from Dectin-1 knockout mice. Shuttles from wild-type neutrophils to Dectin-1<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages occurred, indicating that Dectin-1 is not absolutely required for zymosan shuttling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g008">Fig 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s011">S6F Movie</xref>). However, the incidence of shuttling was consistently lower when recipient macrophages were Dectin-1–deficient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000113.t001">Table 1</xref>). In two independent experiments, the shuttling rates with Dectin-1<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages were 23% and 36% of the wild-type rates. The wild-type rates in these experiments (4.9 and 4.3 shuttles/100 loaded neutrophils at 20.4 min) corresponded well with the incidence data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s014">S2 Table</xref>. These observations indicate that Dectin-1 is indeed involved in shuttling signaling, and there is a requirement for Dectin-1 for optimal shuttling efficiency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We previously reported the exchange of cytoplasmic fragments from living neutrophils to macrophages during a wound-stimulated inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref024">24</xref>], although the physiological purpose of this process was unknown. The data presented here reveal that one purpose of cytoplasmic exchange between neutrophils and macrophages is the transfer of phagocytosed microorganisms. It is readily assumed that when a conidium is found within a particular phagocyte during early infection establishment, then it was that particular phagocyte that first phagocytosed it. We show clearly that is not the case. Conidial shuttling from living neutrophils to macrophages early in fungal infection is an additional and significant aspect of the cell biology of the initial host–pathogen interaction in vivo.</p>
<p>Shuttles could only be identified by careful retrospective analysis of live in vivo imaging files, which presented a substantial challenge to recognizing and studying them and their mechanism. From the 188 independent imaging experiments in this report, we identified 48 stringently defined in vivo conidial shuttles. Using shuttling ascertainment rates as a surrogate for shuttling incidence was sufficient for comparing conditions when exploring shuttling mechanisms. For example, we observed an overall ascertainment rate of 21.4% (30/140 datasets) for biological particles (live or dead fungal spores and zymosan particles), compared to 45.5% (10/22) for β-glucan–coated beads. From a more biological perspective, for in vivo infections following the delivery of 50–100 conidia/inoculum (of which only a minority are initially phagocytosed by neutrophils), the averaged shuttling incidence was at least 19.9% of neutrophil-located spores in the first 3 h of infection. Shuttling was also sufficiently common for multiple occurrences to be recognized in some movies. Collectively, these observations indicate that shuttling is a consistent, recurring phenomenon during infection establishment. Although it comprises only a minority of overall phagocytic events, it still has the potential to impact the outcome of the host–pathogen interaction.</p>
<p>To differentiate shuttling from other mechanisms of pathogen entry into macrophages (such as direct phagocytosis, efferocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref009">9</xref>], metaforosis/lateral transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref015">15</xref>], and trogocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref016">16</xref>]), it was critical to observe both the cellular origin of shuttled conidium and the moment of transfer. The only possible way to do this was to perform high-resolution 4-dimensional confocal microscopy with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Our in vivo zebrafish model provided fluorescent labeling clearly distinguishing the two phagocyte lineages, and imaging conditions were optimized for low phototoxicity. While this enabled high spatiotemporal resolution imaging for multiple hours, the imaging volumes often contained considerable biological complexity (high cell densities, cells entering/leaving imaging volume, etc.), which made identifying potential interactions quite challenging. It should also be noted that although the total number of inoculated conidia per experiment was only 50–100 particles, only a fraction were within the imaged volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). For these reasons and those mentioned earlier, the shuttling incidence that we report certainly underestimates the absolute rate.</p>
<p>The collective attributes of shuttles distinguish shuttling from all other forms of previously described conidial transfer between leukocytes. In the scenarios we examined, shuttles were unidirectional (neutrophil to macrophage), although we cannot categorically exclude the possibility that shuttling could occur in the opposite direction. Shuttles occurred only in the first hours after inoculation, and very distinctively, donor neutrophils were alive and mobile before and after shuttling and could shuttle one or more conidia. Recipient macrophages were also alive and mobile and could be spore-naïve or preloaded prior to shuttling. Shuttles were preceded by highly regionalized neutrophil–macrophage interactions and occurred through focal cell-to-cell interactions, analogous to an intercellular synapse, that sometimes resulted in tethering of the 2 cells together. Macrophages sometimes received aliquots of neutrophil cytoplasm along with the donated spore. This was demonstrated in some cases to be the concomitant transfer of neutrophil membrane around shuttled conidia, consistent with shuttles being the transfer of conidia-laden phagosomes between donor neutrophil and recipient macrophage rather than just of conidia themselves. This transfer of donor cell membrane also distinguishes shuttling from “nonlytic exocytosis,” as described for the expulsion of previously phagocytosed <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> from macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref013">13</xref>]. Furthermore, although nonlytic exocytosis expels the pathogen from a macrophage, it has not yet been described in the context of a concurrent interaction with another leukocyte lineage. The cytoplasmic exchange did not, however, provide a durable marker of shuttle occurrence because the EGFP signal rapidly disappeared, mostly likely because of acidification of the macrophage phagolysosome, as is dramatically demonstrated by our example of the efferocytosis of an entire bead-laden neutrophil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s010">S5 Movie</xref>).</p>
<p>Emphasizing the distinctive nature of shuttling, our movies captured instances of other forms of pathogen exchange between phagocytes that were clearly not shuttles, including (1) neutrophil-to-neutrophil transfer following complete conidial drop-off and departure by the donor neutrophil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s005">S5A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s012">S7A Movie</xref>); (2) neutrophil-to-macrophage transfer following complete conidial drop-off and departure by the donor neutrophil, occurring in proximity to a bona fide shuttle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s005">S5B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s012">S7B Movie</xref>); and (3) neutrophil-to-neutrophil transfer via drop-off as in (1), followed by subsequent shuttling of the same conidium from the second neutrophil to a macrophage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s005">S5C Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s012">S7C Movie</xref>). We did not observe macrophage-to-macrophage lateral transfer of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia as has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref014">14</xref>], likely because this is a later event, predominantly occurring later than 4 h following infection initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Both dead and live conidia, labeled with either calcofluor or Alexa Fluor dye, were shuttled. This was consistent with a conidium-directed chemical stimulus driving shuttling and excluded the possibility that shuttling was a conidium-labeling artefact. Furthermore, shuttling of conidia was conserved for two opportunistic fungal pathogen species, but the kinetics of shuttling was pathogen-specific. This suggested that shuttling was driven by a component common to the conidial cell wall of both species, but one present at different levels or exposed to phagocytes to different degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref033">33</xref>]. Shuttling of zymosan particles provided further evidence locating a shuttling trigger to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g005">Fig 5A and 5C</xref>), leading β-glucan to be identified as a fungal-derived signal sufficient to drive shuttling of plastic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g005">Fig 5B and 5D</xref>). A mutant <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> strain with reduced β-glucan trended to lower shuttling rates, also consistent with the hypothesis that conidial β-glucan directly drives shuttling. Since zymosan particles were shuttled from murine neutrophils to macrophages in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g007">Fig 7</xref>), shuttling seems to be a phenomenon widely conserved among vertebrates and, as for other highly conserved phenomena in host defense, possibly plays an important role in the outcome of infection.</p>
<p>Phagocytosis of fungal pathogens by mammalian leukocytes involves a cluster of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), including Dectin-1, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and Macrophage Mannose Receptor (MMR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref034">34</xref>], and downstream signaling pathways, including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref035">35</xref>]. The main mammalian receptor for β-glucan is Dectin-1, although other receptors are also involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref032">32</xref>]. Hence, it was likely that this receptor and the downstream signaling pathways it engages would be involved in conidial shuttling (as well as phagocytosis). A homolog of mammalian Dectin-1 is yet to be identified in the zebrafish genome, but known downstream signaling components such as Syk have been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref036">36</xref>]. Our in vitro assay showed that for zymosan shuttling between murine cells, there is not an absolute requirement for recipient macrophages to express Dectin-1, but its absence compromises shuttling efficiency. Other shuttle-initiating signals must be involved. Because the neutrophil is clearly viable following the exchange, and because tethering involves only a small portion of the neutrophil membrane, it is improbable that the triggers are broadly displayed “eat me” signals of imminently apoptotic neutrophils such as phosphatidyl serine or calreticulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref037">37</xref>]. However, regionalized display of such signals might be possible. Testing these hypotheses in vivo will be challenging and will require cell-specific and temporally constrained approaches because their global inhibition will inhibit initial neutrophil phagocytosis of conidia, which is a prerequisite for shuttling. Our in vitro systems provide an alternative approach for addressing these mechanistic questions.</p>
<p>Our current model for shuttling begins with priming of the spore-laden donor neutrophil and its engagement with the recipient macrophage through preshuttle contacts. Within the neutrophil, cytoskeletal rearrangement relocates the conidium within a membrane-lined phagosome towards the side of the neutrophil proximate to the recipient macrophage. The conidium, still within its phagosome, is then transferred from the donor neutrophil to the recipient macrophage. β-glucan–dependent molecular signals are required for shuttling and involve Dectin-1 signaling in the recipient macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000113.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Model of neutrophil-to-macrophage conidial shuttles.</title>
<p>The schematic indicates 5 steps in neutrophil-to-macrophage conidial shuttling that accommodate morphological and mechanistic insights from these studies. Undefined signals slow the donor neutrophil and recipient macrophage and bring them into proximity (A), leading to β-glucan–dependent intercellular shuttling signals and spore relocation within the donor cell towards the recipient macrophage (B). An intercellular synapse forms with tethering (C), leading to phagosome transfer (D) and its incorporation into recipient macrophages by a mechanism partially dependent on Dectin-1, at least initially retaining components of the membrane-lined donor cell phagosome (E). Both donor and recipient cells remain active following shuttling, and eventually, both depart (E).</p>

<p>Neutrophil-to-macrophage pathogen shuttling poses other intriguing mechanistic questions. Is it unique to fungal infection or does it occur more widely? Neutrophil-to-macrophage cytoplasm transfer was observed during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref024">24</xref>], suggesting that shuttling may be regulated by inflammatory cytokines. Macrophage cytoplasm transfer to melanoma tumor cells has recently been shown to augment metastatic dissemination and may be another manifestation of this behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref003">3</xref>]. Is shuttling achieved by repurposing of existing cellular machinery? The tethering of separating participating cells immediately after the interaction points to potential involvement of the neutrophil uropod, a structure under much traction stress and rich in actively rearranging cytoskeletal components such as actin–myosin bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref038">38</xref>]. Shuttling may be another manifestation of co-opted trogocytosis mechanisms, as described for macrophage-to-macrophage exchange of gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref016">16</xref>]. However, trogocytosis-associated intercellular bacterial exchanges cannot involve β-glucan signaling.</p>
<p>The most tantalizing question is: what is the impact on the microbiological outcome of the infection? Tied up with this is whether shuttling serves to benefit the host or the pathogen. We recently showed in zebrafish models that macrophages provide an intracellular niche protecting <italic>T</italic>. <italic>marneffei</italic> conidia from neutrophil fungicidal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref020">20</xref>]. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia are also protected by macrophages from neutrophil fungicidal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref023">23</xref>]. Hence, fungal-driven shuttling may have evolved to optimize the location of invading conidia into the less-hostile intracellular environment of macrophages. Certainly, for these two pathogens, shuttling augments initial conidial redistribution away from the unfavorable neutrophil intracellular environment into their viability-enhancing macrophage intracellular niche. Alternatively, shuttling may be a host defense mechanism aiding adaptive immunity. Neutrophils are ineffective antigen-presenting cells, whereas macrophages specialize in this; therefore, the potential outcome of neutrophil-to-macrophage transfer would be to make pathogen antigens accessible to the adaptive immune system. Delineating the viability outcome for shuttled conidia will require tools for tracing individual shuttled spore fate and/or longitudinal viability throughout the animal (not just in the limited high-magnification imaged volume required to observe its occurrence) and for selectively impairing shuttling but not phagocytosis, neither of which is currently possible in vivo, where shuttling is observed in its most physiological context.</p>
<p>Now that this additional phagocyte behavior during fungal infection establishment has been recognized, its implications must be factored into future understanding of the initial host–pathogen interaction specifically and into the view of neutrophil and macrophage behaviors generally.</p>

<title>Shuttle detection and definition</title>
<p>All in vivo shuttles were detected by systematic manual frame-by-frame inspection of movies. For these studies, a “shuttle” was stringently defined as a spore transfer event meeting all of the following criteria: (1) both donor and recipient cells were imaged in toto before, during, and after the shuttle; (2) both donor and recipient cells demonstrated their viability before and after shuttling by migration; (3) the moment of donor-to-recipient cell transfer was visualized; and (4) z-stack viewing unequivocally confirmed that conidia were within donor and recipient cells prior to and after the shuttle. Experience taught that shuttles were most easily recognized by watching movies in reverse and tracing the source of individual macrophage-located conidia. The identity of all 46 unequivocal in vivo shuttles meeting these criteria contributing to this report is assigned in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000113.s013">S1 Table</xref> and is indicated throughout the report.

<title>ShuttleFinder software</title>
<p>The confocal time series were imported into MATLAB (version 8.1.0.604, R2013a) utilizing the bioformats toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref051">51</xref>], and the conidia were tracked with PhagoSight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref026">26</xref>]. The data input consisted of confocal time series with three channels, each containing the fluorescence of one cell type. PhagoSight was designed to track phagocytes in confocal time series. Since conidia are smaller than phagocytes, the reduction step of PhagoSight was only applied to large files that would have taken more than 3 days to process without it. To reduce the likelihood of false negatives, the automatic determined threshold for background separation by PhagoSight was lowered by 10%. For each file, only the longest tracks were analyzed (upper third of track length over time). PhagoSight was used in command line mode without user interaction to allow for automated processing, using the MASSIVE cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000113.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>PhagoSight calculates a bounding box, which described the volume surrounding each tracked spore for each time frame. The intensity of the voxels in the two channels describing neutrophils and macrophages was summed over this bounding box, and a proportional index r between both was calculated:

with <italic>I</italic> describing the intensity of one channel. This ratio was smoothed with a moving average filter over three imaging frames to remove noise caused by imperfections in the tracking process. Subsequently, a point in a track was defined as being in a macrophage (red channel) if the values lay between 1 and 0.2, conversely in a neutrophil (green channel) for a value between −0.2 and −1. To be classified as a candidate shuttle event, the r-values for a conidium track had to pass from either −0.2 to 0.2 (for a neutrophil-to-macrophage shuttle) or vice versa.</p>
<p>The time the tracked conidium reached the threshold was considered the beginning of the shuttle. The end of the shuttle event was defined by the track leaving the threshold area.</p>
