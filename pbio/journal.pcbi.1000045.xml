A quantitative understanding of the processes involved, which currently remains lacking, will be useful in determining the etiology and treatment of obesity and other conditions resulting from prolonged energy imbalance. Here, we show that a mathematical model of the macronutrient flux balances can capture the long-term dynamics of human weight change; all previous models are special cases of this model. We show that the generic dynamic behavior of body composition for a clamped diet can be divided into two classes. In the first class, the body composition and mass are determined uniquely. In the second class, the body composition can exist at an infinite number of possible states. Surprisingly, perturbations of dietary energy intake or energy expenditure can give identical responses in both model classes, and existing data are insufficient to distinguish between these two possibilities. Nevertheless, this distinction has important implications for the efficacy of clinical interventions that alter body composition and mass.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Understanding the dynamics of human body weight change has important consequences for conditions such as obesity, starvation, and wasting syndromes. Changes of body weight are known to result from imbalances between the energy derived from food and the energy expended to maintain life and perform physical work. However, quantifying this relationship has proved difficult, in part because the body is composed of multiple components and weight change results from alterations of body composition (i.e., fat versus lean mass). Here, we show that mathematical modeling can provide a general description of how body weight will change over time by tracking the flux balances of the macronutrients fat, protein, and carbohydrates. For a fixed food intake rate and physical activity level, the body weight and composition will approach steady state. However, the steady state can correspond to a unique body weight or a continuum of body weights that are all consistent with the same food intake and energy expenditure rates. Interestingly, existing experimental data on human body weight dynamics cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. We propose experiments that could resolve this issue and use computer simulations to demonstrate how such experiments could be performed.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the intramural research program of the NIH/NIDDK.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity, anorexia nervosa, cachexia, and starvation are conditions that have a profound medical, social and economic impact on our lives. For example, the incidence of obesity and its co-morbidities has increased at a rapid rate over the past two decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Hill1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Hill2">[2]</xref>. These conditions are characterized by changes in body weight (mass) that arise from an imbalance between the energy derived from food and the energy expended to maintain life and perform work. However, the underlying mechanisms of how changes in energy balance lead to changes in body mass and body composition are not well understood. In particular, it is of interest to understand how body composition is apportioned between fat and lean components when the body mass changes and if this energy partitioning can be altered. Such an understanding would be useful for optimizing weight loss treatments in obese subjects to maximize fat loss or weight gain treatments for anorexia nervosa and cachexia patients to maximize lean tissue gain.</p><p>To address these issues and improve our understanding of human body weight regulation, mathematical and computational modeling has been attempted many times over the past several decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Hall1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Song1">[19]</xref>. Here we show how models of body composition and mass change can be understood and analyzed within the realm of dynamical systems theory and can be classified according to their geometric structure in the two dimensional phase plane. We begin by considering a general class of macronutrient flux balance equations and progressively introduce assumptions that constrain the model dynamics. We show that two compartment models of fat and lean masses can be categorized into two generic classes. In the first class, there is a unique body composition and mass (i.e. a stable fixed point) that is specified by the diet and energy expenditure. In the second class, there is a continuous curve of fixed points (i.e. an invariant manifold) with an infinite number of possible body compositions and masses at steady state for the same diet and energy expenditure rate. We show that almost all of the models in the literature are in the second class. Surprisingly, the existing data are insufficient to determine which of the two classes pertains to humans. For models with an invariant manifold, we show that an equivalent one dimensional equation for body composition change can be derived. We give numerical examples and discuss possible experimental approaches that may distinguish between the classes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>General Model of Macronutrient and Energy Flux Balance</title><p>The human body obeys the law of energy conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Atwater1">[20]</xref>, which can be expressed as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000045.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where Δ<italic>U</italic> is the change in stored energy in the body, Δ<italic>Q</italic> is a change in energy input or intake, and Δ<italic>W</italic> is a change in energy output or expenditure. The intake is provided by the energy content of the food consumed. Combustion of dietary macronutrients yields chemical energy and Hess's law states that the energy released is the same regardless of whether the process takes place inside a bomb calorimeter or via the complex process of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Thus, the energy released from oxidation of food in the body can be precisely measured in the laboratory. However, there is an important caveat. Not all macronutrients in food are completely absorbed by the body. Furthermore, the dietary protein that is absorbed does not undergo complete combustion in the body, but rather produces urea and ammonia. In accounting for these effects, we refer to the metabolizable energy content of dietary carbohydrate, fat, and protein, which is slightly less than the values obtained by bomb calorimetry. The energy expenditure rate includes the work to maintain basic metabolic function (resting metabolic rate), to digest, absorb and transport the nutrients in food (thermic effect of feeding), to synthesize or break down tissue, and to perform physical activity, together with the heat generated. The energy is stored in the form of fat as well as in lean body tissue such as glycogen and protein. The body need not be in equilibrium for Equation 1 to hold. While we are primarily concerned with adult weight change, Equation 1 is also valid for childhood growth.</p><p>In order to express a change of stored energy Δ<italic>U</italic> in terms of body mass <italic>M</italic> we must determine the energy content per unit body mass change, i.e. the energy density ρ<italic><sub>M</sub></italic>. We can then set Δ<italic>U</italic> = Δ(ρ<italic><sub>M</sub>M</italic>). To model the dynamics of body mass change, we divide Equation 1 by some interval of time and take the limit of infinitesimal change to obtain a one dimensional energy flux balance equation:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000045.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>I</italic> = <italic>dQ</italic>/<italic>dt</italic> is the rate of metabolizable energy intake and <italic>E</italic> = <italic>dW</italic>/<italic>dt</italic> is the rate of energy expenditure. It is important to note that ρ<italic><sub>M</sub></italic> is the energy density of body mass change, which need not be a constant but could be a function of body composition and time. Thus, in order to use Equation 2, the dynamics of ρ<italic><sub>M</sub></italic> must also be established.</p><p>When the body changes mass, that change will be composed of water, protein, carbohydrates (in the form of glycogen), fat, bone, and trace amounts of micronutrients, all having their own energy densities. Hence, a means of determining the dynamics of ρ<italic><sub>M</sub></italic> is to track the dynamics of the components. The extracellular water and bone mineral mass have no metabolizable energy content and change little when body mass changes in adults under normal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Keys1">[21]</xref>. The change in intracellular water can be specified by changes in the tissue protein and glycogen. Thus the main components contributing to the dynamics of ρ<italic><sub>M</sub></italic> are the macronutrients - protein, carbohydrates, and fat, where we distinguish body fat (e.g. free fatty acids and triglycerides) from adipose tissue, which includes water and protein in addition to triglycerides.

Hence, to simplify the equations, we can use the method of averaging to remove the fast motion and derive a system of equations for the slow time dynamics. We do this explicitly in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section and show that the form of the averaged equations to lowest order are identical to Equations 3–5 except that the three components are to be interpreted as the slowly varying part and the intake and energy expenditure rates are moving time averages over a time scale of a day.</p><p>The three-compartment flux balance model was used by Hall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Hall1">[3]</xref> to numerically simulate data from the classic Minnesota human starvation experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Keys1">[21]</xref>. In Hall's model, the forms of the energy expenditure and fractions were chosen for physiological considerations. For clamped food intake, the body composition approached a unique steady state. The model also showed that apart from transient changes lasting only a few days, carbohydrate balance is precisely maintained as a result of the limited storage capacity for glycogen. We will exploit this property to reduce the three dimensional system to an approximately equivalent two dimensional system where dynamical systems techniques can be employed to analyze the dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Reduced Models</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Two compartment macronutrient partition model</title><p>The three compartment macronutrient flux balance model Equations 3–5 can be reduced to a two dimensional system for fat mass <italic>F</italic> and lean mass <italic>L = M</italic>−<italic>F</italic>, where <italic>M</italic> is the total body mass.

To simplify the analysis, we consider the intake rates to be clamped to constant values or set to predetermined functions of time. We do not consider the control and variation of food intake rate that may arise due to feedback from the body composition or from exogenous influences. We focus only on what happens to the food once it is ingested, which is a problem independent of the control of intake. We also assume that the averaged energy expenditure rate does not depend on time explicitly. Hence, we do not account for the effects of development, aging or gradual changes in lifestyle, which could lead to an explicit slow time dependence of energy expenditure rate.

If one of the fixed point conditions automatically satisfies the other, then instead of a fixed point there will be a continuous curve of fixed points or an invariant manifold.

The energy partition model has this property and thus has an invariant manifold rather than an isolated fixed point. This can be seen by observing that for <italic>f</italic> given by Equation 15, Equation 26 automatically satisfies condition 27. An attracting invariant manifold implies that the body can exist at any of the infinite number of body compositions specified by the curve <italic>I = E</italic>(<italic>F</italic>,<italic>L</italic>) for clamped intake and energy expenditure rates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000045-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

In the case of a stable fixed point, any temporary perturbation of body weight or composition will be corrected over time (i.e., for all things equal, the body will return to its original state). An invariant manifold allows the possibility that a transient perturbation could lead to a permanent change of body composition and mass.</p><p>At first glance, these differing properties would appear to point to a simple way of distinguishing between the two classes. However, the traditional means of inducing weight change namely diet or altering energy expenditure through aerobic exercise, turn out to be incapable of revealing the distinction. For an invariant manifold, any change of intake or expenditure rate will only elicit movement along one of the prescribed <italic>F</italic> vs. <italic>L</italic> trajectories obeying Equation 12, an example being Forbes's law (14). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000045-g002">Figure 2</xref>, a change of intake or energy expenditure rate will change the position of the invariant manifold. The body composition that is initially at one point on the invariant manifold will then flow to a new point on the perturbed invariant manifold along the trajectory prescribed by (12). If the intake rate or energy expenditure is then restored to the original value then the body composition will return along the same trajectory to the original steady state just as it would in a fixed point model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000045-g002">Figure 2 solid curves</xref>).

If the body composition returned to its original state after such a perturbation then there is a unique fixed point. If it does not then there could be an invariant manifold although multiple fixed points are also possible.</p><p>We found an example of one clinical study that bears on the question of whether humans have a fixed point or an invariant manifold. Biller et al. investigated changes of body composition pre- and post-growth hormone therapy in forty male subjects with growth hormone deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Biller1">[45]</xref>. Despite significant changes of body composition induced by 18 months of growth hormone administration, the subjects returned very closely to their original body composition 18 months following the removal of therapy. However, there was a slight (2%) but significant increase in their lean body mass compared with the original value. Perhaps not enough time had elapsed for the lean mass to return to the original level. Alternatively, the increased lean mass may possibly have been the result of increased bone mineral mass and extracellular fluid expansion, both of which are known effects of growth hormone, but were assumed to be constant in the body composition models. Therefore, this clinical study provides some evidence in support of a fixed point, but it has not been repeated and the result was not conclusive.

We do not consider any feedback of body composition on food intake, which is an extremely important topic but beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Previous efforts to model body weight change have predominantly used energy partition models that implicitly contain an invariant manifold and thus body composition and mass are not fully specified by the diet. If the body does have an invariant manifold then this fact puts a very strong constraint on the fat utilization fraction <italic>f</italic>. Hall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000045-Hall1">[3]</xref> considered the effects of carbohydrate intake on lipolysis and other physiological factors to conjecture a form of <italic>f</italic> that does not lead to an invariant manifold. However, our analysis and numerical examples show that the body composition could have an invariant manifold but behave indistinguishably from having a fixed point. Also, the decay to the fixed point could take a very long time, possibly as long as a decade giving the appearance of an invariant manifold. Only experiments that perturb the fat or lean compartments independently can tell.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Method of Averaging</title><p>The three compartment macronutrient flux balance Equations 3–5 are a system of nonautonomous differential equations since the energy intake and expenditure are explicitly time dependent. Food is ingested over discrete time intervals and physical activity will vary greatly within a day. However, this fast time dependence can be viewed as oscillations or fluctuations on top of a slowly varying background. It is this slower time dependence that governs long-term body mass and composition changes that we are interested in. For example, if an individual had the exact same schedule with the same energy intake and expenditure each day, then averaged over a day, the body composition would be constant. If the daily averaged intake and expenditure were to gradually change on longer time scales of say weeks or months then there would be a corresponding change in the body composition and mass. Given that we are only interested in these slower changes, we remove the short time scale fluctuations by using the method of averaging to produce an autonomous system of <italic>averaged</italic> equations valid on longer time scales.</p><p>We do so by introducing a second “fast” time variable τ = <italic>t</italic>/ε, where ε is a small parameter that is associated with the slow changes in body composition and let all time dependent quantities be a function of both <italic>t</italic> and τ.

The zero eigenvalue reflects the marginal stability along the invariant manifold, which is an attractor if Tr <italic>J</italic>&lt;0. An attracting invariant manifold implies a stable fixed point in the corresponding one dimensional model. Unstable fixed points are either unstable nodes, saddle points or unstable spirals. In the case of unstable spirals, a possibility is a limit cycle surrounding the spiral arising from a Hopf bifurcation, where Tr <italic>J</italic> = 0 and det <italic>J</italic>&gt;0.

In other words, if <italic>f</italic> increases monotonically with <italic>F</italic> and decreases monotonically with <italic>L</italic> then there will be a unique stable fixed point. For an invariant manifold, <italic>f</italic> is given by Equation 15, which immediately satisfies det<italic>J</italic> = 0; Tr<italic>J</italic>&lt;0 is guaranteed if <italic>E</italic> is monotonically increasing in <italic>F</italic> and <italic>L</italic>.
