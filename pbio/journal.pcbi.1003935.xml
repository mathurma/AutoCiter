<abstract>
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>PARKIN</italic> are the most common causes of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease. Both gene products, the Ser/Thr kinase PINK1 and the E3 Ubiquitin ligase Parkin, functionally cooperate in a mitochondrial quality control pathway. Upon stress, PINK1 activates Parkin and enables its translocation to and ubiquitination of damaged mitochondria to facilitate their clearance from the cell. Though PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser65 is an important initial step, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of Parkin's enzymatic functions remain unclear. Using molecular modeling, we generated a complete structural model of human Parkin at all atom resolution. At steady state, the Ub ligase is maintained inactive in a closed, auto-inhibited conformation that results from intra-molecular interactions. Evidently, Parkin has to undergo major structural rearrangements in order to unleash its catalytic activity. As a spark, we have modeled PINK1-dependent Ser65 phosphorylation <italic>in silico</italic> and provide the first molecular dynamics simulation of Parkin conformations along a sequential unfolding pathway that could release its intertwined domains and enable its catalytic activity. We combined free (unbiased) molecular dynamics simulation, Monte Carlo algorithms, and minimal-biasing methods with cell-based high content imaging and biochemical assays. Phosphorylation of Ser65 results in widening of a newly defined cleft and dissociation of the regulatory N-terminal UBL domain. This motion propagates through further opening conformations that allow binding of an Ub-loaded E2 co-enzyme. Subsequent spatial reorientation of the catalytic centers of both enzymes might facilitate the transfer of the Ub moiety to charge Parkin. Our structure-function study provides the basis to elucidate regulatory mechanisms and activity of the neuroprotective Parkin. This may open up new avenues for the development of small molecule Parkin activators through targeted drug design.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurological condition caused by the selective and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>PARKIN</italic> genes are the most common causes of recessively inherited PD. Together the encoded proteins coordinate a protective cellular quality control pathway that allows elimination of impaired mitochondria in order to prevent further cellular damage and ultimately death. Although it is known that the kinase PINK1 operates upstream and activates the E3 Ubiquitin ligase Parkin, the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we combined state-of-the art computational and functional biological methods to demonstrate that Parkin is sequentially activated through PINK1-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent structural rearrangement. The induced motions result in release of Parkin's closed, auto-inhibited conformation to liberate its enzymatic functions. We provide for the first time a complete protein structure of Parkin at an all atom resolution and a comprehensive molecular dynamics simulation of its activation and opening conformations. The generated models will allow uncovering the exact mechanisms of regulation and enzymatic activity of Parkin and potentially the development of novel therapeutics through a structure-function-based drug design.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mutations in the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (<italic>PINK1</italic>) and <italic>PARKIN</italic> genes are the most common causes of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Corti1">[1]</xref>. Although the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of PD remain elusive, it has become clear that PINK1 and Parkin protein functionally cooperate in a novel mitochondrial quality control pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Springer1">[2]</xref>. Upon depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, the Ser/Thr kinase PINK1 is stabilized on damaged organelles and plays a pivotal role for the activation and recruitment of the E3 Ubiquitin (Ub) ligase Parkin from the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Geisler1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-VivesBauza1">[6]</xref>. Parkin then labels numerous mitochondrial proteins with the small modifier protein Ub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Chan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Sarraf1">[8]</xref>. Upon ubiquitination of mitochondria, adaptor proteins such as p97 and p62 are recruited to facilitate clustering of mitochondria around perinuclear regions and the selective degradation of substrates via the proteasome system and of whole organelles via autophagy (mitophagy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Geisler1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Chan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Okatsu1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Tanaka1">[10]</xref>. Mutations in both genes, <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>PARKIN</italic>, abrogate this presumably neuroprotective pathway through distinct molecular mechanisms and at different steps along the sequential process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Geisler1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-VivesBauza1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>PINK1 has been demonstrated to phosphorylate Parkin at residue Ser65 in its N-terminal Ub-like (UBL) domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Iguchi1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima1">[13]</xref>. Moreover, it has been suggested that the activation of Parkin's enzymatic functions and its mitochondrial translocation are coupled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Iguchi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Lazarou1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zheng1">[15]</xref>. Very recently, PINK1 has also been shown to phosphorylate the modifier Ub itself at the same conserved Ser65 residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kane1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zhang1">[19]</xref>. Both phosphorylation events appear to be required for full activation of Parkin's enzymatic functions. Parkin had long been classified as a typical Really-Interesting-New-Gene (RING)-type E3 Ub ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Shimura1">[20]</xref> that bridges the interaction between an E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme and a substrate. However, its Ub transfer mechanism has been challenged lately <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Wenzel1">[21]</xref>. In fact, Parkin is a member of the RING-in-between-RING (IBR)-RING (RBR) family of E3 Ub ligases that mediate the transfer of Ub by a novel hybrid mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Wenzel2">[22]</xref>. While Parkin binds the E2 co-enzyme with its RING1 domain (similar to RING ligases), it receives the Ub moiety from the E2 co-enzyme onto its active site (Cys431) in an unstable thioester intermediate (similar to Homologous-to-the-E6-AP-Carboxyl-Terminus (HECT)-type E3 ligases). Ub is then further transferred from Parkin onto a lysine residue of a substrate protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Berndsen1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Consistent with its notoriously weak enzymatic activity, several partial crystal structures of Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Riley1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Wauer1">[27]</xref> show a closed, auto-inhibited conformation. Several intra-molecular interactions between individual domains literally fold back Parkin onto itself. An at least 3-fold inhibition prevents charging of Parkin with Ub that is required for its activation and enzymatic functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Byrd1">[28]</xref>. It is evident that in order to gain enzymatic activity, Parkin must undergo major structural rearrangements. Ubiquitination enzymes indeed can perform particularly large conformational changes during their catalytic cycles including the remodeling of domain interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Lorenz1">[29]</xref>. Moreover, phosphorylation-dependent exposure of the RING domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kales1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Dou1">[31]</xref> or relief of the auto-inhibited structures has been shown for RING and HECT E3 ligases respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Gallagher1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we set out to provide structural models for human Parkin that would allow release of its auto-inhibited conformation and consequently activation of its E3 Ub ligase functions. We have applied highly accurate molecular modeling methods to provide for the first time an all-atom resolution of human full-length Parkin. Given the suggested auto-regulatory role of the UBL domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Chaugule1">[33]</xref> and the importance of PINK1 kinase activity for Parkin activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Iguchi1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima1">[13]</xref>, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) to study conformational changes that might be induced by phosphorylation of Ser65. Strikingly, our simulations and calculations of pSer65 <italic>in silico</italic> predict a structural rearrangement of the UBL domain that initiates a sequential release of Parkin's intra-molecular interactions. Along these opening conformations, we have docked the E2-Ub complex, required for Parkin's activation and enzymatic functions. Importantly, the presented computational predictions are consistent with our cell biological studies. We provide the basis for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of auto-inhibition and liberation of Parkin's catalytic activity.</p>

<title>Modeling of human Parkin structures</title>
<p>In order to understand the activation mechanisms of the neuroprotective E3 Ub ligase Parkin (for a schematic view of Parkin and its activation see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), i.e. its opening conformations and the release of enzymatic function(s), we performed molecular modeling and dynamics simulations. Our models were generated using the recently resolved X-ray structures of human N-terminal truncated Parkin (PDB IDs: 4BM9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Wauer1">[27]</xref> and 4I1H <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Riley1">[24]</xref>) and of its rat homolog (PDB IDs: 4K7D and 4K95 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Trempe1">[26]</xref>). The molecular modeling methods have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zhang2">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Caulfield2">[36]</xref> and the procedure is outlined in the method section in detail. The generated model for the first time allows a view of the full-length human Parkin protein at an all atom resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s011">Movie S1</xref>). Most importantly, it provides the structure of the regulatory N-terminus but also closes smaller gaps across Parkin's entire length. The UBL domain (residues 1–76) and in particular a flexible linker (residues 77–140) had not been structurally resolved so far for human Parkin. The linker is comprised of two sub-domains: (1) a semi-globular domain from residues 77 to 125 that appears highly dynamic and (2) a tethering loop region from residues 126 to 140 that connects to the RING0 domain. A further examination of the linker's secondary structural features gives the following: α-helical regions from residues Gly77 to Gly85, Arg89 to Ser108, a helix loop turn from Leu112 to Ser116, and minor beta-roll (anti parallel) from Val117 to Leu123 with the beta-strands from the UBL domain residues Phe4-Asn8 and Leu41-Phe45. From residue Leu123 onward, the linker is random coil through Arg140.</p>

<p>The newly modeled N-terminus consequently alters the position of the IBR relative to the UBL domain and RING1. The superposition overlay deviates slightly from the X-ray structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), however, root mean square (RMS) measurements between the backbone of the improved model and various collected structure remains under 5 Å for residues Ser145 to Val465. The RING domains contained within are rather rigid due to zinc-finger stabilization, but the UBL domain and the adjacent linker are both flexible and capable of large movement with free MDS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s012">Movie S2</xref>). Our complete model of human Parkin plus observations for its dynamic motion indicates that the N-terminal UBL-linker region acts like a spring/clamp that tightly holds Parkin in its closed, auto-inhibited conformation. Noteworthy, a prime role for the N-terminus in negatively regulating Parkin's enzymatic activity had already been established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Chaugule1">[33]</xref>. Consistently, PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of the UBL-located Ser65 appears to play a regulatory role for activation and recruitment of Parkin to depolarized mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Iguchi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Lazarou1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zheng1">[15]</xref>.</p>

<title>Phosphorylation of Parkin at Ser65 induces local structural changes</title>
<p>Given this functional link and the particular N-terminal flexibility, we modeled PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of Parkin's UBL domain at Ser65 <italic>in silico</italic> to investigate potential opening conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In our Parkin model, Ser65 is buried within a pocket that is formed between the flexible linker region and the UBL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g002">Figure 2A/B</xref>). We found that phosphorylation of Ser65 (pSer65) resulted in conformational changes compared to unmodified Parkin in the static model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s001">Figure S1</xref>) as well as in more flexibility during free MDS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s013">Movie S3</xref>). A comparison between the pSer65 Parkin model with existing X-ray structures is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s002">Figure S2</xref>. Locally, pSer65 induced a widening of the surrounding cleft and an increase of water molecules occupying the pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We used two center-of-mass metrics to determine the cleft widening. Calculations were carried out first on the edges of the cleft on each side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g002">Figure 2A/C</xref>, for orientation see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Ser65 showed a rather narrow gap of about only 7–9 Å, however pSer65 induced a widening of the cleft&gt;12 Å. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g002">Figure 2D</xref> shows the wide range in flexibility between the linker and the UBL domain as the MDS proceeds. Simulations of greater than 100 ns for Parkin Ser65 and pSer65 gave approximately 8 Å or 14 Å, respectively.</p>

<p>To follow up on these significant changes, we studied mutations of Ser65. In functional studies, Serine is often substituted with Alanine for a phospho-dead version (S65A), while mutations to the negatively charged Aspartic (S65D) or Glutamic (S65E) acid are used as phospho-mimic variants. For critical analysis of the intermolecular interactions induced by these mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s003">Figure S3</xref>), we computed changes in binding energy (ΔΔG), using the Zone Equilibration of Mutants (ZEMu) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Dourado1">[37]</xref> method, implemented in the MacroMoleculeBuilder (MMB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-RubenAbagyan1">[38]</xref>. However, we could not detect any significant change among the Ser65 substitutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>We next modeled the Ser65 mutations to measure gap distances during free MDS using two correlative center-of-mass sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g002">Figure 2D/E</xref>). Both S65D and S65E showed an initial gap distance of about 10 Å. The cleft further widened quickly over the course of 20 ns and longer using MDS, reaching distances of around 12–13 Å similar to pSer65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The phospho-dead S65A variant displayed an initial narrower gap, rather comparable to unmodified Ser65, but showed a pronounced gap opening during simulation of 20 ns and longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) reaching widths closer to pSer65 and both phospho-mimic mutants. Moreover, we found that hydration of the pocket interfacing UBL domain and linker provokes the opening of Parkin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s014">Movie S4</xref>). Based on these findings, we measured the Solvent-Accessible-Surface-Area (SASA-Å<sup>2</sup>) within the pocket and counted the number of water molecules at common time intervals (from the simulation). The average number of water molecules within the pocket ranges from 9 to 12 for the initial time point (t = 0), 6 to 12 for t = 5 ns, and 12 to 19 for t = 100 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Ser65 allowed the pocket to be filled with a constant number of approximately 12 water molecules during the entire simulation, while pSer65 induced a rapid increase from 12 to 19 water molecules that were maintained over time. In the case of S65A, the pocket initially collapsed from 10 to 6 and then slowly re-hydrated to over 16 water molecules. Both phospho-mimic mutants induced solvation of the pocket surrounding residue 65, more similar to pSer65 Altogether, we provide structural evidence that phosphorylation or mutations of Ser65 perturbs the stability between the UBL domain and the linker region, such that the structure becomes looser more quickly allowing the enclosing cleft to widen.</p>

<title>Functional cell-based analysis of Ser65 and substitutions</title>
<p>To corroborate our structural predictions how mutations affect opening of the cleft that encloses residue 65, we expressed GFP-Parkin wild type, S65A, S65D, and S65E variants in human HeLa cells. As a functional readout, we used an unbiased high content imaging assay that monitors mitochondrial translocation of Parkin in cells over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Fiesel1">[39]</xref>. The paradigm relies on chemical uncoupling of mitochondria by treatment with carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), which induces PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of Parkin at Ser65 in the UBL domain, Ub charging of Cys431 and Parkin's recruitment to mitochondria. Translocation of Parkin is quantified as the ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear GFP (Parkin) signal for each of the fusion proteins (for an example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Un-transfected and low level expressing cells were excluded from the analysis, ensuring comparable GFP intensities across all Parkin variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Under basal conditions, Parkin wild type and residue 65 mutants were evenly distributed throughout the cell (GFP ratio ∼1). Upon mitochondrial depolarization (2 h CCCP), the average GFP ratio for Parkin wild type strongly increased, indicating its co-localization with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

Retaining only the lowest energy conformers generated from a large ensemble of states, we applied Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient for structural minimization to obtain the optimal internal coordinates to each structures to arrive at final conformer snapshots. We then dubbed evenly spaced conformers as guideposts spanning the conformational extremes for the UBL domain starting adjacent to the IBR and ending in close proximity to the active site. Using MdMD minimal biasing method, we tested whether or not the Parkin structures could move between the conformers generated with global variable (accessor) based on root mean square deviation (RMSD) to the backbone C-alpha atoms.

<title>Release of Parkin's inhibitory intra-molecular interactions</title>
<p>During the trajectory of the UBL domain across and alongside Parkin, several structural changes were noted that are potentially relevant for E2 co-enzyme binding and Ub charging of Parkin. Following phosphorylation of Ser65 as a trigger, we found that residues within the linker region undergo repeated contacts with the RING1 and RING2 domains during movement of the UBL domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s015">Movie S5</xref>). Our data indicates that several safety belts must be released in order to unleash its E3 ligase activity.</p>
<p>First, the UBL-linker region must dissociate from RING1 and IBR domains in order to loosen the entire structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Based on our simulations, we measured the release of the inhibitory N-terminus that acts like a spring/clamp. The distance between the UBL and RING1 domains indeed increased from about 20 Å to more than 50 Å over time MDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, the distance between the UBL domain and the IBR region significantly increased from an initial 30 Å to almost 90 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>Second, the repressor element of Parkin (REP), a region between IBR and RING2, blocks access of an Ub-loaded E2 co-enzyme (E2∼Ub; the tilde symbol is used to indicate a thioester bond) in RING1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This inhibitory interaction is loosened during Parkin's transitions from stage 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) to stages 2/3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g004">Figure 4B/C</xref>). To measure this release, we calculated RMSD scores. The REP residues considered were all within 5 Å of the supposed RING1 binding region (defined as Cys238, Thr240, Cys241, and Cys263). MdMD showed a steady increase of the RMSD score from 0 Å to&gt;5 Å over the course of 50 ns sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). We then measured the distance of the REP element to the E2 binding site in RING1. The bond distance from Tyr391 (REP region) to Cys238 (E2 binding site in RING1) changed over time from under 10 Å to ∼20 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). This might allow access of an incoming E2∼Ub complex to the binding site. Interestingly, during continued UBL-linker movement towards the active site (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g004">Figure 4</xref>), Tyr391 is eventually able to reposition back into the E2 binding site, possibly indicating a reset mechanism for the next binding event of a (re-)charged E2 enzyme.</p>
<p>Third, the RING0 domain buries Parkin's active site Cys431, making it unavailable to receive Ub from an incoming E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). During the UBL-linker movement, RMSD measurements indicate that the RING0 to Cys431 slightly increased (∼3 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g005">Figure 5H</xref>), while the distance itself initially increased during the first 10 ns from 15.8 Å to ∼19 Å and then decreased to under 17 Å (data not shown). SASA calculations indicated that Cys431 initially lost virtually all water interaction surface (first 5 ns), but abruptly began to hydrate thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). This coincides with the binding of the E2 co-enzyme on the other side of Parkin at RING1 that had been blocked by the REP region before. For the remainder of the measurements, Cys431 stayed at an average SASA of 12.5 Å<sup>2</sup> with transient peaks of 20 Å<sup>2</sup>. This increase in solvent exposure over time is indicative of a conformational reorientation, which could allow the active site Cys431 to receive a thioester-bonded Ub moiety from the E2 enzyme.</p>
<p>Taken together, our MDS and subsequent calculations revealed a sequential release of Parkin's safety belts preventing its activation. The dissociation of the inhibitory N-terminus is triggered by PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser65 in the UBL domain. As a consequence, Parkin's entire structure is loosened and further perpetuates the liberation of Parkin's presumed E2 binding region and of its active center as pre-requisite for enzymatic activity.</p>

<p>The top performing structures were further studied with unbiased (free) MDS. Following docking of the UbcH5a-Ub complex with Parkin, we completed simulations where the Ub-loaded E2 makes substantial movements toward the active site region of Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g006">Figure 6B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s017">Movie S7</xref>). The distance from residue Cys431 to the C-terminal Ub residue Gly76 ranges from an initial 60 Å (in the closed conformation) to approximately 30 Å after 200 ns of accelerated MDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Hamelberg1">[52]</xref> using default parameters within the NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics engine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Wang1">[53]</xref>. The optimal binding pair kept that distance within 40 Å. It is interesting to note, that the E2-Ub complex rolls around Parkin, thereby moving the Gly76 of the bound Ub moiety into a better position for Parkin's catalytic center. While the UbcH5a-Ub complex moves across Parkin, it maintains a final average distance of approximately 32 Å from the thiol of Parkin's Cys431 to Gly76 of Ub. However, without release of the Ub moiety from the E2 (due to the amide linkage in this structure) the co-enzyme stalled in the vicinity of Parkin's active site, while at the same time the UBL domain moved away from the midpoint configuration (state 3, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) into a new conformation unobserved in MdMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s017">Movie S7</xref>). As a control, we started a simulation with the sub-optimal binding for Ub-loaded E2 and Parkin (higher energy). In this case, we found that the docked UbcH5a-Ub complex tended to stall and gradually drifted from the active site toward the IBR domain, increasing the distance between Ub-Gly76 and Parkin-Cys431 (&gt;65 Å) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s018">Movie S8</xref>). In summary, our MDS provide the basis to study major domain rearrangements within Parkin as well as to investigate binding of E2 co-enzymes and Ub charging of Parkin as part of its activation process.</p>

<title>Ub charging of Parkin and utilization of E2 co-enzymes</title>
<p>The labile nature of the E2∼Ub thioester makes the structural and functional studies of these complexes very challenging. For Parkin, a thioester-bound Ub could not be identified so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Wenzel1">[21]</xref>. A substitution of the active site cysteine in E1, E2, or E3 ubiquitinations enzymes with a serine residue, results in the formation of a relatively stable oxyester bond to Gly76 of Ub. To confirm the suitability of a C431S substitution as a tool to monitor the E2-dependent Ub charging of Parkin, we used MMB and ZEMu. In contrast to many Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordinating cysteines, the catalytic residue Cys431 is not making any intra-molecular interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003935.s010">Figure S10</xref>). For the C431S substitution we obtained similar ΔΔGs from three Parkin crystals that indicate no major change, corroborating the usefulness of this particular inactive variant.</p>
<p>To investigate effects of Ser65 mutations on Parkin C431S-Ub oxyester formation as a surrogate for its activation, we expressed these Parkin variants carrying an additional C431S mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). As expected, CCCP treatment of cells expressing the single C431S (S65) mutation induced the formation of an 8 kD shifted Parkin band. The specificity of this band was determined by NaOH treatment that chemically cleaves the C431S-Ub oxyester bond. This is consistent with Parkin's auto-inhibited, inactive structure before and its activation upon mitochondrial depolarization. Of note, for both phospho-mimic mutations (in particular S65E and to a lesser extent S65D), an 8 kD shifted band was detected even at basal conditions (i.e. without CCCP treatment). Consistently, S65E (and S65D) showed enhanced levels of Ub-charging at early time points (1 h CCCP) while oxyester formation of S65 Parkin became apparent only after 2 h and strongly increased by 4 h of CCCP treatment. In contrast, the phospho-dead S65A mutant showed no discernable Ub-oxyester at 0 h CCCP and compared to Ser65 strongly reduced levels after longer incubation times with CCCP (16 h). These results are consistent with a slight activation of the phospho-mimic Parkin mutants at steady state and a strongly diminished Ub-charging of the phospho-dead variant S65A.</p>

<p><bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Parkin C431S. Cells were treated with CCCP for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 16 h and harvested. Western blots were prepared to monitor the formation of a Parkin C431S-Ub oxyester, which, in contrast to unmodifed Parkin (closed arrowhead) appears as a band shift (open arrowhead) and is sensitive to NaOH treatment. The phospho-mimic mutations S65D or S65E showed some levels of Parkin C431S-Ub even in the absence of CCCP, consistent with a slight activation under steady-state conditions. <bold>B</bold>) HEK293E cells were transfected with FLAG-Parkin wild type and left either untreated or were treated with 10 µM CCCP. FLAG immunoprecipitations were performed and ubiquitinations reactions were carried out on the beads. All ubiquitination reactions contained E1, ATP, and N-terminally biotinylated Ub. Either no E2 enzyme, or UBE2D2, UBE2L3 or UBE2N plus its co-factor Uev1a were added. In order to analyze the effect of Parkin phosphorylation, some FLAG immunoprecipitates were pretreated with phosphatase before Ub reaction was carried out. UBE2D2, UBE2L3 and UBE2N can serve as co-factors for Parkin <italic>in vitro</italic>. CCCP treatment is not required, but enhances the ubiquitination reactions. Phosphatase treatment reduces the ubiquitinations to the extent observed without CCCP treatment. UBE2N shows no detectable activity towards Parkin auto-ubiquitination. A closed arrowhead indicates the position of unmodified FLAG-Parkin, an open arrowhead labels Ub modified species. An arrow labels the molecular weight of Parkin on the Streptavidin-HRP blot.</p>

<p>To provide further evidence that Ser65 phosphorylation plays a role for Parkin's enzymatic function, we performed immunoprecipitation coupled to an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay. We transfected HEK293E cells with FLAG-Parkin and affinity purified Parkin by anti-FLAG from cells that have been treated with CCCP for 1 h or left untreated. Given the importance of PINK1 kinase activity and phosphorylation of Parkin's Ser65 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Iguchi1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima1">[13]</xref>, we treated some samples with phosphatase to observe its E3 ligase activity with or without this activating posttranslational modification. Immunoprecipitated Parkin was incubated with a complete mix of ATP, recombinant Ub and E1 enzyme as well as different E2 enzymes. While incubation with UbcH5b/UBE2D2 or UbcH7/UBE2L3 resulted in the formation of likely mono- and di-ubiquitinated Parkin species, Ubc13/UBE2N together with its co-factor Uev1a was unable to generate these Ub modifications on Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003935-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Parkin, without any E2 enzymes, was not able to Ub modify itself. No discernable differences in Parkin's (auto-)ubiquitination were observed between samples that had been left untreated or had been treated with CCCP or phosphatase. CCCP treatment resulted in enhanced poly-Ub levels as judged by streptavidin detection of the biotinylated Ub used. Phosphatase treatment strongly reduced the enzymatic activities of Parkin. It is unclear whether these ubiquitinations were formed on Parkin itself (but are not detectable with a anti-FLAG antibody) or on E2 enzymes or were attached to other co-immunoprecipitated proteins. Taken together, our structural and functional data corroborate an important role of Ser65 phosphorylation and provide a mechanistic insights into unleashing Parkin through unfolding, E2 enzyme binding and Ub charging as well as activation of its enzymatic E3 ligase functions and concomitant recruitment to damaged mitochondria.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on several recent but partial X-ray crystals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Riley1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Trempe1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Wauer1">[27]</xref> we performed molecular modeling to provide an all atom resolution structure of human Parkin. This neuroprotective RBR-type E3 Ub ligase is inactivated in familial and probably also sporadic forms of PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Corti1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Dawson1">[54]</xref>. Under basal conditions, Parkin is auto-inhibited through several intra-molecular interactions. Our models suggest that the N-terminal UBL domain and the linker region, which has been crystallographically difficult to resolve, act as a spring/clamp that holds Parkin in its closed conformation. Previous studies had shown that upon mitochondrial stress, Parkin's activation and recruitment is dependent on the upstream kinase PINK1. We describe the first comprehensive molecular dynamics study of Parkin activation upon PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser65 in the UBL domain. We have generated over 30,000 snapshot structures of Parkin that illustrate a sequential release of its intertwined domains along an unfolding pathway to liberate its Ub ligase function(s).</p>
<p>Functionally, PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of Parkin's Ser65 appears as the most upstream event of its activation cascade. We have analyzed a phospho-dead S65A mutation of Parkin as well as the phospho-mimic variants S65D and S65E. Using a high content imaging approach, we found a significant delay in Parkin recruitment upon mitochondrial uncoupling for all Ser65 substitutions, in line with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Birsa1">[55]</xref>. In contrast to an earlier report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Iguchi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zheng1">[15]</xref>, we noted a substantial increase in Ub charging (oxyester formation) of particularly S65E Parkin and to a lesser extent of the S65D variant even in the absence of CCCP. Our findings are in agreement with more recent studies that support the idea of a partially released auto-inhibition for phospho-mimic Parkin mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Birsa1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima2">[56]</xref>. In fact, phospho-mimic Parkin, compared to wild type, showed increased Ub ligase activity at steady state in neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Birsa1">[55]</xref> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima2">[56]</xref> as evidenced by reduced levels of Parkin substrates under physiological conditions. However, phospho-dead Parkin showed greatly diminished Ub charging at all conditions, consistent with a reduced E2 discharge and E3 ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kazlauskaite2">[57]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima2">[56]</xref>. Despite the enhanced enzyme activity at base line, neither S65D nor S65E Parkin could be found on mitochondria without depolarization. Although mitochondrial translocation and Ub charging of Parkin appear as interdependent events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Iguchi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Lazarou1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zheng1">[15]</xref>, our data corroborate the hypothesis of a second mechanism that is required for the translocation of Parkin, consistent with the finding that Parkin phosphorylation is not sufficient to trigger its recruitment. Thus, PINK1 phosphorylation of Parkin appears to primarily boost its enzymatic activity, thereby regulating not only mitochondrial function but also activity and survival of dopaminergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima2">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to bridge the gap between static structures and enzymatic functions, we performed MDS and used in addition to normal modes, Monte Carlo algorithms and minimal-biasing methods that provided consequent opening conformations of Parkin. Although some of the presented models are hypothetical in nature, it is certain that the N-terminal region has to dissociate from the remaining part of Parkin in order to facilitate further required structural rearrangements. Our full-length Parkin model shows that Ser65 is located within a newly defined cleft that is formed between the UBL domain and the adjacent linker region. Using free MDS, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser65 results in widening and enhanced solvation of this pocket. Similarly, both phospho-mimic and albeit slower also phospho-dead Ser65 mutations allow opening of the cavity as opposed to unmodified Ser65. Our MDS studies further suggest that phosphorylation of Ser65 in Parkin initializes the dissociation of the UBL domain (within ns) and thereby induces larger scale conformational motions over time. It should be noted that the simulation time scale is not an exact match for what is actually occurring in the cell, but is idealized. In the cell, Parkin protein will require more than the calculated time to undergo major structural rearrangements and binding of the E2 co-enzyme in order to become fully active. pSer65-dependent hydration of the surrounding cavity induces the release of the UBL domain, which appears to act as the first safety belt that keeps Parkin's activity in check under basal conditions. Upon dissociation of the UBL domain, we next detected release of the inhibitory REP region from the E2 binding site in RING1 that could facilitate association of an Ub-charged co-enzyme. As a further consequence we also observed conformational adjustments in RING0 that intervenes between RING1 and RING2 burying Parkin's active site when unmodified. In its inactive state, the E2 binding site and Parkin's catalytic center are separated by a distance of more than 50 Å, which would not allow for Ub transfer. However, during opening of Parkin, we measured significant changes in distances, RMSD and SASA values, indicating differences in positioning and solvation of the region surrounding Cys431 that would be important for charging of Parkin.</p>
<p>These promising measurements prompted us to dock an Ub-charged E2 enzyme (UbcH5a/UBE2D1) during the opening phase of Parkin. Indeed, we found conformations that were able to accommodate the co-enzyme and allowed us to generate an energetically favorable Parkin:E2-Ub complex. Strikingly, subsequent free MDS, showed a reorientation of the E2 to better position the Ub-Gly76 residue towards Parkin's active site. This coincides with hydration around Cys431 and results in a significantly reduced distance between the catalytic centers of the E2 and Parkin. The amide linkage in the E2-Ub co-crystal prevented further insights into the transfer of the Ub moiety from the E2 enzyme onto Parkin's active center, but we noted a repositioning of the REP region back into the E2 binding site in RING1. This putative reset mechanism may allow dissociation of the discharged E2 for the next binding event during consecutive ubiquitinations rounds. During mitophagy, multiple E2 enzymes are utilized by Parkin for Ub charging, mitochondrial translocation and substrate ubiquitinations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Lazarou1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Fiesel1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Hasson1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kazlauskaite2">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Geisler2">[58]</xref>. We have recently demonstrated that some regulate Parkin's activation and mitophagy through redundant, cooperative, or antagonistic mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Fiesel1">[39]</xref>. E2 enzymes usually confer the linkage specificity for RING-type Ub ligases while HECT- and RBR-type E3 ligases are charged with Ub and themselves define the respective Ub linkages that are formed. Parkin appears to catalyze the conjugation of various Ub modifications ranging from (multi-) mono-ubiquitination to poly-Ub chains with different topologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Sandebring1">[59]</xref>, while particularly K27, K48, and K63 linked chains have been observed during mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Geisler1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Chan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Birsa1">[55]</xref>. In the absence of Parkin co-crystals with co-enzymes and/or substrates, it will be important to dock additional E2 co-enzymes, other co-factors as well as substrates, where structures are available to shed more light onto the catalytic activity(ies) of Parkin.</p>
<p>In this context, it is important to note that Parkin has been suggested to self-associate through a PINK1-dependent mechanism upstream of its mitochondrial translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Lazarou1">[14]</xref>. Our own findings (unpublished) and other recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zhang1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima2">[56]</xref> including the crystal structures (PDB IDs: 4K7D and 4K95) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Trempe1">[26]</xref> support the dimerization/multimerization capability of Parkin. A small fraction of PINK1-phosphorylated (i.e. activated) Parkin could activate non-phosphorylated Parkin in trans and thereby amplify its E3 ligase activity through an autocatalytic mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zhang1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima2">[56]</xref>. The inactive C431S Parkin variant would inhibit this feed-forward loop and consistently is unable to translocate to mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Iguchi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Lazarou1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zheng1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Fiesel1">[39]</xref> suggesting that the Ub moiety must be passed onto a lysine residue of a substrate that may well include Parkin itself. Of note, the delay in S65A translocation to mitochondria was rescued in the presence of wild type (i.e. pSer65) Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zhang1">[19]</xref>. However, S65A Parkin could not be charged by wild type in the C431S-Ub oxyester experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-ShibaFukushima2">[56]</xref>. Accumulating evidence indicates that pSer65 primarily boosts Parkin's enzymatic E3 ligase activity, but also suggests additional functions for the phosphorylation of the UBL domain than release of auto-inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kazlauskaite2">[57]</xref>. A deletion mutant of Parkin lacking the UBL domain was able to translocate to mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Geisler1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Sarraf1">[8]</xref>, but could not ubiquitinate the model substrate Miro1 while retaining robust auto-ubiquitination and E2 discharge comparable to wild type Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kazlauskaite2">[57]</xref>. A role of the UBL domain in binding to substrates and regulators has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Spratt2">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>Strikingly, it has been shown that PINK1 also phosphorylates the modifier Ub itself at the conserved Ser65 residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kane1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zhang1">[19]</xref>, in addition to Parkin's UBL domain. Of note, Parkin phospho-Ub alone (i.e without CCCP treatment) can activate Parkin wild type, ΔUBL as well as the S65A mutant <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kane1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kazlauskaite1">[17]</xref>. However, optimal activation of Parkin appears to depend on both Ser65 phosphorylation events catalyzed by PINK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kazlauskaite1">[17]</xref>. Consistent with a putative phospho-binding site in Parkin's RING0 that has been identified through co-crystallization of a sulphate ion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Wauer1">[27]</xref>, Parkin can bind to phospho-mimic Ub which seemed to be dependent on Parkin pSer65 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Koyano1">[18]</xref>. One might speculate that while phosphorylation of UBL domain could (pre-)activate Parkin's E3 ligase functions, phosphorylation of Ub that is already attached to a mitochondrial substrate might induce its translocation and full enzymatic activity. Binding of Parkin to phosphorylated Ub moieties (as free or attached monomers or poly-Ub chains) or even its own phosphorylated UBL domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Kane1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Zhang1">[19]</xref> may also help to maintain an open, active conformation. In summary, our structural and functional data underscore the importance of PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of the UBL domain for the activation of Parkin's enzymatic functions. In addition to functional studies that are required to entirely elucidate the mechanisms and the sequence of events during activation and translocation of Parkin, molecular dynamics simulations will certainly be useful to provide structural insights. Our models highlights multiple opportunities for analysis of PD mutations and modifications to hopefully open up new avenues for the design of safe small molecule activators of this multipurpose neuroprotective E3 Ub ligase.</p>

Briefly, each Parkin system was minimized with relaxed restraints using either Steepest Descent or Conjugate Gradient PR, and equilibrated in solvent with physiological salt conditions, as shown in the literature. Following equilibration each system was allowed to run MD calculations between 100–1000 nanoseconds in length. The primary purpose of MD for this study was conformational variability that may occur in the UBL. We also conducted conformationally enhanced sampling with MD biasing methods, like MdMD and MC-based generators. The protocol for refinement include the following steps: (1) Simulated annealing with explicit water molecules and ions, (2) Energy minimization, (3) MDS for 500 ps to relax to the force field (both AMBER03 and YASARA2 were tested). Tables were generated for most optimal conformation. PRIME and YASARA also give output for likely dimerization. FoldX was utilized as a plugin within YASARA to achieve mutant comparisons. In summary, the FoldX algorithm may calculate protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, or mutations within a protein, whereby FoldX calculates ΔΔG of interaction: ΔΔGab = ΔGab−(ΔGa+ΔGb)+ ΔGkon+ΔSsc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Sanchez1">[83]</xref>.

In all cases, we neutralized with counter-ions, and then created a solvent with 150 mM Na+ Cl- to recreate physiological strength. TIP3P water molecules were added around the protein at a depth of 15–18 Å from the edge of the molecule depending upon the side <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Jorgensen1">[84]</xref>. Our protocol has been previously described in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Caulfield2">[36]</xref>. Solvated protein simulations consist of a box with between 1.17×10<sup>5</sup> atoms including proteins, counter-ions, solvent ions, and solvent waters. Simulations were carried out using the particle mesh Ewald technique with repeating boundary conditions with a 9 Å nonbonded cut-off, using SHAKE with a 2-fs timestep. Pre-equilibration was started with 100,000 steps of minimization followed by 10000 ps of heating under MD, with the atomic positions of protein fixed. Then, two cycles of minimization (100000 steps each) and heating (2000 ps) were carried out with restraints of 10 and 5 kcal/(mol·Å<sup>2</sup>) applied to all protein atoms. Next, 50000-steps of minimization were performed with solute restraints reduced by 1 kcal/(mol·Å<sup>2</sup>). Then, 1000 ps of unrestrained MD were carried out, and the system was slowly heated from 1 to 310 K. The production MD runs were carried out with constant pressure boundary conditions (relaxation time of 1.0 ps). A constant temperature of 300 K was maintained using the Berendsen weak-coupling algorithm with a time constant of 1.0 ps. SHAKE constraints were applied to all hydrogens to eliminate X-H vibrations, which yielded a longer simulation time step (2 fs). Our methods for equilibration and production run protocols are in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Caulfield1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Caulfield3">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Reblova1">[85]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Reblova2">[86]</xref>. Equilibration was determined from a flattening of RMSD over time after an interval of&gt;20 ns. Our biasing algorithm, MdMD (MdMD section) expedited conformational searching over timescales inaccessible otherwise. Translational and rotational center-of-mass motions were initially removed.

<p>The MdMD algorithm has been previously described in exhaustive detail for smaller systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Caulfield2">[36]</xref>. The application of MdMD allows the user to alter the shape of X-ray crystallographic structures to match the cryogenic-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) data, which may present an alternative conformation of the structure. In doing so, the cryo-EM density can drive the MD toward an unknown conformation. By automating this process, human biases and errors are minimized for the model making process. To prevent local wells, the time of sampling, MD sprint varies and Boltzmann velocities can be applied directionally. MdMD algorithm was implemented to collect representative pathway data for Parkin dynamics between LC-MOD/MCMM generated states. Average time for MdMD pathway is between 10 and 20 ns, while the count for discarded states during global variable testing ranges from 16% to 8%. Several replicate runs of MdMD were performed.</p>

<title>LC-MOD/MC and MCMM/LMCS conformation generation</title>
<p>Using Schrödinger's Conformational Search Suite, we employed the following scheme. Potential terms were set using the OPLS2005 force field with water solvent and charges designated from the force field. We used an extended cutoff for electrostatic calculations (default: Van der Waals 8.0 Å, Electrostatic 20.0 Å, H-bond 4.0 Å). We utilized constraints fixed on each zinc atom and the associated zinc-finger amino acid residues (i.e. cysteines, histidines, etc), which were determined using harmonic restraints at a force constant of 50 kcal/mol per selected atom. Additionally, torsions of the adjacent amino acid to the zinc-binding amino acid was softly constrained with a 10 kcal/mol force constant. Every other atom of the system was left to freely move under the conditions of the search algorithm, and the constrained pairs were assigned relative to each other, not to coordinate space, such that the zinc-finger could move as a single unit during conformational searches. The Powell-Reeves conjugate gradient energy minimization method was utilized on conformations achieved to return the structure to its local minimum for that particular conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Polak1">[88]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several search schemes were applied to Parkin to look for large global conformational variation. Using the conformational search engine, we examined torsional sampling with MCMM, Mixed-torsional/Low-mode sampling, Large-scale Low-mode sampling, and Mixed torsional/Large-scale low-mode sampling (LC-MOD). When using the LLMOD search, we set the initial convergence criteria to 1.000. To customize the search we used enhanced torsion sampling options with distance and torsion checking. Maximum number of steps per attempt was 5,000 with 100 steps per rotatable bond, saving 10 structures per search. The default energy window for saving structures is 5.02 kcal/mol. Probability of a torsion rotation/molecule translation is 0.5. Minimum distance for a low-mode move is 3.0 Å and maximum is 7.5 Å. The search was continued for 100 s of conformers, retaining only lowest energy models and discarding unrealistic structures. Structures from the LCMOD search form guidepost structures for MdMD biasing of the initial model to traverse the landscape of structures generated using Schrödinger's Large-scale sampling using the initial crude guideposts and various biasing schemes. Final simulations relied on MdMD for smooth pathway transitions.</p>

It consists of first, introducing the mutation and finding an energetically favorable local rearrangement around the mutation site, and second, computing the change in interaction energy (ΔΔG) using a knowledge-based (KB) potential. ZEMu equilibration of the mutation site proceeds as follows: First we specified a small (five residue) flexibility zone centered about the mutation site. The flexibility zone is treated in torsion space, leaving the remainder of the protein rigid and fixed. We then specified a larger, enclosing physics zone inside of which electrostatic and van der Waals forces are active. Due to the lack of solvent or other rigorous treatment of viscosity, it is possible for small chemical groups such as methyl to spin unnaturally quickly, which results in the variable time step integrator taking very small time steps. To deal with this we artificially scale the inertia matrices of such groups by a factor of 11.0 – empirically found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003935-Dourado1">[37]</xref> to be sufficient to lengthen time steps without significantly affecting results.

For the free MDS trajectory, the overall structure is stays under 7–8 Å for RMSF (red line). The red line is for Ser65 simulation and black line is for pSer65 simulation.</p>

<p><bold>RMSD of UBL-linker versus residues 141–465 from four replicates.</bold> Residues 141–465 (blue) are &lt;5 Å of initial structure for duration. Only local conformational fluctuations occur in the main body, which is rigidified by the presence of eight Zinc-fingers. The MdMD algorithm moves each replicate toward State 5 giving rise to large RMS changes that are shown in red, green and beige. For each replicate, the movement is almost similar giving closely spaced RMS changes during the common MD sprint interval.</p>
