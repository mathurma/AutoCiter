        <p>Visual experience in developing tadpoles spatially organizes neuronal receptive fields and improves network-level representation of visual stimuli.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Sensory experience drives dramatic structural and functional plasticity in developing neurons. However, for single-neuron plasticity to optimally improve whole-network encoding of sensory information, changes must be coordinated between neurons to ensure a full range of stimuli is efficiently represented. Using two-photon calcium imaging to monitor evoked activity in over 100 neurons simultaneously, we investigate network-level changes in the developing <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tectum during visual training with motion stimuli. Training causes stimulus-specific changes in neuronal responses and interactions, resulting in improved population encoding. This plasticity is spatially structured, increasing tuning curve similarity and interactions among nearby neurons, and decreasing interactions among distant neurons. Training does not improve encoding by single clusters of similarly responding neurons, but improves encoding across clusters, indicating coordinated plasticity across the network. NMDA receptor blockade prevents coordinated plasticity, reduces clustering, and abolishes whole-network encoding improvement. We conclude that NMDA receptors support experience-dependent network self-organization, allowing efficient population coding of a diverse range of stimuli.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In the developing brain, sensory experience can extensively re-wire neurons, determining both their shape and function. It is thought that this early period of plasticity improves the brain's representation of sensory input. For this plasticity to actually improve coding efficiency, changes to individual neurons should be coordinated across the brain to produce a network-level functional organization. In this study, we measure such network-level changes during visual learning in developing <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (frog) tadpoles. By imaging neuronal calcium levels, we track activity in over 100 neurons simultaneously to observe changes in both single neurons and whole networks during training. We find that the network improves its representation of visual stimuli over time, by forming spatial clusters of highly connected, similarly responding neurons. Distant neurons, however, become less connected. This organization improves the ability of large groups of neurons, spanning multiple clusters, to discriminate the trained stimuli. Finally, we show that blockade of the NMDA receptor prevents this functional organization and the improvement in the network's stimulus representation. Our study shows how developmental plasticity can influence not only the proper connectivity of the visual system, but also its coding capacity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The vertebrate brain exhibits intricate functional organization at many different spatial scales, from cortical microcolumns dedicated to processing specific receptive field properties, to large domains such as somatotopic maps. It is thought that this organization of neurons according to shared function optimizes efficiency and effectiveness of neural processing. During development, the structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Cline1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Goodman1">[2]</xref> and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Dunfield1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Hubel1">[6]</xref> of sensory neural circuits are actively guided by both endogenous signals and environmental stimuli. However, it is not well understood how these changes lead to improved brain function.</p>
      <p>Here we investigate how plasticity affects developing visual system performance from the perspective of sensory encoding—the representation of sensory stimuli by activity in populations of brain neurons. Neuronal responses are inherently noisy and vary across presentations of the same sensory stimulus, limiting how much information can be encoded by a single neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Graf1">[7]</xref>. To optimally encode environmental stimuli in the presence of noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Tkacik1">[8]</xref>, sensory circuits must be organized to balance redundancy, which makes network encoding less sensitive to neuronal noise, with the ability to encode a diverse range of stimuli. In the absence of noise, a given stimulus feature can be fully conveyed by a small number of neurons, and to maximize efficiency, other neurons should then encode different features. If neuronal responses are more variable, more neurons are required to reliably convey a given feature. The optimal response pattern for each neuron thus depends on the response properties of other neurons in the network and the reliability of those responses.</p>
      <p>Encoding is also affected by neuronal interactions. For example, neuronal interactions may be organized to remove correlations from the network's input (decorrelation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Barlow1">[9]</xref>, making the neural code more efficient, and neuronal ensembles can synergistically encode information not available from individual neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Schneidman1">[10]</xref>. Strategies that coordinate neuronal interactions and optimize encoding have been identified in artificial networks under various conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Tkacik1">[8]</xref>, and encoding schemes have been described and evaluated in mature neural circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Gawne1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Pillow1">[14]</xref>. Further studies have shown that adaptation of neuronal receptive fields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Sharpee1">[15]</xref> and correlations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Gutnisky1">[16]</xref> can tune encoding in response to changes in sensory stimuli in vivo. However, little is known about how encoding schemes arise during development or how they are altered during early learning, when dynamically growing neural circuits first wire themselves together. Evaluating network encoding requires simultaneous observation of many neurons, and understanding early network refinement requires monitoring those networks over the course of learning and development.</p>
      <p>The visual system of the <italic>X. laevis</italic> tadpole has been extensively studied as a model of neuronal and neural circuit development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Cline1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Dunfield1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Engert1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Dong1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Chen1">[21]</xref>. Transparent albino tadpoles allow minimally invasive in vivo observation of rapid sensory circuit development, from differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Wu1">[22]</xref> to mature neurons driving behavioral responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Sumbre1">[23]</xref>. Studies in the developing brain have described mechanisms controlling large-scale circuit patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Sperry1">[24]</xref>, fine-scale morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Chen1">[21]</xref>, and rules by which synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Zhang1">[25]</xref>, single neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Engert1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Niell1">[18]</xref>, and small groups of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Gutnisky1">[16]</xref> refine their response properties with experience. However, it is largely unknown how these developmental changes contribute to network encoding performance, or how plasticity is coordinated across neurons to produce functional large networks.</p>
      <p>Here we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Dunfield1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Li1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Niell1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Sin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Sumbre1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Komiyama1">[26]</xref> to monitor network activity and plasticity during early receptive field development in Xenopus tadpole optic tectum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Sakaguchi1">[27]</xref> as we train the brain to respond to a set of visual motion stimuli. Training causes stimulus-specific changes in evoked neuronal responses and increases stimulus information conveyed by neuronal firing. Decoding of network activity using computational models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Quiroga1">[28]</xref> becomes more accurate over the course of visual training. Training induces spatial clustering of receptive fields and correlations by increasing tuning curve similarity and network interactions among nearby neurons and decreasing interactions among distant neurons. Blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartic-acid type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) blocks spatially graded plasticity, and prevents decoding improvement with training. By comparing decoding in single clusters and groups, we show that increasing network performance arises from NMDAR-dependent improvement in encoding of stimulus information across clusters, while encoding within single clusters does not improve with training. We propose that NMDARs support experience-dependent functional clustering, leading to local redundancy and distant decorrelation, and promote receptive field diversity by preventing loss of underrepresented receptive fields. These results highlight contributions of network-level organization to the performance of sensory systems in vivo and identify mechanisms by which visual experience directs improvement in whole-network function.</p>

        <title>In Vivo Monitoring of Neuronal Firing Rates with Two-Photon Calcium Imaging</title>
        <p>In vivo two-photon calcium imaging allows simultaneous monitoring of somatic calcium transients, induced by neuronal firing, in hundreds of neurons in the vertebrate brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Dunfield1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Li1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Niell1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Komiyama1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Ohki1">[29]</xref>. We used this method to monitor correlated visually evoked responses across the optic tectum, which requires that firing-rate measurements are accurate on a single-trial basis and not averaged across trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Quiroga1">[28]</xref>. Optical readout of calcium transients is hindered by drifting baseline fluorescence (<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>), bleaching, and saturation, and involves fundamental tradeoffs between imaging area and quality of signal. Moreover, the relationship between action potentials and calcium levels is complicated by the temporal dependence of calcium concentrations on spiking history and nonlinearities in calcium influx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Vogelstein1">[30]</xref>. To overcome these limitations and improve signal quality, we developed techniques for automated video segmentation to track cell boundaries on the basis of morphology and temporal pixel correlations, spatial filtering to weight the contributions of pixels within a given cell, and <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> estimation using optimal linear methods (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To extract firing rates from fluorescence data we employed a spike inference algorithm, which takes into account temporal dependence and nonlinearities in signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Vogelstein1">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To assess the effectiveness of these methods for measuring single-trial–evoked firing rates in the awake brain, we performed in vivo loose seal patch clamp electrophysiological recordings to monitor action potential spiking during simultaneous calcium imaging and visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g001">Figures 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s002">S2</xref>). We compared firing rates obtained from electrophysiological recordings to two measures of neuronal firing obtained from fluorescence data: peak Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Dunfield1">[3]</xref> and firing rates inferred from spike inference. Though both measures showed significant correlations to actual firing, inferred firing rates outperformed peak Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> in all neurons recorded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s003">Figure S3</xref>), possibly because burst durations and interspike intervals were long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g001">Figure 1f</xref>), resulting in imperfect summation of peak calcium currents. The relationship between inferred firing rates and actual spike counts was linear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s003">Figure S3</xref>), showing that in vivo calcium imaging and spike inference is an effective method for monitoring firing rate fluctuations in tectal neurons.</p>

        <p>We first used rapid two-photon imaging and firing rate inference to characterize motion receptive fields in untrained tadpoles. Motion stimuli consisted of dark bars moving over a light circular background in each of eight directions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), with low contrast so as to better detect improvements in neuronal responses with subsequent training. We found that most motion-responsive tectal neurons respond either symmetrically to pairs of opposing directions (orientation selectivity, 59.1%±5.0% of cells; mean ± standard deviation [SD]), and/or specifically to a narrow band of directions (direction selectivity, 66.3%±11.1%). Neurons responding to two opposite directions while strongly favoring one direction can show both selectivities (36.7%±9.3%). Average responses of individual neurons to each stimulus direction, called tuning curves, show varying selectivity in a topographic organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of two-photon imaging and spike inference in measuring receptive fields across a contiguous brain network in vivo.</p>

        <title>Tectal Network Responses to Visual Stimuli Exhibit Noise Correlations Indicating Functional Interconnections</title>
        <p>Besides the single-neuron properties described above, networks of neurons often show correlations in their firing patterns. Neurons with similar tuning curves show “signal correlations” because their firing is driven by the same stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Gawne1">[11]</xref>. Notably, real neuronal responses also show trial-to-trial deviations from their tuning curves. When these trial-to-trial deviations are shared, because of common input or interconnections, neurons are “noise correlated” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g003">Figure 3a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Gawne1">[11]</xref>. Noise correlations are thus correlations in neural firing patterns that are not explained by shared receptive field properties. Noise correlations can be positive or negative, can differ across stimuli, and do not require signal correlations to be present. When trial-to-trial variability is not shared, neurons are independent.</p>

        <p>Examining multineuronal firing patterns elicited by motion stimuli, we find that noise correlations are prominent in the awake developing tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g003">Figure 3b and 3c</xref>). Noise correlation measurements were correlated over consecutive 30-min periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). Noise correlations varied across stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s004">Figure S4</xref>), and may thus convey stimulus information not present in single-neuron responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s005">Figure S5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Montani1">[37]</xref>. Noise correlations between neurons tended to have the same sign as signal correlations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s006">Figure S6</xref>), indicating that many tectal noise correlations reflect shared errors in similarly responding neurons.

        <title>Tectal Noise Correlations Can Encode Stimulus Information, But Impair Overall Network Performance</title>
        <p>Noise correlations can both help and hurt network stimulus encoding, depending on how they vary with stimuli and the response properties of neurons in the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Tkacik1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Gawne1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Averbeck1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Panzeri1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Montani1">[37]</xref>. Because noise correlations are prominent in developing tectum and are stimulus dependent, we expected that knowledge of noise correlations may be important for downstream neurons to extract all available information from network activity patterns. However, because we found that tectal noise correlations largely reflect shared errors, we expected removal of noise correlations from population activity would increase the amount of information available in those firing patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Graf1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Tkacik1">[8]</xref>. To test these predictions, we constructed two model decoders: one that takes into account pairwise noise correlations, and an optimal independent decoder, which ignores noise correlations. A decoder is a model based on a set of real network responses, which takes a second set of measured activity patterns as input and predicts the inducing stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Quiroga1">[28]</xref>. Decoders thus perform the same task as downstream neurons to recover stimulus information from upstream network activity. By building decoders, we can ask two distinct questions: Regarding encoding—Would population encoding accuracy be altered if noise correlations were somehow abolished? Regarding decoding—Is knowledge of noise correlations necessary to fully decode network activity from a population response? We find that abolishing noise correlations by shuffling neurons' responses across trials of each stimulus improves accuracy of both decoders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g003">Figure 3e</xref>). This finding confirms that encoding would improve overall if responses were uncorrelated, likely because the noise correlations we observe are largely shared errors among similarly responding neurons. Nevertheless, ignoring noise correlations in actual data significantly reduced decoding accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g003">Figure 3e</xref>). This outcome suggests that sensitivity to noise correlations would help downstream neurons to decode firing rates in this network. However, changes in neural response properties over the sampling period can make noise correlations important for decoding, even in cases where they would not be important if responses were stationary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Oizumi1">[38]</xref>. To properly evaluate the contribution of noise correlations to decoding we must thus determine whether tectal responses change with repeated stimulus exposure, and manipulate this contribution by altering neuronal interactions.</p>

To investigate how stimulus encoding changes in response to visual experience, we presented tadpoles the eight motion stimuli of different directions repeatedly over 2 h. This training improved sensory responses over time, increasing dynamic range and response reliability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g004">Figure 4a, 4f, and 4g</xref>). Training also shifted neural response properties, increasing the proportion of neurons showing combined orientation and direction selectivity and decreasing the proportion showing only direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g004">Figure 4e</xref>). Encoding was enhanced, evident from increased stimulus mutual information conveyed by both individual neurons and neuron pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g004">Figure 4b and 4c</xref>), and improvement in both independent and noise-correlation–based decoding of whole-network activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). To further demonstrate that visual experience modifies network encoding over time, we split the stimulation period into two 60-min epochs (“early” and “late”), and built decoders for each using firing statistics from either the same or the opposite epoch. Both independent and noise correlation decoding improved from early to late epochs, and decoding performance decreased when using firing statistics from the opposite epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g005">Figure 5c</xref>), demonstrating that experience changes how developing brain networks encode stimuli.</p>

        <p>To investigate NMDAR effects on experience-dependent network plasticity, we performed the previously described visual training protocol using moving bar stimuli of eight directions with tadpoles treated with MK-801. We find that distinct components of experience-dependent plasticity are NMDAR dependent and independent. In contrast to untreated tadpoles, training did not shift the proportions of different response selectivities in MK801-treated tadpoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g004">Figure 4e</xref>). MK-801 reduced improvement in whole-network encoding, dynamic range, and stimulus information of neuron pairs, but not in single-neuron stimulus information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g004">Figure 4a–4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g005">5a</xref>).

We also find that nearby neuron pairs show higher noise correlations and a significant association between stimulus and noise correlation, consistent with locally shared input or direct connectivity. We tracked these measures across epochs of visual training among nearby (&lt;25 µm), moderate (25–50 µm), and distant (50–75 µm) neurons. Tectal somata have diameters of 10–15 µm.

Networks showed strongly decreased noise correlations to trained stimuli, while noise correlations to untrained stimuli increased above levels in naive tadpoles.

        <title>Coordination between Neuronal Clusters Supports Experience-Dependent Encoding Improvement</title>
        <p>Visual training induces remarkable spatially divergent plasticity. On one hand, training-induced encoding improvement is associated with lower signal and noise correlations among distant neurons. On the other hand, local plasticity opposes this trend, increasing redundancy between nearby neurons over the course of visual training. To determine how these opposing forces contribute to overall network improvement, we grouped neurons according to receptive field so as to monitor stimulus decoding within clusters of similarly responding neurons over time (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Consistent with our measurements of tectal signal correlations, functionally defined groups showed significant spatial clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Interestingly, decoding success of single clusters did not change with training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g008">Figure 8c</xref>), suggesting that interactions between clusters may be more important in supporting overall encoding improvement. To understand how well clusters interact to encode information, we measured intercluster cooperation, which we defined as the decoding performance of two clusters taken together minus the maximum decoding performance of either taken alone. Cooperation is high when clusters encode distinct information or encode information synergistically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Schneidman1">[10]</xref>, and low when clusters encode the same information. Notably, cooperation increased with visual training in control tadpoles, while training during NMDAR blockade decreased cluster cooperation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g008">Figure 8d</xref>). To further investigate how plasticity in neuronal interactions contributes to changes in encoding performance, we again removed the contribution of noise correlations by shuffling neuronal responses prior to decoding (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g003">Figure 3e</xref>). Shuffled decoding accuracy did not change from EARLY to LATE epochs, even as nonshuffled decoding accuracy increased in control tadpoles and decreased in MK-801–treated tadpoles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s009">Figure S9</xref>), consistent with a role for neuronal interactions in driving the changes in network performance we observe. These results show that improvements in the brain's ability to represent visual stimuli are not due only to improved encoding in single neurons or local groups, but are driven strongly by changes in the functional organization of the sensory network.</p>

      <p>The functional organization of the brain contributes to effective neural processing, and neurons can coordinate or compete to encode distinct stimulus dimensions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Gawne1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Miller1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Han1">[45]</xref>. We find that developmental plasticity in response to visual experience establishes such organization in the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This plasticity strengthens divisions between microarchitectural brain regions specialized to encode distinct stimuli that the organism experiences. Visual training improves both individual neuron and network response properties, but single-neuron changes only weakly impact network performance. This weak reliance on single neurons likely arises because the tectal network is organized in local receptive field clusters that exhibit high redundancy; information gained from improved fidelity in any individual neuron tends to already be available from other nearby neurons. Our results show that the functional organization of the network plays a larger role in the overall improvement of population encoding with training. This organization consists of specialization by distinct groups of neurons to convey distinct information, as training drives distant neurons to become more independent while strengthening local redundancy. This spatially driven plasticity arises from forces acting to increase or decrease functional connectivity in the tectum on different spatial scales.</p>

      <p>Spatial clustering of functional properties is a common feature in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Dunfield1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Li1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Komiyama1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Ohki1">[29]</xref>, which can lead to redundant local encoding. Redundancy is important in mitigating effects of variability of individual neuronal responses. Because neuron response fidelity is fundamentally limited by both physics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Bialek1">[46]</xref> and physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Laughlin1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Shadlen1">[48]</xref>, redundant encoding by groups can be more practical than decreasing variability in single neurons. Moreover, response properties in a given brain volume are limited by the availability of presynaptic partners, as each neuron must search its local environment for appropriate connections. In tectum, prominent inputs are likely to be shared by nearby neurons because of the localized arborization of retinal ganglion cell axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Ruthazer1">[40]</xref>, and plasticity that strengthens those inputs thus promotes local redundancy. Finally, local similarity can make wiring of developing networks more economical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Koulakov1">[49]</xref>, as neurons responding to a particular stimulus should then receive inputs from a restricted anatomical region. Learning-associated functional clustering and correlation changes similar to those described here have been described in mouse motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Komiyama1">[26]</xref>, raising the possibility that common constraints drive functional optimization across network structures and functions.</p>
      <p>Measurement of single-trial firing rates enables monitoring of redundancy and noise correlations in large populations of tectal neurons. We found that noise correlations can be repeatably measured and are altered by training in an experience- and NMDAR-dependent fashion. These results show that two-photon calcium imaging can be used to investigate shared connections across contiguous brain regions and how these change in vivo. However, the anatomical substrates underlying tectal noise correlation plasticity remain unclear, since noise correlations could arise either from shared retinal inputs or intratectal connections. Plasticity in noise correlations may indicate formation and elimination of these connections or alteration of synaptic strengths. We found that accounting for noise correlations improves decoding of tectal population activity, but this effect could be due to changes in neural activity patterns over the stimulation period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Oizumi1">[38]</xref>. However, the specific effects of NMDAR blockade on noise correlation-based decoding with training suggest that noise correlations are indeed important for decoding tectal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g005">Figures 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s009">S9</xref>). Despite their importance to decoding, we found that the presence of noise correlations does not improve network encoding. The reduction of correlations typically enables networks to convey more information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Barlow1">[9]</xref>. Indeed, we found that artificially eliminating noise correlations in network activity data increased decoding performance. Networks whose function is limited by the number of neurons available for encoding should thus benefit from decreased noise correlations. Consistent with this prediction, we found that distant network correlations decrease with training in a stimulus-specific manner, as encoding of those stimuli improves. Changes on these larger spatial scales, spanning functional clusters in the tectum, underlie the overall improvement of network encoding with training. Our results show that spatial refinement of noise correlations occurs during experience-dependent plasticity, and changes to such network-level properties are important to the development of tectal function with training.</p>
      <p>We find that visual training with motion stimuli induces extensive plasticity in the tectum, distinct components of which are NMDAR dependent or independent. Consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Engert1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Pratt1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Daw1">[42]</xref>, we find no effect of NMDAR blockade on basal motion response properties in tectum. We found that NMDAR-independent mechanisms mediate training-induced increases in reliability and partly mediate improvements in dynamic range, single-neuron mutual information, and neuron-pair mutual information. NMDAR blockade does not completely abolish tectal plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Dunfield1">[3]</xref>, and NMDAR-independent plasticity has been described in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Malenka1">[50]</xref>. However, NMDAR blockade has dramatic effects on coordination of plasticity across the network and components of single-neuron plasticity. When NMDARs are blocked, visual training fails to induce spatially structured changes in tectal network architecture, and NMDAR-independent plasticity drives neurons toward common receptive fields over time. This progressive loss of network organization prevents training from improving whole-network performance. Our findings suggest that NMDARs are essential to coordinated experience-dependent network plasticity by (1) mediating spatial refinement of network connections, leading to localized redundancy and distant correlation reduction, and (2) promoting receptive field diversity and preventing loss of underrepresented receptive fields even as local similarity increases.</p>
      <p>Results from training with a restricted stimulus set suggest that competition between synaptic connections underlies network changes in response properties and noise correlations. Training with a subset of stimuli dramatically increased the proportion of responsive neurons with selectivity towards the four stimuli presented, showing that motion-responsive tectal neurons can alter their preferred directions with training, and that stimuli compete for representation by a limited pool of tectal neurons. Furthermore, decreases in noise correlations over the four trained stimuli were accompanied by increases over the untrained stimuli, showing that improvements in stimulus representation can occur at a cost to opposing receptive fields. Training with four stimuli also reduced noise correlations across all spatial distances more dramatically than training with the full eight stimuli, showing that more specific training elicits stronger network plasticity, and suggesting that receptive fields compete for efficient representation by the network.</p>
      <p>A number of competitive mechanisms mediated by NMDARs could support the structured plasticity we observe. These mechanisms include removal of axonal projections from tectal regions dominated by opposing axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Ruthazer1">[40]</xref>, spike timing-dependent plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Zhang1">[25]</xref> shown to intrinsically mediate competition between synaptic inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Song1">[51]</xref>, and NMDAR-dependent metaplasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Dunfield1">[3]</xref> that mediates competition by altering plasticity thresholds according to a neuron's overall input rate. Our results demonstrate a role for NMDAR-mediated plasticity mechanisms such as these in experience-driven network refinement.</p>
      <p>For developing neurons to form functional networks, each neuron must possess learning mechanisms that change its response properties to ultimately improve whole-network performance. Optimal changes depend on both the specific stimuli encountered and the response patterns of other neurons throughout the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Tkacik1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Barlow1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Simoncelli1">[52]</xref>. Our findings show that both of these factors guide NMDAR-dependent plasticity induced by structured visual input in the awake, developing brain.</p>

Experiments that showed vertical drift after alignment were discarded (approximately one in four cases). Custom-written software was used to identify and track regions of interest (ROIs) for each cell over the course of each experiment. Initial ROIs were formed on the basis of morphological characteristics and temporal correlation and excluded cell edges, ensuring no overlapping signal from neighbouring cells. ROIs were then expanded, and these regions were refined and fluorescence signal was denoised using iterated singular value decomposition (SVD), where only pixels with common weighting indicating a positive correlation with cell calcium concentration were retained in successive SVD iterations. Pixels in the expanded region were only retained if they predicted signal in the initial ROI, and if they showed less correlation to overlapping ROIs than the maximum correlation of any pixel in the initial ROI. Raw fluorescence for each cell was the reconstructed time-varying mean pixel intensity based on SVD weightings. The fluorescence time series for each cell was then calculated as (<italic>F</italic>−<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>)/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>. The time-varying baseline fluorescence, <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), was fit for each cell using a Kalman smoother implementing the Rauch-Tung-Striebel algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Rauch1">[56]</xref>. The model used for the Kalman smoother consisted of a signal with no velocity and Gaussian noise of constant amplitude to model the slowly drifting baseline. The observation of <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> at each timepoint was the minimum of the smoothed fluorescence trace in a 10-s window around the timepoint, and the covariance was the variance of the raw fluorescence trace within that window, to reflect the confidence that the baseline was observed in that window.</p>
        <p>At this point, cells were excluded from the dataset: (1) If fewer than 80% of pixels from the original morphological ROI had common weighting in the SVD decomposition over 80% of the duration of the experiment; this implied that the singular value did not adequately track the calcium concentration of the cell, which should always be positively correlated to fluorescence intensity. (2) If the estimated signal-to-noise ratio for the calcium trace in the cell was less than 1.</p>

After fitting, spike rate time series for each cell were temporally aligned to each other on the basis of <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> position, to account for the amount of time required to acquire a video frame. Because this model can only place one spike per time bin, it is effective when interspike intervals are consistently longer than the bin width used for inferring spike timings. Over 92% of interspike intervals in electrophysiological recordings during visual stimulation were greater than the 50-ms bin width used for spike inference, and less than 0.1% of time bins contained two spikes, with no bins containing three.</p>

        <p>Temporal response curves for each stimulus type were generated by averaging neurons' firing rate in the temporal vicinity of each stimulus over all stimulus presentations of that type. Each neuron's evoked response to each stimulus presentation was the neuron's mean firing rate between an onset and offset latency after the stimulus, which were chosen to maximize the variance of the neuron's activity across stimulus types. Most tadpoles showed potentiation of evoked responses over time (seven of nine 8STIM; seven of nine 8STIM+MK801; three of five 4STIM). Tadpoles showing significant decrease of response amplitude from the first to second hour of training were not included in analyses.</p>
        <p>Evoked responses for each neuron were normalized to their mean over each 4-min imaging period to ensure that any changes in overall measured activity would not affect subsequent analyses. Tuning curves were calculated as the mean evoked activity in response to each stimulus over all imaging periods within an epoch of interest. Dynamic range of neuronal tuning curves was defined as the mean absolute deviation of the normalized tuning curve from its mean, 1. Dynamic range is thus the average fraction by which firing rate is altered in response to different stimuli.

The most common approach to this task is to calculate the inverse distribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001236.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and use Bayes' rule to obtain the desired result:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001236.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding consists of identifying the peak of this distribution, useful for categorical classification. These probability distributions are hard to estimate from biological data because the number of neurons, the dimensionality of <italic>R</italic>, is high compared to the number of samples available. A simplifying assumption that is often made is to assume that the firing rates of all neurons are conditionally independent given the stimulus <italic>S</italic>. In this case, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001236.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This model requires fewer observations to fit because it requires estimation only of the one-dimensional distribution of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> for each stimulus. To perform categorical classification that is sensitive to pairwise interactions between neurons, we used a simple model that relies on the pairwise conditional probability distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001236.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which are more easily estimated than the full distribution but can capture more complexity than the independent model:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001236.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001236.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Where the denominator in (1) is a correction for the overrepresentation of single-neuron probabilities in the product of pairwise tables. The optimal value of the parameter <italic>N</italic> depends on the size of the network and its correlation structure. In practice, we selected <italic>N</italic> a priori on the basis of a linear regression of the optimal <italic>N</italic> against sample size in separate test data. A separate regression for <italic>N</italic> was used for cluster decoding presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g008">Figure 8</xref>. A prior probability was added to both models to assure that undersampling would not result in zero probability being assigned to a stimulus-response pair. Parameter settings, i.e., number of bins and prior probability, were chosen to maximize absolute decoding success under the independent model, but results were similar under a wide range of parameter settings. Stimulus probabilities generated by both models were adjusted such that long-run probabilities of all stimuli given the training data were equal.</p>
        <p>Assuming sufficiently large samples, this model performs identically to the independent model when neuronal firing is actually independent. For small deviations from independence, consisting of increased probability of a single network pattern, it categorizes stimuli more accurately than the independent model. This decoder outperformed the independent model on virtually all real data we collected, and in artificial datasets of size 3–150 neurons having small pairwise correlations and varying sample sizes (unpublished data). Notably, this model does not make any assumptions about the nature of the bivariate relationships within the network, unlike parametric models such as copulas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Berkes1">[59]</xref>, and allows for graded activity, unlike the Ising model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Tkacik2">[60]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In all cases, statistics for decoding were calculated from a training set separate from the test set to be decoded, using a “leave-one-out” strategy, in which each short segment (eight stimuli) of activity was decoded using statistics calculated on the basis of all other stimulus presentations in the epoch of interest. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g005">Figure 5c</xref>, decoders were trained either on the same epoch being decoded, using a leave-one-out strategy, or all stimulus presentations in the opposite epoch.</p>
        <p>Decoding error was defined as the absolute difference between the MAP estimate and the actual stimulus presented, measured in degrees. Decoding improvement is change in decoding error, with positive values representing a decrease in error. Decoding improvement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g005">Figure 5</xref> was measured relative to performance of the independent decoder at the first timepoint.</p>

        <title>Clustering</title>
        <p>Clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001236-g008">Figure 8c and 8d</xref>) were initially formed using the normalized cuts graph clustering algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001236-Shi1">[61]</xref> over neuron-pair tuning curve similarity. This was followed by gradient descent to generate groups of uniform size (nine neurons) having maximum within-group similarity. Groups that did not reach a threshold value of within-group similarity were not included in decoding. The group size was made uniform to better compare decoding performance across groups. The number of neurons per group was selected to maximize the difference between the minimum pairwise within-group similarity and the maximum pairwise across-group similarity over all datasets.</p>
        <p>The median distance between pairs of neurons within these functionally defined clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001236.s008">Figure S8</xref>) was used to measure spatial clustering.
