<abstract>
<p>An estimated 2.7 million new HIV-1 infections occurred in 2010. `Treatment-for-prevention’ may strongly prevent HIV-1 transmission. The basic idea is that immediate treatment initiation rapidly decreases virus burden, which reduces the number of transmittable viruses and thereby the probability of infection. However, HIV inevitably develops drug resistance, which leads to virus rebound and nullifies the effect of `treatment-for-prevention’ for the time it remains unrecognized. While timely conducted treatment changes may avert periods of viral rebound, necessary treatment options and diagnostics may be lacking in resource-constrained settings. Within this work, we provide a mathematical platform for comparing different treatment paradigms that can be applied to many medical phenomena. We use this platform to optimize two distinct approaches for the treatment of HIV-1: (i) a diagnostic-guided treatment strategy, based on infrequent and patient-specific diagnostic schedules and (ii) a pro-active strategy that allows treatment adaptation prior to diagnostic ascertainment. Both strategies are compared to current clinical protocols (standard of care and the HPTN052 protocol) in terms of patient health, economic means and reduction in HIV-1 onward transmission exemplarily for South Africa. All therapeutic strategies are assessed using a coarse-grained stochastic model of within-host HIV dynamics and pseudo-codes for solving the respective optimal control problems are provided. Our mathematical model suggests that both optimal strategies (i)-(ii) perform better than the current clinical protocols and no treatment in terms of economic means, life prolongation and reduction of HIV-transmission. The optimal diagnostic-guided strategy suggests rare diagnostics and performs similar to the optimal pro-active strategy. Our results suggest that ‘treatment-for-prevention’ may be further improved using either of the two analyzed treatment paradigms.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>HIV-1 continues to spread globally. Antiviral treatment cannot cure patients, but it slows disease progression and may prevent HIV transmission by decreasing the amount of transmittable viruses in treated individuals. ‘Treatment-for-prevention’ argues for immediate treatment initiation and may reduce transmission by 96% (CI: 73–99%), according to the results of a large clinical study (HPTN052). In order to ensure long-lasting treatment success, early therapy initiation demands more sophisticated treatment strategies &amp; exceeding funds. However, countries facing the highest HIV burden are among the poorest. Within this work, we provide a mathematical framework that allows assessing different treatment paradigms using optimal control theory together with stochastic modelling of within-host viral dynamics and drug resistance development. We use this framework to compute and evaluate two distinct <italic>optimal</italic> long-term treatment strategies for resource-constrained settings: (i) a <bold>diagnostic-guided</bold> and (ii) a <bold>pro-active</bold> treatment <bold>strategy</bold>. The cost of a strategy is evaluated from a national economic perspective, valuating a severe patient health status in terms of an economic loss. The <italic>optimal</italic> strategies are compared with current clinical treatment protocols and <bold>no treatment</bold> in terms of costs, life expectation and reduction of secondary cases. Our simulations indicate that the <bold>pro-active</bold> treatment <bold>strategy</bold> performs comparably to the <bold>diagnostic-guided</bold> treatment <bold>strategy</bold>. Both strategies perform better than current clinical protocols, suggesting directions for improvement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>HIV-1 infection remains one of the major global health challenges with an estimated 33 million infected and a continuing spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref001">1</xref>]. Currently, an efficient vaccine remains to be developed, while at the same time the complete elimination of replication-competent virus within the host can not be achieved due to the persistence of the virus in inducible, latent cellular reservoirs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref003">3</xref>], as well as insufficient pharmacological suppression of actively replicating virus in some anatomical/cellular reservoirs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref005">5</xref>]. However, the current situation urges for methods that could bring the epidemic to a halt, or possibly end it. Currently, the most promising strategies are based on the use of antiviral drugs:
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref009">9</xref>] aims to protect uninfected individuals ‘at risk’ by decreasing the probability of infection upon virus exposure, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref010">10</xref>]. PrEP may however be too costly to be broadly implemented in resource-poor countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref011">11</xref>].</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Currently, the decision to initiate treatment against HIV is largely guided by CD4+ cell levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref013">13</xref>]. However, the viral load, which is the primary determinant of infectiousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref015">15</xref>], may be very high within the time-window between HIV infection and initiation of treatment. ‘Treatment for prevention’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>] aims to put infected individuals on therapy as early as possible. This can reduce the infectiousness of a patient by decreasing within-host virus levels, which reduces the amount of transmitted viruses per contact and the probability of infection upon exposure. Analysis of the only completed clinical study to date, HPTN052 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>], estimated that ‘treatment for prevention’ may reduce the number of <italic>linked</italic> HIV-1 transmissions by 96% and the number of <italic>total</italic> HIV-1 transmissions by 89% relative to delayed treatment initiation and subsequently it was nominated as the “breakthrough of the year 2011” by the <italic>Science</italic> magazine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref017">17</xref>].</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In the aftermath of the HPTN052 trial, the cost-efficacy of ‘treatment for prevention’ was analyzed by many mathematical modeling approaches (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref018">18</xref>]). One problem is that most of these approaches focused solely on the epidemic level and did not model drug resistance development within the hosts, which indirectly assumes that the efficacy of ‘treatment for prevention’ is constant over time. However, because viral transmission is strongly correlated with viral levels in the transmitting individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref021">21</xref>], it is reasonable to assume that also the efficacy of ‘treatment for prevention’ is intimately connected with viral suppression. One major challenge during HIV treatment lies in the virus’ tendency to develop drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref022">22</xref>], which in turn can lead to virus rebound and promote HIV transmission for the time it remains unrecognized. An earlier treatment initiation may thus demand an improved therapeutic strategy, that allows long-term control of virus replication (beyond the typical duration of a clinical trial). While sophisticated patient monitoring and timely treatment changes may allow to minimize windows of unrecognized viral breakthrough, they require significant monetary funds, good infrastructure, diagnostic facilities and the availability of alternative treatment options. Only few of these may be available in resource-constrained countries, where the requirement of resources may strongly dominate the possibility to implement a reasonable ‘treatment for prevention’ strategy. Obviously, scaling ‘treatment for prevention’ requires careful examination of various aspects and a policy maker should strike a proper balance between societal and individual perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>This work addresses the scaling of ‘treatment for prevention’ by suggesting <italic>optimal</italic> treatment strategies for the long-term control of HIV within its host (as recommended by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref024">24</xref>]). <italic>Optimality</italic> will be defined from a <italic>national economic perspective</italic>, taking into account that a diseased individual implies an economic loss. By considering the national economic perspective, we do not evaluate what <italic>should</italic> be done, but rather what is <italic>already worthwhile</italic>. However, we also evaluate the derived <italic>optimal</italic> strategies from an individual perspective and in terms of their utility in prevention, i.e. whether a strategy prolongs the life of an infected person and whether the risk of HIV onward transmission is reduced.</p>
<p>We hereby focus on two distinct approaches to handle treatment decisions: The first assumes that treatment decisions (i.e. when to change therapy) are made on an <italic>individual</italic> basis, guided by infrequent diagnostics (referred to as <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>). This represents a medical scenario in which a treating physician decides based on the diagnosed status of the patient that he encounters. The second approach suggests pro-active treatment decisions (referred to as <bold>pro-active strategy</bold>), i.e. does not require diagnostic ascertainment of the patients’ disease status. The two approaches are modeled and solved by two distinct mathematical frameworks. The former is addressed using the recently developed framework of ‘Markov Decision Processes with Rare State Observations’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref025">25</xref>]: For each disease state, it computes the optimal treatment and the next time of medical diagnostics, minimizing viral burden as well as treatment- and diagnostic costs. The latter approach (the <bold>pro-active strategy</bold>) is modeled as an open-loop switched system, where the decision to change the treatment depends on the initial disease state of the patient and the anticipated, (treatment-)induced stochastic dynamics up to some time <italic>t</italic>. The later strategy allows to switch treatment <italic>before</italic> drug resistance is detectable in the individual (pro-active) and may be easier to implement in resource-constrained settings, where poor infrastructure and the costs of diagnostics limit their applicability. By assessing these two distinct frameworks side-by-side, we can rigorously evaluate the different treatment paradigms in terms of their optimality. Algorithms to solve these problems were developed and are stated in the supplementary materials.</p>
<p>Several other groups have suggested <italic>optimal</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref028">28</xref>] or <italic>sub-optimal</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref030">30</xref>] treatment strategies to mitigate drug resistance in HIV-1. All authors treated the underlying system deterministically, which fails to capture the intrinsic stochastic nature of HIV drug resistance development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref031">31</xref>] and the time-scales on which drug resistance develops. None of the previous work focused on HIV prevention, and neither work questioned the analyzed treatment philosophy, either focusing on pro-active treatment switching strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref030">30</xref>], <italic>or</italic> diagnostic-driven strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref029">29</xref>]. In contrast, we used a stochastic model of HIV long-term dynamics after drug application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref025">25</xref>] to more realistically capture the underlying dynamics. Also, we evaluate different assumptions for the controllability of the disease dynamics, by evaluating the two different optimal control frameworks, which allows for an objective assessment of alternative treatment philosophies.</p>
<p>The manuscript will be organized as follows: We will extend- and parameterize the model introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref025">25</xref>] for our needs. After recapitulating essential theory for the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>, we introduce the mathematical concepts behind the <bold>pro-active strategy</bold>, solve both optimal control problems and evaluate them with respect to monetary costs, patient survival and reduction of onward transmission. All algorithms that we developed to solve the optimal control problems will be provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s002">S2</xref> Text for the interested reader.</p>

<p>Within this work, we investigate optimal treatment strategies <italic>in silico</italic> by formulating- and solving two optimal control problems referred to as the optimal <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> and the optimal <bold>pro-active strategy</bold>. In general, an optimal control problem requires a mathematical model of the controlled process and a performance- or cost criterion. Likewise, our problem will be broken down into these ingredients.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Model of Controlled HIV Dynamics</title>
<p>The two addressed optimal control approaches share an identical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g001">Fig 1</xref>) that reflects the short-term dynamics of viral decay- and rebound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g002">Fig 2</xref>), as well as the stochastic HIV long-term dynamics after drug application, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Within this work, we put a focus on viral kinetics and will only indirectly relate to the patient’s health. This is because we are interested in ‘treatment for prevention’ and particularly its efficacy in decreasing onward transmission, which is correlated with the viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref021">21</xref>] and not necessarily with the immune status of the HIV infected patient.</p>

<title>State space</title>
<p>HIV can be successfully suppressed if drug resistance does not develop. Thus, any model that aims to represent the long-term HIV dynamics upon treatment should include drug resistance development. The process of drug resistance development denotes an intrinsically stochastic process, which is determined by random mutation events (point mutations, recombinations). Long term HIV-dynamics in the context of drug treatment may therefore be dominated by these intrinsically stochastic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref031">31</xref>], necessitating stochastic modeling approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref034">34</xref>]. The fundamental evolution equation for intrinsically stochastic kinetics is the chemical master equation (CME). Each state described by the CME comprises a combination of discrete numbers of individuals of the respective species (e.g. viral strains), resulting in state space dimensions ℕ<sub>0</sub>×ℕ<sub>0</sub>×…×ℕ<sub>0</sub>, i.e. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref036">36</xref>]. A major mathematical drawback is the fact that the CME cannot be solved directly due to this complexity. Therefore, a modeler can either approximate the solution of the CME by Monte-Carlo schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref037">37</xref>], aim at hybrid approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref040">40</xref>], which can yield particular characteristics of the CME, or perform a state space reduction (lumping). In this manuscript, we adapt a model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref025">25</xref>] that relates to the latter approach. For this model we can solve the coarse-grained CME directly when computing optimal control strategies.</p>
<p>In brief, the HIV model contains four lumped viral copy number states for each of the four virus strains. The set of states 𝒮 thus has dimension 4<sup>4</sup> = 256 states + 1 [patient death]: If the respective virus type is absent, we denote the respective state by 0, if it is present in low copy numbers, i.e., for &lt; 50 virus copies/mL blood (detection limit of assays used in the clinic), the respective state is denoted by ℓ, for medium copy numbers between 50 and 4000 virus copies/mL blood we denote the lumped states by <italic>m</italic> and for high copy numbers with more than 4000 virus copies/mL blood, it is <italic>h</italic>. This coarse graining is in line with the levels of virus produced in the distinct cellular reservoirs of HIV, see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref034">34</xref>]. The following four viral strains <italic>M</italic> are considered: a strain WT (wild type) that is susceptible to all treatment lines, a strain R1 which is susceptible to a second treatment line, but unaffected by (resistant to) the first treatment line, a strain R2 that is susceptible to the first treatment line, but unaffected by the second, and a highly resistant strain HR, which is resistant to all treatments. In order to describe a virologic state <italic>x</italic> we choose a compact vector notation of the form

<title>Control actions</title>
<p>The actions describe ‘what the controller can do to influence the system’. In terms of HIV therapy, a physician can e.g. choose what treatment(-line) to apply and when to change it. In resource-constrained settings, only few treatment lines are available. In the case of South Africa these may include a first- and a second-line therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref013">13</xref>].

Note, that we consider only the following transitions: WT ↔ R1, WT ↔ R2, R1 ↔ HR and R2 ↔ HR, which is motivated by the fact that a direct transition from WT ↔ HR is very unlikely, because the genetic distance between the two viral strains is too large to be overcome at once.</p>

<title>Parameter estimation</title>
<p>In order to estimate model parameters, we proceeded in a step-wise approach: We first estimated parameters related to viral decay (<italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>, <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) and then used these estimates in order to estimate parameters related to viral growth in the absence of treatment (<italic>k</italic><sub>ℓ,∅</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic>,∅</sub>), using data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref045">45</xref>].

<p>Using the full model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we estimated parameters relating to the clinical drug efficacy of both treatment lines <italic>η</italic>(<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, {WT, R2}) &amp; <italic>η</italic>(<italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>, {WT, R1}) and rates of drug resistance emergence <italic>μ</italic><sub>R1,∅</sub> and <italic>μ</italic><sub>R2,∅</sub>.</p>
<p>In analogy with the South African treatment guidelines, we assumed that the first-line therapy consists of efavirenz (EFV) + zidovudine (AZT) + lamivudine (3TC). Long-term studies usually evaluate the probability of viral suppression, which is defined in terms of undetectable virus loads (≤ 50 viral RNA/mL). Translated to our model, this refers to the condition in which all viral mutants are in state ℓ or absent; i.e. <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004200.e018"><mml:math id="M18" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo minsize="1.2" maxsize="1.2" stretchy="true">[</mml:mo> <mml:mo>≤</mml:mo> <mml:mo>ℓ</mml:mo> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mspace width="0.167em"/><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo> <mml:mo>ℓ</mml:mo> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mspace width="0.167em"/><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo> <mml:mo>ℓ</mml:mo> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mspace width="0.167em"/><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo> <mml:mo>ℓ</mml:mo> <mml:mo minsize="1.2" maxsize="1.2" stretchy="true">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which we denote by the set of states by 𝓛.

<title>Cost assignment</title>
<p>Public health initiatives are often constrained by available funds. The countries with the highest HIV burdened are also among the poorest and financial commitments from donors have stagnated or decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref054">54</xref>] in recent years. Thus, the requirement of resources may strongly dominate the policy making process in a resource-constrained context. Because of these conditions, we designed the performance criterion from a national economic perspective.</p>
<p>The performance criterion valuates the induced system dynamics and controls, i.e. the viral status of the patient and the costs of treatment. We will consider both the direct costs due to the applied treatments <italic>c</italic><sub>𝒜</sub> and indirect costs due to the virologic/health status of a patient <italic>c</italic><sub>𝒮</sub>. Our analysis will be conducted from a country’s public health-care/monetary perspective. Therefore, the costs related to the different states <italic>c</italic><sub>𝒮</sub> will be computed based on the average productivity loss pL(<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>) times the average daily monetary contribution of one individual (assessed in terms of the daily per capita GDP), i.e. <italic>c</italic><sub>𝒮</sub>(<italic>x</italic>) = pL(<italic>x</italic>)·GDP, with <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004200.e019"><mml:math id="M19" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>pL</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:mi>max</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:mtext>pL</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which implies that the total virus load reflects the cost of the individual infection status at any point in time. Death is interpreted in terms of a complete loss in productivity. Furthermore, we take diagnostic costs into account, which applies only in the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>, the <bold>standard of care</bold> and the <bold>HPTN052 protocol</bold> (the latter two are modeled for comparison). The cost of diagnostics will be set to a fixed value and closely reflect the cost of a drug resistance test for the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> and the cost of a virus load determination in the case of the <bold>standard of care</bold> and the <bold>HPTN052 protocol</bold>.</p>
<p>The integration of momentary/running costs yields the objective function (performance criterion) for the optimal control problem. While performance criteria generally depend on the particular application at hand, we decided to consider expected discounted costs on an infinite time horizon. We chose an infinite time horizon, because HIV treatment does not have a previously known endpoint (i.e. time of death). At the same time, a differentiated weighting of immediate and later costs is reasonable due to an upper limitation of life expectancy and aspects of inflation. Costs arising at time <italic>t</italic> &gt; 0 are thus weighted by a discount factor 0 &lt; <italic>e</italic><sup>−<italic>λt</italic></sup> &lt; 1. In this regard, the concrete choice of a discount factor <italic>λ</italic> will depend on the presumed annual inflation in the considered setting. For all calculations, we consider the inflation rate in South Africa as a representative of a resource-constrained country with a large HIV burden, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t002">Table 2</xref>. The discount factor also guarantees convergence of the cost functional and therefore allows the numerical solution of the optimal control problem.</p>

<p>In the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>, treatment can only be changed after a (costly) diagnostic test has been made to determine the virologic state of the patient (i.e. the drug resistance profile).

However, instead of considering regular diagnostic intervals, we consider <italic>patient-specific</italic> diagnostic intervals.

<title>Numerical Solution</title>
<p>Solving optimal control problems is generally computation intense and may not always be achievable. Our two optimal control scenarios require different algorithms for their solution.</p>
<p>For computing the optimal <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>, we used an adapted policy iteration algorithm, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s001">S1 Text</xref> for details.</p>
<p>In order to numerically compute the optimal <bold>pro-active strategy</bold>, we introduce a dynamic programming technique in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s002">S2 Text</xref>, which was developed for the considered performance criterion (expected discounted costs over an infinite time horizon). It has some similarity with the algorithm introduced by Hernandez-Vargas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref027">27</xref>], which, however, considers a different performance criterion (only terminal cost).</p>
<p>Both algorithms were implemented in MATLAB Version 8 and parallelized, where applicable. For the dynamic programming technique in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s002">S2 Text</xref> we used the state of art solver cplex from the IBM ILOG CPLEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref056">56</xref>] Optimization Studio to solve embedded linear programs.</p>

<title>Optimal Treatment Strategy</title>
<p>The optimal <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s006">S1 Table</xref>. In brief, for the considered parameters (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t002">2</xref>), it is suggested to use the first-line treatment <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub> in all states, except those where the virus is resistant against treatment <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, but susceptible to <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>. In the later case treatment line <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub> is suggested. In line with this treatment recommendation, patient monitoring is only suggested as long as the patient is infected with drug-susceptible (“wild-type”) virus. If the patient has a <italic>h</italic>igh or <italic>m</italic>edium virus load, the next diagnostic test should be within 25 days, if the patient has a ℓow/non-detectable virus load, after 152 days.</p>
<p>These results may indicate that the cost for diagnostics is too high in relation to the economic benefit resulting from more close monitoring and informed treatment adaptation (this will be discussed later in the <italic>Discussion</italic>). An exemplary trajectory that highlights the treatment strategy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. The blue line indicates a <italic>patient-specific</italic> trajectory. The filled black marks indicate the times when a diagnostic test is performed and the background shading indicates the applied treatment (white: <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, gray shading: <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>). In the example, the patient initially has a high copy number <italic>h</italic> of wild type (WT) virus, while none of the drug resistant viruses are present.

The remaining viral states belong to ℳ. One can nicely see that after approximately 260 days, maximum viral suppression may be achieved in the sense that the probability to have undetectable virus load (𝓛) is maximal (64.19%), while the patient may have intermediate viral loads ℳ with 15.57% probability and high viral loads ℋ with only 14.40% probability (the probability of death is 5.84%). After this time, it becomes more likely to fail treatment, as indicated by an increase in states ℳ and ℋ relative to 𝓛. We also assessed the sensitivity of the optimal <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> to variations in parameter values and found it to be fairly insensitive to parameter perturbations, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s003">S3 Text</xref>.

The <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> does not comprise diagnostic tests, whereas the protocol for the current <bold>standard of care</bold> (S.O.C.), as well as the protocol used in the <bold>HPTN052</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>], which we simulate for comparison, require viral load measurements. Currently, the expensive resistance tests are not part of the protocol for the <bold>standard of care</bold>, nor were they used for treatment decisions in <bold>HPTN052</bold>. The protocol for S.O.C. recommends changing treatment, if viral load (which is measured at month 6 and then every 12 months) is detectable and confirmed in a follow up testing after 2 months. The protocol for the <bold>HPTN052</bold> trial recommends changing treatment, if two consecutive viral load measurements were greater than 1000 copies/mL, 16 weeks after treatment initiation. Viral load was measured at week 2, at month 1, 2, 3 after treatment initiation and then every 3 month. The cost of virologic testing is roughly 30 US$ per test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref058">58</xref>]. In contrast to S.O.C. and <bold>HPTN052</bold>, the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> requires drug resistance testing. We set the cost of the diagnostics for the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> to 200 US$ per test, in line with the recent literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref059">59</xref>].</p>

<title>Expected Reduction in Secondary Cases</title>
<p>Besides the primary goal of improving the life of the HIV patient, ‘treatment for prevention’ has gained interest in recent years. ‘Treatment for prevention’ strategies reduce onward transmission of the virus by reducing the infectiousness of HIV positive individuals. In order to measure the efficacy of the treatment strategies in preventing HIV-1 transmission, we estimated the incidence rate per 100 person-years associated with each HIV lumped state (ℓ, <italic>m</italic>, <italic>h</italic>) from a meta-analysis by Attia et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref014">14</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s005">S5 Text</xref>). The meta-analysis summarizes the outcome of 11 clinical studies on HIV-1 transmission in heterosexual sero-discordant couples, primarily from Africa.</p>

<p>We computed the expected reduction of secondary cases for different strategies taking either <bold>no treatment</bold> or the current <bold>standard of care</bold> as the reference strategy. In comparison to <bold>no treatment</bold>, the maximal reduction of secondary cases for the <bold>pro-active</bold> -, the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>, the <bold>HPTN052 protocol</bold> and S.O.C. are achieved roughly 1.5–3 years after treatment initiation with values of 86%, 87%, 82% and 79% respectively, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. The relative reduction of secondary cases per survivor for the <bold>diagnostic-guided</bold> and the <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> are very similar, with an increase for the first 2 years, followed by a slow decline (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t005">Table 5</xref>). The relative reduction of secondary cases per survivor for the <bold>HPTN052 protocol</bold> is slightly better than that of S.O.C, with a tendency to decline over time, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t005">Table 5</xref>. Note, that the computed relative reduction of secondary cases with the <bold>HPTN052 protocol</bold> was 82% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t005">Table 5</xref>), which is slightly lower than the reported relative reduction of transmission events in the actual HPTN052 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>] (reduction of 96% of linked and 89% of total transmission events). We have discussed reasons for this apparent under-prediction later in the manuscript. The difference between the optimal strategies (<bold>diagnostic-guided</bold> and the <bold>pro-active strategy</bold>) and S.O.C. becomes evident, when looking at the relative risk reduction by the optimal treatment strategies in relation to S.O.C. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. The reduction in secondary cases per survivor by the optimal strategies in comparison to S.O.C. is highest at the beginning and then slowly decreases over time.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main aim of this work was to develop a rigorous mathematical framework that allows to compare different treatment paradigms in terms of monetary costs, treatment benefit and efficacy for ‘treatment for prevention’. It was previously stated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref060">60</xref>], that the durability of ‘treatment for prevention’ should be assessed. Our simulations over a long time horizon (up to 5000 days/13.7 years) indicate that the effect of ‘treatment for prevention’ is significant and remains relatively stable beyond the time horizon typically assessed in clinical studies, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t005">Table 5</xref>, and that it may even be improved. We estimated that a <bold>standard of care</bold> therapy in e.g. South Africa can achieve a 66–79% reduction of HIV-1 onward transmission, in comparison to delivering <bold>no treatment</bold>. We also implemented the <bold>HPTN052 protocol</bold>, as stated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>] and predicted that it would achieve up to 82% reduction of HIV-1 transmission, being more effective than the current <bold>standard of care</bold>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">Fig 6B</xref>.</p>
<p>Statistical assessment of the actual HPTN052 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>] yielded estimates for the relative reduction of transmission of 96% for linked transmission and 89% for any transmission. Our simulated <bold>HPTN052 protocol</bold> yielded a 82% reduction of onwards transmission, which is within the confidence range of the reported estimates (CI: 73–99% for linked transmission and CI: 68–96% for any transmission) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>]. Note, that only one linked transmission event (1/1585 person-years) was observed in the early therapy arm of HPTN052 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>], giving rise to the statistical uncertainty in the reported estimate. Nevertheless, our simulations may under-predict the efficacy of HPTN052 due to several factors:
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>The reported treatment efficacy in the HPTN052 study was higher than predicted by our model: Virologic failure was only observed in 5% of participants in the early-therapy group of HPTN052, possibly explaining the difference between the outcome of the simulation vs. the clinical trial.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Despite only 5% failing to suppress the virus in the HPTN052 study, 66% initiated a second line therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>], meaning that a significant proportion of patients switched treatment <italic>before/without</italic> virologic failure. In our simulations of the <bold>HPTN052 protocol</bold>, patients only switched treatment when they showed signs of virologic failure. However, one may speculate that these treatment switches <italic>before/without</italic> virologic failure may have an impact on the long-term viral suppression that could be similar to a pro-active treatment switch.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The primary measurable endpoint of the HPTN052 study was the infection of the sero-discordant partner. Onward transmissions to other individuals could not be quantified for obvious reasons.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>While a number of trials are now underway to confirm the results of HPTN052, see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref062">62</xref>], our <italic>in silico</italic> approach specifically addresses the need for an improved treatment strategy, particularly taking affordability into account, which suggests strategies that are suitable for scaling up.</p>
<p>Our work may indicate that if ‘treatment for prevention’ is scaled up and implemented using the current <bold>standard of care</bold> treatment strategy, its efficacy may not be as high as expected from HPTN052. Unlike in HPTN052, where monitoring of treatment success (viral suppression) and timely execution of treatment changes were realized, in resource-constrained countries close patient monitoring is currently not implemented in a routine setting and may be difficult to realize due to infrastructural and economic requirements.</p>
<p>Two alternative strategies for the immediate initiation of therapy were assessed in our work that take into account the mentioned limitations. Both suggested strategies (the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> and the <bold>pro-active strategy</bold>) yielded better results in our simulations in terms of the reduction of onward transmission (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t005">Table 5</xref>) at a lower price (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t003">Table 3</xref>). Both <italic>optimal</italic> strategies could yield a 72–87% reduction in HIV onward transmission in comparison to <bold>no treatment</bold>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t005">Table 5</xref>. In comparison to the <bold>standard of care</bold>, we estimated that the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> and the <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> could yield another 33–38% reduction of onward transmission after 2 years of treatment, but the advantages of the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> and the <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> over the <bold>standard of care</bold> slowly declined over time, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. This indicates that both <italic>optimal</italic> strategies have a particular strength in reducing early transmissions (shortly after treatment initiation) in comparison to the current <bold>standard of care</bold>. This may be of particular utility, if transmission occurred primarily during early infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref064">64</xref>]. In our work, we did not take behavioral factors into account, which would lead to a time-dependency of the infection rate. Rather, we assumed that the infection rate 𝕀ℝ(<italic>x</italic>) is constant over time, but dependent on the total virus load as reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref021">21</xref>]. If transmission would primarily take place during an early infection, the advantages of the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> and the <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> over the <bold>standard of care</bold> would be even more pronounced than indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">Fig 6B</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>optimal</italic> <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> suggested <italic>patient-specific</italic> diagnostics, i.e. dependent on the patient’s virologic status (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s006">S1 Table</xref>), unlike fixed intervals as in S.O.C, or the protocol stated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref016">16</xref>]. In summary, the <italic>optimal</italic> <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> suggests to take frequent diagnostics (≈ every month) if the patient is infected with a <italic>h</italic>igh or <italic>m</italic>edium number of treatment-susceptible virus and less frequent (≈ every 5 month) diagnostics if the patient is infected with a ℓow/undetectable number of virus. No diagnostics are recommended for the remaining virologic states. Altogether, a very sparse diagnostic schedule for individual patients is suggested. Previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref025">25</xref>] indicated that price reductions for the diagnostic tests would yield a better patient-outcome, which indicates that available drugs may not be utilized optimally in resource-poor settings, because diagnostics are currently too expensive. Of note is the fact that albeit treatment being available at very low expense (due to negotiations by the Clinton Foundation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref065">65</xref>]), diagnostics may not be.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we suspected that allowing treatment change only <italic>after</italic> diagnostic confirmation of treatment failure (i.e. some time after drug resistance has occurred) may limit future treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref034">34</xref>]. Since the <italic>optimal</italic> <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold> suggested rare diagnostics, and because it only allows to change treatment <italic>after</italic> resistance is detectable, we evaluated <bold>pro-active switching strategies</bold>. Note, that pro-active treatment switching strategies tested in the clinic increased virologic suppression and lowered rates of drug resistance emergence in HIV-1, when compared to conventional strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref066">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref067">67</xref>]. Similar strategies are also used against bacterial infections and cancers.</p>
<p>The computed <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> suggests a single treatment change <italic>without</italic> prior ascertainment of the viral status within a treated patient. Surprisingly, this strategy could yield comparable outcomes in terms of monetary costs, patient health and reduction of onward transmission, see Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t005">5</xref> and Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">6</xref>. Our work thus indicates that <bold>pro-active strategies</bold>, may be as effective as diagnostically-driven ones, when diagnostics are expensive or inaccessible. Note, that unlike other <italic>optimal</italic> control approaches, i.e. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref028">28</xref>] that suggest infinitely fast switching between regimens to mitigate drug resistance emergence, our predicted <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> actually only recommends a single treatment change, which is clinically more realistic. We also analyzed the sensitivity of the <bold>pro-active strategies</bold> with respect to the timing of this switch (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The graphic illustrates, that the switch is optimal after 14 days, however the difference in the performance measure is marginal, as long as the treatment switch is performed before ≈ 30 days (1 month) after treatment initiation.</p>

<p>Obviously, pragmatic and clinical considerations need to be taken into account to translate our results into practice. Also, several assumptions have been made, which require careful evaluation. For example, we used a very coarse-grained model of HIV within-host dynamics, which was required to enable the numerical computation of optimal controls, particularly for the closed-loop system employed in the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>. Most models of viral dynamics, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref069">69</xref>], were developed to accurately predict short-term viral dynamics after drug application and are unable to predict virologic failure after long time intervals, in contrast to our coarse-grained model, which was developed and parameterized in order to predict short-term viral dynamics as well as virologic failure after very long time-intervals, see e.g. Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g003">3</xref>. It is therefore more suitable than existing models in estimating the long-term response to antiviral treatment. However, in the future we will focus on developing more elaborated HIV-models and on algorithms to solve the control problem for the chemical master equation directly, without state-space lumping. Note, that other computationally efficient numerical approaches, such as model predictive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref030">30</xref>], could be used to approximate the optimal treatment strategies. However, there is no guarantee that the computed control using these approaches will be <italic>optimal</italic>.</p>
<p>In our approach, we modeled treatment change as a switched system, which neglects the pharmacokinetics of the distinct drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref070">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref072">72</xref>] and may only indirectly reflect drug adherence in an average population (drug efficacy <italic>η</italic> is a constant term in our model). Neglecting pharmacokinetics may, however, be a justifiable step in this modeling exercise, because of the considered time-scales (on the order of years), and also because optimizing e.g. drug adherence was not an objective of this study. However, if the main interest is for example in optimizing the switch between two treatment lines by optimal dosing in order to prevent time frames of insufficient viral suppression or drug over-exposure, or to include <italic>patient-specific</italic> or time-dependent drug adherence, we advise to consider a different control system, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref073">73</xref>]. Within such a framework, monitoring (e.g. viral load assessment) may also be incorporated as a tool to assess individual drug adherence and to allocate resources to improve it.</p>
<p>We did not explicitly consider costs related to contraindications caused by the treatment. For example, the second treatment line <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub> may be less tolerable. Mathematically, this can be modeled in terms of increased treatment costs for <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>, in comparison to the first treatment line <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>. In order to test the sensitivity of the optimal <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> to this parameter, we conducted the necessary computations in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004200.s003">S3 Text</xref> and found that the computed strategy was fairly insensitive to changes in treatment costs. This may indicate that the benefits of the treatment switch outweigh these potential shortcomings.</p>
<p>Also, we did not include screening costs or the costs of the initial virologic assessment, thus our calculations refer to the public health costs that accrue <italic>from the start</italic> of HIV treatment. These costs will, however, only enter as a constant to each of the tested strategies and will not change the results beyond the addition of this constant to the values stated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t003">Table 3</xref>. Additional costs (personnel, infrastructure, transportation) may come along with diagnostic assessments. It is likely that hidden costs for diagnostics are substantial. With a higher cost of diagnosis, the <bold>pro-active strategy</bold> may outperform the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>, which may suggest an even less frequent diagnostic schedule, supporting our claim that current diagnostics may be too expensive to be appropriately used.</p>
<p>We used the price of a drug resistance test (<italic>k</italic><sub>dia</sub> ≈ 200 US$ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref059">59</xref>]) to account for diagnostics in the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>. This had the following reason: Current guidelines recommend to measure the total virus load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref013">13</xref>] and to switch treatment, if, based on this partial information, virologic failure is anticipated. As reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref057">57</xref>], this may lead to unnecessary treatment switches. In contrast, a resistance test directly informs the physician about the necessity of treatment change. Mathematically, partial information, i.e. the <italic>total virus load</italic>, would lead to a distinct control framework, namely Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref074">74</xref>], which are extremely challenging to solve, particularly for larger models like the one used herein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In POMDPs, partial information may be mapped into a ‘<italic>believed</italic>’ full virologic status, for example <italic>observing</italic> a <italic>h</italic>igh total virus load <italic>may</italic> be due to some resistance development, e.g. the viral state <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004200.e074"><mml:math id="M74" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo minsize="1.2" maxsize="1.2" stretchy="true">[</mml:mo> <mml:mo>ℓ</mml:mo> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mspace width="0.167em"/><mml:mi>h</mml:mi> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mspace width="0.167em"/><mml:mn>0</mml:mn> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mspace width="0.167em"/><mml:mn>0</mml:mn> <mml:mo minsize="1.2" maxsize="1.2" stretchy="true">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with some probability. However, it is hard for us formalize the physicians intuition (i.e. the relation between observation, belief and truth) regarding this ‘mapping’ of partial measurements to viral states <italic>x</italic>.</p>
<p>As a primary outcome of our modeling exercise, we estimated the expected <italic>relative</italic> number of secondary infections prevented (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004200.t005">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004200.g006">Fig 6</xref>); -unlike many other approaches (summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004200.ref018">18</xref>]), which take the <italic>absolute</italic> number of secondary cases into account. Estimating <italic>absolute</italic> numbers of secondary cases would require to model complex behaviors, i.e. sexual relationships, etc. over time, for which we do not have data for validation, nor was it the main focus of the current work. This also prevents us from predicting the course of the epidemic or deriving its reproductive number <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> in relation to distinct treatment strategies. However, the primary aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of different treatment strategies, which is nicely quantified in terms of the expected <italic>relative</italic> number of secondary infections prevented. Note, that this relative estimate requires no assumptions on the underlying transmission dynamics, except that it assumes that these dynamics are similar for a tested strategy versus its comparator.</p>
<p>In addition to insights in HIV ‘treatment for prevention’ strategies, the developed mathematical/control theoretic framework may already be applicable to many medical phenomena. Further developments may improve its applicability to even more complex processes, which can be accurately described by intrinsically stochastic dynamics. For example, the open-loop optimal control approach (used to determine the optimal <bold>pro-active</bold> strategy) may be turned into a closed-loop system, if diagnostics are taken from time-to-time to determine the viral state of a patient, i.e. <italic>p</italic>[<italic>x</italic>](<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>). Also, the closed-loop system that requires state determination (the <bold>diagnostic-guided strategy</bold>) may be combined with the open-loop system in order to allow for pro-active treatment changes in between diagnostic assessments.</p>
