        <p>Cytokinesis is powered by the contraction of actomyosin filaments within the newly assembled contractile ring. Microtubules are a spindle component that is essential for the induction of cytokinesis. This induction could use central spindle and/or astral microtubules to stimulate cortical contraction around the spindle equator (equatorial stimulation). Alternatively, or in addition, induction could rely on astral microtubules to relax the polar cortex (polar relaxation). To investigate the relationship between microtubules, cortical stiffness, and contractile ring assembly, we used different configurations of microtubules to manipulate the distribution of actin in living silkworm spermatocytes. Mechanically repositioned, noninterdigitating microtubules can induce redistribution of actin at any region of the cortex by locally excluding cortical actin filaments. This cortical flow of actin promotes regional relaxation while increasing tension elsewhere (normally at the equatorial cortex). In contrast, repositioned interdigitating microtubule bundles use a novel mechanism to induce local stimulation of contractility anywhere within the cortex; at the antiparallel plus ends of central spindle microtubules, actin aggregates are rapidly assembled de novo and transported laterally to the equatorial cortex. Relaxation depends on microtubule dynamics but not on RhoA activity, whereas stimulation depends on RhoA activity but is largely independent of microtubule dynamics. We conclude that polar relaxation and equatorial stimulation mechanisms redundantly supply actin for contractile ring assembly, thus increasing the fidelity of cleavage.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>In animal cells, the last step of cell division, or cytokinesis, requires the action of a contractile ring—composed largely of actin and myosin filaments—that cleaves the cell in two. Before the cell divides, it first duplicates its genome and separates the chromosomes into the two newly forming daughter cells, a task carried out by a structure called the spindle apparatus, which is composed mostly of long polymers called microtubules. The site of cleavage must occur between the segregating chromosomes—at the spindle equator—to ensure that each cell receives the proper number of chromosomes. In addition to separating the chromosomes, microtubules are also essential for inducing cytokinesis—but how they do this is controversial. For example, the “polar relaxation” hypothesis proposes that the astral microtubules, which radiate outward, cause contractile elements to flow from the polar cortex toward the equator, resulting in furrowing. In contrast, the “equatorial stimulation” hypothesis proposes that the spindle microtubules directly stimulate cleavage exclusively at the equator. Using a novel approach, we demonstrate that both mechanisms are in fact functioning together to recruit actin filaments to the nascent ring, providing redundancy that increases fidelity. Specifically, we were able to mechanically alter the distribution of actin filaments in living, dividing cells by using a microscopic needle to manipulate microtubules while perturbing the cytoskeleton with chemical compounds. Our high-resolution microscopy data advance the understanding of both proposed mechanisms. We also documented a novel, microtubule-based mechanism for transporting actin aggregates to the equatorial cortex. These results help to resolve a long-standing dispute concerning this fundamental cellular process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The contractile ring is a dynamic, actomyosin-based structure whose constriction generates a cleavage furrow, ultimately producing two daughter cells. To ensure accurate distribution of chromosomes to each cell, the location of the division plane and the timing of cleavage must be tightly regulated to coordinate with chromosomal segregation. In animal cells, this coordination is mediated by the spindle apparatus, which both segregates the chromosomes during anaphase and signals the cortex as to where and when the contractile ring should be assembled (reviewed in, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b004">4</xref>]). In addition to its structural components, the ring contains numerous other proteins, some of which are thought to recruit or retain ring components, while others function as regulatory or signaling molecules. For example, the GTPase RhoA and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor help regulate polymerization of actin and myosin within the ring, thus promoting its constriction (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b005">5</xref>]). Some proteins are localized both to the central spindle and the equatorial cortex in a temporally dynamic manner. It is not known whether these proteins represent independent pools or whether the proteins diffuse or are somehow transported between locations.</p>
      <p>Spindle microtubules are known to play a critical role in specifying the cleavage plane in animal cells. Evidence from divergent organisms shows that the cleavage furrow can be initiated at the spindle equator by astral microtubules, central spindle microtubules, or both (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b001">1</xref>]). Furthermore, microtubules have been shown to be the only structural constituent of the spindle apparatus required for furrow induction, regardless of their original location within the spindle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b006">6</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether microtubules induce furrow formation by mechanisms of polar relaxation and/or equatorial stimulation of the cell cortex (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b007">7</xref>]).</p>
      <p>The polar relaxation model, as originally proposed by Wolpert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b008">8</xref>], postulates that inhibitory signals are sent from astral microtubules to the polar cortex to decrease cortical tension locally. Computer simulations indicate that high microtubule density at the poles may produce the highest surface tension at the equator, where the contractile ring forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b010">10</xref>]. In sea urchin eggs, just before cytokinesis, tensile forces become elevated globally, and thus relaxation of tension at the poles may lead to furrow formation at the equator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b012">12</xref>]. Furthermore, in cells with depolymerized or genetically shortened microtubules, the overall cortical contractility is higher, albeit disorganized (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b015">15</xref>]). In theory, microtubules could induce polar relaxation by a number of different mechanisms. Microtubules could inhibit assembly (or promote disassembly) of polar actin filaments. Alternatively, they could inhibit contractile activity of the polar filaments. For example, microtubules might inhibit Rho-dependent actin contractility through localized sequestration and inhibition of GEF-H1, an activator of Rho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b016">16</xref>]. Or instead, microtubules could induce polar relaxation by altering the distribution of cortical actin filaments, relocating them away from the poles in a process known as cortical actin flow. Cortical flow of actin has been observed in cultured mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b017">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>The equatorial stimulation model proposes that furrowing is induced by stimulatory signals sent from the central spindle midzone and/or the spindle asters to the equatorial cortex. The classic “torus experiment” by Rappaport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b018">18</xref>] demonstrated that astral microtubules from two opposing asters, not connected by a spindle, are sufficient to induce ectopic furrow formation in echinoderm embryos. Because the cell was topologically manipulated to eliminate the poles, the implication was that polar relaxation could not be invoked as the mechanism for furrowing—although technically, a role for cortical flow has not been excluded. Similarly, astral microtubules from two neighboring spindles can define such an ectopic furrow in a fused epithelial cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b019">19</xref>]. For monopolar spindles, it was proposed that furrow formation was stimulated by a subset of astral microtubules stabilized by chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b020">20</xref>], or by bundles of central spindle-like microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b021">21</xref>]. In cultured rat cells, when communication between the central spindle and equatorial cortex is disrupted by a small “perforation” (i.e., a deep indentation of the membrane, located peripherally within the equatorial plane), a furrow fails to form at the equatorial cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b022">22</xref>]; the furrow initiates instead at the perforation site—as if the central spindle were now signaling to an “interior cortex” located on the spindle side of the perforation. Proteins localized to the central spindle, such as centralspindlin (consisting of a RhoGAP and a kinesin) and RhoGEF, are important for organizing midzone microtubules and signaling the equatorial cortex for furrow induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b024">24</xref>]. Recently, LET-99 and heterotrimeric G proteins were shown to play important roles in aster-positioned cytokinesis in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b025">25</xref>]. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> zygotes, stimulatory signals from asters and the spindle midzone are both important for cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b028">28</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it was very recently shown that F-actin–associated vesicles co-localize with central spindle and peripheral microtubules. Thus, it was hypothesized that the central spindle may somehow coordinate co-transportation of actin and new membrane to the ingressing cleavage furrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b029">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although it has not been directly demonstrated that polar relaxation and equatorial stimulation coexist in a single cell during cytokinesis, other groups have worked to document the relationship between astral-derived and central spindle-derived cytokinetic signals. For example, in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila asterless</named-content> mutant, a suboptimal version of cytokinesis can occur despite the absence of asters from the male meiotic spindle, demonstrating that astral microtubules are dispensable for inducing cytokinesis in male meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b030">30</xref>]. Bringmann and Hyman showed that astral and central spindle signals both help position the cytokinetic furrow during the first zygotic division in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b026">26</xref>]; however, cortical tension was not specifically addressed. The astral signal in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> was later shown to be distinct from the central spindle signal and to negatively regulate distribution of cortical myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b028">28</xref>]. In contrast, myosin II in cultured mammalian cells does not undergo cortical flow, as determined by kymography, whereas actin does [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b017">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the authors postulated that cortical actin is not the sole source of equatorial actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b017">17</xref>]; the other source was not identified. Hu et al. recently observed HeLa cells undergoing drug-induced monopolar cytokinesis. They postulated that feedback loops (i.e., bi-directional signaling) between midzone-like spindle microtubules and various furrow components could promote polarization in these cells, and also that cortical flow could help organize microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b021">21</xref>]. Our work builds on, complements, and extends these ideas, using a novel experimental approach.</p>
      <p>If we assume that polar relaxation and equatorial stimulation can coexist in cytokinesis, it is not obvious how microtubules manage to provide opposing signals in the same cell, i.e., to relax the polar cortex yet stimulate the equatorial cortex. To address this question, and to probe the mechanistic link between cortical properties and contractile ring assembly, we used fluorescently labeled cytokinetic cells of the silkworm <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bombyx mori</named-content>. These cells allowed us to examine the distribution of actin filaments as driven by micromanipulated microtubules, with or without drug treatments that affect either microtubule dynamics or actin assembly. We show that loss of cortical actin may occur at any region of the cell cortex adjacent to dynamic microtubules, due to cortical flow. Stimulation, as gauged by rapid de novo assembly and delivery of actin aggregates, may also occur at any region of the cell cortex, mediated by the bundled, overlapping plus ends of central spindle microtubules. Our data show that polar relaxation and equatorial stimulation mechanisms coexist in silkworm spermatocytes and are compatible with dual roles for microtubules. Furthermore, our work provides mechanistic advances and demonstrates how both mechanisms can independently supply actin for contractile ring assembly.</p>

        <p>Spermatocytes cultured underneath a layer of halocarbon oil were relatively large (∼33 μm in diameter), optically clear, and amenable to micromanipulation. Digital-enhanced polarization microscopy on cells from late metaphase to early anaphase revealed a short but robust spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv001">Video S1</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 9), whose relatively small size provided ample space for manipulation of spindle microtubules. To visualize the dynamics of microtubules and actin filaments during cytokinesis, we microinjected metaphase-stage spermatocytes with rhodamine tubulin and low-level Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv002">Video S2</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 4). The fluorescently labeled cytoskeleton was imaged using spinning disc confocal microscopy. Furrow initiation occurred during early anaphase after actin aggregates emerged at the interdigitating microtubule plus ends at the equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, between 0 and 4). The aggregates gradually enlarged before coalescing with cortical actin filaments to assemble the contractile ring that constricts the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, 4–45). The time from anaphase onset to cleavage was not significantly different for the uninjected control cells (48.4 ± 2.5 min) and the injected, double-labeled cells (49.5 ± 5.0 min), suggesting that the low-level phallodin was not perturbing actin function.</p>

Presumably due to the centrioles' motile flagellar axonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, a–c; as seen in immunostained cells), both asters were mobile within the cell.

          <title>Cortical flow of actin filaments driven by spindle microtubules.</title>
          <p>In cells in which both asters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, arrows) happened to be located at the same pole of the spindle, cortical actin filaments appeared to flow to the opposite side of the cell during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, 0–6.3, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv003">Video S3</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 4. Note: panels were chosen to highlight cortical flow; these focal planes are not optimal for viewing actin aggregates). In such cells, the midzone of the central spindle was never aligned with the cell's equator, and these cells divided asymmetrically around the equator of the shifted spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv004">Video S4</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 6). Our observation suggested that astral microtubules could relax the polar cortex by excluding cortical actin filaments from the pole. However, since the asymmetric furrow was aligned with the spindle equator, it was also possible that the spindle midzone signaled the band of cortex that encircled the spindle equator, stimulating recruitment of actin to the furrow. To discern between these alternatives, we needed to assess whether actin could be redistributed within the cortex in the absence of an intact central spindle. Thus, we used a microneedle to push the spindle poles together in anaphase, mechanically remodeling the spindle apparatus. We refer to this operation as “collapsing” the spindle. During the remodeling process, the spindle was simultaneously relocated to a region of the cell previously unexposed to any furrow cues (e.g., nascent actin aggregates). By collapsing the spindle, we accomplished three objectives. First, the act of collapsing served to reorganize the central spindle, destroying its equatorial configuration. This likely impeded its ability to stimulate the cortex in its new location, preventing the formation of a complete, circular furrow. Second, relocation of the spindle presumably prevented deposition of additional furrow cues at the original cortical site, and depending on the timing of the move, may well have prevented deposition of any cues at the original location. Third, relocation and collapsing of the spindle allowed us to induce controlled exclusion of actin filaments from a region of our choice; relocation brought the spindle close enough to the cortex to initiate cortical flow, whereas collapsing exposed or freed some microtubule plus ends that originally interdigitated with the opposite half of the spindle, potentially altering their dynamic properties (see below).</p>

Shortly thereafter, cortical actin filaments began to flow away from the spindle microtubules to the opposite side of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, 10). Because actin filaments are a major component of actomyosin contractile elements, their exclusion from the cortex near the spindle would presumably result in cortical relaxation. This microtubule-driven actin flow resulted in asymmetric distribution of cortical actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, 10) and initiation of contractile ring assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, 16, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv005">Video S5</xref>) around the presumptive, newly defined zone of microtubule overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b032">32</xref>]. The microtubule-driven actin flow persisted into telophase, as shown in similar experiments in which cells were manipulated while undergoing cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv006">Video S6</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 26). This resulted in asymmetric placement of the contractile ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, 18–37). Because randomly dislocated asters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and arbitrarily repositioned, collapsed spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">3</xref>B) caused cortical actin flow, we hypothesized that cortical relaxation could be induced at any region of the cell cortex by microtubules from any source. To test this idea, we mechanically remodeled cells by placing both asters in one region of the cell, separated from the asterless, collapsed spindle, as depicted in the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, 5–12, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv007">Video S7</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 8).

              <p>(A) During anaphase (0), when the spindle apparatus was collapsed, and pushed with a microneedle to an arbitrary region of the cell cortex (3), actin filaments flowed to the opposite side of the cell (3–25). This redistribution of actin filaments by spindle microtubules resulted in asymmetric cell division (71).</p>
              <p>(B) Repositioning and reorganization of the spindle (2) during telophase resulted in a similar scenario, preceded by regression of the original furrow.</p>
              <p>(C) An anaphase cell (with only one aster visible in this focal plane; 0) was mechanically remodeled by moving spindle microtubules to the upper portion of the cell and collapsing the spindle (shown at top of cell, 5–21). The collapsed spindle was manipulated to detach and relocate first one of its asters (dot in center of cell, 5) and then its second aster (to left of first aster; both asters marked by arrows, 12–21). Possibly due to actin exclusion (5–21) by microtubules from both structures, the contractile ring formed between the collapsed spindle and the pair of detached asters (21–66). This is shown in the schematic diagram (representing the cell in 21).</p>

The schematic shows the cell's outline, the location of the needle (gray), and the direction of flow of cortical actin (red), as induced by the collapsed, repositioned spindle (green, at top). The manipulation needle (arrows), which indented but did not pierce the plasma membrane, locally intercepted the actin flow; brighter fluorescence accumulated on the side of the needle that faced the repositioned spindle (1.7–4.5). The three large red objects (3.4–4.5, upper right) are cell division scars, i.e., remnants from former cytokinetic rings. These scar structures can also move around within the cortex during cortical flow. Note: despite removal of the holding needle, the spindle is not depicted as a giant aster, since the reorganization from monopolar spindle to aster takes at least several minutes.

To confirm this, we decided to use a microneedle to indent a region of the cortex, distant from the presumptive source of actin. We predicted the needle would intercept part of the actin flow, resulting in the accumulation of cortical actin filaments on the side of the needle-indented cortex that faced the source of actin, i.e., the side closer to the repositioned spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, diagram).

          <title>Cortical stiffness correlated with local density of cortical actin.</title>
          <p>We had been using local density of cortical actin to infer cortical stiffness, and we needed to test the validity of this assumption. To assay the degree of cortical stiffness in a region of high actin density relative to one of low actin density, cortical flow of actin filaments was induced using a repositioned, collapsed spindle to generate a density differential. After cortical flow was induced, the cortex farthest from the spindle (high actin density) was probed by depression with the side of a flexible microneedle. As predicted, the needle tip was bent by the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g004">Figure 4</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 7).

(Similar results were obtained using grasshopper spermatocytes; unpublished data (<italic>n</italic> = 6).)

        <title>Evidence for Equatorial Stimulation as Gauged by De Novo Assembly of Actin</title>
        <sec id="s2c1">
          <title>De novo assembly and delivery of actin aggregates mediated by microtubule plus ends.</title>
          <p>Two sources of actin may contribute to contractile ring assembly: pre-existing actin filaments from the cell cortex and the cytoplasm, and actin aggregates that are assembled de novo at the equator. We have demonstrated that microtubule-driven cortical flow provides a mechanism by which cortical actin is excluded from the polar cortex. (Polar microtubules may also play a role in clearing cytoplasmic actin filaments from the polar region. See legend to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv004">Video S4</xref>.) We hypothesized that microtubules might stimulate de novo actin assembly at the equator, since the speckles of actin fluorescence that were detected at equatorial microtubule plus ends increased in number and size as anaphase progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). To detect de novo actin assembly, we monitored its dynamics starting at the metaphase-anaphase transition in cells with labeled microtubules and actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv009">Video S9</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 15). Before onset of anaphase, actin fluorescence was absent from the spindle equator where the aligned metaphase chromosomes were located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, 0). As the cell entered anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, 2), speckles of actin fluorescence soon emerged at the spindle midzone where microtubule plus ends overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, 2–4). The speckles gradually grew into bigger aggregates as anaphase proceeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, 4–10, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv009">Video S9</xref>). The de novo emergence and accumulation of actin fluorescence was readily apparent when actin alone was visualized, using the rhodamine channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, insets). Notably, nascent actin aggregates were assembled across the entire midzone of the central spindle, and delivered laterally to the incipient contractile ring by microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv010">Video S10</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 13). This novel means of delivery was driven by a structural reorganization of each spindle half: microtubules became more focused at their minus ends (at the spindle poles), while splaying out toward the equatorial cortex at their plus ends, thus enlarging the spindle midzone region. These splaying microtubules were organized into bundles, some of which were coated with an actin aggregate at the plus ends of the bundle, enabling its delivery to the cortex. Lateral transport appeared to begin around the time of furrow initiation, while cortical flow was already in progress. However, we could not definitively rule out an earlier starting point, since small numbers of peripheral microtubules could have escaped detection. Moreover, it was problematic to define a precise endpoint, as the trajectory of the outwardly splaying spindle was confounded by the ingressing furrow.</p>

          <title>De novo actin assembly was independent of microtubule dynamics.</title>
          <p>Because microtubules were involved in both actin exclusion from the polar region and de novo actin assembly at the equator, we asked whether either process required dynamic microtubules. To address this question, we repeated the de novo actin assembly experiments (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) in cells whose microtubules were simultaneously labeled and stabilized with Oregon green paclitaxel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv011">Video S11</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 11). We determined whether paclitaxel-treated cells had entered anaphase by gently probing the chromosomes with a microneedle—allowing us to assess whether homologous chromosomes were physically separable or still attached to one another. Following the onset of anaphase, chromosomes in spindles that were stabilized at the metaphase-anaphase transition could be separated from their homolog, but they could not move poleward (unpublished data). However, de novo actin assembly at the midzone of microtubule plus ends was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, 3–10; insets show the actin channel alone; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv011">Video S11</xref>). Emergence and accumulation of actin fluorescence at the spindle midzone appeared similar in stabilized and nonstabilized cells (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), demonstrating that aggregate assembly was independent of microtubule dynamics. However, the assembled actin aggregates remained at the midzone of the spindle stabilized at the metaphase-anaphase transition. This failure of delivery suggests that at later stages, when the central spindle is remodeled to produce the polar focusing of microtubules and the splaying of bundles, dynamic microtubules may be required.</p>

          <p>To further test how central spindle microtubules deliver de novo–assembled actin aggregates to the cell cortex, we remodeled these actin-tipped microtubules with a microneedle to expose their plus ends to the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>). After anaphase onset, a central spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, a) was collapsed by pushing the spindle poles together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, b).

              <p>(A) A schematic showing remodeling of the central spindle by micromanipulation. A post-anaphase spindle (a, green) was collapsed using a micromanipulation needle (b, gray). The manipulation created two lateral microtubule bundles, with the exposed microtubule plus ends of the bundles pointing toward opposite sides of the cortex. The interior ends of the bundles flanked chromosomes (c, blue), kinetochores (c, purple) and centrosomes (c, orange). If the collapsed spindle was brought close to the cortex and held in place by a microneedle, it reorganized into a monopolar spindle (d). If the holding needle was removed, the spindle usually reorganized into a giant aster (e).</p>
              <p>(B) Actin exclusion was inhibited when the remodeled spindle was stabilized by paclitaxel. Neither the stabilized lateral spindle (8) nor the evolving monopolar spindle (12–22) induced unidirectional flow of actin filaments (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Cells in (B–F) were labeled as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>C.</p>
              <p>(C) Actin aggregates were assembled at the plus ends of stabilized, laterally oriented microtubule bundles (0–2, arrowheads), and were delivered to the non-equatorial cortex where splaying microtubule bundles were in contact with the cortex (2–12, arrows).</p>
              <p>(D) A monopolar spindle (2) gradually splayed its microtubule bundles toward the cell cortex (2–21), which delivered actin aggregates (2, arrowheads) and induced a furrow (11–21, arrows). The furrow eventually regressed (61).</p>
              <p>(E) Tracking of an actin aggregate delivered from the plus ends of one microtubule bundle to the cell cortex. The giant aster had chromosomes in its center and microtubule plus ends pointing outward, as in (A, panel e). When the aster was placed near the cell cortex using a microneedle, an actin aggregate moved away from the microtubule bundle plus ends and merged into the cortex (box, 0–8.8).</p>

          <p>We mechanically positioned the remodeled and stabilized spindle so that its exposed microtubule plus ends, which were coated with the de novo–assembled actin aggregates, were removed from the original equatorial cortex and thus from any cues already present there. In all spindle configurations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, b–e), actin aggregates were delivered by the bundled microtubules to the nearby cortex. Notably, microtubule splay in a lateral spindle gradually brought microtubule plus ends close to the cell cortex, and hence allowed the delivery of actin aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv013">Video S13</xref>). Furrow initiation could occur in such manipulated cells, provided the actin aggregates were delivered to a cortical zone that encircled the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, arrows). Using time-lapse imaging, we followed a giant aster positioned near the cell periphery (viewed from above, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, e) and documented its delivery of an actin aggregate from the plus end of a microtubule bundle to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">6</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv014">Videos S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv015">S15</xref>). The accumulation of actin aggregates made the cell cortex significantly brighter over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>F, 0 onward), indicating that delivery of actin aggregates can proceed even in the absence of dynamic microtubules, so long as splay of central spindle microtubules is not blocked.</p>
          <p>In the final stage of lateral transport, actin aggregates had to be released from the tips of the microtubule bundles to allow their delivery to the cortex. To examine this process in greater detail, the red and green channels were analyzed individually for signs of costaining at the tips of microtubule bundles (in transit from the central spindle to the cortex). The signal from the microtubules at the peripheral ends of the bundles was much weaker than the signal from the actin; thus, the costained regions appeared red rather than yellow in the merged images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>. However, close analysis revealed a correlation between the length of the costained region of the bundle and the distance from bundle tip to cortex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060209-t001">Table 1</xref>). This distance was actually measured from the distal end of the actin aggregate rather than from the distal end of the bundle itself. The length of the actin aggregate remained fairly constant—approximately 0.8 to 0.9 μm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060209-t001">Table 1</xref>). When a bundle was more than about 1.2 μm from the cortex, at least a portion of the aggregate (perhaps close to the entire aggregate) overlapped with the tip of the bundle. As the bundle, with its associated cargo, came within about 0.41–1.2 μm of the cortex, it was no longer possible for the entire length of the aggregate to fully overlap with the bundle, even taking into account the uncertainty of the measurements. In other words, the aggregate appeared to be “sliding” off the tip of the bundle, toward the cortex. Finally, as the actin-tipped bundle approached within 0.4 μm of the cortex, i.e., closer than the length of the aggregate itself, the aggregate was released completely from the bundle, and the overlap dropped to zero.</p>

          <title>Cortical actin flow was dependent on microtubule dynamics.</title>
          <p>In contrast to the de novo assembly of actin aggregates, cortical flow of actin was highly dependent on dynamic microtubules. We attempted to induce cortical flow in paclitaxel-treated cells by collapsing the spindle with a microneedle while repositioning it close to the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">6</xref>D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv012">Video S12</xref>, and see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, 3–10). Cortical flow was clearly inhibited. This result supports our contention that cortical actin filaments are excluded from the polar region and redirected toward the equatorial cortex by dynamic microtubules.</p>

        <title>Equatorial Stimulation, but Not Polar Relaxation, Was Dependent on RhoA Activity</title>
        <p>We wanted to determine whether de novo assembly of actin aggregates at the plus ends of central spindle microtubules requires RhoA as a regulator. To do so, we microinjected late metaphase cells with C3 ribosyltransferase, a botulinum toxin that specifically inhibits Rho by ADP ribosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b033">33</xref>]. We hypothesized that this inhibition would disrupt de novo actin assembly at the spindle midzone, without affecting cortical flow of actin. As expected, the C3 transferase-treated cell continued to divide but failed to accumulate actin aggregates in the central spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g007">Figure 7</xref>). As seen in optical sections of control cells (<italic>n</italic> = 15), actin accumulated both at the equatorial cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, top and bottom) and at microtubule plus ends within the central spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, middle).

        <title>Polar Relaxation and Equatorial Stimulation Both Induce Contractile Ring Assembly and Cell Cleavage</title>
        <p>By mechanically manipulating the spindles of double-labeled silkworm spermatocytes, we show how polar relaxation (as gauged by redistribution of cortical actin) and equatorial stimulation of the cortex (as gauged by de novo actin assembly and transport) both contribute to contractile ring assembly and furrow induction. We demonstrate that spindle microtubules deliver both inhibitory and stimulatory signals to the cell cortex during furrow formation, depending on their configuration and location within the cell. The dynamic astral microtubules drive actin filaments from the polar region to the equatorial cortex, which relaxes the polar cortex, while increasing cortical tension at the actin-dense equator. Meanwhile, bundles of interdigitating microtubules across the entire central spindle stimulate de novo assembly of actin aggregates at their overlapping plus ends, and deliver the aggregates to the equatorial cortex. These dual signaling mechanisms ensure that both cortical actin and central spindle-associated actin are delivered to the equatorial cortex, resulting in a robust contractile ring, and providing redundancy to safeguard an essential cellular process. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv004">Videos S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv009">S9</xref>, as well as previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b035">35</xref>], provide hints that cytoplasmic actin filaments (perhaps vesicle bound; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b029">29</xref>]) may constitute a third source of actin that could ultimately be delivered to the equatorial cortex by microtubules.</p>
        <p>We show that in the absence of equatorial stimulation, contractile ring assembly and furrowing can still be induced by means of actin redistribution driven by cortical flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). We accomplished this by displacing the entire spindle apparatus, bearing “stimulatory” furrow cues that were reorganized (via spindle collapse), or C3 transferase-suppressed, to an arbitrary region of the cortex. The existence of a cortical flow of actin filaments away from the displaced spindle microtubules was established by our ability to intercept the flow locally, using a microneedle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). We found that the flow of cortical actin during cytokinesis can be induced by any microtubules positioned near the cortex, provided their plus ends are dynamic and accessible (i.e., neither interdigitating nor otherwise bundled or stabilized). We hypothesize that collapsing the spindle can mechanically free a subset of plus ends; this could allow those formerly interdigitating central spindle microtubules to become more dynamic and to take on properties held by astral microtubules, such as the ability to contact the cell cortex and induce cortical flow of actin filaments. Interdigitating microtubules in an intact central spindle would be able to contact the cortex only laterally, and as incorrectly oriented bundles, which should not be conducive for promoting cortical flow. As predicted by this finding, furrow formation can occur between a collapsed asterless spindle and its two detached asters in a remodeled cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). We have also shown that this microtubule-driven actin flow begins shortly after anaphase onset and persists through telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g003">3</xref>B), contributing to both contractile ring assembly at the equator and furrow inhibition at the poles throughout the furrow induction and ingression stages. Cortical flow during cytokinesis has previously been inferred or observed for contractile elements including myosin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b037">37</xref>] and pre-existing actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b038">38</xref>], as well as for a membrane-bound receptor-ligand complex, membrane domains, and cell surface proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b041">41</xref>]. As the movement of certain surface proteins mirrors that of cortical actin, it has been suggested that the actin network could serve as a scaffold for these proteins, thus engineering their co-transport to the furrow region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b041">41</xref>].</p>
        <p>How might microtubules interact with actin filaments to effect their exclusion from the poles? Since paclitaxel inhibits cortical flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">6</xref>D), actin filaments are likely to be driven from the polar region towards the equatorial cortex by elongating microtubules. Following anaphase onset, the plus ends of astral microtubules can elongate toward and contact the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b042">42</xref>]. Such microtubules would be anchored to the spindle pole at their minus ends, and conceivably constrained at their plus ends by indirect attachment to a mobile cortical component, namely filamentous actin (analogous to cortical capture via Bim1/Kar9/Myo2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b044">44</xref>]). Given the microtubule's length, flexibility, geometrical orientation within the cell, and constraints on its direction of movement, its elongation may be sufficient to drive cortical actin toward the equator. Elongation of tethered microtubules against a fixed barrier can produce force of up to 10 pN, as gauged by microtubule buckling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b045">45</xref>]. Presumably, this force could be harnessed to allow tip-attached cortical actin to “hitchhike” to the equatorial cortex, where it would be released, possibly by binding to myosin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b038">38</xref>] or anillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b046">46</xref>]. Alternatively, or in addition, actin filaments could be transported along the subset of microtubules that are contiguous to the cortex, and longitudinally aligned, with appropriate polarity. Motor proteins would provide the driving force for transport, with microtubule elongation serving only to extend the track toward the equator. Actin filaments could either be cargo for a plus-end–directed kinesin (attached via an adaptor protein), or else the actin could be coupled to the microtubule track via kinesin/myosinV-type hetero-motors (as modeled in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b047">47</xref>]), and slide along the stationary microtubule toward the equatorial cortex, with kinesin providing directionality for the flow. The tracks could consist of the cortically apposed section of centrosome-attached astral microtubules and/or those released from the centrosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b050">50</xref>] that become cortically apposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b052">52</xref>].</p>
        <p>We also show that actin aggregates can be assembled de novo within the central spindle in the absence of cortical-flow based redistribution of actin, by using paclitaxel to impede the flow. Similarly, paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules can induce a cleavage furrow in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b053">53</xref>], perhaps implying mechanistic conservation. We demonstrate that cortical stimulation can be induced at any region in the cortex by microtubule plus ends of the central spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Our data reveal that de novo–assembled cytoplasmic actin aggregates can comprise a supply of actin sufficient to form the contractile ring and induce cell cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). Newly assembled actin aggregates are precursors of the contractile ring, since they ultimately merge with the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The existence of de novo assembly of actin during contractile ring formation is consistent with evidence from diverse cell types, including grasshopper spermatocytes (unpublished data), yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b055">55</xref>], <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b056">56</xref>], and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b038">38</xref>]; in addition, there is precedent for the presence of actin nucleating protein formin at microtubule plus ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b057">57</xref>]. Assembly of actin aggregates is sensitive to the Rho GTPase inhibitor, C3 transferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, middle), supporting the existence of a microtubule-dependent zone of active RhoA during cleavage plane specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b062">62</xref>]. Our findings also raise the possibility that equatorial stimulation signals could be transported along stationary central spindle microtubule tracks from the spindle pole region to the midzone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), before ultimately reaching the equatorial cortex, perhaps via lateral transport.</p>
        <p>Actin aggregates are assembled across the entire spindle midzone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">5</xref>C); hence they must be transported laterally from the plus ends of the bundled microtubules to the equatorial cortex. We have captured this novel means of delivery using time-lapse sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figures 5</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">6</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">6</xref>F). Bundles of central spindle microtubules, some tipped with actin aggregates, splay laterally outward as the spindle changes shape, thereby conveying their cargo to the incipient furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). The actin cargo remains associated with the tips of the microtubule bundles until the bundles are within about 0.4 μm of the cortex, less than the length of the aggregate itself (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060209-t001">Table 1</xref>). At this point, the microtubule-associated aggregates appear to be released from the microtubule bundles, in that the costaining at the microtubule tips disappears. The dissociation of the actin from the bundles may be mediated by kinesins bound to the bundle, as the aggregate appears to slide off the end of the bundle as it approaches the cortex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060209-t001">Table 1</xref>). This transport of actin aggregates may be largely independent of microtubule dynamics; when a post-anaphase, paclitaxel-stabilized spindle with mechanically exposed, bundled plus ends is brought close to the cortex by micromanipulation, it remains functional for delivery of actin aggregates to the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">6</xref>F). The induction of an ectopic furrow following cortical deposition of actin aggregates from microtubule plus ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>D) indicates that actin-tipped microtubules may contain sufficient furrow constituents (i.e., structural constituents along with any co-transported stimulatory cues) to permit contractile ring assembly. This idea is consistent with work by Hu et al., showing that the tips of monopolar spindles contain critical stimulatory components (e.g., the Rho GEF Ect2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b021">21</xref>].</p>
        <p>We propose that in the bipolar spindle, other spatially dynamic midzone components may also utilize this microtubule-based lateral transport mechanism—either co-transported with actin aggregates, or else delivered via a distinct set of midzone microtubules. By ensuring timely relocation of cytokinetic components, lateral transport could play a role in processes such as midzone signaling of the equatorial cortex, assembly and maintenance of the contractile ring and abscission. For example, the midzone component centralspindlin becomes localized to the equatorial cortex during anaphase. Bundled interdigitating microtubules, tipped with centralspindlin, may become docked at the contractile ring via Anillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b063">63</xref>]. We suggest that these tipped microtubules may originate from the central spindle and deliver their cargo to the cortex via lateral transport. Similarly, lateral transport could provide a means of delivery to the cortex for a recently characterized subset of vesicles. These vesicles are associated both with actin and with the central spindle, and are thought to contribute to furrow ingression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b029">29</xref>]. In fixed cells, the authors saw thin microtubule bundles potentially connecting the central spindle with the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b029">29</xref>], consistent with a lateral transport mechanism. As another example, by early anaphase, the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is at the mitotic spindle midzone, whereas later in anaphase it is also present at the equatorial cortex (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b064">64</xref>]), perhaps arriving there by lateral transport. Interestingly, in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, the CPC component INCENP has been shown to bind actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b065">65</xref>]. It is also worth determining whether a subset of RhoA may reach the equatorial cortex via lateral transport, given that RhoA localization may depend on microtubule organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060209-b058">58</xref>].</p>

        <title>Model for Microtubule Induction of Contractile Ring Assembly</title>
        <p>Our results explain how a single spindle component, the microtubule, can play opposing roles in two complementary pathways of contractile ring assembly. The seemingly incongruous stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the cortex are produced by different configurations of microtubules that populate different regions of the cytokinetic cell. We propose a microtubule induction model to describe how microtubules perform their dual signaling at the poles and the equator to induce contractile ring formation and cleavage furrow initiation. During early anaphase, dynamic astral microtubules at the poles inhibit ectopic furrow formation by excluding pre-existing actin filaments from the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g008">Figure 8</xref>A, red dotted arrows and red lines at cortex), ultimately resulting in actin accumulation at the incipient equatorial furrow. Meanwhile, at the plus ends of the relatively stable central spindle microtubules, actin aggregates are assembled de novo, and enlarge over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g008">Figure 8</xref>A, red lines in midzone). As the cell progresses toward telophase, preexisting cortical actin filaments continue to flow from the polar cortex to the equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g008">Figure 8</xref>B, red dotted arrows). At the same time, the plus ends of bundled central spindle microtubules splay laterally to deliver the actin aggregates to the equatorial cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g008">Figure 8</xref>B, red solid arrows). The newly delivered aggregates coalesce with the actin excluded from the polar cortex to assemble the contractile ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g008">Figure 8</xref>C).</p>

        <p>In summary, we show that actin is redistributed into the contractile ring via two microtubule-dependent pathways that coexist during cytokinesis of the silkworm spermatocyte: equatorial stimulation and polar relaxation. These dual signaling pathways ensure the fidelity of cytokinesis, which fails only if both mechanisms are inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). With some modification, our model could be generalized to multiple cell types. For example, cytokinetic cells of varying sizes and spindle geometries might rely more heavily on one mechanism than the other to achieve a global balance between tension and relaxation. We have demonstrated that the entire cell cortex is potentially responsive to both stimulatory and inhibitory cues from microtubules during cytokinesis in silkworm spermatocytes. How might the cell restrict the contractile ring to a localized band of equatorial cortex? By stimulating only the equatorial cortex while concomitantly relaxing other regions of the cortex, a cell could ensure cytokinetic fidelity by building in redundancy. Polar relaxation could be thought to include a component of equatorial stimulation in that pre-existing actin filaments are transported to the equatorial cortex. Equatorial stimulation, with its de novo actin assembly, recruits cytoplasmic G-actin to the equator. Hence, the seemingly disparate models ultimately result in redistribution of all available actin resources to the equator for ring assembly.</p>

The microneedle (arrow on first frame), which indented but did not pierce the plasma membrane, locally intercepted the actin flow, with brighter fluorescence accumulating on the side of the needle facing the repositioned spindle.

Microtubules (green) were stabilized and labeled with Oregon Green Paclitaxel, and actin (red) was labeled using low-level rhodamine phalloidin. The giant aster developed from a post anaphase spindle, which was collapsed by a microneedle. Microtubule bundles in the aster were oriented with their plus ends closest to the cortex, and many of them were tipped with actin aggregates. A subset of these actin aggregates were ultimately delivered to and merged into the cortex after the aster was maneuvered to a location near the cortex. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060209-sv015">Video S15</xref> corresponds to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g006">Figure 6</xref>E.</p>

          <title>A 3D View of a Bipolar Spindle, Showing Overlapping Actin-Tipped Bundles in the Central Spindle</title>
          <p>A stack of 2D images of an anaphase cell (at a stage similar to that of the cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060209-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) was reprocessed to create a 3D image, by rotation first around the <italic>y</italic>-axis, and then around the <italic>x</italic>-axis. Microtubules (green) were stabilized and labeled with Oregon Green Paclitaxel, actin (red) was labeled by low-level rhodamine phalloidin, and the nucleus (blue) was stained with Hoechst. Microtubule bundles from the two half spindles radiated outwards to the equatorial cortex, displaying tips coated with actin aggregates. Such actin coated microtubule bundles were absent on the side of the cell facing the coverslip (see the vertical rotation). Presumably because the cell was flatter on that side, the bundles had to travel a shorter distance to deliver their cargo; hence, they may have reached the cortex sooner than the bundles on the opposite side. In this cell, the chromosomes were already segregated to the poles, and some of the actin aggregates had already been delivered to the equatorial cortex by the microtubule plus ends; thus, actin aggregates could no longer be seen in the center of the spindle. Two pairs of centrosomes at the poles of the cell were clearly visible.</p>
