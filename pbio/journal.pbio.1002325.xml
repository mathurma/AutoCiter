<abstract>
<p>Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a normal cell differentiation event during development and contributes pathologically to carcinoma and fibrosis progression. EMT often associates with increased transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, and TGF-β drives EMT, in part through Smad-mediated reprogramming of gene expression. TGF-β also activates the Erk MAPK pathway through recruitment and Tyr phosphorylation of the adaptor protein ShcA by the activated TGF-β type I receptor. We found that ShcA protects the epithelial integrity of nontransformed cells against EMT by repressing TGF-β-induced, Smad-mediated gene expression. p52ShcA competed with Smad3 for TGF-β receptor binding, and down-regulation of ShcA expression enhanced autocrine TGF-β/Smad signaling and target gene expression, whereas increased p52ShcA expression resulted in decreased Smad3 binding to the TGF-β receptor, decreased Smad3 activation, and increased Erk MAPK and Akt signaling. Furthermore, p52ShcA sequestered TGF-β receptor complexes to caveolin-associated membrane compartments, and reducing ShcA expression enhanced the receptor localization in clathrin-associated membrane compartments that enable Smad activation. Consequently, silencing ShcA expression induced EMT, with increased cell migration, invasion, and dissemination, and increased stem cell generation and mammosphere formation, dependent upon autocrine TGF-β signaling. These findings position ShcA as a determinant of the epithelial phenotype by repressing TGF-β-induced Smad activation through differential partitioning of receptor complexes at the cell surface.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>TGF-β family proteins control cell differentiation and various cell functions. Increased TGF-β signaling, acting through heteromeric receptor complexes, contributes to carcinoma progression and fibrosis. TGF-β drives epithelial–mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT), which enables cell migration and invasion. Upon TGF-β binding, “type I” receptors activate, through phosphorylation, Smad2 and Smad3 that control target gene transcription. In EMT, Smad complexes activate the expression of EMT “master” transcription factors and cooperate with these to repress the epithelial phenotype and activate mesenchymal gene expression. TGF-β receptors also activate Erk MAPK signaling, involving association of the adaptor protein ShcA and Tyr phosphorylation of ShcA by type I receptors. We now show that the predominant ShcA isoform, p52ShcA, competes with Smad2/3 for binding to type I TGF-β receptors, thus repressing Smad2/3 activation in response to TGF-β and localizing the receptors to caveolar compartments. Consequently, decreased ShcA expression enhanced TGF-β receptor localization in clathrin compartments and autocrine Smad2/3 signaling, repressed the epithelial phenotype, and promoted EMT. The changes following decreased ShcA expression resulted in increased cell migration and invasion, as well as increased stem cell generation, dependent upon autocrine TGF-β signaling. These findings position ShcA as a determinant of the epithelial phenotype by repressing TGF-β-induced Smad activation through differential partitioning of receptor complexes at the cell surface.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Shc proteins are intracellular adaptor proteins that relay signals from membrane-associated receptors, including receptor tyrosine (Tyr) kinases (RTKs), cytokine receptors and integrins. They interact with phospho-Tyr residues through their N-terminal PTB domain and C-terminal SH2 domain and enable Tyr kinases to phosphorylate Shc on three Tyr residues in a central CH1 domain, thus facilitating activation of the Ras/Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in response to extracellular ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>]. Among the four mammalian Shc proteins, ShcA is widely expressed and generated as three isoforms, p66, p52, and p46, through differential start codon usage and splicing. ShcA is well studied as a signaling mediator of membrane-associated Tyr kinases leading to Erk MAPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>], although it also plays a role in activation of PI3K-Akt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref004">4</xref>] and controls cytoskeletal changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref005">5</xref>]. Targeted inactivation of ShcA expression does not prevent growth factor-induced Erk MAPK activation but confers an impaired sensitivity to growth factors and an attenuated Erk MAPK activation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref006">6</xref>]. Since nonchordate metazoans lack some or all Tyrs that are phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref008">8</xref>], Shc proteins may also exert functions independent of Tyr phosphorylation. ShcA is additionally controlled by serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) phosphorylation, which regulates protein interactions, Shc activities in lipid metabolism, endocytosis and small GTPase regulation, e.g., following protein kinase C activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref010">10</xref>] and responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref011">11</xref>]. p52ShcA also plays a role in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, which is not initiated by Tyr kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>TGF-β family proteins control cell differentiation and various functions in metazoans. As secreted dimers, TGF-β and TGF-β-related proteins activate intracellular signaling through a cell surface complex of two type II and two type I receptor kinases. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptors phosphorylate the type I receptors that then activate their signaling effectors, the Smads, through C-terminal phosphorylation on two Sers. Thus, TGF-β induces the type I receptor TβRI to activate Smad2 and/or Smad3, which then dissociate from the receptor complexes and form trimers of two receptor-activated Smads and one Smad4. These then cooperate with DNA binding transcription factors and coregulators to activate or repress TGF-β target gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref015">15</xref>]. In addition to the Smad-mediated changes in transcription, the TGF-β receptors also activate Erk, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK signaling, as well as Rho and PI3K-Akt-TOR signaling, albeit to a lower extent than RTKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref018">18</xref>]. Their activation in response to TGF-β may relate to the dual kinase specificity of the TGF-β receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref021">21</xref>], which, as is seen with other dual specificity kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref022">22</xref>], confers Tyr phosphorylation that is much weaker than Ser/Thr phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref021">21</xref>]. TGF-β induces TβRI phosphorylation on Tyr, and TGF-β-induced activation of Erk MAPK signaling results from TGF-β-induced recruitment of p52ShcA to TβRI, enabling TβRI to phosphorylate p52ShcA on Tyr, and more prominently on Ser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>At several stages during development, dependent on the microenvironment, epithelial cells repress their differentiation state, resulting in loss of epithelial junction and polarity complexes, and redirect their gene expression and phenotype to transition into motile mesenchymal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref024">24</xref>]. This reversible transdifferentiation process is commonly called epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is potently induced by activation of TGF-β signaling, in cooperation with other signaling mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref027">27</xref>]. Postnatally, EMT is recapitulated in fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref029">29</xref>] and in cancer progression, where it directs carcinoma cell invasion and correlates with cancer stem cell properties. In both pathological contexts, EMT has been functionally linked with increased TGF-β signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref032">32</xref>]. In TGF-β-induced EMT, the activated Smads direct the expression of “master” transcription factors, such as Snail, ZEB, and Twist, and then cooperate with these transcription factors to regulate the expression of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref024">24</xref>]. While Akt activation is required for completion of TGF-β-induced EMT, with mTOR complex 2 being essential for the cytoskeletal reorganization and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref034">34</xref>], the roles of the MAPK pathways in TGF-β-induced EMT have been less defined, although Erk MAPK signaling has been implicated in EMT responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Aiming to better understand the roles of TGF-β signaling in EMT, we down-regulated the expression of ShcA in epithelial cells. These cells underwent EMT spontaneously, thus enhancing their motility and invasion, and the generation of epithelial stem cells, dependent on autocrine TGF-β-induced Smad signaling. Our results show that ShcA protects epithelial cells against EMT through suppression of TGF-β-induced Smad signaling. This inhibition is achieved through direct competition of ShcA with Smad3 for binding to the TβRI, and, consequently, changes in the partitioning of ShcA-interacting TGF-β receptor complexes and receptor complexes that enable TGF-β-induced Smad activation.</p>

<title>Decreasing ShcA Expression Promotes Transition from Epithelial to Mesenchymal Phenotype</title>
<p>To address the role of ShcA in the epithelial phenotype and EMT, we used mouse mammary NMuMG cells and human HaCaT skin keratinocytes as model systems, which like most other cells predominantly express the p52ShcA isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In these cells, which transition into a mesenchymal phenotype in response to TGF-β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref037">37</xref>], we down-regulated ShcA expression by transfecting the cells with ShcA-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s002">S1A Fig</xref>). ShcA mRNA expression was at its best decreased to 15%, as assessed by qRT-PCR, depending on the sequence of the siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s002">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Compared to cells transfected with control siRNA, cells with down-regulated ShcA expression had a less cuboidal epithelial phenotype and a more elongated and spread out phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting EMT. The EMT phenotype was supported by decreased immunostaining and diffuse mislocalization of E-cadherin at cell contacts, shown by confocal immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the actin filaments were no longer cortically organized, and the cells showed prominent fibronectin immunostaining that was not apparent in epithelial cells that were transfected with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These changes upon down-regulation of ShcA expression were similar in NMuMG and HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). That down-regulation of ShcA expression resulted in EMT was also supported by decreased E-cadherin expression and increased fibronectin, N-cadherin and vimentin expression that characterize EMT. Also these changes were apparent in both NMuMG and HaCaT cells, when compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s002">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The EMT phenotype resulting from decreased ShcA expression could be reversed following reintroduction of p52ShcA expression. HaCaT cells, selected to express an shRNA that targets the ShcA 3’ untranslated region from a lentiviral vector, had decreased ShcA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s002">S1E Fig</xref>) and showed the expected EMT phenotype, as apparent by cell morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s002">S1E Fig</xref>, top), decreased E-cadherin and increased fibronectin expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s002">S1G and S1H Fig</xref>). Reintroducing p52ShcA expression using a vector that was not targeted by the shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s002">S1E Fig</xref>) reverted the cells to an epithelial phenotype with increased E-cadherin and decreased fibronectin expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s002">S1G and S1H Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, NMuMG cells can form acini-like structures when allowed to grow three-dimensionally in Matrigel, and inducing EMT in response to TGF-β impairs the integrity of these structures due to cell dispersal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref039">39</xref>]. Whereas NMuMG cells transfected with control siRNA formed such smooth-edged spheres in Matrigel, cells with decreased ShcA expression were unable to do so and showed cell dispersal, similarly to the effect of adding TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these observations, we conclude that decreasing ShcA expression confers a transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype, and, therefore, that ShcA plays a role in stabilizing the epithelial phenotype.</p>

<title>ShcA Expression Controls EMT-Associated Cell Behavior</title>
<p>The epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype transition is marked by increased cell motility, which is often the basis for increased invasiveness of cells that have undergone EMT, e.g., in cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref024">24</xref>]. We therefore evaluated whether decreased ShcA expression gave rise to cells with enhanced motility and invasion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, down-regulation of ShcA expression increased cell motility, assessed in a cell monolayer wounding assay. Additionally, the cells showed increased invasion in Transwell assays that score the number of cells that invaded through basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine the effect of decreased ShcA expression on cell behavior in vivo, we transplanted DiI-labeled cells into the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Recent studies have shown that cancer cell dissemination in such zebrafish xenograft assays correlates with cancer cell behavior in mouse models of metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref040">40</xref>]. DiI-labeled NMuMG cells with down-regulated ShcA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g002">Fig 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s003">S2A Fig</xref>) and control NMuMG cells were injected into the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), and the dissemination of the cells was visualized by fluorescence microscopy over 60–84 h. Down-regulation of ShcA expression resulted in increased dissemination from the site of injection, scored at 72 h after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), which is consistent with their increased cell motility and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Partial or complete loss of epithelial phenotype and EMT can lead to acquisition of stem cell properties in normal and transformed mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref041">41</xref>]. Mammary stem cells that have the ability to self-renew and reconstitute mammary glands can form single cell–derived mammospheres when cultured in suspension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref042">42</xref>]. Additionally, mouse mammary epithelial or carcinoma stem cells express increased levels of CD49f and moderately increased CD24 levels, when compared to cells lacking self-renewal and gland-reconstituting capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref044">44</xref>]. Accordingly, we found that decreasing ShcA expression resulted in increased CD49f expression and a modest increase in CD24 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g002">Fig 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s003">S2B Fig</xref>). Additionally, down-regulation of ShcA expression conferred increased formation of single cell–derived mammospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g002">Fig 2G</xref>), indicative of the increased number of self-renewing stem cells in the population. These results correlate the EMT phenotype, resulting from decreased ShcA expression, with stem cell properties in culture, and suggest that ShcA expression may control cancer stem cell generation and function.</p>

<title>ShcA Does Not Modulate EMT through the Erk MAPK Pathway</title>
<p>ShcA acts as an adaptor that facilitates Erk MAPK pathway in response to various ligands, as has been best studied in the context of growth factor-induced Tyr kinase receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>].

ShcA down-regulation also exerted a milder decrease in basal Akt activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>), consistent with the proposed role of Shc in insulin- and growth factor-induced PI3K activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref045">45</xref>].

Immunoblotting for ShcA revealed the down-regulation of ShcA expression using siRNA, and GAPDH immunoblotting served as loading control.

<p>To assess whether the EMT resulting from decreased ShcA expression was due to decreased Erk MAPK pathway activity, we evaluated the effect of U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor that prevents Erk MAPK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), on cell morphology. U0126 did not induce the phenotypic changes that are apparent when ShcA expression is down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). U0126 also did not induce Snail, Twist, fibronectin or vimentin expression, or repress E-cadherin expression, as is seen in response to silencing ShcA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3F–3J</xref>). However, inhibition of MEK1/2 activity resulted in a somewhat increased N-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3K</xref>), and slightly repressed Twist expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Furthermore, U0126 slightly destabilized the junctional localization of E-cadherin that was revealed by immunofluorescence, with further destabilization upon down-regulation of ShcA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3L</xref>). Similarly to NMuMG cells, treatment of HaCaT cells with U0126 did not induce a change in morphology that resembled the effect of down-regulation of ShcA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s004">S3A Fig</xref>), and did not induce the expression of the Snail-related transcription factor Slug (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s004">S3B Fig</xref>), which, similarly to Snail in NMuMG, promotes EMT of HaCaT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref046">46</xref>]. These data suggest that inhibition of the MEK1/2-Erk MAPK pathway does not account for a loss of epithelial morphology, and argue that EMT resulting from ShcA down-regulation is not due to inhibition of the Erk MAPK pathway.</p>
<p>Considering the mild decrease in Akt activation following ShcA down-regulation, and the reported roles of Shc in growth factor-induced PI3K activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref045">45</xref>], we also assessed the effects of LY294002, a direct PI3K inhibitor, on the epithelial morphology. Inhibition of PI3K activity resulted in decreased Akt activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), without, however, inducing an EMT-like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) or Snail or Twist mRNA expression in control epithelial cells, nor did it significantly affect the expression of fibronectin, vimentin or E-cadherin mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3F–3J</xref>). These data suggest that the EMT-like phenotype following down-regulation of ShcA expression does not result from decreased Akt activation. Finally, inhibition of p38 MAPK using SB203580 did not affect the epithelial morphology in control cells, or the EMT phenotype in cells with down-regulated ShcA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), and had no major effects on the expression of EMT marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g003">Fig 3F–3K</xref>).

<title>Decreased ShcA Expression Promotes EMT through Autocrine TGF-β Signaling</title>
<p>To define the mechanism that accounts for the EMT in response to down-regulation of ShcA expression, we treated the cells with SB431542, a specific inhibitor of the TGF-β/activin type I receptor kinases that prevents TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref047">47</xref>]. As expected, SB431542 blocked the TGF-β-induced activation of Snail mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s005">S4A Fig</xref>) and the TGF-β-induced transition of NMuMG cells into an elongated cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In untreated NMuMG cells with down-regulated ShcA expression, SB431542 strongly decreased the level of Snail mRNA to a level below the Snail mRNA expression in NMuMG cells with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s005">S4A Fig</xref>). A similar inhibition was observed when cells were treated with LY2109761, another TGF-β/activin type I receptor kinase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref048">48</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s005">S4B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, these cells reverted to an epithelial phenotype when treated with SB431542 or LY2109761. This was apparent by visual microscopic examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), immunofluorescence for E-cadherin at cell contacts and cortical actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), and immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and/or mRNA expression of mesenchymal fibronectin, vimentin, and N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s005">S4C–S4G Fig</xref>). Treatment of the cells with a neutralizing anti-TGF-β monoclonal antibody also repressed the EMT phenotype, but this repression was less complete when compared with the effects of SB431542 or LY2109761 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s005">S4B–S4D Fig</xref>), consistent with an inability to fully block autocrine TGF-β signaling using antibodies. Furthermore, SB431542 inhibited the invasion that resulted from down-regulation of ShcA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). As in NMuMG cells, SB431542 also induced HaCaT cells with down-regulated ShcA expression to revert from the mesenchymal into an epithelial phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4E–4G</xref>). Indeed, SB431542 repressed the enhanced expression of the Snail-related transcription factor Slug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s005">S4H Fig</xref>) and reverted the cells to an epithelial appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) with epithelial E-cadherin and actin staining and lack of fibronectin immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). These observations suggest that autocrine TGF-β signaling, to which all cells in culture are exposed, drives the observed EMT in cells with decreased ShcA expression. By extension, these data also suggest that down-regulation of ShcA expression confers increased sensitivity to autocrine TGF-β signaling.</p>

<p>We next evaluated the effect of transfected ShcA siRNA on autocrine and TGF-β-induced activation of Smad2 and Smad3, the major signaling effector in response to TGF-β. Without adding TGF-β, NMuMG cells showed marginally detectable Smad2 and Smad3 activation, visualized by immunoblotting for C-terminally phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<p>To better appreciate the consequence of the increased Smad3 activation, we examined the transcription from tandem Smad3-binding DNA sequences in luciferase reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). Transfection of ShcA siRNA, resulting in decreased ShcA expression, enhanced the basal Smad-mediated transcription in NMuMG and HaCaT cells, and increased the TGF-β-induced luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s006">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). The enhanced Smad activation in response to autocrine TGF-β signaling, or in response to added TGF-β, predicts that down-regulation of ShcA expression results in increased TGF-β target gene expression. This was indeed the case. Activation of Smad7 or PAI-1 mRNA expression is routinely used to monitor direct TGF-β-induced, Smad-mediated transcription activation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g005">Fig 5F and 5G</xref>, down-regulation of ShcA expression resulted in enhanced Smad7 and PAI-1 mRNA expression, which was prevented by blocking the TGF-β-induced Smad activation using SB431542. Decreased ShcA expression also enhanced Smad7 and PAI-1 expression in response to added TGF-β.</p>
<p>The increased autocrine induction of TGF-β target genes may be at the basis of the spontaneous EMT of NMuMG and HaCaT cells, when ShcA expression is down-regulated. Indeed, Snail mRNA expression in NMuMG cells and Slug mRNA expression in HaCaT cells were higher when ShcA expression was down-regulated, and these increases were prevented in the presence of SB431542 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g004">Fig 4A and 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s005">S4A and S4E Fig</xref>). Similarly, Twist and ZEB1 mRNA expression were enhanced upon down-regulation of ShcA expression in NMuMG and HaCaT cells, and these increases were repressed by SB431542 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s006">S5E–S5H Fig</xref>). With Snail directing the repression of E-cadherin expression in NMuMG cells, ShcA down-regulation resulted in lower E-cadherin mRNA expression, another hallmark of EMT in NMuMG cells, that was prevented in the presence of SB431542 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g005">Fig 5H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s006">S5I Fig</xref>). Finally, down-regulation of ShcA expression resulted in enhanced fibronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin mRNA expression, which was blocked by SB431542 and therefore depended on autocrine TGF-β signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g005">Fig 5I–5K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s006">S5J Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These data illustrate that decreasing ShcA expression results in enhanced autocrine TGF-β/Smad signaling, and consequently in enhanced TGF-β target gene responses, which drive or contribute to the spontaneous EMT response.</p>

<title>ShcA Competes with Smad3 for Binding to TβRI</title>
<p>We have previously shown that increased TGF-β receptor levels at the cell surface confer increased autocrine TGF-β signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref051">51</xref>]. Inhibition of ectodomain shedding, which enhances TβRI cell surface levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref049">49</xref>], or high glucose or insulin, which induce a rapid increase in TβRII and TβRI at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref051">51</xref>], both increase autocrine TGF-β signaling and TGF-β responsiveness. We therefore examined the cell surface TGF-β receptor levels using cell surface protein biotinylation in cells with decreased ShcA expression in comparison with control cells. Down-regulation of ShcA expression did not result in increased cell surface levels of TβRI or TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g006">Fig 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s007">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>), nor did it enhance the TβRI and TβRII mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s007">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>). We conclude that the increased autocrine TGF-β signaling does not result from increased cell surface levels of TGF-β receptors. Additionally, down-regulation of ShcA expression did not enhance the expression or release of TGF-β1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s007">S6E and S6F Fig</xref>), the major TGF-β made by NMuMG cells in culture, nor did it affect the generation of active TGF-β (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s007">S6F Fig</xref>) that could otherwise have accounted for increased autocrine TGF-β signaling.</p>

TβRI and TβRII levels in the cell lysates were visualized by immunoblotting. (B) Increasing quantities of transfected p52ShcA expression plasmid, in μg per well, decreased the TGF-β-induced Smad3 activation, shown by immunoblotting for pSmad3, in NMuMG cells. Immunoblotting reveals the total Smad3 levels, increasing levels of transfected p52ShcA-HA, and total levels of p52/p46ShcA, with GAPDH as loading control. (C) Increased expression of transfected p52ShcA in NMuMG cells decreased the TGF-β-induced Smad3 activation, assessed by anti-pSmad3 immunoblotting, and increased the TGF-β-induced Erk1/2 MAPK and Akt activation, assessed by immunoblotting for pErk1/2 and pAkt<sup>S473</sup>. Control panels show immunoblotting for Smad3, Erk1/2 MAPK, Akt, and GAPDH. (D) Increasing quantities of transfected p52ShcA plasmid, in μg per well, decrease the Smad3D407E association with TβRI, while increasing p52ShcA association, in TGF-β-treated 293T cells that were transfected to coexpress TβRII and TβRI. Smad3 or p52ShcA association with TβRI was visualized by anti-Flag immunoprecipitation of TβRI, followed by immunoblotting for Smad3 or HA-tagged p52ShcA, and Flag-tagged TβRI. Immunoblotting of the cell lysates shows p52/46ShcA levels, and TβRI and Smad3 levels, as well as GAPDH as loading control. (E) Increasing quantities of purified His-p52ShcA (shown in μg/incubation) interfere with binding of immunopurified Flag-tagged TβRI, isolated from TGF-β-treated 293T cells coexpressing TβRI and TβRII, to purified GST-Smad3. Immunoblotting of Flag-tagged TβRI adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-Smad3 reveals association of Smad3 with TβRI in the absence of ShcA and loss of associated TβRI in the presence of ShcA, while anti-Smad3 immunoblotting reveals the GST-Smad3 used in the experiments. The lowest panel shows TβRI that was not bound to GST-Smad3. Comparing lane three with lane seven shows that dephosphorylation of TβRI using λ-phosphatase prevents association of Smad3 with TβRI.

<p>We next explored whether inhibition of TGF-β-induced Smad activation by ShcA might explain the increased Smad activation when ShcA expression is decreased. Indeed, increasing levels of transfected p52ShcA expression plasmid, and thus of p52ShcA expression, decreased the level of TGF-β-induced Smad3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g006">Fig 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s007">S6G Fig</xref>). The decrease in Smad3 activation with increased p52ShcA expression correlated with enhanced levels of TGF-β-induced Erk MAPK and Akt activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). To visualize whether ShcA affected the transient interaction of Smad3 with TβRI that is required for Smad3 activation, we used a mutant of Smad3 with Asp407 replaced by Glu, which has enhanced affinity for TβRI, thus allowing detection of the TGF-β-induced Smad3-TβRI interaction by immunoprecipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref052">52</xref>]. Increasing ShcA expression resulted in a decreased interaction of Smad3D407E with the TGF-β-activated TβRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g006">Fig 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s007">S6H Fig</xref>). Since ShcA can interact with TβRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref012">12</xref>], this result suggests that Smad3 and ShcA may compete for binding to TβRI. To address directly the nature of the competition, we purified GST-Smad3 and His-tagged p52ShcA from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Immunopurified Flag-tagged TβRI, obtained from TGF-β-stimulated cells expressing tagged TβRII and TβRI, associated in vitro with glutathione-bound, purified GST-Smad3, and this interaction was prevented following dephosphorylation of TβRI by lambda phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g006">Fig 6E</xref>; compare lanes three and seven). Purified His-tagged p52ShcA prevented the association of GST-Smad3 with TβRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). These results suggest that ShcA binding to TβRI interferes with Smad3 binding to TβRI, and that steric incompatibility of ShcA and Smad3 binding may prevent TGF-β-induced Smad3 activation in the direct presence of ShcA. These results further suggest that ShcA expression is an important determinant of TGF-β-induced Smad activation.</p>

<title>ShcA Regulates Subcellular Compartmentalization of TβRI</title>
<p>Since p52ShcA interfered with the association of Smad3 with TβRI and promoted TGF-β-induced Erk MAPK activation, we evaluated whether it affected the compartmentalization of TβRI in clathrin-coated pits, where TGF-β-induced Smad signaling is initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref054">54</xref>].

<p>The TβRI receptor has also been shown to interact with caveolin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref057">57</xref>], a cholesterol-binding protein that is the major component of caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref059">59</xref>]. Increasing ShcA expression enhanced the association of TβRI with caveolin 1 in TGF-β-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g007">Fig 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s008">S7C Fig</xref>). In contrast, increasing the levels of coexpressed Smad3 decreased the interaction of TβRI with caveolin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g007">Fig 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s008">S7D Fig</xref>). Finally, decreasing the endogenous level of ShcA expression using siRNA modestly decreased the TGF-β-induced association of endogenous TβRI and caveolin 1 in NMuMG cells while increasing the association of TβRI with β2-adaptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g007">Fig 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s008">S7E and S7F Fig</xref>). Conversely, ShcA overexpression increased the interaction of TβRI with caveolin 1 and decreased its interaction with β2-adaptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g007">Fig 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002325.s008">S7E and S7F Fig</xref>). Together, these data support the notion that ShcA controls the partitioning of the TβRI receptors between the Smad-activating receptor complexes in clathrin-coated endosomes and caveolar microdomains.</p>
<p>A role of ShcA in defining this balance was further supported by sucrose gradient fractionation of lysates of NMuMG cells. In control cells, TβRI cofractionated with caveolin-1, with only minimal levels of TβRI in the fractions containing clathrin and the early endosomal marker, EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). TGF-β treatment induced association of some TβRI with the fractions containing clathrin and EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g007">Fig 7G</xref>), as expected since TGF-β induces Smad activation. Decreasing ShcA expression following lentiviral expression of ShcA shRNA resulted, in the absence of TGF-β treatment, in a less confined association of TβRI with caveolin-1 and a broader association of TβRI with the clathrin/EEA1 fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g007">Fig 7H</xref>). This increased TβRI association with clathrin/EEA1 fractions is consistent with ShcA’s role in sequestering TGF-β receptor complexes in caveolar microdomains, suggested by immunoprecipitation analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g007">Fig 7A–7E</xref>). It is also consistent with our finding that reduced ShcA expression results in increased autocrine TGF-β-induced Smad activation, which occurs in clathrin/EEA1 endosomes. The TβRI association with clathrin/EEA1 fractions was not much enhanced upon adding TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g007">Fig 7I</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ability of TGF-β to induce EMT is explained in part by the Smad-directed activation of EMT master transcription factor expression and functional cooperation of Smads with these transcription factors; yet, synergy with non-Smad signaling is essential for the realization of EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref026">26</xref>]. Since TGF-β induces Erk MAPK pathway activation through Tyr phosphorylation of p52ShcA, we addressed the role of ShcA in TGF-β-induced EMT of nontransformed epithelial cells. Unexpectedly, we found that the expression level of ShcA plays a role in the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype and in EMT, by balancing TGF-β-induced signaling. Specifically, our results revealed that (1) ShcA represses TGF-β-induced Smad activation, thus repressing autocrine TGF-β/Smad signaling, (2) ShcA enables differential compartmentalization of Smad signaling and ShcA-mediated non-Smad signaling in response to TGF-β, (3) ShcA expression helps to maintain the epithelial phenotype, and decreased ShcA expression promotes EMT resulting from increased autocrine TGF-β/Smad signaling.</p>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>ShcA Controls TGF-β-Induced Smad Activation and Signaling Responses</title>
<p>We previously reported that p52ShcA and p66ShcA can associate with the TβRI receptor and are phosphorylated by its kinase on Ser and Tyr, and that TGF-β-induced recruitment and Tyr phosphorylation of p52ShcA by TβRI enables TGF-β-induced Erk MAPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref012">12</xref>]. To address the role of ShcA in TGF-β-induced EMT, we used two epithelial cell lines, NMuMG and HaCaT cells that are commonly used to study EMT. Like most cells in culture, they express predominantly the p52 isoform of ShcA with lower levels of p66ShcA. Down-regulation of ShcA expression repressed the expression of all ShcA isoforms; targeted down-regulation of only p52ShcA cannot be done with the p52ShcA sequence fully comprised in p66ShcA. Our results demonstrate that decreasing ShcA expression enhances Smad signaling and, thus, that ShcA acts to repress Smad activation. This was apparent in the level of Smad3 activation and nuclear import in response to TGF-β and the activation of TGF-β/Smad target gene expression. These findings are consistent with results on the control of TGF-β signaling by a mutant p53 in human prostate carcinoma cell lines, showing that Smad2/3 activation is decreased upon overexpression of ShcA and enhanced when ShcA levels are reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref060">60</xref>]. The increased Smad3 activation when ShcA expression is down-regulated did not result from an increase in cell surface TGF-β receptors or from generation of active TGF-β by the cells, but from enhanced Smad3 recruitment to the activated TβRI. We found that p52ShcA attenuates TGF-β-induced association of Smad3 with TβRI through direct competition, as shown in cells coexpressing these signaling mediators and using purified proteins. As a result of this interference, ShcA expression, and in particular p52ShcA, acts as a cell-intrinsic determinant in the control of TGF-β-induced Smad activation and gene expression responses. p66ShcA has properties that are distinct from p52ShcA, e.g., through functional linkage with the oxidative stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref062">62</xref>] and was shown to oppose p52ShcA in RTK-induced Erk MAPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref063">63</xref>]. Whether p66ShcA also controls TGF-β-induced Smad and Erk MAPK activation, e.g., through competition with p52ShcA, remains to be seen.</p>

<title>ShcA Defines the Differential Compartmentalization of TGF-β-Induced Smad Signaling</title>
<p>TGF-β-induced Smad activation occurs in clathrin-coated pits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref054">54</xref>], and TGF-β receptors associate with β2-adaptin in clathrin-associated AP2 complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref055">55</xref>]. Conversely, TGF-β receptors are enriched in lipid-rich caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref064">64</xref>], and the TβRI receptor can associate with caveolin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref057">57</xref>]. Whereas TGF-β receptor degradation in caveolar microdomains dampens TGF-β responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref054">54</xref>], cholesterol depletion experiments correlate TβRI localization in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts with TGF-β-induced Erk MAPK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref064">64</xref>]. Additionally, TGF-β-induced Akt activation requires caveolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref065">65</xref>].

<p>We show that p52ShcA expression stabilizes the TβRI interaction with caveolin 1, while decreasing the TβRI association with the AP2 complex, consistent with the decreased TGF-β-induced Smad3 activation, and that depletion of ShcA expression decreases the TGF-β-induced TβRI interaction with caveolin 1, enabling a higher level of TβRI interaction with AP2. Membrane fractionation revealed that most TGF-β receptor complexes colocalize with caveolin 1 microdomains in unstimulated cells, and that ShcA down-regulation shifted a fraction of the receptors into clathrin-containing endosomal membranes, enabling increased Smad2/3 activation in response to autocrine TGF-β. We therefore conclude that ShcA controls the compartmentalized distribution of TGF-β receptors between clathrin-coated pits and caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002325.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Consistent with our observation that p52ShcA links TGF-β receptor activation with TGF-β-induced Erk MAPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref012">12</xref>], ShcA appears to balance the TGF-β response through Smad versus Erk MAPK pathway signaling. In RTK signaling or signaling through receptor-associated Tyr kinases, p52ShcA phosphorylation in caveolar membranes facilitates Erk MAPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref067">67</xref>]. The dual specificity kinase TGF-β receptors allow for a similar mode of Erk MAPK pathway activation in response to TGF-β, albeit to a much lower extent. Our findings also complement a recent observation that Dab2, an SH2 domain adaptor that interacts with TβRI and clathrin, and is required for TGF-β-induced Smad signaling, helps control the TβRI localization in clathrin endosomes and enhances its clathrin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref068">68</xref>]. It is conceivable that p52ShcA and Dab2 may have opposing roles in balancing Smad activation versus non-Smad responses.</p>
<p>Previous studies revealed that cells regulate their TGF-β responsiveness by controlling the levels of functional TGF-β receptors at the cell surface. High glucose and insulin enhance TGF-β responsiveness by inducing a rapid mobilization of TβRII and TβRI from intracellular stores to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref051">51</xref>]. Conversely, cleavage of cell surface TβRI by the membrane-associated metalloprotease TACE decreases the cell sensitivity to TGF-β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref049">49</xref>]. Our findings now present an alternative mechanism of controlling the TGF-β responses, in which ShcA defines the compartmentalization of cell surface TGF-β receptor complexes, balancing Smad-mediated responses against Erk MAPK pathway activation through ShcA. Compartmentalized balancing of TGF-β receptor signaling by ShcA may provide an as-yet-unappreciated level of control with scenarios that impact cell homeostasis and cancer progression, as increasingly valued for the spatial (de)regulation of RTK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref069">69</xref>].</p>

<title>Decreased ShcA Expression Attenuates the Epithelial Integrity and Promotes EMT</title>
<p>While much attention is given to the roles of Smads in driving the EMT gene expression program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref024">24</xref>], the MEK1/2-Erk MAPK pathway was shown to be required for TGF-β-induced EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref070">70</xref>], and blocking Akt or mTOR complex 2 activation prevents transition of epithelial cells into the mesenchymal phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref071">71</xref>]. These observations support a model that the Erk MAPK and Akt-mTOR pathways cooperate with Smad signaling in the elaboration of EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref024">24</xref>]. In the epithelial cells studied, decreasing ShcA expression resulted in attenuated Erk MAPK activation, consistent with the observation that targeted inactivation of ShcA expression attenuates growth factor-induced Erk MAPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref006">6</xref>], and with the presence of growth factors in serum that act through RTKs and thus activate Erk MAPK signaling. Down-regulated ShcA expression also attenuated Akt activation, suggesting a role of ShcA in coupling growth factor signaling to Akt activation, as proposed for some RTKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref004">4</xref>]. That increased Smad signaling in the context of attenuated Akt and Erk MAPK pathway activation leads to EMT in response to autocrine TGF-β signaling highlights the role of TGF-β-induced Smad signaling in EMT but does not argue against a requirement for Erk MAPK and Akt.</p>
<p>Our finding in nontransformed cells that ShcA protects epithelial cells from transitioning toward a mesenchymal phenotype, by repressing TGF-β/Smad activation, raises the possibility that carcinoma cells control through ShcA the EMT phenotype and, consequently, the invasive and stem cell phenotype and cancer dissemination. ShcA is expressed in many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>], but little is known about the control of ShcA expression, and most studies do not distinguish p52ShcA from p66ShcA expression, even though p66ShcA and p52ShcA have distinct functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref072">72</xref>]. Consistent with its role in mitogenic signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>], ShcA is required for breast cancer development in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref073">73</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry, however, reveals heterogeneity in ShcA expression among carcinomas with levels that are often lower than those in normal epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref074">74</xref>]. Moreover, mammary carcinoma cells that express a mutant ShcA lacking a functional phosphoTyr-binding PTB domain show increased expression of mesenchymal fibronectin and α5β1 integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref075">75</xref>], arguing that with impaired ShcA function the carcinoma cells might transition toward a mesenchymal phenotype. Distinct functions of p66SchA, with some antagonizing those of p52SchA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref060">60</xref>] may explain the complex roles of SchA in controlling epithelial plasticity of carcinomas. Accordingly, analyses of breast cancer cell lines suggest differential regulation of p52ShcA and p66ShcA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref076">76</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that carcinoma cells may down-regulate ShcA, or specifically p52ShcA expression, at sites of invasion, where cells undergo EMT. Whether differential p52ShcA and p66ShcA expression correlates with carcinoma cell behavior is an open question. Although in our nontransformed epithelial cells the ShcA expression level defines the sensitivity to EMT through modulation of TGF-β signaling, crosstalk of ShcA with oncogenic signaling may confer a more complex role of ShcA in the epithelial plasticity of cancer cells. Indeed, ShcA cooperates with Neu/ErbB2 signaling in the control of cell motility and invasion in transformed epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref077">77</xref>], through effects on focal adhesion turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref077">77</xref>], and increased p52/46ShcA levels enhance migration of prostate carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref060">60</xref>]. Additionally, p66ShcA overexpression promotes EMT in ErbB2-driven breast cancer cells, through up-regulated activation of the c-Met receptor by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref076">76</xref>]. It is unknown whether in this context p66ShcA antagonizes the role of p52ShcA, as seen in RTK responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref078">78</xref>]. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether ShcA contributes to epithelial plasticity responses when EMT is driven by increased RTK or Wnt signaling. Finally, consistent with the linkage of EMT with stem cell generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref041">41</xref>], decreased ShcA expression promoted stem cell generation, apparent by marker expression and mammosphere formation. Future studies will reveal whether p52ShcA and p66ShcA expression control cancer stem cell generation and tumor initiation.</p>

<p>Active TGF-β was quantified using TMLC reporter cells with an integrated TGF-β/Smad3-responsive luciferease expression unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref086">86</xref>]. NMuMG cells, transfected with control or ShcA siRNA, were grown in serum-free medium for 2 h, conditioned media were collected, concentrated using Pierce protein concentrator (Thermo scientific), and either kept at 4°C or heated at 80°C for 10 min to activate all latent TGF-β. The conditioned media samples were incubated with TMLC reporter cells in 12-well plates at a density of 150,000 cells/well for 12–16 h. In parallel, media samples with known concentrations of TGF-β were added to TMLC reporter cells to generate a standard curve. The luciferase activities of the conditioned media were calibrated against the standard curve TMLC reporter cells, allowing us to define the TGF-β concentration in conditioned media samples.</p>

<title>Subcellular Fractionation</title>
<p>NMuMG and HaCaT cells were grown to 80% confluence, serum starved for 2 h, treated with 2 ng/ml TGF-β for 30 min to 1 h, washed with cold PBS, and lysed with 0.5 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 11.0. The subcellular fractionation was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002325.ref054">54</xref>]. The cells were then homogenized using Dounce homogenizer with 15 tight strokes followed by three 20-s bursts of sonication (Vibra-Cell). The lysates were centrifuged for 800 g to remove debris, adjusted to 4 ml of 40% sucrose in 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, and placed at the bottom of ultracentrifuge tubes. Then 30% sucrose was overlaid, followed by 5% sucrose, to generate by centrifugation a discontinuous 5%–40% sucrose gradient. Centrifugation was at 38,000 rpm for 16–18 h using a Beckmann Coulter Optima L-90K ultracentrifuge and rotor SW41. Twelve 1 ml fractions were collected from the top of the tube and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.</p>

<title>qRT-PCR Analysis</title>
<p>To quantify ShcA, TβRI, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, fibronectin, Snail, Slug, Smad7, and PAI-I mRNA expression, NMuMG and HaCaT cells were treated with or without 2 ng/ml TGF-β, and RNA was isolated with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and used as a template for reverse transcriptase. mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR with IQ SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and normalized against RPL19 mRNA.

<p>Decreased ShcA expression promotes EMT in NMuMG and HaCaT cells. (A) Selective silencing of ShcA expression in NMuMG and HaCaT cells using transfected siRNA, i.e., siShc-a and siShc-b for NMuMG cells, and siShc-c and siShc-d for HaCaT cells. NMuMG and HaCaT cells were transfected with control or ShcA siRNA, and the immunoblotted p52ShcA band was quantified by densitometry. The graphs show averaged values of three independent experiments, relative to p52ShcA of control siRNA cells. Error bars indicate standard errors, based on three independent experiments. (B) ShcA mRNA quantified by qRT-PCR and normalized against RPL19 mRNA in NMuMG cells or HaCaT cells transfected with control siRNA or ShcA siRNA, i.e., siShc-a and siShc-b for NMuMG cells, or siShc-c and siShc-d for HaCaT cells. Error bars indicate standard errors, based on three independent experiments. (C, D) Immunoblots of EMT marker expression, i.e., E-cadherin, fibronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin, in NMuMG (C) and HaCaT (D) cells were quantified by densitometry. The graphs show averaged values of three independent experiments, relative to the marker expression in control siRNA cells. Error bars indicate standard errors, based on three independent experiments. (E) Compared to cells expressing a control shRNA, HaCaT cells infected to express shRNA targeting the 3’UTR of ShcA mRNA showed decreased ShcA expression, assessed by immunoblotting. Subsequent transfection with an siRNA-insensitive expression plasmid encoding p52ShcA resulted in increased p52ShcA expression. GAPDH immunoblotting was used as loading control. (F) Phase contrast microscopic images of HaCaT cells transfected with control or shRNA against the 3’UTR of ShcA mRNA and then rescued or not with a transfected p52ShcA plasmid. (G) Immunofluorecence detection of E-cadherin and fibronectin expression in HaCaT cells generated in (E) and shown in (F). (H) Expression of E-cadherin and fibronectin mRNAs in HaCaT cells generated in (E), quantified by qRT-PCR and normalized to RPL19 mRNA.
