What are the driving forces that lead to expression divergence in some genes and conserved expression in others? Here we employ flux balance analysis to address this question for metabolic genes. We consider the genome-scale metabolic model of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> and its entire space of optimal and near-optimal flux distributions. We show that this space reveals underlying evolutionary constraints on expression regulation, as well as on the conservation of the underlying gene sequences. Genes that have a high range of optimal flux levels tend to display divergent expression levels among different yeast strains and species. This suggests that gene regulation has diverged in those parts of the metabolic network that are less constrained. In addition, we show that genes that are active in a large fraction of the space of optimal solutions tend to have conserved sequences. This supports the possibility that there is less selective pressure to maintain genes that are relevant for only a small number of metabolic states.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>The regulation of gene product activity allows cells to efficiently cope with various tasks under varying conditions. Given that, one may have expected that striving for efficiency would cause genetically similar cells to have similar regulation. However, in reality, high variations in gene expression levels are detected between different strains and even between genetically identical cells taken from the same culture. What are the driving forces that lead to expression divergence in some genes and conserved expression in others?</p><p>To address this question, the authors study the conservation of regulation in yeast metabolism, using a computational model. They find that genes coding for reactions whose flux rates are narrowly constrained by the cellular need to maximize growth rate tend to have strictly conserved regulation and expression. However, when a wide range of flux rates is compatible with high cellular growth rates, the corresponding regulation and expression patterns are free to diverge. Furthermore, enzymes that participate in a large number of alternative metabolic behaviors tend to be encoded by genes with a highly conserved sequence. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that maintaining large variability in the overall expression and metabolic repertoire of the cell is under marked evolutionary selection.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>YB is supported by the Dewey David Stone Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Why do some of the genes monitored in these experiments manifest divergent expression values while the expression of others is constrained? We study this question from an evolutionary perspective in an in silico model of metabolism.</p><p>A key tool in studying metabolic networks is constraint-based modeling, which permits analysis of large-scale networks. Accurate prediction of dynamic metabolic activity requires kinetic models, but these rely on detailed information of the rates of enzyme activity, which is mostly unavailable, and are thus limited to small-scale networks. In contrast, constraint-based models use genome-scale networks to predict steady-state metabolic activity, regardless of specific enzyme kinetics. Stoichiometric, thermodynamic, flux capacity, and possibly other constraints are used to limit the space of possible flux distributions attainable by the metabolic network. Flux balance analysis (FBA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b009">9</xref>] is a specific, constraint-based method which assumes that the network is regulated to maximize or minimize a certain cellular function, which is usually taken to be the organism's growth rate. FBA has been successfully used for predicting growth, uptake rates, byproduct secretion, and growth following adaptive evolution, as well as other phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>The metabolic state predicted by FBA for a given growth media is not unique—in many cases there is a set of an infinite number of optimal solutions. Thus, we discuss here the <italic>optimal solution space,</italic> the space of all flux distributions leading to an optimal growth rate<italic>.</italic> On one hand, there are missing constraints in the model, and one line of research aims at reducing the solution space by adding biologically plausible constraints, e.g., by explicitly incorporating regulatory constraints in the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b015">15</xref>] and by looking for specific reactions for which new constraints may significantly reduce the size of the solution space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b016">16</xref>]. On the other hand, even though there are still probably some missing constraints in FBA models, it has already been demonstrated that the solution space of such models does carry meaningful biological information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b018">18</xref>]. Alternative optimal, steady-state flux solutions were shown to reflect redundant pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b019">19</xref>], and sampling of the FBA solution space has been used, for example, to identify correlated fluxes in the mitochondrial metabolic network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b018">18</xref>]. Moreover, Fong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b021">21</xref>] have shown that multiple biologically meaningful flux states are active in different conditions. However, this point has been largely ignored in many FBA studies which, focusing on a variety of other research questions, have examined an arbitrary single optimal solution.</p><p>Here we further pursue the possibility that the FBA solution space reflects multiple biologically meaningful metabolic states that are active in various conditions or under different evolutionary trajectories. We study the possibility that it reflects evolutionary constraints on expression and sequence of the associated genes. In particular, we focus on yeast metabolism using a recent genome-scale, fully compartmentalized model of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b022">22</xref>], which is one of the largest and most comprehensive metabolic models available for a microorganism. We show that by considering the entire FBA solution space we can identify constraints on the regulation of the associated genes, and thus predict which genes will have divergent expression levels among different yeast strains, and less conserved regulation among closely related species. In addition, we show that the sequences of genes that are active in multiple solutions tend to be highly conserved, suggesting that constraints on sequence divergence can also be discerned by studying the entire solution space. These results show that the space of FBA solutions, which emerges from a complex interplay between the stoichiometric constraints, the uptake rates defining the growth medium and the optimality assumption, is not just a technical consequence of our ignorance of additional constraints. Rather, this solution space sheds light on the evolution of metabolic regulation and of the metabolic network itself.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Conservation of Expression Regulation Is Reflected by the FBA Solution Space</title><p>Cellular metabolism is governed by various factors such as enzyme kinetics, allosteric control, and transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene and protein regulation. Specifically, the effect of transcriptional regulation on cellular metabolism was previously studied based on gene expression measurements, small-scale flux measurements, and large-scale flux predictions. Enzyme-coding genes that form metabolic pathways were shown to be expressed just-in-time when needed in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b023">23</xref>]. A strong qualitative correspondence between gene expression and metabolic fluxes for various pathways was shown in both bacteria and yeast, following environmental changes in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b024">24</xref>] and adaptive evolution in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b025">25</xref>]. Previous studies have also shown that the expression patterns of enzyme-coding genes are correlated with the flux patterns predicted by FBA. Schuster et al. and Famili et al. have shown that genes associated with fluxes that are predicted to change together during a shift from one medium to another (e.g., in diauxic shift) are co-expressed under these conditions (but this was done on a small scale, especially the analysis of Schuster et al.), while Reed and Palsson have shown that the genes associated with fluxes that are correlated within the solution space also exhibit moderate levels of correlation in their expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b027">27</xref>].</p><p>Here we identify a more direct relationship between expression and flux.

A reaction displays a broad range of values when there are alternative pathways to the one it belongs to. For example, when simulating glucose-rich conditions, the reaction along the glycolysis pathways that is catalyzed by Fba1, which converts fructose 1,6 bisphosphate into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, can have a flux approximately equal to that of glucose intake, or, alternatively, be bypassed completely via the pentose phosphate pathway.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020106-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020106.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Distribution of the 1,149 Modelled Metabolic Reactions according to Their Variability within the Space of Optimal Solutions for YPD</title><p>(A) Reactions with flux equal to zero in all optimal solutions.</p><p>(B) Reactions with the same, nonzero value in all optimal solutions.</p><p>(C) Reactions with low variability among optimal solutions <italic>(flexbility score between 0 and 10<sup>−2</sup>)</italic>.</p><p>(D) Reactions with medium variability among optimal solutions <italic>(flexbility score between 10<sup>−2</sup> and 1/2)</italic>.</p><p>(E) Reactions with high variability among optimal solutions <italic>(flexibility score at least 1/2)</italic>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020106.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>As flux values are significantly correlated with expression levels, we hypothesized that the range of possible optimal flux values for a given reaction reflects evolutionary constraints on the expression levels of its associated enzymes. Specifically, the regulation of reactions that have an optimal fixed value is under strong selection to maintain their flux at the precise levels needed, while the regulation of reactions that may have a broad range of optimal values is under weaker selection.</p><p>To pursue this possibility we used <italic>flux variability analysis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b019">19</xref>]: for each reaction we computed the maximal and minimal flux values attainable in the space of optimal flux distributions for growth conditions simulating YPD-rich media. We define the <italic>YPD flexibility score</italic> of a reaction as the difference between these maximal and minimal values. In addition, we performed a similar analysis, this time computing flux flexibility scores across 1,000 randomly generated growth media. In both cases, the flexibility score of a gene has been taken as the maximal score among the flexibility scores of the reactions it is associated with. Interestingly, we found that the YPD flexibility score is very similar to the flexibility scores found across the random media (mean Spearman rank correlation = 0.92), and focus on it in the sequel.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that genes with smaller YPD flexibility scores have tighter regulation, we studied the correlation between the genes' YPD flexibility scores, the conservation of their promoters, and their expression patterns. We used a score computed by Townsend, Cavalieri, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b002">2</xref>], which measured expression patterns for four yeast strains, obtaining an <italic>expression divergence score</italic> for each gene. Harbison, Gordon, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b031">31</xref>] constructed a comprehensive map of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> transcription factor binding sites, and for each site reported the number of yeast species (from among <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, and Saccharomyces bayanus</italic>) in which it is conserved. Based on this data, we assigned to each gene a <italic>promoter conservation score</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>)<italic>.</italic> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020106-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020106-g002">2</xref>B, both scores show moderate, statistically significant correlations with the YPD flexibility score; the Spearman rank correlation with expression divergence is 0.18 (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>, 469 genes), and is −0.18 with promoter conservation (<italic>p</italic>-value = 10<sup>−3</sup>, 330 genes). Although these statistically significant correlations are of moderate magnitude, taken together they support the hypothesis that low flexibility scores are associated with conserved regulation. We show that these results are robust with respect to the definition of the flexibility score and the analysis of near-optimal solution spaces in Table 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020106-sd003">Protocol S2</xref>.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020106-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020106.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Correlation of YPD Flexibility Score with Biological Measurements Reflecting Constraints on Regulation</title><p>(A) Mean expression divergence (from Townsend et al.) as a function of the gene's flexibility score;</p><p>(B) Mean promoter conservation score (based on Harbison et al.) as a function of the gene's flexibility score;</p><p>(C) Mean expression variance (from Ihmels et al.) as a function of the gene's flexibility score.</p><p>Genes are binned according to their flexibility score into five bins, such that each bin contains the same number of genes.

That is, their more flexible regulation does indeed manifest itself in increased expression variability.</p><p>A likely mechanism underlying these findings is that genes with high flexibility scores take part in pathways that have alternative ones for optimal growth. In some conditions one pathway is used, while in others the alternative is taken, leading to a variable expression pattern. This is reflected not only in the model, but also in comparison with lethality assays. Of the 50 genes with the highest flexibility scores, only 6% are essential for growth in YPD, whereas of the 89 that have a zero flexibility score, 17% are essential.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Conservation of Gene Sequence Is Reflected by the FBA Solution Space</title><p>Papp et al. have shown that enzyme-coding genes that according to FBA are active in several conditions tend to be more conserved in evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b033">33</xref>] and hence can be found in numerous organisms: they simulated nine representative growth media, and found an optimal flux distribution for each. They suggested that genes that are active (i.e., associated with reactions having nonzero flux) in only a few conditions are expected to be less conserved than their counterparts, since if these conditions become irrelevant, the gene may be lost. Indeed, they have shown that genes active in 0–7 conditions have, on average, fewer orthologs in other species than those that are active in eight or nine conditions.</p><p>We followed their analysis by carrying it out in a large-scale manner, and considered the entire optimal solution space rather than a single optimal solution. For each gene in the model we computed the fraction of 1,000 random growth media in which it is active using <italic>flux variability analysis</italic>. This value is the <italic>intercondition activity score</italic> of the reaction, and from it a similar score was deduced for the corresponding genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Rather than counting orthologs, as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b033">33</xref>], we compared this score directly with the evolutionary rate of the gene's sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b034">34</xref>], and found a statistically significant anticorrelation between them, both in random rich media (Spearman rank correlation = −0.27; <italic>p</italic>-value = 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; 238 genes), and in random poor media (Spearman rank correlation = −0.35; <italic>p</italic>-value = 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup>; 238 genes).</p><p>Surprisingly, sequence conservation can also be deduced from studying the solution space for a <italic>specific</italic> growth medium solely. To quantify the activity of yeast genes in rich media we computed for each gene a <italic>YPD activity score,</italic> reflecting the fraction of metabolic states in the near-optimal FBA solution space in which it is active (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Comparing this score to the evolutionary rate of the gene's sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b034">34</xref>], we find a statistically significant anticorrelation between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020106-g003">Figure 3</xref>; Spearman rank correlation = −0.37, <italic>p</italic>-value = 5 × 10<sup>−9</sup>, 234 genes), showing that the genes that are active at multiple metabolic states in a single growth media tend to be conserved. This correlation is also statistically significant when minimal–medium solutions are sampled, rather than those corresponding to YPD medium (Spearman rank correlation = −0.37, <italic>p</italic>-value = 3 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, 182 genes). One possible reason for this correlation is that it reflects the same trend observed already in multiple growth media: the metabolic network model captures stoichiometric-related constraints and nutrient limits, but may not include some environmental conditions. Hence, the FBA solution space for rich media may represent the various metabolic states that are optimal in rich media under different exogenous conditions, such as temperature or salinity. In other words, different metabolic states actually represent flux distributions under different conditions, and, as in the intercondition analysis, we expect that the sequence of genes that are required in many exogenous conditions will tend to be more conserved. Interestingly, the correlation observed in a single rich medium is higher than that obtained across multiple rich media, and remains statistically significant and qualitatively similar to that reported above when varying the near-optimality threshold of the solution space (Table 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020106-sd003">Protocol S2</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0020106-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020106.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Average YPD Activity Score as a Function of a Gene's Evolutionary Rate</title><p>Genes are binned by multiplying their evolutionary rate by 50, and rounding to the closest integer.

This correlation suggests that there is selection pressure to preserve the sequence of genes whose knockout has a notable effect on the growth rate of the organism. Repeating this analysis for the set of metabolic genes also revealed a statistically significant correlation between the knockout growth rate and evolutionary rate (Spearman rank correlation = 0.2, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.04, 103 genes). However, notably, the latter correlation is weaker than that observed between the YPD activity score and evolutionary rate, further supporting the claim that the activation of genes in multiple conditions is a selected trait.</p><p>Previously it was shown that the best predictor for evolutionary rate is the expression level of the encoded gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b035">35</xref>]. Other plausible measures for gene importance, such as the number of physical interactions, essentiality, and the drop of fitness following a knockout, were reported to explain only a small fraction of the variation in expression rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b036">36</xref>].

While some of them may be superfluous, arising from missing constraints, this study shows that as a whole, they are biologically meaningful. Three different possibilities for their interpretation suggest themselves: (i) effect of exogenous factors; (ii) alternative evolutionary pathways; and (iii) heterogeneity within a population.</p><sec id="s3a"><title/><sec id="s3a1"><title>(i) Effect of Exogenous Factors.</title><p>In addition to the growth medium simulated by the model, the metabolic behavior of an organism is also influenced by exogenous factors that are beyond the model's scope. Hence, it is plausible that the stoichiometric constraints allow for the existence of a variety of different metabolic states that are needed for growth in the given medium under the various different external conditions that the organism may encounter. The solution space represents the union of these different conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><title>(ii) Alternative Evolutionary Pathways.</title><p>It was suggested that the FBA solution space may contain alternative flux distributions that are attainable through different evolutionary paths, as was experimentally shown in an adaptive evolution experiment in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b025">25</xref>]. These experiments showed that although evolutionary endpoints may converge with respect to the selection pressure for high growth rate, the underlying metabolic states, characterized by measured metabolic fluxes and gene expression, may significantly diverge.</p></sec><sec id="s3a3"><title>(iii) Heterogeneity within a Population.</title><p>Previous studies suggest that the predicted variability in metabolic states may represent heterogeneous metabolic behaviors of individuals within a cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b019">19</xref>]. It is possible that the multiple metabolic states composing the space of optimal solutions represent this heterogeneity. This possibility is especially appealing in light of recent measurements of gene expression at the single-cell level, showing high variability in expression among cells taken from the same culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>We find support for all three interpretations. The observation that reactions that display a range of values within the space of optimal solutions tend to be associated with genes whose regulation is less conserved supports interpretation (ii); where optimality allows for different evolutionary paths to be taken, and the data suggests that they are indeed taken. This finding is in agreement with the previous experiments of bacterial adaptive evolution, showing that adaptive mechanisms evolved in the transcriptional regulatory network that governs their metabolic state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b020">20</xref>]. The correlation between the number of solutions in which a reaction is active and the conservation of the associated genes' sequence supports interpretation (i): The YPD activity score behaves similarly to the <italic>inter</italic>condition activity score, and thus may also be thought to reflect metabolic states across different (exogenous) conditions in YPD. But this finding can also be seen as supporting interpretation (ii)—enzymes that are active in multiple solutions, that is, according to interpretation (ii), appear in multiple strains, are more conserved. Indeed, as we find the YPD activity score to be a better predictor of sequence conservation than the intercondition activity score, it is likely that factors in addition in interpretation (i) play a role here.</p><p>Finally, the fact that reactions with variable flux values within the solution space tend to be associated with genes with variable expression patterns clearly supports interpretation (i), but can possibly also be seen as indirect support for interpretation (iii). While the expression variability we analyzed is based on averages over a population under different conditions, and interpretation (iii) addresses expression variability among individual cells in the same condition, it was suggested that these two measures of variability are related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b037">37</xref>]. If this is indeed the case, then the results above indirectly support the possibility that variability within the solution space is correlated with variability within a population. However, additional large-scale measurements of population expression variance are required to establish this possibility further.</p><p>In fact, interpretations (i)–(iii) are not inclusive, and may correlate with different regions within the solution space. This suggests the following view of this space: some solutions are superfluous, and exist only due to the lack of sufficient regulatory (and other) constraints within the model; the remainder solution space is composed of subspaces representing solutions attained via different evolutionary paths; these spaces may be further partitioned to sets of solutions that arise under different external conditions, representing heterogeneous phenotypes among genetically similar cells.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that genes with a high potential flux range have indeed fewer constraints on their regulation, and that genes that are active in multiple metabolic states tend to be highly conserved. These results emerge when studying the FBA solution space as a whole, clearly showing that it carries meaningful biological information.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Metabolic network model.</title><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> metabolic model used here is by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020106-b022">22</xref>].
