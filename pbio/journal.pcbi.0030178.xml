While genome-scale methods are available for identifying interacting proteins, they do not pinpoint the interacting motifs (e.g., a domain, sequence segments, a binding site, or a set of residues). Here, we develop and apply a method for delineating the interacting motifs of hub proteins (i.e., highly connected proteins). The method relies on the observation that proteins with common interaction partners tend to interact with these partners through a common interacting motif. The sole input for the method are binary protein interactions; neither sequence nor structure information is needed. The approach is evaluated by comparing the inferred interacting motifs with domain families defined for 368 proteins in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP). The positive predictive value of the method for detecting proteins with common SCOP families is 75% at sensitivity of 10%. Most of the inferred interacting motifs were significantly associated with sequence patterns, which could be responsible for the common interactions. We find that yeast hubs with multiple interacting motifs are more likely to be essential than hubs with one or two interacting motifs, thus rationalizing the previously observed correlation between essentiality and the number of interacting partners of a protein. We also find that yeast hubs with multiple interacting motifs evolve slower than the average protein, contrary to the hubs with one or two interacting motifs. The proposed method will help us discover unknown interacting motifs and provide biological insights about protein hubs and their roles in interaction networks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Recent advances in experimental methods have produced a deluge of protein–protein interactions data. However, these methods do not supply information on which specific protein regions are physically in contact during the interactions. Identifying these regions (interfaces) is fundamental for scientific disciplines that require detailed characterizations of protein interactions. In this work, we present a computational method that identifies groups of proteins with similar interfaces. This is achieved by relying on the observation that proteins with common interaction partners tend to interact through similar interfaces. The proposed method retrieves protein interactions from public data repositories and groups proteins that share a sensible number of interacting partners. Proteins within the same group are then labeled with the same “interacting motif” identifier (iMotif). The evaluation performed using known protein domains and structural binding sites suggests that the method is better suited for proteins with multiple interacting partners (hubs). Using yeast data, we show that the cellular essentiality of a gene better correlates with the number of interacting motifs than with the absolute number of interactions.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>RA is supported by a grant from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología (MCyT, BIO2002–03609).

Recently, several techniques such as two-hybrid assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b006">6</xref>] and affinity purifications followed by mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b009">9</xref>] have enabled large-scale identification of protein–protein interactions. While these efforts provide rich lists of interacting proteins, they do not produce information about the specific interfaces involved in each interaction.</p><p>Proteins interact through a limited set of interface types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b011">11</xref>]. These interfaces are usually key determinants of the function. Therefore, narrowing down protein–protein interactions to interactions between specific protein components (e.g., a domain, sequence segments, a binding site, or a set of residues) is important for a more accurate characterization of the function of proteins and their complexes. Identifying the protein interfaces that mediate interactions may also be useful for the prediction of unknown protein–protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b013">13</xref>], for homology-based protein annotation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b014">14</xref>], and for relating gene essentiality and network topology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b015">15</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, the description of protein interactions in terms of the interacting components has been based on protein structural domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b016">16</xref>], protein functional sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b017">17</xref>], and protein patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b018">18</xref>]. However, fully characterizing protein surfaces that are in contact with each other during an interaction requires the determination of the structure of protein complexes by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. These methods are not always applicable and thus the number of known 3-D atomic structures of proteins and their complexes is limited. As a result, accurate and general computational methods for identifying motifs involved in protein–protein interactions are needed.</p><p>Recently, several methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b025">25</xref>] have been developed to describe protein–protein interactions in terms of interacting protein domains, as defined in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b026">26</xref>], PFAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b027">27</xref>], and InterPro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b028">28</xref>] databases. However, while these methods find interactions between predefined protein domains, interactions between undefined domains remain undetected. Sequence-based methods overcome this problem by identifying sequence signatures that consistently co-occur in pairs of interacting protein sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b029">29</xref>], while structure-based methods can predict the amino acid residues that are in contact during a protein–protein interaction, but require information about the structures of both proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b033">33</xref>]. Recently, Kim et al. used known protein interactions and structures to characterize the interfaces between two interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b015">15</xref>]. They found that some previously accepted relationships between network topology and genomic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b036">36</xref>] are actually more reflective of the number of distinct binding interfaces. For example, highly connected proteins in the network (i.e., hubs) with multiple interfaces are twice as likely to be essential as hubs with one or two interfaces. The findings of Kim and coworkers clarify some previous analyses that related the observed essentiality of hubs with their high number of interacting partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b037">37</xref>] or with their interactions to other hubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b038">38</xref>]. Kim et al. also demonstrated that the evolutionary rate is significantly lower for multi-interface hubs than for the average protein, but not so for hubs with one or two interfaces.</p><p>Here, our basic assumption is that proteins with overlapping sets of interacting partners tend to interact with the common partners through the same interacting motif, such as a domain, sequence segments, a binding site, or a set of residues. A similar assumption has been previously used to annotate protein sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b041">41</xref>]. We first tested this assumption based on databases of protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b042">42</xref>] and protein domains defined in SCOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b026">26</xref>], observing that the assumption holds true for highly connected proteins (i.e., hubs in a protein–protein interaction network). Building on this validation, we then developed a method for identifying interacting motifs (iMotifs), which has been implemented within the protein–protein interaction framework and integration engine PIANA (Protein Interactions and Network Analysis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b042">42</xref>]. iMotifs are not required to be of any particular structural type or size, thus allowing us to characterize proteins and their interactions at different levels of resolution, ranging from full proteins to small binding sites. In contrast to other methods, our approach is not limited to finding predefined classes of interacting motifs, such as SCOP domains or PROSITE functional sites, and can be used to identify unknown interacting motifs. Moreover, the sole input for our method is binary protein interactions; neither structure nor sequence information is required to assign iMotifs to proteins.</p><p>Two main objectives have been addressed in this work. The first objective was to demonstrate whether protein interactions alone can be used to infer interacting motifs. The positive predictive value of our method in detecting proteins with common SCOP families was 75% at sensitivity of 10%, and the Spearman correlation coefficient between the number of iMotifs assigned to proteins and the number of interfaces found by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b015">15</xref>] was 0.57. The second objective was to examine if the conclusions on protein hubs of Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b015">15</xref>] hold for our iMotifs assignments. The results demonstrate that protein hubs with multiple iMotifs are more likely to be essential than hubs with one or two iMotifs and that protein hubs with multiple iMotifs evolve slower than the average protein in the dataset, as opposed to hubs with one or two iMotifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Proteins with Common Interaction Partners Tend to Share a SCOP Domain</title><p>The basic assumption behind this work is that proteins with overlapping sets of interaction partners tend to interact with those partners through a common interacting motif. The validity of this assumption was tested on a nonredundant set of 368 proteins with known SCOP domains (Material and Methods). Although SCOP does not classify proteins by their interfaces, SCOP domains were used as surrogates for iMotifs because protein interaction types can be defined by the domains in the interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b043">43</xref>].</p><p>We found the number of common interaction partners (<italic>N</italic>) to be a good indicator of the probability of two proteins having a domain in the same SCOP family, especially for highly connected proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030178-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). For example, 73% of protein pairs with 50–60 common interaction partners shared a SCOP domain.

Two proteins tend to have a common interacting motif only if they share direct physical interactions with the same partner(s). However, the likelihood of two proteins sharing a SCOP domain was lower by solely using yeast two-hybrid experimental data, a detection method that is more likely to contain binary protein interactions than other experimental methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b044">44</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030178-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Delineating Interacting Motifs</title><p>Based on the observation that highly connected proteins with common interaction partners tend to interact with them through a common interacting motif, we have developed a method that groups proteins with similar interacting motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030178-g001">Figure 1</xref> and Material and Methods section). Briefly, the procedure is carried out in four steps: 1) build a protein–protein interaction network; 2) initialize a cluster interaction network by assigning each protein of the network to a cluster; 3) iteratively create new clusters by fusing similar clusters (allowing a protein to be in more than one cluster) until the similarity score drops below a predefined threshold; and 4) label with a different interacting motif identifier (iMotif) each cluster with more than one protein and derive iMotif–iMotif interactions from the clustered network. In step 3), the similarity score between two clusters is their number of common interacting partners in the cluster interaction network (<italic>N</italic>). Assigning an iMotif to a group of proteins simply establishes that they have a certain feature that allows them to interact with the same set of partners, without determining the size, sequence, or structure of that feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030178-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Thus, an iMotif can be an interface consisting of a set of domains or only a specific constellation of a small number of residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030178-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030178-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030178.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Assigning iMotifs to Proteins and Identifying iMotif–iMotif Interactions</title><p>First, the protein interaction network is built.

Thus, different thresholds or metrics produce different iMotifs, corresponding to different levels of resolution in the description of protein–protein interactions. For example, the method can be applied at the resolution of domains from SCOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b026">26</xref>], and PFAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b027">27</xref>], or at the higher resolution of functional sites from PROSITE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b045">45</xref>]. In this section, we have evaluated the method on a nonredundant set of proteins (Material and Methods) for three different tasks: (i) detecting proteins with common SCOP domain families; (ii) predicting SCOP domain–domain interactions observed in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b046">46</xref>]; and (iii) predicting the number of distinct binding interfaces as defined by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b015">15</xref>]. Therefore, in the evaluation, iMotifs effectively represent SCOP family domains (for the first two tasks) and structural binding interfaces (for the third task).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Detecting Proteins with Domains in the Same SCOP Family</title><p>We evaluated the ability of the method to detect proteins with a domain in the same SCOP family (Methods).

The positive predictive value drops to ∼50% for <italic>N</italic> of 15, indicating that the accuracy of our method in detecting proteins with common SCOP family domains proportionally decreases with the number of common interacting partners. Therefore, the method should be preferentially applied to assigning interacting motifs to highly connected proteins.

Briefly, PRATT identifies sequence patterns common to a set of sequences. In this work, we selected significant sequence patterns for each iMotif by maximizing the number of proteins within the iMotif that contained the pattern. The significance (i.e., <italic>p</italic>-value) of a sequence pattern assigned to an iMotif depends on the occurrence of the pattern in the iMotif with respect the whole dataset. As shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030178-g006">Figure 6</xref>, 80% of iMotifs had a specific sequence pattern contained in at least 74% of their proteins (using a <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff of 10<sup>−8</sup>).

This reduction, in turn, increased the correlation between the number of binding sites from Kim et al.

Our approach obtained high positive predictive value for identifying proteins with domains from the same SCOP family and predicting domain–domain interactions. We also analyzed hub proteins and their properties based on the number of iMotif assigned to them, obtaining similar findings to those in an independent approach that rely on protein structure information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b015">15</xref>].</p><p>Recent estimates suggested that only one-fifth of interaction types are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b043">43</xref>]. Therefore, current knowledge of protein structures is not sufficient to describe all protein interaction types. Our approach, in contrast to other previously described methods, accomplishes three different objectives: (i) it predicts the number of different iMotifs in a protein, (ii) it classifies proteins by their predicted iMotifs, and (iii) it predicts interactions between the iMotifs. The method can identify iMotifs independently of structural or sequence information; it can assign an iMotif to two structural domains or two iMotifs to a single domain. Since the resolution at which iMotifs describe protein interfaces depends on the similarity metric used and the threshold applied by the method, iMotif assignments can be used to infer whether the interaction is mediated through multiple, single, or partial domains. On the one hand, setting a high threshold on the number of common interaction partners (<italic>N</italic>) will assign few iMotifs to reduced sets of proteins (i.e., very specific and restrictive iMotifs). On the other hand, using low <italic>N</italic> thresholds will assign the same iMotif to broad numbers of proteins (i.e., very unspecific and general iMotifs). We showed that the method works better for highly connected proteins and using high values for <italic>N</italic>. Moreover, our approach is not limited to finding predefined classes of protein components and thus allows us to predict new types of interacting motifs. For example, an iMotif can be mapped to a predefined class (e.g., a SCOP domain or a PROSITE functional site) by examining the known classes assigned to proteins with that iMotif. Therefore, iMotifs that remain unmapped are likely candidates for unknown classes. Such predictions may prove useful for target selection in structural genomics.</p><p>Relying solely on experimentally detected interactions affects the accuracy of our method. It has been shown that high-throughput experiments have limited reliability and that many of the detected interactions are probably not direct (i.e., they are carried out through a third protein) or do not even exist (i.e., false positives) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b052">52</xref>]. However, we did not observe an improvement by solely using interactions from yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030178-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B), the high-throughput method that is best suited to detect direct interactions. As more interaction data becomes available, we will reexamine the effects of restricting the method to employ interactions specifically labeled as “direct” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b006">6</xref>]. One way of avoiding these limitations is to calculate similarity scores using families of proteins instead of absolute numbers of protein partners. This will prevent assigning the same iMotif to proteins that have many common partners but all of them belong to a single protein family. Removal of redundancy from the sets of partners indeed increases the percentage of identified protein pairs with a common domain family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030178-sg007">Figure S7</xref>).</p><p>The combination of iMotif assignments with sequence search methods identified specific sequence patterns in iMotifs. We found that most iMotifs had a significant sequence pattern that was contained in most of the iMotif proteins. These patterns, which could be responsible for the iMotif proteins common interactions, could then be used to: (i) localize the iMotif in the protein sequence, (ii) assign iMotifs to proteins for which no interaction data is yet available, and (iii) predict interactions between proteins that contain patterns assigned to two interacting iMotifs.</p><p>Our iMotif assignments are similar to those obtained using an independent approach, which relies not only on known protein–protein interactions, but also on protein structure information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b015">15</xref>]. In agreement with the results of Kim et al.<italic>,</italic> we observe different properties between hubs with multiple iMotifs (multi-iMotif) and hubs with one or two iMotifs (singlish-iMotif). In particular, we find that (i) multi-iMotif hubs are more likely than singlish-iMotif hubs to be essential for cell viability, and (ii) multi-iMotif hubs, in contrast to singlish-iMotif hubs, evolve slower than the average protein. Furthermore, we have also observed a correlation between the number of iMotifs of a hub and its essentiality for cell survival. The properties observed for hubs with respect to their number of iMotifs may reflect the difference between proteins with multiple simultaneously possible interactions (multi-iMotif hubs are probably involved in permanent complexes) and proteins with multiple exclusive interactions (for singlish-iMotif hubs involved in transient interactions). This is in agreement with the previous observation that interfaces of transient protein–protein interactions are less restricted in evolution than interfaces in permanent complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b053">53</xref>].</p><p>Our results extend the findings and conclusions of Kim and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b015">15</xref>] to proteins of unknown structure.

Interactions between non-initial clusters are not considered for calculating the similarity scores.</p><p>Fourth, each cluster with more than one protein is labeled with a different interacting motif identifier (iMotif), and that iMotif is assigned to all proteins within that cluster. iMotif–iMotif interactions are then derived from interactions in the cluster interaction network where both sides of the interaction have been labeled with an iMotif identifier.</p><p>For example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030178-g001">Figure 1</xref>), a proteome of six proteins (namely A, B, C, D, E, and F) forms a network of interactions that connects proteins A with B, C, and D, and protein E with B, C, D, and F (step 1). Our method starts by creating a cluster interaction network from the network of protein interactions (i.e., six clusters with seven interactions) (step 2). Next, the clusters that share the largest number of common interactions are fused (i.e., clusters 1 and 5, with three common interactions, are fused into a new cluster 7). This step is then repeated until the maximum similarity score between the clusters drops below a predefined threshold (i.e., <italic>N</italic> = 2 common interactions). Thus, the iterative process will run for another iteration creating a new cluster (cluster 8) by fusing clusters 2, 3, and 4, which have two common interactions (step 3). Once the iterative process is finished, the method assigns iMotif identifiers to all proteins in clusters with more than one protein (i.e., proteins A and E in cluster 7 share iMotif 1, and proteins B, C, and D in cluster 8 share iMotif 2) (step 4).

Among these positives, we define as true positives those proteins that have a common SCOP family code with the query protein. Moreover, we define as false negatives the proteins that have the same SCOP family code as the query protein but were not found by the method to share an iMotif.</p><p>iMotif–iMotif interaction predictions were evaluated against interacting SCOP families obtained from the PDB. Two SCOP domains were considered to interact if they were co-crystallized and had at least two atoms within 5 Å distance. Because we are interested in domain interactions at the protein–protein interaction level, we excluded intrachain interactions from this set. Our method creates a list of putative domain–domain interactions for each predicted iMotif–iMotif interaction by assuming that all domains of the query protein with one iMotif interact with all domains of proteins with the other iMotif. In this context, we define as positive any iMotif–iMotif interaction where the query protein is involved. A positive is then considered a true prediction if at least one of its putative domain–domain interactions is observed in the PDB. Finally, false negatives are interactions observed in the PDB for SCOP families of the query protein that do not appear in any list of putative SCOP family interactions.</p><p>To avoid biases in the evaluation, only proteins from the test set (before removing redundancy) and their SCOP families were considered when counting positives and negatives. The positive predictive value is defined as the number of true positives over the total number of positives, and sensitivity is the number of true positives over the sum of true positives and false negatives. The positive predictive value and sensitivity were calculated with respect to the similarity score threshold used for stopping the clustering. We also define the applicability of the method as the percentage of proteins with at least one positive under a given threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Extracting sequence patterns from iMotifs.</title><p>For each group of protein sequences with a given iMotif, sequence signatures were generated using the PRATT program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030178-b050">50</xref>], a software tool capable of finding flexible sequence patterns from a set of unaligned sequences.
