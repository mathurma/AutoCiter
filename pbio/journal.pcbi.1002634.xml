        <p>Multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations occur in a wide variety of biological organisms from bacteria to humans as well as financial, chemical and complex physical systems. Multistability refers to noise driven switches between multiple weakly stable states. Scale-invariant fluctuations arise when there is an approximately constant ratio between the mean and standard deviation of a system's fluctuations. Both are an important property of human perception, movement, decision making and computation and they occur together in the human alpha rhythm, imparting it with complex dynamical behavior. Here, we elucidate their fundamental dynamical mechanisms in a canonical model of nonlinear bifurcations under stochastic fluctuations. We find that the co-occurrence of multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations mandates two important dynamical properties: Multistability arises in the presence of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, which generates co-existing attractors, whilst the introduction of multiplicative (state-dependent) noise ensures that as the system jumps between these attractors, fluctuations remain in constant proportion to their mean and their temporal statistics become long-tailed. The simple algebraic construction of this model affords a systematic analysis of the contribution of stochastic and nonlinear processes to cortical rhythms, complementing a recently proposed biophysical model. Similar dynamics also occur in a kinetic model of gene regulation, suggesting universality across a broad class of biological phenomena.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Biological systems are able to adapt to rapidly and widely changing environments. Many biological organisms employ two distinct mechanisms that improve their survival in these circumstances: Firstly they exhibit rapid, qualitative changes in their internal dynamics; secondly they possess the ability to respond to change that is not absolute, but scales in proportion to the underlying intensity of the environment. In this paper, we study a simple class of noisy, dynamical systems that mathematically represent a very broad range of more complex models. We hence show how a combination of nonlinear instabilities and state-dependent noise in this model is able to unify these two apparently distinct biological phenomena. To illustrate its unifying potential, this simple model is applied to two very distinct biological processes – the spontaneous activity of the human cortex (i.e. when subjects are at rest), and genetic regulation in a bacteriophage. We also provide proof of principle that our model can be inverted from empirical data, allowing estimation of the parameters that express the nonlinear and stochastic influences at play in the underlying system.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Biological systems are optimized to survive in environments whose properties may vary greatly, such as changes in the biochemical environment of bacteria across several orders of magnitude, or even qualitatively, such as seasonal variations that banish food sources and prohibit foraging behavior in some mammalian species. Multistable dynamics and scale-invariant fluctuations are two complex dynamical processes whose presence in a wide variety of biological organisms suggests an adaptive role where they occur. The former enables switching amongst a wide variety of dynamical scenarios, whereas the latter ensures sensitivity to environmental fluctuations even if their background ambient intensity scales across several orders of magnitude. Their co-existence would allow a system to express two (or more) fundamentally distinct dynamical behaviors whilst maintaining scale-invariant fluctuations within and between each of these. The objective of this paper is to elucidate the basic dynamical mechanisms of these two phenomena and show how they can be studied within a unifying framework. We take the human alpha rhythm, which exhibits both multistability and scale invariant fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer1">[1]</xref>, as a paradigmatic example and show how a recently proposed biophysical mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref> is a specific example of the present, more general dynamical framework. We also investigate multistable dynamics in a kinetic model of gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Hasty1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mathematically, multistability corresponds to the presence of multiple concurrent state-space attractors, each with their own basin of attraction. System noise is required to erratically knock the system's state vector from attractor to attractor (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Tsuda1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Braun1">[5]</xref>. A classic example in the human perceptual system is binocular rivalry, the abrupt alternations between two discrete percepts that occur when different images are presented to each eye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Attneave1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Blake1">[7]</xref>. Multistability is also found in the human motor system, for example when paced finger tapping switches between anti-syncopation and syncopation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Bressler1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Haken1">[9]</xref>. In the setting of perceptual decision-making, multistability between both possible choices is thought to arise just before the outcome of a two alternative choice task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Deco1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Roxin1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Wang1">[12]</xref>. Multistability has been reported in a wide variety of other biological contexts - including the cellular mechanisms of working memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Durstewitz1">[13]</xref>, and gene expression, where it underlies cellular differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Kelemen1">[14]</xref> and epigenetic variability in genetically identical cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Gordon1">[15]</xref>. These observations motivate the search for generic mechanisms not limited to a specific model or context.</p>
      <p>In the framework of dynamical systems, multistability corresponds to the exploration of a multi-attractor landscape under the influence of system noise. Although the nature of the dynamical landscape has been extensively mapped, system noise is almost invariably introduced in biological contexts as an additive stochastic term. This contrasts with the treatment of stochastic effects in econometrics, where a complex relationship between trade volume (system activity) and volatility (system stochasticity) is a well-known property of financial systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Bekaert1">[16]</xref>. This more complex, state-dependent relationship is also observed in a wide variety of biological organisms including bacterial chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Tu1">[17]</xref> as well as complex physical systems. State-dependent fluctuations are arguably a defining feature of human cognition, being present in perception (the “Weber-Fechner law”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Weber1">[18]</xref>), movement (“Fitt's law”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Harris1">[19]</xref>) and even computation (“Hick's law”) where such operations appear to underlie nonverbal numerical processing in humans and monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Cantlon1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Cordes1">[21]</xref> and infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Izard1">[22]</xref>. The almost ubiquitous observation of “state-dependent computations” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Buonomano1">[23]</xref> challenges the approach of simply adding system noise to dynamical states in computational models of the brain. Hence, state-dependent fluctuations and multistability are both present in the perceptual, cognitive and motor systems of the brain, ostensibly allowing the brain to adopt distinct functional modes, whilst ensuring uncertainty can be represented adaptively within and between these modes. For example, perceptual switching during binocular rivalry between visual stimuli differing by an order of magnitude along at least one physical dimension (such as contrast) would necessitate tight coupling of bistability and scale-invariant fluctuations in visual cortex in order to ensure equivalent perceptual representations across transitions. More generally, consider a distributed perceptual system that encodes its beliefs about hidden sensory causes in its mean state, whilst the precision of those beliefs is encoded in the dispersion of those states (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Friston1">[24]</xref>). Accordingly, in the presence of perceptual ambiguity, the co-existence of state-dependent fluctuations and multistability would allow such a system to switch between several competing perceptual representations whilst keeping the precision of those beliefs relatively constant. Without this coupling, beliefs regarding the more intense aspects of the external environment would inevitably be held with greater precision regardless of their veracity.</p>
      <p>Spontaneous activity of the human cortex is dominated by high amplitude 10 Hz oscillations, strongest over the posterior cortex - the so-called alpha rhythm. Knowledge of the human alpha rhythm dates back to the earliest recordings of electro-cortical activity by Hans Berger in 1924, yet its mechanisms remain poorly understood. In contrast to the widely held belief that the human alpha rhythm continuously “waxes and wanes”, it rather bursts erratically between two distinct ‘modes of activity’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer1">[1]</xref>. Temporal fluctuations of power in each of these modes are not constant, but rather scale in proportion to the mean power of the modes. Spontaneous activity of the human cortex hence exhibits clear evidence of both multistability and scale-free invariance. A biophysical mechanism for these key features of the human alpha rhythm was recently established in a model of large-scale brain activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref>. This neural field model describes the large-scale dynamics of corticothalmic activity, constrained by key neurophysiological properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Robinson1">[25]</xref>. When endowed with appropriate biophysical properties, this model showed a remarkable concordance with the multistable properties of the human alpha rhythm. A crucial process underlying this convergence between theory and experiment was the state-dependent gating of stochastic inputs to the specific thalamic nucleus (the key relay centre of the brain) by oscillatory feedback from the cortex. Proximity of voltage-dependent NMDA channels to ligand-gated ion channels was proposed to underlie this key “state dependent” innovation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Stephan1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The biophysical model employed by Freyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref> has been validated across a wide range of states of arousal hence positioning this finding within a broad and unifying account of cortical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Robinson2">[27]</xref>. However, whilst Freyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref> add an explanation of the alpha rhythm to this framework, they do not elucidate the deeper dynamical mechanisms at play, or whether they could be achieved by other model innovations. The objective of the present study is to address this in a simple algebraic (“normal form”) model of multistable oscillations and discuss the broader implications for other complex biological systems by demonstrating the same phenomena in a modulatory genetic network.</p>

        <p>To provide an orientation for the present purposes, the quantitative properties of resting state, eyes closed EEG data are briefly re-iterated (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for data acquisition and analysis). In addition to exemplifying the properties of multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations, analyses of all subsequent modeled systems follow the same principles as those employed here.</p>
        <p>Fluctuations in power of 10 Hz oscillations burst erratically between a low amplitude mode and highly variable large amplitude excursions, which range across several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g001">Figure 1c,d</xref>). When viewed in double logarithmic coordinates, the PDFs derived from these time series exhibit clear bimodality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Each of these modes can be well described with a simple exponential PDF of the form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <italic>x</italic> is the power and <italic>γ</italic> is the corresponding shape parameter. The overall time series is closely described by their sum. To formally compare the bimodal to the unimodal fit, we compare their Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values. The better model will yield lower BIC values, reflecting small residual variances after penalization for the number of free parameters. Crucially, although the peaks of these modes differ by several orders of magnitude, when viewed in these double logarithmic coordinates their relative widths are almost identical: This shows that their standard deviation (SD) scales in proportion to their mean.</p>

        <p>The “dwell time” statistics further characterize the properties of these fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Nakamura1">[28]</xref>. These are defined as the successive durations that the system resides in each of the two modes (the boundary between the modes is defined by the crossing of the exponentials) and can be understood by inspecting their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). For switching driven by a classic stochastic process - a simple Poisson process - the dwell time distributions conform to a simple exponential form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> evident as a straight line with slope -<italic>a</italic> in semi-logarithmic coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). In contrast, the empirical dwell time distributions in alpha fluctuations show evidence of long tailed statistics, which are well described by stretched exponentials of the form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The parameter <italic>b</italic> captures the stretch, which imbues the dwell times with “fat right hand tails” and reflects the tendency of the system to be increasingly trapped in one state or another for 0&lt;<italic>b</italic>&lt;1. That is, the longer the system stays in one mode, the lower the likelihood of a switch to the other mode, in contrast to a Poisson process which has a constant failure rate.</p>

        <p>As reviewed above, multistability occurs in dynamic systems when system noise causes the states to jump between two or more co-occurring phase-space attractors, each with their own basin of attraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Gardiner1">[29]</xref>. While a number of dynamical scenarios with different sets of attractors can give rise to multistability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Spiegler1">[30]</xref>, the multistable behavior of the alpha rhythm suggests a particular setting. Given that the human alpha rhythm jumps between a low amplitude mode and a high amplitude oscillatory waveform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Stam1">[31]</xref>, bistability in this setting likely reflects switching between a fixed point and a limit cycle attractor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref>. In particular, whereas high amplitude alpha oscillations are strongly nonlinear, the low power fluctuations lack nonlinear structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Stam1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Breakspear1">[32]</xref>, arguing that the low amplitude mode more likely corresponds to fluctuations around a fixed point rather than a second limit cycle. Although the co-existence of these attractors can arise in a wide class of models describing complex systems, all are mathematically equivalent to the normal form of a Hopf bifurcation. A normal or canonical form is a set of reduced, approximating equations which are considered to preserve the essential features of the original system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Strogatz1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Murdock1">[34]</xref>. Normal forms are usually analytically solvable and therefore allow a deeper insight into the geometric structure of the approximating equations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Josic1">[35]</xref>. Here we study the general normal form of a Hopf bifurcation, namely<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002634.e004"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1002634.e005"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>(1) describes the amplitude dynamics with shape parameter λ and bifurcation parameter <italic>β</italic> (see below). (2) describes the dynamics of the system's phase. The function f(r) defines the relationship between amplitude and phase, i.e. the phase dynamics is amplitude dependent if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the present paper we solely focus on the amplitude dynamics, and for reasons of simplicity we will only consider the case of a constant phase velocity, θ<sub>c</sub> = 10 Hz with f(r) = 0. Note that (1) is an odd function so that whatever holds for r&gt;0 also holds for r&lt;0 (because the amplitude and its derivative are both inverted). Hence, without loss of generality we need only consider the case r≥0.</p>
        <p>Because (1) is always zero for <italic>r</italic> = 0, the system always has a fixed point at the origin. This fixed point is an attractor if the RHS of (1) is negative in the immediate neighborhood of zero. Otherwise it is a repellor. If it is negative for all r&gt;0 then the origin is the system's <italic>global attractor</italic>. However this fifth degree polynomial can have at least two positive roots and, due to the rotation introduced by (2), the system can hence have up to two limit cycles of finite positive amplitude <italic>R</italic>. Any such limit cycle will be an attractor if the sign of (1) is positive for <italic>r</italic>&lt;<italic>R</italic> and negative for <italic>r&gt;R</italic>. Otherwise it will be a repellor. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, we consider a variety of scenarios with the shape parameter fixed at <italic>λ</italic> = 4 and different values of the bifurcation parameter <italic>β</italic>. In the first case (red; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the RHS of (1) is strictly negative (leftward moving) for <italic>r</italic>&gt;0 and hence the origin is the system's global attractor. However as <italic>β</italic> increases, the local maximum at r∼1.5 crosses zero at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, ensuring two limit cycles. The preceding geometric considerations imply that there is hence an unstable repellor (at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and a stable attractor (at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). An example (blue) is given for <italic>β</italic> = −2. With a further increase in <italic>β</italic>, the limit cycle repellor migrates inward and eventually (at <italic>β</italic> = 0) collides with the fixed point. Following this bifurcation (i.e. for <italic>β</italic>&gt;0) geometry reveals that the fixed point is a repellor and the outer (and now only) limit cycle is the system's global attractor. Panel (b) shows the three possible roots of (1) plotted across a continuous range of <italic>β</italic> with locations of the three preceding scenarios indicated accordingly. This plot reveals the continuous unfolding of the three scenarios just outlined, with the abrupt discontinuities - heralding bifurcations - at <italic>β</italic> = −4 and <italic>β</italic> = 0. This is the canonical <italic>sub-critical</italic> Hopf bifurcation, so-called because limit cycle solutions occur below the loss of stability of the fixed point at <italic>β</italic> = 0. Generally, bistability is confined to the region <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where the attracting fixed point and attracting limit cycles have basins of attraction separated by the unstable limit cycle (hence also called a <italic>seperatrix</italic> or <italic>basin boundary</italic>).</p>

The limit cycle repellor - necessary for the subcritical Hopf bifurcation and hence bistability - occurs across a broad region of parameter space (one example in blue) and can hence be considered a <italic>structurally stable</italic> solution to the system. However, for <italic>λ</italic>&lt;0, the quintic polynomial (1) has at most two zero crossings, i.e. two attractors. For <italic>β</italic>&lt;0 the only attractor is at the origin <italic>r</italic> = 0, and as <italic>β</italic> increases through <italic>β</italic> = 0 (far left panels, red to green), this fixed point loses stability in favor of a single limit cycle attractor that grows continuously in amplitude from the origin.

        <p>This system hence captures the complete family of Hopf bifurcations with a continuous transition between the super- and subcritical cases. A third order (cubic) polynomial is sufficient to model either a super-critical <italic>or</italic> a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, but not both (i.e. there is no single cubic function that allows a smooth transition between the two). The fifth order term can be thought of as a higher order “correction term” that allows one to model a physical system that could, in principle, express either a subcritical or a supercritical bifurcation depending on the smooth tuning of a control parameter (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Strogatz1">[33]</xref>).

As expected, for sufficient noise amplitude (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) switching between low and high amplitude modes occurs exclusively in the region of bistability (blue; middle column). However, the corresponding bimodal PDF exhibits an obvious deviation from the empirical data (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g004">Figure 4e</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Whilst the mean increases by two orders of magnitude from the low to the high amplitude fluctuations, the standard deviation is constant. Hence in these double logarithmic coordinates, the high power mode is clearly thinner than its low power counterpart. A theoretical exponential PDF with the empirically motivated proportional scaling between mean and standard deviation (shown in red) is thus a poor fit to the second mode in these numerical data. The progressive thinning of the standard deviation with the increasing mean is also evident when comparing the difference between the PDFs of the unimodal fixed point (red; left column) and unimodal limit cycle (green; right column) solutions. Naturally the standard deviations in all three cases are of equivalent size because the fluctuations arise from the same term. The PDFs only appear thinner when viewed in logarithmic coordinates.</p>

This leads to a rapid and permanent “quenching” of the system's activity and is thus of no further interest. Setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> prevents this, whilst also allowing the multiplicative term to play an increasingly dominant influence away from the origin.<disp-formula/></p>
          <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g005">Figure 5</xref>, this system exhibits very close agreement with the bistable properties of human EEG (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g004">Figure 4</xref>, it is clear that the standard deviation now scales in proportion to the mean and, additionally, the dwell time distributions follow a stretched exponential form. This also affords insight into the origin of the trapping (long right hand tails) in the dwell time distributions: When the system first switches crosses the seperatrix into the low power mode, the noise terms exert a relatively strong influence, implying that a switch back across the seperatrix (into the high power mode) is reasonably likely. However, if by chance the system does not cross but instead approaches zero, the state-dependent stochastic term diminishes in influence and the system is relatively less likely to be perturbed back into the high power mode. Hence switching likelihood diminishes smoothly with dwell time (survival). Conversely, when the system crosses the separatrix into the right hand mode, the state-dependent term increases in effective strength, driving the system towards the erratic high amplitude fluctuations visible in the time series and trapping the system in the high power mode.</p>

        <p>Whilst these basic processes are present in most human EEG recordings, there exists considerable inter-subject variability in the degree of bimodality, the relative height of the two modes and the stretch of the dwell time distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer1">[1]</xref>; see supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002634.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Can these high-order statistics be used for subject-specific parameter estimation when inverting models of large-scale cortical activity? We exploit the simple parametric form of (4) by systematically varying the deterministic and stochastic terms and obtaining numerical time series, from which we estimate system statistics describing the extent of the bimodality and the shapes of the dwell time distributions for the two modes. This allows a proof of principle that the model parameters could be inferred from empirical time series data.</p>
        <p>The results for four summary statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g006">Figure 6</xref>, with attention restricted to regions in parameter space where bimodal activity arises. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g006">Figure 6a–<bold>d</bold></xref> show the impact of varying the two noise parameters ρ and η, while the model's shape and bifurcation parameters λ and β are varied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g006">Figure 6<bold>e–g</bold></xref>.

        <p>There are several noteworthy features of these plots: Firstly, the curves are well behaved (no smoothing has been applied) and are either monotonic in cross section, or unimodal. A specific experimentally derived estimate of any of the system statistics hence constrains the value of underlying system parameters to a relatively simple curve or loop (corresponding to contour lines) in each of these spaces. Secondly, although there do exist correlations between some of the parameters, they are sufficiently distinct that combining multiple system statistics generally further constrains the underlying parameter values. For example, the contours in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g006">Figure 6e</xref> for the BIC values are generally orthogonal to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g006">Figure 6<bold>d</bold></xref> for the stretching of the low power mode. Hence specific values of each of these two system statistics will in general constrain the values of the model parameters <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>β</italic> to at most two possibilities (where the contour lines of each statistic cross).</p>
        <p>Fixing the parameters and simulating the system multiple times yields an ensemble of time series from which can be extracted an ensemble of data features. Ensemble simulations show that each of the summary statistics (BIC difference, etc.) follow a Normal distribution (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002634.s001">Figure S1</xref>) whose mean corresponds to the value shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g006">Figure 6</xref>. This is crucial for formal model inversion since this allows a (pre)metric to be defined over these spaces, using a suitable function such as Kullback–Leibler divergence and hence estimates of the distance between parameter values. We also note that although the contour lines in these particular planes may not cross, we actually seek the intersection of the surfaces which yield these lines in cross-section and which more generally will have mutual intersections in the full dimensional space. This can be achieved with a suitable variational scheme such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Friston2">[37]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Examining alternative hypotheses: Parameter noise and supercriticality</title>
        <p>The notion that resting state cortex operates in the vicinity of a nonlinear instability is certainly not unique to the present contribution, although the majority of previous accounts have assumed that the bifurcation was supercritical (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Stam1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Breakspear2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Liley1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Valdes1">[40]</xref>, but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Amit1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Bernacchia1">[42]</xref>). In this case, switching between a low and high amplitude mode arises from a “wandering” of the system across either side of the bifurcation threshold, corresponding to a random walk on the system's bifurcation parameter.</p>
        <p>To investigate the dynamics arising in this scenario, we set the shape parameter lambda to -4 so that the system possesses a supercritical bifurcation, and endow the bifurcation parameter beta with mean reverting stochastic (Ornstein Uhlenbeck) fluctuations,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002634.e030"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e030" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an uncorrelated Wiener process. Beta will hence undertake stochastic excursions either side the bifurcation point, <italic>β</italic> = 0. The typical excursion duration and depth into either regime is determined by the correlation time τ and the variance σ. In particular, if τ diverges (i.e. 1/τ approaches zero), <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002634.e030">equation 5</xref> becomes a Brownian walk on β. In this setting, the first return time for β (the dwell times for fluctuations on either side of the 0 axis) would show a power law distribution, which is contrary to the presence of stretched exponential dwell times in our EEG data. Decreasing τ (and hence introducing correlations) leads to an exponentially truncated first return time distribution (again not a stretched exponential). Should the system even yield a bimodal PDF, here we already encounter a major difference from the subcritical case, namely that the temporal statistics in the supercritical setting are determined by the (arbitrarily-imposed) characteristics of the noise through the correlation time parameter τ and do not emerge from the system's inherent dynamics.<disp-formula/></p>
        <p>Two examples of this dynamic scenario are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g008">Figure 8</xref>. For small to moderate parameter noise, power fluctuations express a unimodal exponential PDF, despite the emergence of occasional oscillatory activity in the time series. For moderate to large parameter noise, the system exhibits periods of high amplitude oscillatory behavior corresponding to parameter excursions well into supra-threshold territory. The probability distributions in these settings do not, however, show the clear bimodal distributions. Rather they generate broad, approximately unimodal forms that do not converge, even over long integration times towards any obvious simple probability distribution (multiple local minima are occasionally present in the PDFs). This is not particularly surprising since mean reverting stochastic (Ornstein Uhlenbeck) fluctuations are maximally (and unimodally) distributed around zero. In brief, the parameters of (5) play a crucial role in determining the data features, but impart an expected high penalty cost and generate a poor model fit. It hence seems unlikely that this scenario, with the increased complexity, can parsimoniously account for bimodal statistics in human EEG.</p>

        <title>Bistability in a biophysical model of corticothalamic activity</title>
        <p>Having established the dynamical principles of bistability in a normal form model, we now revisit bistability in a detailed biophysical model of electrocortical activity (previously reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref>). This model describes local mean field dynamics of populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cortical gray matter as they interact with neurons in the specific and reticular nuclei of the thalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Robinson1">[25]</xref>. These dynamics are governed by physiologically derived nonlinear evolution equations that incorporate synaptic and dendritic filtering, nonlinear firing responses, corticothalamic axonal delays and synaptic gains between presynaptic impulses and postsynaptic potentials. Resting state cortical activity has extensively been modeled by studying the noise-driven endogenous fluctuations. This yields a set of eight first-order stochastic delay differential equations. For a full model description including equations, please refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Robinson1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Breakspear2">[38]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Whereas in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref> examples of bistability were illustrated, we presently seek to more deeply explore the underlying bifurcation space and hence the core dynamical processes. We employ a numerical continuation scheme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Engelborghs1">[43]</xref> to study the family of bifurcations occurring at the 10 Hz (alpha) instability within the subspace of this system's parameter space spanned by the excitatory connection strengths for the reciprocal feedback between cortex and thalamus, <italic>ν<sub>es</sub></italic> and <italic>ν<sub>se</sub></italic>. Although this delay differential system is substantially more complex than the preceding normal form, it nonetheless exhibits a comparable family of Hopf bifurcations with a continuous transition from sub- to supercriticality along a branch of 10 Hz instabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g009">Figure 9a</xref>). We hence identify a candidate set of parameter values for a subcritical Hopf bifurcation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g009">Figure 9b</xref>) and drive the system with a combination of additive and multiplicative stochastic inputs. In particular, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-McCormick1">[44]</xref> we introduce a state-dependent feedback term from descending excitatory cortical input to the specific thalamic nuclei which modulates the strength of ascending stochastic input from subcortical sources (as motivated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Friston2">[37]</xref>).</p>

        <title>Bistability and multiplicative noise in a genetic regulatory network</title>
        <p>Intriguingly, the processes we presently study in the human brain have been observed across a range of distinct different biological systems. For example, the crucial role of bistability has been recently reported in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Kelemen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Gordon1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Gardner1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Kierzek1">[47]</xref> as has the existence of long-tailed distributions in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Krishna1">[48]</xref>. State-dependent noise has also been reported to play a key role in bacterial chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Tu1">[17]</xref>. Our analyses may thus speak broadly to other biological contexts.</p>
        <p>We analyse a kinetic model of genetic regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Hasty1">[3]</xref>. This model captures DNA-protein interaction in a small feedback network of genetic regulation in the temperate bacteriophage <italic>λ</italic> - a protoypical example of efficient phenotypic switching in response to an environmental signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Johnson1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Ptashne1">[50]</xref>. Please note that the bacteriophage λ is unrelated to shape parameter λ in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002634.e004">equation (1)</xref>. Briefly, the concentration of a single genetic repressor, <italic>x</italic>, initiates a sequence of DNA binding and dimerization at three sequential binding sites, each quickly reaching equilibrium due to its fast kinetic rates. The resulting DNA-protein complex then initiates transcription and production of <italic>x</italic> - hence enacting a positive feedback loop - which is offset by its degradation. Transcription also requires the presence of an RNA polymerase. Both transcription and degradation occur at slower time scales than binding and dimerization.</p>
        <p>By assuming the fast kinetic equations are kept at (or close to) equilibrium in comparison to transcription and degradation, the evolution of <italic>x</italic> can be described by the differential equation,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002634.e033"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e033" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula> where the dimensionless parameter <italic>α</italic> is a measure of the degree in which the transcription rate is increased above its basal rate by repressor binding, and <italic>γ</italic> is proportional to the relative strengths of the degradation and basal rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Hasty1">[3]</xref>.<disp-formula/></p>

        <p>Stochastic influences in genetic networks are widely modelled, representing the action of thermal fluctuations, parameter variability, and the impact of more complex chemical processes also not explicitly modelled. Similarly, in large-scale neuronal systems stochastic inputs typically represent non-specific inputs from neuronal regions (such as sensory organs) not otherwise explicitly modelled. In both settings, in systems where noise interacts with a feedback loop it can be introduced via a state-dependent stochastic term. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g010">Figure 10c–e</xref> shows an example time series with a state-dependent noise term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> added to the RHS of (6).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Detailed biophysical models - derived and parameterized using prior biological knowledge - are useful for elucidating specific biological mechanisms underlying particular phenomena, and unifying different behaviours of the same system within a single framework (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Robinson2">[27]</xref>). In contrast, simple algebraic (so-called normal forms) models provide deeper insights into the underlying dynamical processes at play, and whilst they lack the ability to prescribe specific biophysical mechanisms, they provide a window into unifying principles that exceed the confines of any one particular domain. A classic example is the logistic equation, which was derived as an abstraction of population dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-May1">[51]</xref> but became a mathematical paradigm for chaotic dynamics in complex systems. We presently show that a normal form of the Hopf bifurcation - a fifth order polynomial - is able to recapitulate the multistable and scale-invariant dynamics of human cortical activity when endowed with a subcritical instability and multiplicative noise. We also show how this model captures the dynamical principles at play in a detailed neural field model of cortical dynamics as well as a kinetic model of genetic regulation in a bacteriophage, hence suggesting universality in the biological world.</p>
      <p>Regardless of their niche, biological systems share a number of competing constraints such as flexibility, robustness, cost efficiency, fidelity, and reproduction. Is it hence surprising that apparently diverse biological systems exploit similar dynamical mechanisms in addressing these? Given that universality underpins many dynamical systems observed in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Bak1">[52]</xref>, and indeed normal form models are formally equivalent to broad classes of more complex systems under fairly general conditions, it is perhaps to be expected that simple models should capture fundamental dynamical processes that arise throughout biology. We have argued that the combination of a subcritical bifurcation with multiplicative noise satisfies two key constraints, namely spontaneous switching between multistable modes of activity (flexibility) and scale-invariant fluctuations between these modes over several orders of magnitude (fidelity). The presence of bistability in both the detailed neural field model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Freyer2">[2]</xref> and the genetic regulatory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Hasty1">[3]</xref> was already known: here we suggest that they share the same dynamical mechanism. Although Hasty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Hasty1">[3]</xref> illustrated exemplar time series with both additive and parameter noise, we add specific predictions arising from a state-dependent stochastic term, namely that the fluctuations may be scale invariant and the dwell times in each mode will be long-tailed. This is consistent with effects documented in other genetic systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Krishna1">[48]</xref>, possibly due to similar mechanisms.</p>
      <p>By suggesting the functional form of the deterministic and stochastic terms in large-scale cortical dynamics, the present findings have direct and pragmatic implications for the analysis of neuroimaging data. Where stochastic processes have been previously introduced to dynamic models of cortical systems, they have almost invariably taken the form of a purely additive term. Our analysis mandates a state-dependent noise term for inversion of neural field (e.g., Jirsa and Haken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Jirsa1">[53]</xref>, Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Robinson3">[54]</xref>) and neural mass (e.g., Wendling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Wendling1">[55]</xref>, David and Friston <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-David1">[56]</xref>) models from electrocortical data. We have given a proof-of-principle here by inverting the normal form model from two examples of bistable human EEG data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Naturally, formal inversion should leverage other (lower order) properties of the data such as spectral peaks and scaling regimes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Robinson1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Moran1">[57]</xref> However, the bistable statistics are indispensable for disentangling the additive and multiplicative noise parameters, as well as the global properties of the system's phase space.</p>
      <p>Moving beyond the exemplar model inversion method demonstrated here, a more formal framework, such as the variational framework implemented in Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Friston3">[58]</xref>, would enable robust parameter estimation and model comparison. We provide a preliminary exploration of model space in duplets of parameters and show that (1) The space appears sufficiently well behaved (surfaces are smooth and unimodal), and (2) For fixed parameters, system statistics are Normally distributed. These observations suggest that the parameters will be identifiable and penalties for system complexity that rest upon the divergence between prior and posterior parameter distributions will be obtainable: Both of these are required for the variational model inversion scheme implemented in DCM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Friston2">[37]</xref>. This method has been successful in neuroscience for inverting both EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In fact the model typically used in DCM for fMRI is also a truncated power series (linear or 2nd-order), similar to our algebraic model, to which fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Friston4">[59]</xref> have been added. Our findings suggest that a higher order term (at least cubic) may be required for many of the rich behaviours observed near the edge of dynamical instabilities, and not necessarily only in EEG data. While EEG oscillations are much faster than fMRI responses, dwell time switching in cortical systems exhibits long tails and hence occurs well into the scales observable in fMRI data (∼10 sec). It is hence possible that a DCM with a higher order state term may be a better generative model for fMRI data than the current quadratic term. This is an empirical question that can be addressed using a suitable model inversion scheme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Daunizeau1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Li1">[61]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As noted before, a cubic polynomial is sufficient to describe the family of either sub- <italic>or</italic> supercritical Hopf bifurcations, but not both: A fifth order term is required to enable a smooth transition between the two <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Strogatz1">[33]</xref>. Inclusion of higher order terms opens the possibility of modeling even more subtle features of the dynamics, such as sub-harmonics and nonlinear amplitude-frequency effects. These may be crucial to highly nonlinear neuronal computations such as pitch perception in the auditory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Large1">[62]</xref> and vibrotactile perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Langdon1">[63]</xref>. It is also important to note that the present normal form, which captures the basic dynamics of the biological systems we study, cannot be expected to capture all forms of multistability. In particular, the limit cycle is extinguished at the “lower end” of bistability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002634-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) through a saddle-node bifurcation. That is, the attractor loses structural stability and ceases to exist. An alternative dynamical scenario would be that such an attractor only loses asymptotic (Lyapunov) stability. That is, it remains an invariant set but loses attraction in one or more subspaces, hence becoming a saddle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Ashwin1">[64]</xref>. In this setting, system noise could still allow the system to itinerantly shadow the “ghost attractor” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Tsuda1">[4]</xref>, although (in the absence of an attracting basin) the associated switching behavior may follow a simple Poisson process and not show any trapping (i.e. stretched, long-tailed dwell times). This dynamical scenario could only arise in a different normal form model.</p>
      <p>Whilst we have argued that modeling state-dependent noise and higher order state terms in neurophysiological data has pragmatic implications, they also speak to fundamental computational processes in the brain. As recalled in the Introduction, state-dependent fluctuations are arguably a defining feature of perception (the “Weber-Fechner law”), movement (“Fitt's law”), and computation (“Hick's law”). Intriguingly, multistability co-exists with scale invariant fluctuations in these basic cognitive systems. For example, multistability is a well known property of the function (as exemplified by binocular rivalry) and physiology (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Anderson1">[65]</xref>) of the visual system. Likewise, Weber's law has well-known neurophysiological correlates in the early visual system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Mante1">[66]</xref>. Whilst the fixed ratio of the standard deviation with the mean intensity of a percept or motor action permits relative uncertainty to remain constant, the presence of multistability in these same systems additionally allows switching to distinct dynamical regimes which may confer adaptive advantage. If generative models that contain higher order terms are to provide stronger model evidence than simpler models (without those terms), it will arguably be most likely during experimental manipulations where such scale-free (or multistable) computations provide a performance advantage. That is, when the optimal generative model for the data embodies the same functional form as that required to optimize task performance.</p>

        <p>Resting state EEG data were acquired from 16 healthy subjects using BrainAmp amplifiers (hardware bandpass filter, 0.1–250 Hz; BrainAmp; Brain Products) and EEG caps (Easy-Cap; FMS). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to their participation.

        <title>Normal form model - numerical integration</title>
        <p>Time series were obtained from numerical integration of (4) in the presence of stochastic fluctuations. We used Heun's integration scheme (an extension of the Euler integration into a two-stage second-order Runge–Kutta integration scheme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Mannella1">[67]</xref>) with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>In order to ensure stable and reproducible results, we obtained 10 different time series for each set of parameter values, starting from different initial conditions. Integration length was 900 s, matching the length of the EEG data sets. The first 10 seconds were always discarded to account for initial transients.</p>
        <p>For all following analyses the amplitude time series <italic>r(t)</italic> was transformed to its Analytic signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>,</sub> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the Hilbert transform of <italic>r</italic>, since the fitting of an exponential PDF, i.e. a chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom (DoF), to a power time series mandates an underlying signal with two DoF. Substituting <italic>r</italic> by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases the DoF to two, thereby ensuring the valid application of the exponential PDF fitting procedure.</p>

Using the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), empirical PDFs were then fitted to two types of distribution functions: A simple exponential form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002634-Balakrishnan1">[68]</xref><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where x is the power and γ is the shape parameter; and a biexponential form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>γ1</italic> and <italic>γ2</italic> are the shape parameters of the two exponentials and δ is a weighting factor. We formally compared the bimodal to a unimodal fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which includes a penalty term for model complexity: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where L is the maximum likelihood estimate, i.e. the maximum value of the log likelihood function for the estimated model, n is the number of observations and k is the number of free parameters (<italic>k = 1</italic> for the unimodal fit and <italic>k = 3</italic> for the bimodal fit).Given two or more candidate models, the ‘best’ model will yield relatively low values of Λ – reflecting small residual variance after penalization for the number of free parameters. In order to gain a better insight into the functional form of the PDF, we formally evaluated the fitted PDFs in log-log coordinates.</p>

        <title>Parametric analysis of noise and stability parameters</title>
        <p>To map out the possible bistability and dwell time statistics, we explored the parameter space of our model by systematically varying stability parameters β and λ as well as the noise parameters η and ρ from (4). For λ&gt;0, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the system exhibits two attractors (a fixed point and a limit cycle) coexisting in parameter space, and hence expresses bistability, given an adequate noise term. We hence chose fixed values <italic>λ</italic> = 4, <italic>β</italic> = −3.4 and systematically varied the noise parameters <italic>η</italic> and <italic>ρ</italic> between 80 linearly equally spaced values in the defined ranges <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002634.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which were determined through iterative adjustment.</p>
        <p>For each combination of values (80×80), we iterated (4) as described in section <italic>Normal form model - numerical integration</italic>. For each time series, we applied the same fitting procedures and parameter estimation methods as for the EEG data (as detailed above), yielding two key system statistics: the BIC difference, quantifying the relative goodness of fit of a bimodal versus a unimodal PDF, and the stretched exponential exponent <italic>b</italic> indicating the degree of stretching of the dwell time distributions for the low and high power modes. BIC difference and exponent <italic>b</italic> were taken as averages across the 10 calculated time series at each point.</p>
