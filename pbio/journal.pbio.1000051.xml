				<article-title>Peripheral Regulatory T Cells Take the Road Less Traveled</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells expressing forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) arise during thymic selection among thymocytes with modestly self-reactive T cell receptors. In vitro studies suggest Foxp3 can also be induced among peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a cytokine dependent manner. T<sub>reg</sub> cells of thymic or peripheral origin may serve different functions in vivo, but both populations are phenotypically indistinguishable in wild-type mice. Here we show that mice with a <italic>Carma1</italic> point mutation lack thymic CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and demonstrate a cell-intrinsic requirement for CARMA1 in thymic Foxp3 induction. However, peripheral <italic>Carma1-</italic>deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells could be generated and expanded in vitro in response to the cytokines transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). In vivo, a small peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> pool existed that was enriched at mucosal sites and could expand systemically after infection with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Our data provide genetic evidence for two distinct mechanisms controlling regulatory T cell lineage commitment. Furthermore, we show that peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells are a dynamic population that may expand to limit immunopathology or promote chronic infection.</p>

          <p>In mammals, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are essential for controlling infections, but have the potential to attack host tissues as well, resulting in autoimmune disease. A subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>)—identified by the expression of the forkhead transcription factor <italic>Foxp3</italic>—serve to prevent immunopathology by dampening immune responses. These cells are unique among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, as only the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage can develop in both the thymus and periphery. Using a genetic approach, we identified a mutation in the gene <italic>Carma1,</italic> a key component of T and B cell signaling, which in mice distinguishes T<sub>reg</sub> cells derived from the periphery from thymic-derived regulatory T cells. The mutation caused an absence of thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells. However, a small population of T<sub>reg</sub> cells was observed in the spleen, lymph nodes, and colon of <italic>Carma1</italic>-mutant mice that expanded after viral infection, suggesting that peripheral development of T<sub>reg</sub> cells could still occur. Indeed, <italic>Carma1</italic>-mutant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could be converted into the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage in vitro. Our results demonstrate an organ-specific requirement for the CARMA1 signaling pathway that developing thymocytes need in order to become T<sub>reg</sub> cells, but that naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can bypass in the periphery. This dichotomy suggests that T<sub>reg</sub> cells of thymic or peripheral origin may have different specificities or functions in vivo.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Two major mechanisms enforce self-tolerance: negative selection in the thymus and dominant tolerance in the periphery. The importance of both mechanisms is underscored by the phenotypes of autoimmune regulator (<italic>Aire</italic>) knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b001">1</xref>] and <italic>scurfy</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b002">2</xref>], which have defects in negative selection or dominant tolerance, respectively. Humans with orthologous mutations develop autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b004">4</xref>] or immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b005">5</xref>]. These mutations all result in systemic autoimmunity, though defects in dominant tolerance cause a more severe and fatal disease. The study of dominant tolerance accelerated after cloning of the <italic>scurfy</italic> locus, which identified forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) as an essential molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b006">6</xref>]. Foxp3 is a transcription factor expressed predominantly in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells committed to the regulatory T cell (T<sub>reg</sub>) lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b007">7</xref>]. Expression of Foxp3 programs T cells with suppressor function, allowing T<sub>reg</sub> cells to effect dominant tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b008">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>The majority of T<sub>reg</sub> cells are derived from the thymus, although an unknown percentage of these cells may develop in the peripheral lymphoid organs. Thymic T<sub>reg</sub> lineage commitment occurs in CD4 single-positive (SP) thymocytes and requires intermediate affinity binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b009">9</xref>], co-stimulation through CD80 and CD86 interactions with CD28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b011">11</xref>], and the cytokines TGFβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b012">12</xref>] and interleukin (IL)-2 or IL-15 signaling through the shared IL-2Rβ chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b016">16</xref>]. Peripheral commitment of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage, modeled in vitro, requires exogenous TGFβ, in addition to TCR stimulation and concomitant IL-2 production, to induce Foxp3 expression and T<sub>reg</sub> function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b017">17</xref>]. Foxp3 induction can be enhanced in vitro by inhibition of AKT-mediated signaling or transient TCR stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b019">19</xref>], and may be preferentially driven in vivo by retinoic acid made by macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) residing in mucosal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b020">20</xref>]. The differences in signaling pathways used in the development of thymic versus peripherally induced T<sub>reg</sub> cells remain largely unexplored.</p>
      <p>In this report, we describe the characterization and positional cloning of the <italic>king</italic> mutation. We identified the mutation by screening G3 mice, homozygous for germline mutations induced by <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b021">21</xref>], to detect defects in T cell effector function. In <italic>king</italic> homozygous mice, no thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells were detected, but Foxp3 could be induced among peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to cytokines. Thus, the <italic>king</italic> mouse offered a model to explore differences in signaling pathways used for thymic versus peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> lineage commitment and to study peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> dynamics, which are normally obscured by the presence of thymic-derived T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Our studies provide genetic evidence of two pathways, operating in the thymus or periphery, that commit CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage. We also show that viral infection can cause massive expansion of peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells, an event that may reduce immunopathology or contribute to persistent viral infections.</p>

        <title>Identification of the <italic>king</italic> Mutation</title>
        <p>To identify genes with non-redundant roles in T cell development, priming or effector function, we designed a screen to detect defective cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell (CTL) responses in mice immunized with ovalbumin (act-mOVA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b022">22</xref>]. Among 2,500 ENU-mutagenized G3 mice screened, we have thus far bred three non-responsive mutations to homozygosity. We termed one of these mutants <italic>king</italic>. While the primary screen used was an in vivo cytotoxicity assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b023">23</xref>], the mutation could be scored using an in vitro assay as well. To do so, we isolated T cells 7 d after immunization, at the peak of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response, and expanded antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in culture with SIINFEKL peptide. <italic>king</italic> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells did not undergo secondary expansion or produce interferon (IFN)γ after restimulation with peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). We hypothesized that a mutation affecting DC cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, T cell activation, or T cell proliferation could cause such a phenotype. To test DC function, we used FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3)-ligand to generate bone marrow-derived lymphoid DCs, a subset of DCs that efficiently cross-primes CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b022">22</xref>]. When lymphoid DCs were exposed to ovalbumin expressing apoptotic cells, <italic>king</italic> DCs primed ovalbumin-specific OT-I T cells as efficiently as wild-type DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In addition, <italic>king</italic> DCs showed normal up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II after activation by Toll-like receptor ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b024">24</xref>] or apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b022">22</xref>] (unpublished data), suggesting that the mutation did not affect co-stimulation. These results indicated that the <italic>king</italic> mutation did not impair DC-mediated cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

As CD25 can be further up-regulated in response to IL-2, we measured IL-2 production by <italic>king</italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activated by TCR ligation and found a lack thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Since these data implied only a partial defect in T cell activation, we next assessed T cell proliferative capacity. <italic>king</italic> T cells failed to proliferate in response to TCR stimulation, although this could be partially rescued by exogenous IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). As IL-2 is required to maintain CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b014">14</xref>], we assessed the development of these cells in <italic>king</italic> mice. CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells were reduced by an order of magnitude in periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), but were absent in the thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g001">Figure 1</xref>G), indicating that the <italic>king</italic> mutation blocked commitment of developing thymocytes to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage. We also investigated the function of another population of self-reactive T cells that develop in the thymus, natural killer T (NKT) cells. 90 min after injection of the NKT cell-specific agonist alpha-galactosylceramide (αGalCer), elevated concentrations of IL-4 and IFNγ were measured in the serum of <italic>king</italic> mice, indicating that the mutation did not impair pan-T cell function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g001">Figure 1</xref>H).</p>
        <p>Unlike most other mutations that impair T<sub>reg</sub> development, <italic>king</italic> mice did not exhibit gross signs of autoimmunity. Even in a cohort of <italic>king</italic> mice monitored for over 9 mo, no detectable anti-chromatin auto-antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000051-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) were found in the serum, nor did the mice develop splenomegaly, lymphoproliferative disease, or signs of chronic inflammation—all aspects of autoimmunity normally controlled by T<sub>reg</sub> cells.</p>

        <title><italic>king</italic>, a Mutation in <italic>Carma1</italic></title>
        <p>To find the causative mutation, we mapped the <italic>king</italic> phenotype by outcrossing the <italic>king</italic> stock (C57BL/6J background) to C3H/HeN mice, backcrossing to the <italic>king</italic> stock, and measuring the percentage of circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing Foxp3 in the blood of F2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). By analyzing 134 informative microsatellite markers dispersed throughout the genome on 39 meioses, we localized the <italic>king</italic> mutation to the distal region of Chromosome 5 with a peak logarithm of odds (Lod) score of 11.74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Further analysis of 268 meioses confined the mutation to a 1.03-Mb critical region, bounded by the markers D5Mit292 and D5Mit101. This region contained only six annotated genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.informatics.jax.org</ext-link>), and among these was <italic>Card11</italic> (more commonly known as <italic>Carma1</italic> [from CARD-MAGUK1]). We sequenced either genomic DNA or cDNA of all coding basepairs within the critical region and identified a single point mutation in <italic>Carma1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), which resulted in an L525Q substitution. The mutation occurred in α-helix2, in the NORS (no regular secondary structure) domain, of the CARMA1 linker region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). In naïve T cells, the CARMA1 protein adopts a conformation in which the linker domain associates with the caspase recruitment domain (CARD). Upon T cell activation, protein kinase C (PKC)θ phosphorylation of residues in the linker domain reduces intramolecular affinity for the CARD domain. This liberates both the CARD and coiled-coil domains, allowing CARMA1 oligomerization and recruitment of B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) to the CARMA1 signaling module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b026">26</xref>]. Following activation, degradation of BCL10 terminates CARMA1-dependent signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b027">27</xref>]. CARMA1 has a similar function in B cells, downstream of PKCβ. No CARMA1 expression was detected by western analysis in the thymus, spleen, or lymph nodes of <italic>king</italic> homozygotes (<italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Furthermore, CARMA1 was not detectable in CD4 or CD8 SP thymocyte lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). The L525Q mutation may have the effect of destabilizing the CARMA1-<italic>king</italic> protein or marking it for degradation in mature T and B cells.</p>

        <title>A Cell-Intrinsic Role for <italic>Carma1</italic> in T<sub>reg</sub> Lineage Commitment</title>
        <p>In addition to Foxp3, thymocytes committed to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage also express CD25, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b032">32</xref>]. To determine whether <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> thymocytes begin differentiation into the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage but fail to express Foxp3, a distal marker of T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation, we examined expression of these additional markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The lack of expression of these markers suggests CARMA1 acts early in T<sub>reg</sub> lineage commitment. An absence of thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice could result from altered selection by thymic epithelial cells, a defect in the TCR and co-stimulatory signaling pathways, or a lack of signaling through the IL-2Rβ chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b033">33</xref>]. To understand the role of <italic>Carma1</italic> in thymic T<sub>reg</sub> development, we generated reciprocal and mixed bone-marrow chimeric mice. Foxp3 expression was absent in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> thymocytes that developed in a wild-type thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), but normal in wild-type thymocytes that developed in a <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Therefore, the T<sub>reg</sub> deficiency in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice results not from an altered thymic environment, but rather from an intrinsic defect in hematopoietically derived precursors. When wild-type mice were reconstituted with <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> and wild-type bone marrow at a 4:1 ratio, 1:1 chimerism was achieved among lymphocytes. While wild-type thymocytes differentiated into the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage at normal frequencies, <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> thymocytes failed to develop into thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells and expressed lower levels of CD25, GITR, and CTLA-4 among CD4 SP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). As trans-acting IL-2Rγ chain cytokines produced by wild-type thymocytes did not rescue Foxp3 induction in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> thymocytes, it is likely that impaired signaling downstream of the TCR or CD28 underlies the absence of the thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells.</p>

        <p>Pathways distinct from those involved in thymic development regulate commitment and homeostasis of peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b014">14</xref>]. In wild-type mice reconstituted with <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> bone marrow, peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells were found at reduced frequencies, similar to those observed in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). Conversely, in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice reconstituted with wild-type bone marrow, peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells occurred at frequencies similar to those observed in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). Therefore, the <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> environment can support T<sub>reg</sub> homeostasis and a cell-intrinsic defect in development causes the T<sub>reg</sub> deficiency observed in these mice. It has been proposed that IL-2 regulates T<sub>reg</sub> homeostasis and that T<sub>reg</sub> cells may function as an IL-2 “sink” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b034">34</xref>]. However, in wild-type mice reconstituted with mixed wild-type and <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> bone marrow, the <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> T<sub>reg</sub> population did not expand in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). Interestingly, the wild-type T<sub>reg</sub> population expanded to comprise 20% of the wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and 10% of the total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell pool. This suggests that a cell-extrinsic homeostatic mechanism regulates the size of the T<sub>reg</sub> compartment in the periphery of naïve wild-type mice.</p>

        <p>To determine whether <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were more or less prone than wild-type cells to express Foxp3, we preformed a dose-response analysis of Foxp3 induction by titrating anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and TGFβ concentrations. In the absence of CARMA1, the TCR-signaling threshold for Foxp3 induction was increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Co-stimulatory signals were also required for efficient Foxp3 induction in wild-type and <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).

        <p>The absence of detectable thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells and presence of a small peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> population in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice suggests that induction of T<sub>reg</sub> cells can occur in the periphery of naïve mice without activation of the CARMA1 pathway.

        <p>As IL-2 and TGFβ are sufficient to induce Foxp3 in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we explored the possibility that these cytokines activated signaling pathways downstream of CARMA1, or induced Foxp3 expression via an alternative pathway. We first activated wild-type and <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with the PKC activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, without exogenous cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Upon activation, BCL10 phosphorylation, NF-κB inhibitor alpha (IκBα) degradation and phosphorylation of both Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) isoforms occurred in wild-type T cells. In contrast, BCL10 was constitutively phosphorylated, amounts of IκBα were constantly elevated, and the JNKp54 isoform remained unphosphorylated in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> T cells. Interestingly, decreased abundance and constitutive phosphorylation of BCL10 was observed in total <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> lymph node T cells, but not thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Normally, BCL10 is recruited to CARMA1 after activation. After assembly of the CARMA1 signaling complex, phosphorylation marks BCL10 for ubiquitination and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b027">27</xref>]. The lack of CARMA1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g002">Figure 2</xref>D) and constitutive degradation of BCL10 in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> T cells indicates that the CARMA1 signaling complex cannot be assembled; this is also reflected by the elevated amounts of TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) in resting and activated <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), likely due to reduced protein turnover.</p>

        <p>Other groups have reported that <italic>Carma1</italic>-deficient T cells exhibit a lack of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b031">31</xref>] and JNK2 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b036">36</xref>] after TCR stimulation. While the CARMA1 signaling complex was inoperative in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice, it was possible that exogenous IL-2 and TGFβ retained the ability to activate NF-κB or JNK. However, when we activated wild-type and <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> T cells with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of these cytokines, levels of IκBα degradation and JNK phosphorylation remained unchanged up to 60 min after activation (unpublished data). Similar results were obtained when T cells were activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies.</p>
        <p>We next investigated whether other cytokines could drive Foxp3 expression. To determine if trans-acting cytokines produced by wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could drive Foxp3 induction, we co-cultured activated wild-type and <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of TGFβ. The presence of activated wild-type cells allowed proliferation and Foxp3 induction in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Co-culture in the presence of IL-2 neutralizing antibody abolished proliferation of <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Foxp3 induction in both wild-type and <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). However, other IL-2Rγ chain cytokines can also substitute for exogenous IL-2 in Foxp3 induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b037">37</xref>]. To test whether this could occur in the absence of CARMA1, we activated <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of TGFβ and IL-4 (an IL-2Rγ chain cytokine). Exogenous IL-4 induced proliferation and Foxp3 induction, although, as expected, it was less potent than exogenous IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b038">38</xref>]. However, neutralizing IL-2 antibody abrogated this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g007">Figure 7</xref>B), indicating that other IL-2Rγ chain cytokines can drive IL-2 production and T cell proliferation independently of TCR-mediated CARMA1 activation. It has also been reported that CpG DNA or associated proinflammatory molecules can act, in vitro, directly on T cells to restore TCR-mediated proliferation and induce CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell polarization in cells from <italic>Pkc</italic>θ<italic><sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b039">39</xref>].

        <title>T<sub>reg</sub> Cell Suppressor Function Does Not Require CARMA1</title>
        <p>It remained unclear whether CARMA1 was required for T<sub>reg</sub> suppressor function. In addition to Foxp3, in vitro generated T<sub>reg</sub> cells express CD25, CTLA-4, and GITR at high levels, similar to T<sub>reg</sub> cells found in vivo. <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> T<sub>reg</sub> cells generated in vitro express normal levels of these markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). T<sub>reg</sub> cells have the ability to suppress T cell proliferation by a cell-contact dependent mechanism in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b034">34</xref>]. Both wild-type and <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> induced T<sub>reg</sub> cells, generated in vitro with IL-2 and TGFβ, suppressed the proliferation of wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a co-culture assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g007">Figure 7</xref>D).

        <title>C<italic>arma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> T<sub>reg</sub> Cells Expand during Mouse Cytomegalovirus Infection</title>
        <p>Peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells comprise a small percentage of <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the steady-state. It has been suggested that peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells may expand during conditions of lymphopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b009">9</xref>], at the site of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b040">40</xref>], or in response to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b041">41</xref>]. The absence of thymic-derived T<sub>reg</sub> cells in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice provides a model to study the dynamics of peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells during infection. To do this, we infected <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice with a pathogen that establishes persistent infection in mice—mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice mounted T-dependent B cell responses that were reduced compared to the wild-type response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g008">Figure 8</xref>A), but sufficient to allow survival without any signs of virus-induced immunopathology or detectable virus in the spleen 14 d after infection. Yet, at the peak of the effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response, 8 d after infection, no T<sub>reg</sub> expansion was observed in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). However, splenic CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells expanded by an order of magnitude in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice 14 d after MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g008">Figure 8</xref>C). MCMV establishes persistent infection in the salivary glands, and T cells drain from the salivary glands to the submandibular lymph nodes. Here, T<sub>reg</sub> expansion was also observed in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000051-g008">Figure 8</xref>D). No Foxp3 expression was detected in the thymus 8 or 14 d after infection, suggesting that T<sub>reg</sub> expansion resulted from either de novo induction of Foxp3 or expansion of the pre-existing peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> pool. Additionally, MCMV infected <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice did not develop signs of autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disease when monitored for 80 d after infection.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Accumulating evidence suggests that diverse stimuli can drive proliferation or induction of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b043">43</xref>]. We have shown that cytokines or MCMV infection can drive Foxp3 induction and peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation in the absence of CARMA1, but found different requirements for thymic T<sub>reg</sub> development. Contrary to expectations that the T<sub>reg</sub> deficiency observed in mice lacking components of the CARMA1 pathway reflected an inability to produce IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b033">33</xref>], cytokines produced by wild-type thymocytes or thymic epithelial cells did not rescue thymic Foxp3 induction in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> thymocytes in mixed bone marrow chimeric mice. This may reflect the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> thymocytes capable of responding to IL-2 and inducing Foxp3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b044">44</xref>] among <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> thymocytes. Thus, unlike Foxp3 induction in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which can be driven by cytokines without activation of CARMA1, developing thymocytes require activation of a cell-intrinsic, CARMA1-dependent signaling pathway(s) that likely includes the transcription factor NF-κB. CARMA1-mediated NF-κB activation may act as a survival factor in thymic T<sub>reg</sub> development, preventing apoptosis of thymocytes with certain TCRs or pre-TCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b045">45</xref>] that are destined to become CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells.</p>
      <p>Given the robust T cell expansion observed in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice during MCMV infection, it is perhaps surprising that they do not develop spontaneous autoimmune disease as a consequence of thymic T<sub>reg</sub> deficiency. Likewise, deletion of other genes in the <italic>Carma1</italic> pathway—<italic>Pkc</italic>θ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b046">46</xref>]<italic>, Bcl10</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b046">46</xref>]<italic>, Tak1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b048">48</xref>], <italic>Ikk</italic>β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b049">49</xref>]—impairs T<sub>reg</sub> development, but does not result in spontaneous autoimmunity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000051-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Mice with a <italic>Ick</italic>-driven CD4-specific deletion of <italic>Tak1</italic> develop colitis with age, although escaped CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells retaining intact <italic>Tak1</italic> might initiate disease in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b047">47</xref>]. Additionally, hypomorphic mutations in regulators of TCR-mediated PKCθ activation, linker for T cell activation (<italic>Lat)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b050">50</xref>], and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (<italic>Zap70</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b051">51</xref>], also block T<sub>reg</sub> development. In <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice, T cells, including any with potentially auto-reactive TCRs, are normally quiescent, but can become activated during the “cytokine storm” of infection. The small <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> pool may also contribute to dampening T cell responses directed towards self-antigens or commensal flora and may release more of the regulatory cytokine TGFβ than wild-type T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Additionally, the impaired B cell function in <italic>Carma1</italic>-deficient mice may prevent amplification of auto-reactive immune responses. We also demonstrated that NKT cell, but not conventional T cell cytokine production occurred normally without functional CARMA1, suggesting that in the absence of thymic-derived T<sub>reg</sub> cells, <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> NKT cells do not drive spontaneous autoimmune disease.</p>
      <p>The development of the hematopoietic system and lymphocyte activation defects were similar in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Carma1</italic>-knockout mice. Therefore, it was surprising to find reduced protein levels and constitutive phosphorylation of BCL10 in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In CARMA1-deficient JPM50.6 cells, BCL10 expression is normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b052">52</xref>]. The normal expression of BCL10 in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> thymocytes, but not lymph node cells suggests BCL10 degradation may be confined to mature T and B cells. As the <italic>king</italic> mutation occurred in a region of CARMA1 predicted to regulate accessibility of the CARD domain, we propose a model in which BCL10 is constitutively recruited to the CARMA1-<italic>king</italic> protein in mature T and B cells. This interaction is not sufficient to assemble the full CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 signaling complex or to activate NF-κB, but does allow for BCL10 phosphorylation and the subsequent degradation of BCL10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b027">27</xref>] and the CARMA1-<italic>king</italic> protein. As a result, the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex cannot be assembled upon TCR stimulation.</p>
      <p>The generation of peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells requires TCR signals in addition to TGFβ and IL-2 in vitro. Our data suggest that peripheral Foxp3 induction may not require CARMA1-mediated activation of NF-κB, as indicated by the lack of IκBα degradation or JNK phosphorylation after activation. When IκBα degradation was induced by culturing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with TNFα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b029">29</xref>], <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> cells still did not proliferate, nor did they up-regulate Foxp3 in the presence of TGFβ. Similar to our observations for <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice, exogenous IL-2 can also rescue the TCR-mediated proliferation defect in mice deficient for the NF-κB family members <italic>p50</italic> and <italic>c-Rel</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b053">53</xref>]. T cells from these mice also cannot produce IL-2, and peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells are reduced 5-fold. It will be of interest to determine if thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells develop in these NF-κB deficient mice and whether peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from these mice induce Foxp3 after exposure to IL-2 and TGFβ.</p>
      <p>Recently, two groups reported TGFβ-independent Foxp3 induction in vitro when CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated in the presence of chemical or genetic inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b019">19</xref>]. Weak or transient TCR stimulation, without co-stimulation, is also postulated to favor peripheral induction of Foxp3 in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b043">43</xref>]. However, <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were less prone than wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to induce Foxp3 when given weak TCR stimulation. Therefore, our data suggest that unlike the AKT signaling axis, blockade of CARMA1-dependent signaling does not favor peripheral Foxp3 induction.</p>
      <p>In vivo, we have shown that factors produced during MCMV infection can stimulate peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> expansion in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice. Our in vitro data suggest that this expansion may require IL-2Rγ chain cytokines, such as IL-4, to drive IL-2 production. Expansion of T<sub>reg</sub> cells may contribute to the transient immunosuppression that can follow viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b054">54</xref>], and our data suggest these cells may arise peripherally. Such a response could protect the host against cross-reactive anti-viral T cells that have the potential to precipitate autoimmune disease. An alternative but not mutually exclusive hypothesis holds that MCMV may manipulate the host immune response to expand virus-specific T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Such a strategy has been well documented for the parasite <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Leishmania major</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b042">42</xref>], and may be utilized by other viruses, for example Friend leukaemia virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b041">41</xref>]. If these T<sub>reg</sub> cells localized to viral reservoirs, they could facilitate persistent viral infections.</p>
      <p>The existence of two pathways for Foxp3 induction allows for a total T<sub>reg</sub> pool with two potential specificities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b032">32</xref>]. Thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells might primarily express TCRs with intermediate self-affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b009">9</xref>], as Foxp3 induction would require TCR signals strong enough to activate CARMA1 without causing clonal deletion. Tonic signaling through the TCR along with consumption of cytokines could allow expansion of thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells to fill the T<sub>reg</sub> niche. The generation of peripherally induced T<sub>reg</sub> cells might be driven by cytokines produced by the innate immune system at mucosal sites or during infection. In <italic>Carma1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, myeloid cells make normal amounts of IL-2, which may support the peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> population we observe in <italic>Carma1<sup>k/k</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b055">55</xref>]. These induced T<sub>reg</sub> cells could then prevent T cell responses to commensal flora and dampen potentially dangerous responses to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b041">41</xref>] or innocuous antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000051-b043">43</xref>].</p>

        <title>In vitro T cell activation.</title>
        <p>MACS purified splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were used to test T cell activation. To measure up-regulation of activation markers by flow cytometry, cells were activated for 24 h, and then stained for intra-cellular CD25 and CD69. IL-2 production was measured by culturing 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml under activating conditions in supplemented IMDM media. Supernatant was harvested at 18 h and IL-2 was measured by ELISA (eBioscience). T cell proliferation assays entailed activating CFSE-labeled CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells using 10 μg/ml CD3ε and 1 μg/ml CD28 plate-bound antibodies with or without 100 U/ml IL-2. CFSE dilution was measured after 4 d by flow cytometry.</p>
        <p>Peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells were generated in 24-well plates by culturing 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFSE-labeled CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in plates coated with CD3ε and CD28 antibodies with or without IL-2 (R &amp; D Systems) and/or TGFβ (R &amp; D Systems) in supplemented IMDM media. CFSE dilution and intracellular expression of Foxp3 was measured after 4 d of culture. To examine the effect of other cytokines, 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFSE-labeled C57BL/6-CD45.1<sup>+</sup> and <italic>king</italic>-CD45.2<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were co-cultured in plates coated with 2 μg/ml CD3 and CD28 antibodies in supplemented IMDM media with 5 ng/ml TGFβ and with or without 10 μg/ml neutralizing IL-2 antibody (JES6–1) (eBioscience). Additionally, CFSE dilution and Foxp3 induction was assessed in CFSE-labeled CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activated by 2 μg/ml CD3 and CD28 plate-bound antibodies in supplemented IMDM media with 5 ng/ml TGFβ and: 100 nM CpG oligonucleotides (SIGMA), 10 ng/ml IL-4, 10 ng/ml TNFα, 100 U/ml IFNα, or 100 U/ml IFNγ (all cytokines, R &amp; D systems).</p>
        <p>For western analysis of T cell signaling, MACS purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin (SIGMA) for the indicated time. Cells were lysed in a non-ionic buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 15 min on ice, then suspended at a 1:1 ratio in Lamelli sample buffer.</p>

After 4 d, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were again MACS purified. Foxp3 induction was assessed by flow cytometry, and in all experiments at least 90% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed Foxp3. Induced T<sub>reg</sub> cells were harvested and co-cultured at indicated ratios with 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> MACS purified CFSE-labeled CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Also included were 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> T cell-depleted, γ-irradiated (3,000 rad) splenocytes as bystander cells and 0.5 μg/ml soluble CD3ε antibody.
