        <p>We identify two distinct Hh secretion forms with complementary signaling activities produced in both mammals and flies: one sterol-modified and lipoprotein-associated, and another lacking sterol modification.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Hedgehog (Hh) proteins control animal development and tissue homeostasis. They activate gene expression by regulating processing, stability, and activation of Gli/Cubitus interruptus (Ci) transcription factors. Hh proteins are secreted and spread through tissue, despite becoming covalently linked to sterol during processing. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to release Hh proteins in distinct forms; in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, lipoproteins facilitate long-range Hh mobilization but also contain lipids that repress the pathway. Here, we show that mammalian lipoproteins have conserved roles in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) release and pathway repression. We demonstrate that lipoprotein-associated forms of Hh and Shh specifically block lipoprotein-mediated pathway inhibition. We also identify a second conserved release form that is not sterol-modified and can be released independently of lipoproteins (Hh-N*/Shh-N*). Lipoprotein-associated Hh/Shh and Hh-N*/Shh-N* have complementary and synergistic functions. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs, lipoprotein-associated Hh increases the amount of full-length Ci, but is insufficient for target gene activation. However, small amounts of non-sterol-modified Hh synergize with lipoprotein-associated Hh to fully activate the pathway and allow target gene expression. The existence of Hh secretion forms with distinct signaling activities suggests a novel mechanism for generating a diversity of Hh responses.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Hedgehog (Hh) proteins are conserved secreted signaling molecules that regulate embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Ectopic Hh signaling promotes tumorigenesis, and secretion of mammalian Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) by many tumors supports their growth and survival. As Hh proteins are covalently modified by sterol and palmitate, specific mechanisms are required to release them from cell membranes. Here, we show that different fly and mammalian cell types, including Shh-dependent cancer cells, release lipid-modified Hh/Shh on lipoproteins—the major lipid carriers in circulation. Perturbed lipoprotein metabolism is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, which is associated with many tissue pathologies and an elevated cancer risk. We show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian lipoproteins act positively to mobilize lipid-modified Hh proteins, but also contain lipids that repress the pathway when Hh/Shh is absent. Association of Hh/Shh with lipoproteins neutralizes their inhibitory effect in both organisms. We also find that many cells release a second form of Hh/Shh independently of lipoproteins that lacks sterol modification. This form cannot overcome lipoprotein-mediated repression but further activates the pathway in the presence of lipoprotein-associated Hh/Shh. The existence of multiple release forms with different activities suggests novel conserved mechanisms for generating diverse responses to Hh ligands. Our data also suggest that perturbed Hh signaling could contribute to human pathologies associated with lipoprotein dysfunction.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hedgehog (Hh) family proteins are secreted signaling molecules that control animal development and tissue homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Ingham1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-McMahon1">[2]</xref>. They are produced as precursors that are processed through autocatalytic cleavage and sterol modification to generate the active N-terminal signaling domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Porter1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Porter2">[4]</xref>, which can be further modified by palmitoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Pepinsky1">[5]</xref>. Both lipid modifications influence Hh signaling, but their precise function remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Mann1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Release of dually lipid-modified proteins from cell membranes must involve specific secretion mechanisms. Work in different systems has suggested several mechanisms to release Hh from cellular membranes with its lipid moieties intact, including exovesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Tanaka1">[7]</xref>, multimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Chen1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Zeng1">[11]</xref>, and lipoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Panakova1">[12]</xref>. Although the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lipoprotein Lipophorin (Lpp) promotes long-range Hh spreading in the wing imaginal disc, Hh can still signal over shorter distances in Lpp RNAi animals. Thus, wing discs may also secrete Hh by Lpp-independent mechanisms.</p>
      <p>In addition to mobilizing Hh, Lpp contains lipids that repress the pathway in the absence of Hh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Khaliullina1">[13]</xref>. When Hh is absent, signaling by the 7-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) is catalytically repressed by the Hh receptor, Patched (Ptc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Taipale1">[14]</xref>. Ptc is thought to repress Smo by regulating access to lipophilic ligands that alter Smo trafficking and activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Chen2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Rohatgi1">[17]</xref>. Ptc can mobilize Lpp sterols from endosomes, suggesting that Ptc may modulate Smo activity, in part, by regulating access to inhibitory Lpp lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Khaliullina1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Smo signals by regulating processing of Gli family transcription factors [Cubitus Interruptus (Ci) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Huangfu1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Lum1">[19]</xref>. When Smo is inactive, these are processed to transcriptional repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-AzaBlanc1">[20]</xref>. Active Smo stabilizes full-length Gli/Ci proteins, but to induce target gene transcription, Gli/Ci activation requires additional Smo-dependent events that are not well understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Methot1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Koebernick1">[22]</xref>. Lpp specifically promotes degradation of full-length Ci<sub>155</sub>, but does not influence its activation; upon Lpp RNAi, Ci<sub>155</sub> accumulates, but this does not suffice for target gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Khaliullina1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Thus far, the function of lipoproteins in the Hh pathway has only been investigated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In this study, we demonstrate conserved release mechanisms for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh and human Shh. Both proteins can be secreted in two forms by many different cell types—one is lipoprotein-associated and sterol-modified, the other lacks sterol modification and can be released independently of lipoproteins. Lipoprotein-associated forms of Hh and Shh are also observed in systemic circulation of fruit flies and humans. The lipoprotein-associated forms of Hh/Shh can alleviate the repressive activity of lipoproteins on Hh signaling. Additional signals by non-sterol-modified Hh proteins further activate the pathway to effect target gene expression.</p>

        <title>Human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh Proteins Are Secreted in Both Lipoprotein-Associated and Lipoprotein-Free Forms</title>
        <p>To investigate the secretion forms of mammalian Shh, we first transfected HeLa cells with Shh, cultured them in serum-free medium, and assayed Shh in supernatants after 48 h. Isopycnic density centrifugation showed that all detectable Shh is present in high-density fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, HeLa cells do not secrete Shh on lipoproteins, or other low-density particles like exovesicles, in the absence of extrinsically added factors. We then asked whether HeLa cells might release Shh on exogenously added lipoproteins by providing fetal bovine serum to Shh-transfected HeLa cells and assaying Shh in density-fractionated supernatants after 48 h. These supernatants still contain high-density Shh; however, an additional, more abundant pool of Shh is found in fractions corresponding in density to lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This increase in the level of secreted Shh is not caused by increased Shh production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), raising the possibility that serum lipoproteins facilitate the release of Shh by HeLa cells. Transfecting HeLa cells with different Shh lipid modification mutants shows that lipid modification is essential for formation of the low-density secretion form; Shh-N<sup>C24S</sup>, which lacks both cholesteryl and palmitoyl modification, is present exclusively in high-density fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s001">S1B</xref>). Thus, HeLa cells can secrete Shh in two forms, one of which depends on extrinsic factors and lipid modification.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To ask whether serum increased Shh release or promoted its stability in supernatants, we followed the accumulation of Shh in supernatants over time. Low-density Shh is already detected in supernatants 1 h after addition of fresh serum-containing medium to Shh-transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). In contrast, high-density Shh is only detected after 4 h. This suggests that serum directly increases secretion of a low-density form of Shh.</p>
        <p>To test directly whether low-density Shh corresponded to a lipoprotein-associated form, we added specific human lipoprotein classes to Shh-transfected HeLa cells—very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Western blotting cell supernatants showed that VLDL, LDL, or HDL increases levels of Shh in supernatants without affecting Shh levels in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In density gradients, most Shh fractionates at a density characteristic of the added lipoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). To ask whether Shh bound directly to lipoproteins, we immunoprecipitated lipoproteins from supernatants containing either lipid-modified Shh or non-lipid-modified Shh-N<sup>C24S</sup>. Shh, but not Shh-N<sup>C24S</sup>, is efficiently co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies to proteins that scaffold the major human lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s001">S1D</xref>). Thus, Shh associates directly with all major human lipoprotein classes through its lipid moieties.</p>
        <p>Secretion of Hh proteins by a variety of cancer types promotes tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-RuiziAltaba1">[23]</xref>. To investigate the secretion forms of Shh endogenously produced by cancer cells, we analyzed supernatants of the pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2 grown in serum-free medium supplemented with VLDL, LDL, or HDL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Berman1">[24]</xref>. MIA PaCa-2 cells produce much lower levels of Shh than transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). However, similar to what we observed in HeLa cells, addition of individual lipoprotein classes strongly increases the amount of Shh present in supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, density gradients show that secreted Shh is present in fractions characteristic of the added lipoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g001">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s002">S2B</xref>). Very minor amounts of Shh can also sometimes be detected in high-density fractions. Thus, MIA PaCa-2 cells, which endogenously produce Shh, can release it on the different human lipoprotein classes.</p>
        <p>Shh is efficiently mobilized by three different lipoproteins of widely different size and density, scaffolded by two distinct apolipoproteins, suggesting broad specificity in the mechanisms that promote Shh/lipoprotein association. To ask whether these mechanisms might operate across phyla, we investigated whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> Lpp could act as a carrier for human Shh. Indeed, adding <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemolymph to serum-free medium induces HeLa cells to release Shh that co-fractionates with Lpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). Conversely, Hh-expressing <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells are capable of secreted Hh in a low-density form when grown in the presence of either Lpp or mammalian lipoproteins provided in fetal bovine serum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s002">Figure S2C</xref>,D). These data suggest that conserved biophysical properties of lipoproteins, rather than specific protein–protein interactions, promote their association with Hh proteins. Interestingly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells also produce a high-density form of Hh similar to the high-density Shh observed in HeLa cell supernatants.</p>

        <title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh Can Be Secreted Into the Hemolymph in Both Lipoprotein-Associated and Lipoprotein-Free Forms</title>
        <p>Since both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue culture cells release Hh proteins in both lipoprotein-associated and non-associated forms, we wondered which forms might be found in vivo. Interestingly, we noted that Hh proteins are present in animal circulation; Shh in 100,000 <italic>g</italic> supernatants of human serum is present in density gradient fractions that contain LDL/HDL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh is present in hemolymph, the insect body fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemolymph represents a convenient system to study in vivo Hh secretion, because the secreted form is readily accessible and produced in the presence of all potentially relevant extrinsic factors. Like Hh secretion in imaginal discs, Hh secretion into circulation requires Dispatched (Disp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Burke1">[25]</xref>. However, imaginal discs are not a major source of hemolymph Hh; RNAi-mediated Hh knock-down in discs does not affect hemolymph Hh levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).

The source and function of circulating Hh will be reported elsewhere (Rodenfels et al., manuscript in preparation). To ask whether hemolymph Hh circulated on lipoproteins, we fractionated third instar larval hemolymph on density gradients and probed for Hh and for apoLII, a scaffolding apolipoprotein of Lpp. All detectable Hh co-fractionates with apoLII, suggesting that hemolymph Hh is secreted on Lpp under normal circumstances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s003">S3D</xref>).</p>

        <p>Our observation that a variety of mammalian cell types can secrete Shh on lipoproteins led us to wonder how general this capacity might be in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues. Since the hemolymph allows unambiguous detection of secreted Hh, we used the GAL4 system to induce ectopic expression of Hh in different tissues and examined the secretion form present in the hemolymph. While imaginal discs do not normally contribute to hemolymph Hh, driving Hh overexpression in discs raises the level of Lpp-associated Hh in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g002">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Thus, discs can secrete Lpp-associated Hh, consistent with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Panakova1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, the fat body and midgut can secrete high levels of Lpp-associated Hh into the hemolymph in a Disp-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–D). The vast majority of overexpressed wild-type Hh cofractionates with Lpp, even at the earliest time points after inducing expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s004">Figure S4E</xref>). Thus, a wide variety of cell types, including disc epithelial cells as well as unpolarized fat body cells, can release Hh in association with lipoproteins.</p>
        <p>To ask which lipid modifications were required for association of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh with Lpp, we investigated Hh lipid modification mutants—Hh<sup>C85S</sup>, which lacks palmitate; Hh-N, which lacks sterol; and Hh-N<sup>C85S</sup>, which lacks both modifications. We ectopically expressed these different lipid mutant variants in the fat body, using the fat body-specific driver <italic>lpp</italic>-GAL4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s004">Figure S4F</xref>,G). Density gradients show that Hh<sup>C85S</sup> is released entirely on Lpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Hh-N is released predominantly on Lpp, although small amounts are observed in high-density fractions. In contrast, Hh-N<sup>C85S</sup> is present entirely in high-density fractions. This indicates that most Hh secreted by the fat body is both palmitoylated and sterol-modified and that either lipid modification suffices for Lpp association.</p>
        <p>To ask whether Lpp was needed for secretion of wild-type Hh to circulation, we examined the effects of RNAi-mediated Lpp knock-down. Analysis of hemolymph in density gradients revealed that Hh is still secreted into the hemolymph when Lpp levels are strongly reduced. While some Hh co-fractionates with residual Lpp, most is present in dense fractions that do not contain apoLII, a scaffolding protein of Lpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Reduced sterol levels cannot account for the appearance of high-density Hh, because dietary sterol depletion does not produce this phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s003">Figure S3E</xref>,F). In addition to Lpp, <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemolymph contains two minor lipoproteins of higher density, Lipid Transfer Particle (LTP) and Crossveinless-d (Cv-d) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Palm1">[26]</xref>. However, most hemolymph Hh secreted in Lpp RNAi larvae fractionates at even higher density than LTP or Cv-d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s003">Figure S3G</xref>). This high-density form of Hh therefore does not correspond to LTP or Cv-d-associated Hh; rather, it is a lipoprotein-independent form. Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh can be secreted into the hemolymph as both Lpp-associated Hh and as a lipoprotein-independent form.</p>

        <title>Lipoprotein-Free Hh and Shh Are Secreted as Non-Sterol-Modified Dimers/Monomers</title>
        <p>We wondered how Hh and Shh were secreted independently of lipoproteins as high-density forms. Hh proteins have been proposed to assemble into high molecular weight multimers that interact via their lipid anchors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Chen1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Zeng1">[11]</xref>. Both Hh and Shh have also been observed in monomeric forms. We therefore used gel filtration chromatography to compare the sizes of different secreted forms of Hh and Shh. Shh secreted in the absence of lipoproteins elutes exclusively in low molecular weight fractions consistent with Shh monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This suggests that the high-density form of Shh released by HeLa cells independently of lipoproteins is not multimeric; rather, it corresponds to free Shh. Shh from HeLa cells cultured in serum-containing medium is found both in fractions consistent with monomers and in high molecular weight fractions overlapping those containing the apolipoprotein apoA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, high molecular weight complexes may correspond entirely to lipoprotein-associated Shh.</p>

        <p>To confirm that high-molecular weight pools correspond to the low-density form of Shh, we pooled different sizing column fractions and analyzed them by density gradient centrifugation. Indeed, Shh in size ranges above 240 kDa fractionates entirely at low density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Conversely, Shh present in sizing column fractions consistent with monomers is found in high-density gradient fractions. Thus, HeLa cells produce at least two forms of Shh, a high molecular weight, lipoprotein-associated form and a monomeric form.</p>
        <p>To characterize the size of the different secretion forms of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh in hemolymph, we generated them in larger amounts by overexpressing Hh in the fat body, alone or in combination with induction of Lpp RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Gel filtration chromatography revealed that in wild-type, Hh is present in high molecular weight complexes that are the same size as Lpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Examining these high molecular weight complexes in density gradients confirms that they correspond to low-density Hh (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Reducing Lpp levels causes the appearance of an additional pool of Hh that fractionates near the 45 kDa standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s005">S5C</xref>). Thus, similar to HeLa cells, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body can secrete Hh into the hemolymph as a high molecular weight Lpp-associated form, or as a low molecular weight complex (possibly dimers) independently of Lpp.</p>
        <p>It seemed unlikely for the normally lipid-modified Hh proteins to be soluble as monomers or dimers. Therefore, we considered the possibility that this pool of Hh/Shh lacked lipid modification. To test this directly, we labeled Hh-producing S2 cells with <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol under conditions where they produced similar amounts of low-density and high-density forms. We subjected supernatants to density gradient centrifugation and analyzed each fraction both by Western blotting and in-gel fluorography. Western blotting detects the Hh N-terminal domain in both low- and high-density fractions, however only the low-density pool of Hh has incorporated radioactive cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, high-density Hh is not modified by sterol.</p>
        <p>Sterol modification can also be assayed by partitioning into detergent and aqueous phases of Triton X-114 solutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Porter1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Porter2">[4]</xref>. In this assay, sterol-modified Hh from low-density fractions of S2 cell supernatants partitions predominantly into the detergent phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, non-sterol-modified Hh in high-density fractions partitions almost exclusively into the aqueous phase. Triton X-114 phase partitioning of Hh/Shh variants genetically engineered to lack different lipid moieties shows that sterol is necessary and sufficient for partitioning into the detergent phase, regardless of the presence of palmitate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s005">Figure S5D</xref>,E). We therefore used Triton X-114 partitioning to assess whether the high-density forms of Hh/Shh produced by other cells were sterol-modified. Shh secreted by HeLa cells in the absence of lipoproteins partitions exclusively into the aqueous phase, suggesting that it is not sterol-modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). In contrast, Shh secreted in the presence of lipoproteins partitions mostly into the detergent phase, suggesting that lipoproteins allow the release of sterol-modified Shh. The minority of Shh that partitions into the aqueous phase also migrates slightly more slowly than detergent phase Shh, consistent with the reduced mobility of Hh proteins that lack sterol moieties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Porter1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Porter2">[4]</xref>. To confirm that non-sterol-modified Shh in these supernatants corresponds to the monomeric/high-density pool, we subjected pools of size fractionated Shh to Triton X-114 phase partitioning. Indeed, while the high molecular weight pool partitions into the detergent phase, the low molecular weight pool partitions into the aqueous phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Thus, while the lipoprotein-associated pool of Shh is sterol-modified, the monomeric pool likely is not. Taken together, these data suggest that HeLa cells release only monomeric, non-sterol-modified Hh in the absence of lipoproteins, but can also release sterol-modified Shh when lipoproteins are added.</p>
        <p>To assess the sterol modification of Lpp-associated and high-density <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh forms secreted into the hemolymph, we performed similar Triton X-114 phase partitioning experiments on wild-type and Lpp RNAi hemolymph. Lpp-associated Hh partitions to the detergent phase, indicating it is sterol-modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3H,I</xref>). In contrast, Hh isolated from Lpp RNAi hemolymph, which comprises Lpp-associated and Lpp-free pools, is found in both detergent and aqueous phases. Furthermore, aqueous phase Hh migrates more slowly than detergent phase Hh, similar to non-lipid-modified Hh mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s005">Figure S5F</xref>). Thus, Lpp-associated Hh present in the hemolymph is modified by sterol and Lpp-free Hh likely is not.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these data suggest that lipoproteins promote release of sterol-modified Hh/Shh, whereas the Hh/Shh forms that are secreted independently of lipoproteins appear to be non-sterol-modified. The non-sterol-modified form is indistinguishable in electrophoretic mobility and hydrophobicity from Hh-N/Shh-N, which have been genetically engineered to lack sterol modification. This suggests that their C-terminal sequence is very close or identical to that of Hh-N/Shh-N; however, mass spectrometric analysis will be required to determine it precisely. We hereafter denote these endogenously produced Hh proteins that lack sterol Hh-N*/Shh-N*.</p>

        <p>Although wing imaginal discs can release Hh on Lpp, our previous results suggested that they also must release Hh in a Lpp-independent form; Lpp RNAi does not prevent Hh secretion in wing discs, but reduces its signaling range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Panakova1">[12]</xref>.

MTP is required for assembly of the two lipoproteins Lpp and LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Palm1">[26]</xref>. Blocking both Lpp and LTP secretion causes defects similar to Lpp RNAi alone; released Hh is detected over a shorter distance in the anterior compartment, and its signaling range is correspondingly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, knock-down of either LTP or Cv-d alone does not affect Hh signaling in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s006">Figure S6A</xref>,B). This argues that Hh secreted by wing discs upon Lpp RNAi represents a lipoprotein-independent form. We therefore considered whether discs might normally release a non-sterol-modified form of Hh.</p>

        <p>Although Hh overexpression in imaginal discs increases the amount of Lpp-associated Hh in the hemolymph, it does not result in detectable levels of high-density hemolymph Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, if discs do secrete this form of Hh, it may be more tightly associated with cells or the extracellular matrix. We noted that the N-terminal signaling domains of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian Hh proteins have an unusually high pI (8.45–8.75) and thus should be positively charged at physiological pH. To disrupt possible ionic interactions between Hh proteins and imaginal disc tissue, we dissociated disc cells under either mildly alkaline (pH 9) or high salt (0.5 M NaCl) conditions. These conditions do not disrupt sterol linkage; even pH 10 is insufficient to cleave the ester bond between Hh and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). To enrich for low molecular weight forms of Hh, we prepared 100,000 <italic>g</italic> supernatants; a large fraction of Lpp is pelleted at 100,000 <italic>g</italic>, along with small membrane fragments and exovesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g004">Figure 4B,C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Beckett1">[27]</xref>. Dissociation of discs at pH 9 dramatically increased recovery of Hh in 100,000 <italic>g</italic> supernatants, compared to dissociation in PBS. Density gradient centrifugation of these supernatants shows that most Hh is of high density, consistent with depletion of membrane and Lpp-associated pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Similarly, high salt conditions allow the recovery of high-density Hh in 100,000 <italic>g</italic> supernatants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s006">Figure S6D</xref>). Triton X-114 phase partitioning indicates that high-density Hh is not sterol-modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Smaller amounts of Hh are sometimes detectable in low-density fractions, which also contain residual Lpp; Triton X-114 phase separation confirms that this pool of Hh is sterol-modified. On sizing columns, high-density Hh from imaginal disc supernatants is found in fractions consistent with monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that imaginal discs can release Hh in two forms: one is sterol-modified and Lpp-associated, the other is neither sterol-modified nor Lpp-associated. We obtained similar low- and high-density pools of Hh from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos dissociated at mildly basic pH or in high salt, suggesting that release of these two Hh forms is widespread (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s007">Figure S7</xref>). The non-sterol-modified form appears to be monomeric. Note that the buffer conditions we used do not disrupt lipoprotein particles, or the association of Hh with lipoproteins (unpublished data). However, we cannot rule out that these buffer conditions might disrupt complexes of Hh and other proteins, if these required ionic interactions for their integrity.</p>

        <title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Lpp-Associated Hh Stabilizes Ci155 But Does Not Activate Target Gene Expression</title>
        <p>We wondered whether the signaling activity of Lpp-associated Hh and Hh-N* might differ. To test this, we sought a method to expose wing discs specifically to each of these forms. To achieve this, we ectopically produced different forms of Hh in the fat body and assayed their activity in wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This method has the advantage that the form and amount of Hh to which the wing disc is exposed can be defined by analyzing the hemolymph. We monitored pathway activity by three different methods. We performed Western blotting against the Hh pathway components Ci and Fused. During pathway activation, Fused becomes multiply phosphorylated by different mechanisms; the extent of its phosphorylation correlates with pathway activity and can be monitored by electrophoretic mobility shifts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Zhou1">[28]</xref>. We further used immunostaining to detect the distribution of full-length Ci<sub>155</sub> and target gene expression (<italic>en</italic>, <italic>engrailed</italic>; <italic>col</italic>, <italic>collier</italic>; <italic>dpp</italic>, <italic>decapentaplegic</italic>) in the wing pouch. Hh endogenously produced in the posterior compartment of the wing disc signals to anterior cells close to the compartment boundary. To distinguish the effects of Hh provided exogenously through the hemolymph, we assayed signaling in anterior regions far from the AP boundary, which are normally not exposed to Hh. We also compared the relative sizes of the anterior and posterior compartments; overexpressing Hh in the wing disc causes anterior overgrowth, presumably because of increased production of Dpp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Strigini1">[29]</xref>.</p>

        <p>To ask whether raising the amount of circulating Lpp-associated Hh could elevate Hh levels in wing discs, we used different GAL4 drivers to increase hemolymph Hh—<italic>lpp</italic>-GAL4, which increases circulating Hh levels dramatically, and <italic>npc1b</italic>-GAL4, which increases Hh levels more moderately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). The moderate amounts of hemolymph Hh produced by <italic>npc1b</italic>-GAL4 do not increase Hh staining or affect Hh signaling in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s008">Figure S8A</xref>–C). Thus, the even lower amount of Hh normally present in circulation is unlikely to influence the shape of the wing disc Hh gradient. In contrast, the much higher circulating Lpp-associated Hh levels induced by <italic>lpp</italic>-GAL4 raise Hh staining throughout the anterior compartment of the wing disc to levels normally observed only near the AP boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Thus, this condition provides Lpp-associated Hh to the whole wing disc in relevant amounts, allowing us to specifically assess its signaling activity.</p>
        <p>Lpp-associated Hh stabilizes Smo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s008">Figure S8D</xref>) and Ci<sub>155</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figure 5B,D</xref>) throughout the wing pouch and increases phosphorylation of Fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). However, Lpp-associated Hh does not increase transcription of <italic>dpp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figure 5G</xref>), <italic>en</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s008">Figure S8F</xref>,G), or <italic>col</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figure 6G,H</xref>), and causes barely detectable anterior overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). This is surprising, because Hh present at similar levels in the normal wing disc gradient activates these target genes. Western blotting reveals that Lpp-associated Hh, although it increases the amount of full-length Ci<sub>155</sub>, does not reduce levels of the repressor Ci<sub>75</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s008">S8D</xref>). Thus, Lpp-associated Hh has only a subset of the activities of Hh normally released by wing disc cells. The effects of Lpp-associated Hh are remarkably similar to those of Lpp RNAi—increased phosphorylation of Fused and stabilization of Ci<sub>155</sub> without reduction of Ci<sub>75</sub> or activation of target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figure 5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Khaliullina1">[13]</xref>. This suggests that Lpp-associated Hh does not promote Ci<sub>155</sub> activation or block its processing to the repressor form; rather, it specifically stabilizes inactive full-length Ci<sub>155</sub>. We note that these high levels of Lpp-associated Hh actually repress <italic>en</italic> and <italic>col</italic> expression in the anterior compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figures 6G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s008">S8F</xref>,G), suggesting that they compete with Hh produced locally by posterior compartment cells. This is consistent with the idea that wing discs normally make not only Lpp-associated Hh but also a Lpp-independent form.</p>

        <title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh-N* and Hh-N Can Activate Target Gene Expression</title>
        <p>As the effect of Lpp-associated Hh on the Hh pathway is confined to Ci<sub>155</sub> stabilization, we wondered whether Hh-N*, which is endogenously produced by imaginal discs, might exert additional effects leading to target gene transcription. To address this, we reduced Lpp-mediated Ci<sub>155</sub> degradation and simultaneously exposed wing discs to additional Hh-N* provided by the hemolymph. We accomplished this by concomitant expression of Lpp RNAi and Hh in the fat body. Under these conditions, the hemolymph contains moderate levels of Hh-N*; some Hh is also detected on residual Lpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The total amount of Hh present in the hemolymph is less than when Hh is ectopically produced by otherwise normal fat bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), and it accumulates at lower levels in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s009">Figure S9A</xref>,B). However, Hh produced by the fat body in Lpp RNAi animals induces ectopic expression of <italic>dpp</italic> in some regions of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figure 5G</xref>) and causes strong anterior overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). This suggests that Hh-N* can induce transcription of target genes, at least when Ci<sub>155</sub> is stabilized by Lpp RNAi. The fact that even larger amounts of Lpp-associated Hh do not produce these effects suggests that Hh-N* is either more potent or that its signaling activity is different.</p>
        <p>Since our biochemical data indicated that Hh-N* lacked sterol modification, we wondered whether its activity might be mimicked by Hh-N, which is genetically engineered to lack sterol modification. The signaling activity of Hh-N/Shh-N has been investigated in different systems including wing discs. Their activity compared to wild-type proteins has been controversial—they have been proposed to signal over both longer and shorter ranges than the wild-type form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Gallet1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Lewis1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Li1">[31]</xref>. However, it has been difficult to determine the concentration of secreted Hh-N or sterol-modified Hh to which tissue is exposed in vivo. To compare the signaling activity of Hh-N to that of wild-type Hh at definable concentrations, we expressed each protein in the fat body and first compared their levels in the hemolymph. We used two different Hh-N expression constructs (Hh-N<sup>Med</sup> and Hh-N<sup>Low</sup>) to drive Hh-N expression. Both produce much lower concentrations of circulating Hh than the wild-type Hh expression construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The weak Hh-N<sup>Low</sup> does not increase wing disc Hh staining detectably when expressed in the fat body. Driving Hh-N<sup>Med</sup> in the fat body does increase Hh levels in the wing disc, but to a much lesser extent than expression of wild-type Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s010">S10A</xref>,B).</p>
        <p>We next compared how these defined amounts of Hh-N and wild-type Hh derived from the fat body influenced signaling in the wing disc. In striking contrast to wild-type Lpp-associated Hh, which only causes Ci<sub>155</sub> stabilization and a moderate increase in Fused phosphorylation, these moderate levels of Hh-N produced from Hh-N<sup>Med</sup> elicit the full spectrum of Hh responses; Fused is extensively phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), Ci<sub>75</sub> levels are reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s010">S10E</xref>), and Ci<sub>155</sub> accumulates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figure 6F,H</xref>). Furthermore, target gene expression is activated throughout the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figures 6G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s010">S10A</xref>–C), and wing discs strongly overgrow anteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The minor amounts of Hh-N produced by Hh-N<sup>Low</sup> do not affect target gene activation. However, when combined with wild-type Hh, they suffice to extensively phosphorylate Fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), deplete Ci<sub>75</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s010">S10F</xref>), activate target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figures 6G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s010">S10G</xref>), and cause anterior overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, Hh-N has a qualitatively different signaling activity from wild-type Hh and can activate transcription of target genes. A possible explanation for this is that Hh-N has features of both wild-type Lpp-associated Hh and Hh-N*. It can associate with Lpp, but lacks sterol modification and is partially released as a high-density form. This raises the possibility that the combination of these Hh forms is more powerful that either one alone. Consistently, even otherwise inactive amounts of Hh-N suffice to induce target gene expression if Ci<sub>155</sub> is stabilized by wild-type Lpp-associated Hh.</p>

        <title>Lipoprotein-Associated Shh Reverses Pathway Inhibition by Mammalian Lipoproteins</title>
        <p>To investigate the signaling abilities of lipoprotein-associated Shh and Shh-N*, we assayed their activities in Shh-LIGHT2 cells. These cells harbor a luciferase reporter sensitive to Gli repressors and activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Sasaki1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Taipale2">[33]</xref>. We isolated lipoprotein-associated Shh from supernatants of cells grown with serum by density centrifugation. We prepared Shh-N* from supernatants of cells grown in serum-free medium. We added increasing amounts of either lipoprotein-associated Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) or Shh-N* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) to Shh-LIGHT2 cells in serum-free conditions. For lipoprotein-associated Shh, lipoprotein concentrations were kept constant; only the fraction of lipoproteins carrying Shh was varied. Both forms of Shh increase reporter activity in a concentration-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>). To ask whether lipoproteins repress signaling by Shh-N*, we added both Shh-N* and purified lipoproteins to Shh-LIGHT2 cells. Under these conditions, the vast majority of Shh-N* remains unassociated with lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s011">Figure S11A</xref>). Reporter activation by Shh-N* is strongly reduced by lipoproteins in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s011">Figure S11B</xref>). In contrast, even much higher amounts of lipoproteins do not repress signaling by lipoprotein-associated Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g007">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001505.s011">S11B</xref>). Thus, mammalian lipoproteins repress signaling by lipoprotein-free Shh-N*.

        <p>This similarity led us to wonder whether the inhibitory molecules in lipoproteins were conserved. To test this, we asked whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> Lpp could inhibit signaling in Shh-LIGHT2 cells. Indeed, Lpp strongly represses signaling by Shh-N*. In contrast, Shh associated with Lpp signals efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, the inhibitory activity of lipoproteins on the Hh pathway is conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. Lipoprotein-associated Shh can overcome this inhibition, but Shh-N* cannot.</p>
        <p>We wondered whether Shh-N* might signal more efficiently if lipoprotein-mediated inhibition was blocked by lipoprotein-associated Shh. We therefore assayed their activity in Shh-LIGHT2 cells alone and in combination. We chose concentrations of Shh either in the linear response range or at saturation concentrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>). While Shh-N* signals only weakly in the presence of lipoproteins, adding Shh-N* together with lipoprotein-associated Shh causes a more than additive increase in reporter activity at nonsaturating concentrations of Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001505-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). This suggests that lipoprotein-associated Shh and Shh-N* may increase pathway activity synergistically.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A variety of different mechanisms have been proposed to account for the release and spread of dually lipid-modified Hh proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Mann1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Eaton1">[34]</xref>. In mammalian systems, secreted Hh proteins have been observed in high-molecular weight complexes and on exovesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Tanaka1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Zeng1">[11]</xref>. Monomeric forms have also been detected, but how a doubly lipid-modified protein could remain soluble as a monomer has never been explained. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, association with the insect lipoprotein Lpp promotes long-range Hh signaling, but Lpp knock-down experiments suggested that at least one shorter range form must also exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Panakova1">[12]</xref>. This apparent diversity in release mechanisms raises the question of how different forms of Hh act on cells. In this work, we establish that mammalian Shh can be released on lipoproteins, like its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart, and we identify and biochemically characterize a second conserved release form that is monomeric/dimeric and non-sterol-modified (Hh-N*/Shh-N*). We use both mammalian signaling assays and in vivo experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to distinguish their effects on the Hh pathway and show that they signal synergistically.</p>
      <p>Our studies of lipoprotein-mediated release of Shh were facilitated by the use of cell types (HeLa and Mia-PaCa2) that rely on extrinsic factors (in this case lipoproteins) to release sterol-modified Shh. Interestingly, it was recently shown that extrinsic addition of Scube to tissue culture cells also promotes release of lipid-modified Shh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Creanga1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Tukachinsky1">[36]</xref>. Together, these studies highlight the emerging importance of non-autonomously acting factors in the release of sterol-modified Hh proteins. HEK293 and Bosc23 cells, which have often been used to study Shh release mechanisms, are able to release some sterol-modified Shh even in defined serum-free media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Zeng1">[11]</xref>. It would be interesting to ask whether these differences might be accounted for by endogenous production of factors like Scube or apolipoproteins.</p>

        <title>Conserved Functions for Lipoproteins in the Hh Pathway</title>
        <p>Our work in tissue culture shows that an evolutionarily conserved feature of lipoproteins is their ability not only to mobilize Hh proteins, but also to repress pathway activity. A unique function of lipoprotein-associated forms of Hh is to reverse this pathway inhibition. To what extent are lipoproteins important for the in vivo function of mammalian Hh proteins? Genetic studies have not highlighted obvious links between mammalian lipoprotein metabolism and the Hh pathway. However, it has been noted that loss of apoB-containing lipoproteins does produce a subset of phenotypes similar to those of Hh loss of function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Farese1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Raabe1">[38]</xref>. Knockouts of individual members of the large family of apoA-like apolipoproteins are viable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Plump1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Plump2">[40]</xref>. However, since we have shown that Shh can be released on all human lipoprotein classes, redundancy might make a requirement for lipoproteins hard to identify genetically. Furthermore, phenotypic analysis may be confounded by the fact that lipoproteins exert both positive and negative effects on the Hh pathway.</p>
        <p>Many different tissues produce lipoproteins and they are abundant in circulation and interstitial fluids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Reichl1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Vance1">[43]</xref>. While access to large lipoproteins such as VLDL may be limited by the permeability of the vasculature in some tissues, HDL is abundant in interstitial fluid. Even before development of the embryonic vasculature is complete, apoA1 can be readily detected in mouse limb buds (M. Swierczynska and S. Eaton, unpublished observation). Thus, it will be interesting to assess the relative contributions of different lipoproteins to Shh release and signaling in vivo during development and adult tissue homeostasis. Many tumors secrete Hh proteins, which they require for growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-RuiziAltaba1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Barakat1">[44]</xref>. Interestingly, lipoprotein levels are unbalanced in metabolic syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of cancer development. Tumors promote both angiogenesis and vascular permeability and should have access to a broad range of lipoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Faulds1">[45]</xref>. Thus, our observation that lipoproteins enhance Shh release by the pancreatic cancer cell line Mia-PaCa2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Berman1">[24]</xref> may be relevant to a broad variety of Shh-secreting tumors in vivo.</p>
        <p>In addition to mobilizing Hh proteins locally, our work suggests that lipoproteins may also function to carry them into systemic circulation. While we do not address the physiological role of circulating Hh here, we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh produced in one organ can signal to another in an endocrine manner. Hh signaling is known to influence lipid metabolism in both mammals and flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Suh1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Teperino1">[48]</xref>, and Hh associated with circulating lipoproteins may be important in this regard. Perturbed lipoprotein metabolism is a widespread phenomenon in modern society and is associated with a wide variety of different tissue pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Eckel1">[49]</xref>. Our results raise the possibility that lipoprotein dysfunction might cause disease in part by altering Hh signaling.</p>

        <title>Release of Hh Proteins as Non-Sterol-Modified Forms</title>
        <p>Our work also demonstrates that Hh proteins can be released independently of lipoproteins in a non-sterol-modified form (Hh-N*/Shh-N*). Autocatalytic processing of the full-length Hh protein to the active N-terminal domain involves covalent linkage to sterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Porter1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Porter2">[4]</xref>. How could cells generate non-sterol-modified Hh-N*/Shh-N*? Hh-N*/Shh-N* might be generated enzymatically by unknown sterol esterases or proteases, or cleavage of the thioester bond by an alternative nucleophile. These proteins cannot lack significant portions of the N-terminal signaling domain; Hh-N*/Shh-N* are of slightly slower electrophoretic mobility than their sterol-modified counterparts, migrating similarly to Hh proteins from which cholesterol has been removed either chemically or genetically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Porter1">[3]</xref>. This distinguishes Shh-N* from Shh released by metalloprotease-mediated shedding, which is a truncated protein with faster electrophoretic mobility than lipid modified Shh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Dierker1">[50]</xref>. Many studies have observed monomeric/dimeric forms of secreted Hh proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Chen1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Zeng1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Feng1">[51]</xref>, although whether these were sterol-modified was never established. This raises the possibility that the autonomous ability of cells to release non-sterol-modified forms is widespread.</p>

        <title>Complementary Functions of Lipoprotein-Associated and Non-Sterol-Modified Forms of Hh</title>
        <p>The diversity of different forms of secreted Hh raises the interesting issue of whether they might affect signaling in different ways. For the first time, to our knowledge, we show here that at least two of these different forms (lipoprotein-associated Hh and Hh-N*) have qualitatively different effects on the Hh pathway. We show that the lipoprotein-associated forms of both <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh and mammalian Shh can block the repressive effects of lipoproteins on Hh signaling. In vivo experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reveal that lipoproteins and Lpp-associated Hh regulate a specific subset of signaling events. Lpp-associated Hh can increase Smo levels, partially phosphorylate Fused, and increase Ci<sub>155</sub> levels. However, Lpp-associated Hh cannot reduce levels of the Ci<sub>75</sub> repressor form or activate expression of target genes. Non-sterol-modified Hh-N* has a complementary function; extremely low levels of Hh-N that do not affect signaling at all by themselves combine with Lpp-associated Hh to complete Fused phosphorylation, reduce the levels of Ci<sub>75</sub> repressor, and activate target gene expression. Signaling experiments in Shh-LIGHT2 cells show that lipoprotein-associated Shh can induce reporter transcription in this assay; interestingly, it can also synergize with Shh-N* to further increase pathway activity. Our findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest it will be interesting to assay for different effects of each Shh form on ciliary Smo trafficking and processing of Gli2 and Gli3.</p>
        <p>In general, it will be important to understand how these forms act differently at the cellular level. We showed previously that Ptc regulates Lpp trafficking and proposed that Ptc represses Smo, in part by mobilizing an inhibitory lipid from Lpp particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Khaliullina1">[13]</xref>. Lipoprotein association may facilitate the access of Hh/Shh to this compartment, allowing it to efficiently block mobilization of lipoprotein lipids by Ptc. In contrast, non-lipoprotein-associated Shh/Hh, although they likely bind to Ptc, may interact with different co-receptors (e.g. Ihog and Cdo-family proteins, or LRP2) with distinct signaling functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Beachy1">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Christ1">53</xref>.</p>
        <p>Much Hh research has focused on the importance of its graded spatial and temporal distribution in patterning gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Dessaud1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001505-Zhu1">[55]</xref>. Our data raise the possibility that tissue-patterning information might be contained, not only in the absolute amount of Hh but in the relative proportions of different Hh forms. These forms may spread through tissue differently, form differently shaped gradients, and interact with different receptor complexes. Thus, the Hh activity gradient may reflect the superimposition of gradients created by distinct Hh forms. In general, regulating the secretion form of Hh might be one way of generating a diversity of Hh responses in different tissues.</p>

Cv-d is used as a loading control. (B) Hh levels in hemolymph and fat body of control and Dispatched (Disp) mutant larvae ectopically expressing Hh in the fat body, analyzed by WB. Note that hemolymph levels of fat-body-secreted Hh are strongly decreased in Dispatched mutants. Loading controls are Cv-d (hemolymph) or tubulin (larval extract). (C) Hh levels in hemolymph and gut of control and Dispatched mutant larvae ectopically expressing Hh in the midgut. Note that hemolymph levels of midgut-secreted Hh are strongly decreased in Dispatched mutants. Loading controls are Cv-d (hemolymph) or tubulin (larval extract).

Subsequently, Hh hydrophobicity was analyzed by Triton X-114 phase separation and WB. pH 9 or pH 10 does not increase the levels of Hh present in the aqueous phase, indicating that these conditions do not hydrolyze the ester bond between Hh and sterol.
