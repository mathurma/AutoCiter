<abstract>
<p>Specification of the dorsal-ventral axis in the highly regulative sea urchin embryo critically relies on the zygotic expression of <italic>nodal</italic>, but whether maternal factors provide the initial spatial cue to orient this axis is not known. Although redox gradients have been proposed to entrain the dorsal-ventral axis by acting upstream of <italic>nodal</italic>, manipulating the activity of redox gradients only has modest consequences, suggesting that other factors are responsible for orienting <italic>nodal</italic> expression and defining the dorsal-ventral axis. Here we uncover the function of Panda, a maternally provided transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) ligand that requires the activin receptor-like kinases (Alk) Alk3/6 and Alk1/2 receptors to break the radial symmetry of the embryo and orient the dorsal-ventral axis by restricting <italic>nodal</italic> expression. We found that the double inhibition of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptors Alk3/6 and Alk1/2 causes a phenotype dramatically more severe than the BMP2/4 loss-of-function phenotype, leading to extreme ventralization of the embryo through massive ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic>, suggesting that an unidentified signal acting through BMP type I receptors cooperates with BMP2/4 to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression. We identified this ligand as the product of maternal Panda mRNA. Double inactivation of <italic>panda</italic> and <italic>bmp2/4</italic> led to extreme ventralization, mimicking the phenotype caused by inactivation of the two BMP receptors. Inhibition of maternal <italic>panda</italic> mRNA translation disrupted the early spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic>, leading to persistent massive ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic> on the dorsal side despite the presence of Lefty. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Panda is not a prototypical BMP ligand but a member of a subfamily of TGF-β distantly related to Inhibins, Lefty, and TGF-β that includes Maverick from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and GDF15 from vertebrates. Indeed, overexpression of Panda does not appear to directly or strongly activate phosphoSmad1/5/8 signaling, suggesting that although this TGF-β may require Alk1/2 and/or Alk3/6 to antagonize <italic>nodal</italic> expression, it may do so by sequestering a factor essential for Nodal signaling, by activating a non-Smad pathway downstream of the type I receptors, or by activating extremely low levels of pSmad1/5/8. We provide evidence that, although <italic>panda</italic> mRNA is broadly distributed in the early embryo, local expression of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA efficiently orients the dorsal-ventral axis and that Panda activity is required locally in the early embryo to specify this axis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that maternal <italic>panda</italic> mRNA is both necessary and sufficient to orient the dorsal-ventral axis. These results therefore provide evidence that in the highly regulative sea urchin embryo, the activity of spatially restricted maternal factors regulates patterning along the dorsal-ventral axis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A key event during development of bilaterians is specification of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes of the embryo. In some species, such as the fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this process relies on the activity of maternal determinants localized into the egg during oogenesis. However, in other animals, such as mammals or echinoderms, which are renowned for the developmental plasticity of their embryos, there is presently no evidence for maternal determinants controlling axis formation, and how these embryonic axes emerge from radially symmetrical embryos remains unknown. In the sea urchin embryo, specification of the dorsal-ventral axis critically relies on the localized expression of the TGF-β ligand Nodal in the presumptive ventral territory, but what controls the spatially restricted expression of <italic>nodal</italic> is not known. We discovered that in the sea urchin embryo, the initial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression is directed by another TGF-β ligand that is expressed maternally, which we named Panda. Panda is both necessary for the early spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> and sufficient to orient the dorsal-ventral axis when misexpressed locally. Altogether, our findings suggest that Panda may act as a maternal signal that defines the orientation of the dorsal-ventral axis. Thus, an antagonism between Nodal and maternal Panda signaling drives dorsal-ventral axis formation in the sea urchin embryo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In bilaterians, specification of the dorsal-ventral (D/V) axis is a crucial event during embryogenesis to establish the correct body plan. In many species, this process relies on gene products translated from maternal mRNAs deposited in the egg. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, specification of the D/V axis of the embryo is initiated by the product of the <italic>gurken</italic> gene, which is active in the oocyte nucleus during oogenesis and encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) superfamily that acts as a secreted dorsalizing signal [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similarly, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish, although the D/V axis is not preformed in the unfertilized egg, dorsal determinants are localized to the vegetal pole of the egg [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Fertilization breaks the radial symmetry of the egg and triggers the asymmetric transport of these determinants from the vegetal pole to the future dorsal side where they activate the canonical Wnt pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While maternal information is clearly important for specification of the D/V axis in a number of species, in contrast, there is very little evidence for the presence of maternal determinants of axis formation in the oocyte of mammals, consistent with the idea that the embryonic axes are specified entirely by cell interactions [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Accordingly, it has been argued that the regulative abilities of the first blastomeres of the mouse embryo rule out the possibility that maternal determinants influence axis specification [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]).</p>
<p>The sea urchin embryo is well known for its extraordinary developmental plasticity [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In a now classical blastomere dissociation experiment, Driesch showed that dissociated blastomeres of the four-cell stage embryo have the potentiality to reestablish a D/V axis [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The outcome of this experiment not only demonstrated the impressive regulative ability of the early blastomeres of the sea urchin embryo but also strongly influenced ideas about how D/V patterning is established in this organism. By showing that the D/V axis is very easily respecified, it encouraged the view that there are no determinants for D/V axis formation in echinoderm embryos. On the other hand, egg bisection experiments performed by Hörstadius showed that differences in the fates of presumptive ventral and dorsal regions can be traced back to the egg, consistent with the idea that the oocyte already has a bilateral organization [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. If there are maternal cues that influence D/V axis formation in this embryo, what could they be? There is a large body of evidence correlating formation of the D/V axis with the activity of redox gradients and with the asymmetric distribution of mitochondria in the unfertilized sea urchin egg. Classical experiments performed by Child, Pease, and Czihak in the thirties and sixties showed that it is possible to bias the D/V axis by treating embryos with steep gradients of respiratory inhibitors and that the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase can predict the D/V axis as early as the eight-cell stage, with the presumptive ventral side being more oxidizing than the dorsal side [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This asymmetry of mitochondria activity is the first known manifestation of D/V polarity. Several recent studies by Coffman and colleagues addressed the question of causality between this early asymmetry and the orientation of the D/V axis [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although these studies provided evidence that the D/V axis can be entrained by centrifugation, by microinjection of purified mitochondria, or by overexpressing a form of catalase targeted to the mitochondria, the correlations obtained remained modest, and in no case were these perturbations shown to efficiently orient the D/V axis [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, perturbations that were expected to influence D/V axis formation, such as overexpression of a mitochondrially targeted form of superoxide dismutase, which generates the strong oxidizing component H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and that would be predicted to efficiently orient the axis, did not show any effect on the orientation of the D/V axis. Therefore, the redox gradient model of D/V axis formation clearly needs further experimental validation, and the biological significance of the early asymmetry of mitochondria and of redox gradients and their relation to the D/V axis remains largely unclear.</p>
<p>At the molecular level, the earliest sign of specification of the D/V axis is the expression of the TGF-β <italic>nodal</italic> in the presumptive ectoderm at the 32-cell stage. <italic>nodal</italic> is the first known zygotic gene differentially expressed along the D/V axis, and Nodal signaling orchestrates patterning along the secondary axis first by specifying the ventral ectoderm and second by inducing the expression of BMP2/4, which acts as a relay to specify the dorsal ectoderm. <italic>nodal</italic> morphants completely lack D/V polarity, but expression of <italic>nodal</italic> into one blastomere is capable of completely rescuing D/V polarity in these embryos [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory studies further showed that <italic>nodal</italic> expression is driven by ubiquitously expressed maternal factors such as the transcription factor SoxB1 and that it requires maternal Wnt/beta catenin signaling as well as signaling by the Vg1/GDF1-related maternal factor Univin [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Intriguingly, <italic>nodal</italic> is initially expressed very broadly, almost ubiquitously, and then its expression is progressively restricted to a more discrete region of the ectoderm during cleavage. The progressive spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression is thought to rely mostly, if not exclusively, on the ability of Nodal to promote its own expression through an intronic autoregulatory enhancer [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and to induce the expression of the long-range Nodal antagonist Lefty. This regulatory mechanism based on the long-range diffusion of the Lefty antagonist fulfills the requirement for a reaction diffusion and is thought to be mainly responsible for amplifying an initial subtle asymmetry, possibly generated by redox gradients, into a robust spatially restricted expression of <italic>nodal</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>nodal</italic> expression requires the integrity of the p38 pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Inhibition of p38 signaling with pharmacological inhibitors abolishes <italic>nodal</italic> expression. Immunostaining experiments using an anti-phosho p38 and analysis of the spatial distribution of a p38-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein revealed that p38 is first activated ubiquitously and then selectively inactivated on the presumptive dorsal side of the embryo. The signals that regulate p38 in the early embryo are not known, but it has been proposed that redox gradients may be directly responsible for p38 activation [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, direct evidence that p38 mediates the effects of redox gradients is presently lacking, and the transcription factors linking p38 to the machinery that regulates <italic>nodal</italic> expression are not known.</p>
<p>In this paper, we identify a maternal factor that plays a crucial role in D/V axis formation by directing the spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. First, we discovered that an unidentified TGF-β ligand cooperates with BMP2/4 to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression. We identified this ligand as the product of a maternally expressed TGF-β ligand related to Maverick from Drosophila and GDF15 from vertebrates that we named Panda. Inhibition of maternal <italic>panda</italic> mRNA translation blocked the early spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> and caused persistent massive ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic> on the dorsal side despite the presence of Lefty. We further show that while blocking translation of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> mRNA alone does not cause ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic>, the double knockdown of <italic>panda</italic> and <italic>bmp2/4</italic> causes an extreme ventralization. We further provide evidence that the <italic>panda</italic> mRNA is broadly distributed in the early embryo, that local expression of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA efficiently orients the D/V axis, and that, although <italic>panda</italic> mRNA is broadly distributed, Panda activity is required locally in the early embryo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that maternal <italic>panda</italic> mRNA is required early to restrict the spatial expression of <italic>nodal</italic>, that it is sufficient to orient the D/V axis when misexpressed, and therefore, that it fulfills the requirements for a maternal factor that specifies the D/V axis.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that, although specification of the D/V axis is established by the activity of Nodal in the zygote, maternally provided signaling molecules play crucial roles by antagonizing the activity of Nodal.</p>

<title>The Type-I BMP Receptor Alk1/2 Is a Central Player in D/V Axis Formation and BMP2/4 Signaling</title>
<p>We showed previously that during D/V patterning in the sea urchin embryo, transduction of the BMP2/4 signals requires the activity of the type-I BMP receptor Alk3/6, the functional orthologue of Thickveins, which transduces Dpp signals in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We noticed, however, that blocking Alk3/6 consistently produced a phenotype much less severe than the BMP2/4 loss-of-function phenotype. For example, while <italic>bmp2/4</italic> morphants typically lack a population of immunocytes called pigment cells that requires BMP signaling, <italic>alk3/6</italic> morphants always develop with numerous pigments cells (arrows in <xref rid="pbio.1002247.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). This suggested that residual BMP signaling in <italic>alk3/6</italic> morphants allows formation of pigment cells and/or that additional BMP type I receptors may contribute to transduction of BMP2/4 signals in the absence of Alk3/6. Indeed, in addition to <italic>alk3/6</italic>, the sea urchin genome contains a second gene encoding a BMP type I receptor named Alk1/2, which is mostly similar to Alk1 and Alk2 from vertebrates and to Saxophone from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Like <italic>alk3/6</italic>, <italic>alk1/2</italic> is expressed maternally and ubiquitously during the cleavage and blastula stages (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). To evaluate the contribution of Alk1/2 in BMP2/4 signaling, we knocked it down with antisense morpholinos. Interestingly, blocking <italic>alk1/2</italic> mRNA translation disrupted D/V axis formation and produced a phenotype stronger than that resulting from inhibition of Alk3/6 (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). When the <italic>alk1/2</italic> morpholino was injected at 1.2 mM, most <italic>alk1/2</italic> morphants failed to develop their ventral arms and dorsal apex and appeared rounded. Alk1/2 morphants also lacked most pigment cells and developed with an ectopic ciliary band and ectopic spicules on the dorsal side, a phenotype largely identical to the <italic>bmp2/4</italic> morphant phenotype. These phenotypes could be suppressed by coinjection of a modified wild-type <italic>alk1/2</italic> mRNA immune against the morpholino (see <xref rid="pbio.1002247.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). As shown previously in the case of Alk3/6 and of BMP2/4, blocking Alk1/2 caused a dramatic expansion of the ciliary band territory at the expense of the dorsal ectoderm, as evidenced by the massive ectopic expression of <italic>foxG</italic> and <italic>onecut</italic> on the presumptive dorsal side and the lack of expression of dorsal marker genes such as <italic>hox7</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Unexpectedly, blocking Alk1/2 function, unlike blocking BMP2/4 or Alk3/6, caused a weak but consistent ventralization, as evidenced by the expression of <italic>chordin</italic> or <italic>foxA</italic> that extended to the dorsal side at the gastrula stage (black arrowheads in <xref rid="pbio.1002247.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Consistent with this ventralization, we found that at blastula stages, embryos injected with high doses of the <italic>alk1/2</italic> morpholino displayed a massive ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic> similar to that observed in <italic>lefty</italic> morphants (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). This phenotype, which is not observed in <italic>bmp2/4</italic> or <italic>alk3/6</italic> morphants, suggests that, in addition to BMP2/4, Alk1/2 may also be required to transduce an unidentified dorsalizing signal. Finally, consistent with the absence of expression of dorsal marker genes, inhibition of <italic>alk1/2</italic> mRNA translation, like inhibition of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> or <italic>alk3/6</italic>, drastically reduced phospho-Smad1/5/8 signaling in the dorsal ectoderm (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). We conclude that Alk1/2 plays a pivotal role in transduction of BMP2/4 in the sea urchin and that the activities of Alk1/2 and Alk3/6 are nonredundant, both being functionally required during D/V patterning to transduce BMP2/4 signals and to activate Smad1/5/8 signaling in the dorsal ectoderm. Furthermore, these results suggest that in addition to BMP2/4, Alk1/2 may be required for transduction of (a) still unidentified signal(s) that regulate(s) D/V patterning.</p>

<p>(A) Morphology of embryos at 72 hours after fertilization (hpf) injected with morpholinos targeting either the <italic>alk3/6</italic>, <italic>alk1/2</italic>, or <italic>bmp2/4</italic> transcripts. Note the striking similarity of the phenotypes of <italic>alk1/2</italic> and <italic>bmp2/4</italic> morphants that both develop with a ciliary band on the dorsal side (black arrowheads) compared to the less severe phenotype of <italic>alk3/6</italic> morphants that is evidenced by the presence of pigment cells (black arrows) and of a less well-developed ciliary band on the dorsal side. (B) Expansion of the ventral and ciliary band fates at the expense of the dorsal ectoderm in <italic>alk1/2</italic> morphants was revealed by the analysis of marker genes. Controls and <italic>alk1/2</italic> morphants embryos were stained by in situ hybridization with the indicated probes. In <italic>alk1/2</italic> morphants at mesenchyme blastula, the territory expressing the ventral marker genes, <italic>nodal</italic>, <italic>chordin</italic>, and <italic>foxA</italic> is largely normal, but consistently, a slight broadening of <italic>nodal</italic> expression is observed (white arrowheads), while expression of the dorsal gene <italic>hox7</italic> is suppressed.

<title>An Unidentified TGF-β Ligand Acting through Alk1/2 and Alk3/6 Cooperates with BMP2/4 to Restrict <italic>nodal</italic> Expression</title>
<p>To further characterize the requirements for Alk1/2 and Alk3/6 in D/V axis patterning, we performed a double knockdown. Our expectations were that the double knockdown of <italic>alk3/6</italic> and <italic>alk1/2</italic> would produce a phenotype roughly similar to the BMP2/4 loss-of-function phenotype. However, surprisingly, the morphology of the double knockdown embryos was very different from that of the <italic>bmp2/4</italic> knockdown. The <italic>alk1/2</italic> + <italic>alk3/6</italic> morphants were completely radialized and developed with a prominent proboscis in the animal pole region and with an ectopic ciliary band surrounding the vegetal pole region (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, white and black arrowheads, respectively). These features are typical of the strongly ventralized phenotype observed in <italic>nodal</italic>-overexpressing or nickel-treated embryos (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Indeed, molecular analysis revealed that the double inhibition of Alk3/6 and Alk1/2 caused a massive ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic> and of its downstream target genes <italic>chordin</italic> and <italic>foxA</italic> in the presumptive ectoderm at the blastula stage, whereas it abolished the expression of the dorsal marker gene <italic>hox7</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Consistent with the extreme ventralization of the double <italic>alk1/2</italic> + <italic>alk3/6</italic> morphants, at the gastrula stage, expression of the ciliary band genes <italic>foxG</italic> and <italic>onecut</italic> was detected in a belt of cells surrounding the vegetal pole (black arrowheads in <xref rid="pbio.1002247.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), a pattern typically observed in embryos ventralized by <italic>nodal</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Since these results suggest that signaling from these BMP receptors is required to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression, we tested if treatments with recombinant BMP2/4 can antagonize <italic>nodal</italic> expression. Indeed, treatments with increasing concentrations of recombinant BMP2/4 protein gradually antagonized <italic>nodal</italic> expression, with low concentrations first causing a typical Nodal loss-of-function phenotype and high concentrations resulting in dorsalization of the ectoderm (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>

Note the presence of a ciliary band in the vegetal pole region (black arrowheads) and the prominent proboscis (white arrowheads) in the animal pole region in the double <italic>alk1/2</italic> + <italic>alk3/6</italic> morphants and in <italic>nodal</italic>-overexpressing or nickel-treated embryos.

<p>Taken together, these results reveal that specification of the ventral territory is not independent of BMP signaling, as previously thought [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The results suggest instead that, in addition to specifying the dorsal region at the onset of gastrulation, signaling from the two BMP receptors Alk3/6 and Alk1/2 is critically required during or before blastula stages to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression to the ventral side. Importantly, the fact that the <italic>bmp2/4</italic> morphant phenotype is considerably weaker than the double <italic>alk1/2</italic> + <italic>alk3/6</italic> morphant phenotype strongly suggests that an unidentified signal acting through these BMP type I receptors is critically required, in addition to BMP2/4, for the correct specification of the D/V axis and for the normal restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression.</p>

<title>The TGF-β Ligand Panda Cooperates with BMP2/4 to Restrict <italic>nodal</italic> Expression during D/V Patterning</title>
<p>We next attempted to identify the TGF-β ligand acting through Alk3/6 and Alk1/2 that cooperates with BMP2/4 and that restricts the early expression of <italic>nodal</italic> during D/V axis formation. In other species, BMP ligands of the BMP5/8 and anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein (ADMP) subfamilies have been shown to cooperate and to act redundantly with BMP2/4 factors during D/V patterning. For example, in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, while the single knockdown of either ADMP, BMP2, BMP4, or BMP7 resulted in partial central nervous system (CNS) expansion, the quadruple knockdown of BMP2,4,7 and ADMP caused full radialization and ubiquitous neural induction [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We therefore tested if in the sea urchin, like in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, members of the BMP5/8 and ADMP subfamilies of TGF-β ligands cooperate with BMP2/4 during D/V patterning.</p>
<p>The simple knockdown of BMP5/8 caused a phenotype much weaker than the phenotype caused by blocking BMP2/4. Surprisingly, the double knockdown of BMP2/4 and BMP5/8 only slightly increased the severity of the BMP2/4 morphant phenotype (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002247.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Similarly, the double knockdown of BMP2/4 and ADMP did not cause a phenotype dramatically more severe than the BMP2/4 morphant phenotype. Even more surprising, the triple knockdown of BMP2/4, BMP5/8, and ADMP did not increase significantly the severity of the BMP2/4 morphant phenotype and did not result in ventralized embryos, suggesting that in the sea urchin, BMP5/8 and ADMP do not act redundantly with BMP2/4 to regulate the spatial restriction of Nodal (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). We therefore extended our search for TGF-β ligands that would cooperate with BMP2/4 during D/V patterning to other members of the TGF-β superfamily. In addition to members of the BMP subfamily such as <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>bmp5/8</italic>, and <italic>admp</italic>, the sea urchin genome contains several genes encoding TGF-β ligands structurally related to Activins including TGF-β sensu stricto, Activin as well as SPU_018248, a less well-characterized gene related to Maverick from <italic>Drosophila</italic> that we renamed <italic>panda (paracentrotus anti-nodal dorsal activity)</italic> (see below) in this study [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Blocking Activin or TGF-β sensu stricto did not perturb establishment of the D/V axis, making unlikely the possibility that these factors cooperate with BMP2/4 to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (our unpublished results). In contrast, blocking translation of the TGF-β Panda strongly affected D/V polarity. While the triple knockdown of <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>bmp5/8</italic>, and <italic>admp1</italic> did not increase the severity of the <italic>bmp2/4</italic> morphant phenotype, in contrast, the double knockdown of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>panda</italic> produced a very strong phenotype, indistinguishable from that of the double <italic>alk1/2 + alk3/6</italic> morphants. Strikingly, the ventralization induced by the double inactivation of <italic>panda</italic> and <italic>bmp2/4</italic> was so strong that it frequently led to scission of the embryos in two parts by formation of a circular stomodeum and separation of the animal pole-derived proboscis from the vegetal part of the larva that contained the gut (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Indeed, starting at early stages, the double <italic>panda</italic> + <italic>bmp2/4</italic> morphants displayed a massive ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic>, similar to that caused by the double inactivation of Alk1/2 and Alk3/6 (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). The extent of this radialization was extremely pronounced, as evidenced by the radial expression of the other ventral markers <italic>chordin</italic> and <italic>foxA</italic> and of the ciliary band markers <italic>onecut</italic> and <italic>foxG</italic> as well as by the suppression of the dorsal marker <italic>hox7</italic> both at the blastula and late gastrula stages. The summary diagram of <xref rid="pbio.1002247.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> shows that, while inactivation of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> alone does not cause ventralization, in contrast, simultaneous inactivation of both <italic>panda</italic> and <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, like the double knockdown of <italic>alk1/2</italic> and <italic>alk3/6</italic>, causes unrestricted expression of <italic>nodal</italic> leading to strong ventralization.</p>

<p>These observations strongly support the view that Panda is the elusive factor that, together with BMP2/4, is required to antagonize Nodal signaling during D/V patterning of the embryo. Taken together, these results also suggest that, in addition to Lefty, the normal restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression during D/V patterning in the sea urchin embryo requires the activities of Panda and BMP2/4 possibly signaling through the two BMP type-I receptors, Alk3/6 and Alk1/2.</p>

<title>Panda Is a Maternally Expressed TGF-β Ligand Required Early to Restrict <italic>nodal</italic> Expression</title>
<p>In a previous study, we had suggested that the TGF-β encoded by SPU_018248 is related to Maverick sequences from insects and to GDF2 sequences from <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic>; however, this analysis failed to identify any deuterostome orthologue of this gene, and the evolutionary origin of this TGF-β remained unclear [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To clarify the evolutionary relationships between SPU_018248 and other TGF-β family members and to identify orthologous sequences of this gene in deuterostomes, we performed a novel phylogenetic analysis using a comprehensive set of TGF-β sequences from protostomes, deuterostomes, and cnidarians and including in the analysis the Maverick sequence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the GDF2 sequence from Molluscs as well as a large set of BMP family members from different organisms (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002247.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). This analysis confirmed that the sea urchin Panda sequence is phylogenetically related to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Maverick and "GDF2-like" sequence from <italic>Crassostrea</italic>. However, it further revealed that Panda and Maverick/GDF15-like factors belong neither to the GDF2/BMP9 family nor to any known subclass of canonical BMP ligands. In addition, this analysis identified GDF15 from vertebrates as well as two genes from hemichordates and cephalochordates (called <italic>myostatin-like</italic>) as additional deuterostome orthologues of Panda (see also <xref rid="pbio.1002247.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Consistent with these conclusions, Panda, Maverick, and GDF15 share with Inhibins beta chains, TGF-β, and Myostatins a pattern of nine cysteines in the ligand domain, a pattern that is not shared by any prototypical BMP ligand (see <xref rid="pbio.1002247.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref> and the alignment provided in the supplementary information). Therefore, Panda, Maverick, and GDF15-like sequences define a distinct subclass of TGF-β ligands within a larger branch of the TGF-β superfamily that comprises Inhibins beta chains, Lefty factors, Myostatins, and TGF-β sensu stricto (see also [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]).</p>

We reanalyzed the expression of <italic>panda</italic> by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization and confirmed that transcripts of this gene are present predominantly in immature ovocytes, unfertilized eggs, and early embryos (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002247.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>). Remarkably, a graded distribution of transcripts could be detected in immature ovocytes, in eggs, and during early stages, with one side of the embryo showing a slightly stronger staining than the other, reinforcing the idea that this factor plays an early role in D/V axis formation. Furthermore, double labeling with <italic>nodal</italic> revealed that the side with the highest concentration of mRNA was the dorsal side, opposite to the side of <italic>nodal</italic> expression, consistent with the idea that Panda is a factor that cooperates with BMP2/4 to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>).

<p>To further characterize the role of <italic>panda</italic> during D/V axis formation, we injected two different antisense morpholino oligonucleotides targeting either the translation start site or the 5' UTR region of the transcript. Injecting these two different morpholinos gave rise to similar and remarkable phenotypes (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). While at the late gastrula stage, control embryos had started to flatten on the presumptive ventral side and had formed two PMC clusters on each side of the archenteron, the <italic>panda</italic> morphants were completely radialized, and the PMCs remained arranged into a ring around the archenteron (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Similarly at 48 hpf, when control embryos had developed into elongated pluteus larvae, <italic>panda</italic> morphants had conserved a radially symmetrical morphology and contained ectopic spicules rudiments (arrowheads in <xref rid="pbio.1002247.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Surprisingly, at 72 h, these embryos had partially recovered a D/V polarity as indicated by the bending of the archenteron towards the presumptive ventral ectoderm, the opening of the stomodeum, and the preferential elongation of spicules on the presumptive dorsal side (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Indeed, molecular analysis revealed that in most of the embryos (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 300), knocking down <italic>panda</italic> with either the ATG morpholino (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) or the UTR morpholino (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>) caused a strong ventralization accompanied with massive ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic> and <italic>chordin</italic>, which were expressed throughout most of the ectoderm at the mesenchyme blastula stage, and a concomitant loss of the dorsal marker gene <italic>hox7</italic>. At the late gastrula/prism stage (30 hpf), <italic>panda</italic> morphants remained ventralized, as evidenced by the expanded expression of ventral marker genes such as <italic>nodal</italic>, <italic>foxA</italic>, and <italic>foxG</italic> compared to control embryos, occupying about one-half of the embryo. However, consistent with the progressive recovery of D/V polarity observed in live embryos, the expression of <italic>hox7</italic> in the dorsal region and of the ciliary band marker <italic>onecut</italic> at the late gastrula stage indicated that dorsal and ciliary band fates were allocated in <italic>panda</italic> morphants by the end of gastrulation (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Therefore, although the morphology of <italic>panda</italic> morphants is radially symmetrical at late gastrula stage, molecular analysis reveals that these embryos are nevertheless patterned along the D/V axis and that radialization is caused by a marked expansion of ventral cell fates. Taken together, these results suggest that Panda function is required early to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression. In the absence of Panda, ventral fates are expanded at the expense of dorsal fates, but this ventralization is most severe during the blastula and gastrula stages, the embryos progressively recovering, to some extent, a D/V polarity after 48 h (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>

<title>Panda, Alk1/2, and Alk3/6 Are Required Early to Restrict <italic>nodal</italic> Expression</title>
<p>To determine when Panda, Alk1/2, and Alk3/6 functions are required to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression, we performed a time-course experiment. We compared <italic>nodal</italic> expression at successive developmental stages, from cleavage to mesenchyme blastula, in control embryos and in embryos injected with either the morpholino oligonucleotide targeting the ATG of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA or with a morpholino oligonucleotide targeting a splice junction of the <italic>panda</italic> gene or with a mixture of <italic>alk1/2</italic> and <italic>alk3/6</italic> morpholino (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A–7C</xref>). Strikingly, in embryos injected with the morpholino targeting the translation start site of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA, presumed to block both maternal and zygotic <italic>panda</italic> transcripts, or with a combination of the <italic>alk1/2</italic> and <italic>alk3/6</italic> morpholinos, <italic>nodal</italic> expression was never restricted and remained radialized at all stages analyzed (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>nodal</italic> expression was largely normal in embryos injected with the morpholino targeting the splice junction of <italic>panda</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>), and blocking zygotic <italic>panda</italic> function did not noticeably perturb development of the embryos (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002247.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). RT-PCR analysis indicated that this splice-blocking morpholino reduced the level of the mature panda transcript by more than 90% at the pluteus stage (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). This analysis reveals that the function of maternal Panda, but not of zygotic Panda, and the activities of Alk1/2 and Alk3/6 are required very early to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression to the ventral side.</p>

<title>Local Overexpression of <italic>panda</italic>, Like Inhibition of Nodal Signaling, Efficiently Orients the D/V Axis</title>
<p>The results presented so far indicate that Panda is expressed in a broad D/V gradient and that, like Lefty, Panda is critically required for the correct spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> to the ventral side during early stages. We then tested if overexpression of Panda, like overexpression of Lefty, efficiently blocks Nodal signaling. Surprisingly, overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> in the egg did not perturb establishment of the D/V axis, and the <italic>panda</italic>-overexpressing embryos developed into normal pluteus larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). This suggested that unlike Lefty, Panda alone is not capable of suppressing Nodal signaling when overexpressed. We then reasoned that rather than inhibiting Nodal signaling, the function of Panda may instead be to bias early Nodal signaling, perhaps by simply attenuating Nodal signaling on the dorsal side. If this were the case, then local overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> should efficiently orient the D/V axis. To test if local overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> is capable of biasing the orientation of the D/V axis, embryos at the two-cell stage were injected into one blastomere with <italic>panda</italic> mRNA together with a lineage tracer, and at the prism stage, the position of the clone of injected cells was recorded (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>). Strikingly, in almost 100% of the embryos injected with <italic>panda</italic> mRNA, the boundaries of the clone precisely coincided with the dorsal part of the embryo. Local overexpression of a constitutively active version of Alk3/6 (Alk3/6QD) or Alk1/2 (ALK1/2Q/D) mimicked the effects of local overexpression of <italic>panda</italic>, efficiently orienting the D/V axis in all the injected embryos (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002247.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Global overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> at the one-cell stage does not perturb establishment of the D/V axis. Normal morphology of pluteus larvae developing after injection with <italic>panda</italic> mRNA at 1,000 μg/ml. (B) Effects of local overexpression or down-regulation of various components of the Nodal and BMP pathway on the orientation of the D/V axis. Injection of <italic>panda</italic> (1,000 μg/ml) or of the activated form of <italic>alk3/6</italic> (<italic>alk3/6Q230D)</italic> mRNA (200 μg/ml) into one blastomere at the two-cell stage imposes a dorsal identity to the progeny of the injected cell in nearly 100% of the injected embryos. Local down-regulation of <italic>nodal</italic> or <italic>acvrII</italic> also imposes a dorsal identity. Conversely, down-regulation of <italic>panda</italic> or <italic>alk3/6</italic> mRNA, and to a lesser extent of <italic>alk1/2</italic>, strongly biases the orientation of the D/V axis and promotes ventral fates. V, ventral; D, dorsal. The same result was also obtained by local inhibition of Nodal signaling after injection into one blastomere at the two-cell stage of a morpholino oligonucleotide targeting either the <italic>nodal</italic> transcript or the type II Nodal receptor <italic>acvrII</italic>. Consistent with this strong effect on the orientation of the D/V axis, in all embryos injected with <italic>panda</italic> or <italic>alk3/6QD</italic> mRNAs or with the <italic>acvrII</italic> or <italic>nodal</italic> morpholinos, at the blastula stage, <italic>nodal</italic> was expressed in a sector of the embryo located on the opposite side of the clone of injected cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>).

<p>Finally, we tested if overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> promotes expression of dorsal marker genes. We analyzed the expression of <italic>tbx2/3</italic>, the earliest zygotic expressed in all three germ layers in the presumptive dorsal region and that is thought to be induced by low levels of BMP signaling [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> induced a moderate ectopic expression of <italic>tbx2/3</italic> in all three germ layers, suggesting that <italic>panda</italic>, like <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, can activate BMP target genes requiring a low level of BMP signaling (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
<p>We next tested if removing the function of <italic>panda</italic> from part of the early embryo is also sufficient to orient the D/V axis (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002247.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, injecting the <italic>panda</italic> morpholino randomly into one blastomere at the two-cell stage significantly biased the orientation of the D/V axis, most embryos (77.5%) showing a clone of fluorescently labeled cells in the ventral region. Similarly, injection of <italic>alk3/6</italic> morpholino into one blastomere at the two-cell stage efficiently (70%) oriented the D/V axis, supporting the idea that Alk3/6 is involved in the early steps of D/V axis specification. Injection of the <italic>alk1/2</italic> morpholino also significantly biased the orientation of the D/V axis, imposing a ventral identity to the clone in about 50% of the injected embryos (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>). In contrast, injection of the <italic>bmp2/4</italic> morpholino into one blastomere did not significantly orient the D/V axis, 37% of the injected embryos displaying a clone of injected cells on the ventral side, further suggesting that <italic>bmp2/4</italic> is not involved in the early steps of axis specification (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, these results show that while manipulating the levels of BMP2/4 does not appear to have a strong effect on the orientation of the D/V axis, in contrast, up-regulating or down-regulating the levels of Panda or Alk3/6, and to a lesser extent of Alk1/2, in part of the early embryo strongly impacts on the orientation of the D/V axis, partially mimicking manipulations of the levels of Nodal signaling.</p>

<title>Spatially Restricted Panda Signaling Specifies the D/V Axis</title>
<p>In the course of our functional analysis of <italic>panda</italic>, we tried to rescue the defects of D/V patterning and the spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression of <italic>panda</italic> morphants, by injecting a synthetic <italic>panda</italic> mRNA lacking the sequence targeted by the morpholino. Surprisingly, injection into the egg of a synthetic <italic>panda</italic> mRNA failed to rescue the severe defects of D/V polarity caused by injection of the <italic>panda</italic> morpholino (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). All the embryos derived from double injection of <italic>panda</italic> morpholino and <italic>panda</italic> mRNA at the one-cell stage developed with a phenotype indistinguishable from the <italic>panda</italic> loss-of-function phenotype. Since Panda is required to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression and since the endogenous <italic>panda</italic> mRNA is enriched on the presumptive dorsal side, we reasoned that maybe Panda activity had to be provided locally in order to mimic the distribution of endogenous <italic>panda</italic> mRNA and to rescue D/V polarity of <italic>panda</italic> morphants. Indeed, while injection of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA into the egg was inefficient to rescue the D/V axis, injection of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA into one blastomere completely rescued D/V polarity of embryos previously injected with the <italic>panda</italic> morpholino, all the embryos developing into perfectly normal pluteus larvae with the dorsal side corresponding to the <italic>panda</italic>-expressing clone (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). This experiment demonstrates that the activity of exogenous Panda has to be spatially restricted to rescue the lack of maternal Panda function, consistent with the idea that the activity of endogenous Panda is spatially restricted in the early embryo. Similarly, injection into one blastomere of <italic>alk3/6QD</italic> mRNA at low doses that do not dorsalize completely rescued D/V polarity of embryos previously injected with <italic>panda</italic> morpholino, consistent with previous results showing that local misexpression of an activated form of Alk3/6 is sufficient to antagonize <italic>nodal</italic> expression and to orient the D/V axis (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Coinjection of the <italic>panda</italic> and <italic>alk1/2</italic> morpholinos or of the <italic>panda</italic> and <italic>alk3/6</italic> morpholinos causes a strong ventralization, as does the double inactivation of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> + <italic>alk1/2</italic> or of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>alk3/6</italic>.

(C) Panda requires Alk3/6 to orient the D/V axis when misexpressed. Local overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> orients the D/V axis in nearly 100% of the injected embryos. However, if the eggs are first injected with the <italic>alk3/6</italic> morpholino, panda is no longer able to orient the D/V axis. (D) Western blot of phospho-Smad1/5/8 in control embryos at the indicated stages or in embryos overexpressing <italic>panda</italic> or injected with a <italic>panda</italic> morpholino. Note that phosphoSmad1/5/8 is undetectable before the late blastula stage and that overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> does not appear to cause phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. B1, very early blastula; B2, early blastula.

The highly sensitive alkaline phosphatase-based detection of pSmad1/5/8 does not allow detection of Smad1/5/8 signaling at early stages in control embryos. In contrast, following overexpression of <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>alk3/6QD</italic>, or <italic>alk1/2QD</italic> into the egg or into one blastomere at the two-cell stage, strong nuclear phosphoSmad1/5/8 immunostaining is easily detected at early blastula. This pSmad1/5/8 immunoreactivity is not detected following injection of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA. Nevertheless, overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> induces weak ectopic Smad1/5/8 signaling at mesenchyme blastula. (F) Overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> expands Smad1/5/8 signaling at the mesenchyme blastula stage. pSmad1/5/8 is normally restricted to the dorsal ectoderm and dorsal PMCs at mesenchyme blastula. Overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> expands the territory in which pSmad1/5/8 is detected toward the ventral side.

Similarly, the double inactivation of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>alk1/2</italic> or of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>alk3/6</italic> produced a strong ventralization, suggesting that the activities of Alk1/2 and Alk3/6 are both required to transduce Panda signals, although the phenotype was slightly less severe than that resulting from the double knockdown of <italic>panda</italic> and <italic>bmp2/4</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A and 10B</xref>).</p>
<p>To test directly the hypothesis that Panda requires the BMP type I receptors to orient the D/V axis, we used the axis induction assay. We first injected the <italic>alk3/6</italic> morpholino into the egg, and then, at the two-cell stage, we injected <italic>panda</italic> mRNA into one blastomere. While <italic>panda</italic> mRNA efficiently oriented the D/V axis when injected alone, previous injection of the <italic>alk3/6</italic> morpholino into the egg abolished the ability of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA to orient the D/V axis, suggesting that the Alk3/6 receptor is required for the activity of Panda (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the results presented above strongly suggest that Panda requires the activity of the BMP type I receptors to orient the D/V axis; however, they do not answer the question of what signal transduction pathway is activated by this ligand. Since the axis-inducing activity of Panda requires the BMP type I receptor Alk3/6 and since manipulating the levels of this BMP type I receptor largely mimicked the effects of manipulating the levels of Panda, we expected that Panda, acting through Alk3/6 and Alk1/2, would activate canonical BMP signaling and Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. However, intriguingly, previous studies failed to detect phospho-Smad1/5/8 before the hatching blastula stage using western blotting [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], suggesting that previous detection methods were not sensitive enough or that Panda may not activate canonical Smad signaling. We therefore attempted to detect endogenous phospho-Smad1/5/8 during the cleavage/early blastula period using an optimized western blotting assay. We were able to detect very strong phosphorylation of endogenous Smad1/5/8 at mesenchyme blastula stages (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10D</xref>). However, endogenous phospho-Smad1/5/8 remained below the level of detection during cleavage stages, and overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> did not detectably increase the level of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 at early stages. We also tried to detect phospho-Smad1/5/8 during cleavage/early blastula by using a sensitive immunostaining protocol. Fixed embryos were incubated with the anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibody and then with a secondary antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10E</xref>). While overexpression of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> or of an activated form of <italic>alk3/6</italic> or of <italic>alk1/2</italic> induced robust and very strong phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 starting during cleavage stages, overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> did not cause any detectable phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 at these early stages (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10E</xref>). However, intriguingly, at mesenchyme blastula, we consistently observed expanded phospho-Smad1/5/8 signals in most embryos overexpressing <italic>panda</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10F</xref>), consistent with the observed ectopic expression of <italic>tbx2/3</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>). However, pSmad1/5/8 signaling remained strongly polarized along the D/V axis, consistent with the apparent inability of <italic>panda</italic> to completely dorsalize embryos.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>panda</italic> may not directly activate phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and that the expanded pSmad1/5/8 signals may result from Panda antagonizing Nodal signaling and/or promoting BMP2/4 signaling [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results presented in this study show that in addition to Lefty, the spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression critically requires the activity of the maternal TGF-β ligand Panda. Panda is required very early and locally for the spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression and is sufficient to orient the axis when locally overexpressed. Taken together, these properties strongly suggest that Panda may act as a maternal determinant of D/V axis formation in the sea urchin embryo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An important and still largely unanswered question in developmental biology is how embryonic axes emerge in highly regulative and radially symmetrical embryos such as in mammals. Does formation of the primary and secondary axes depend entirely on cell interactions and reaction-diffusion mechanisms in the zygote, as suggested by the large developmental plasticity of the early blastomeres, or does it rely in part on maternal cues deposited in the egg? The process of D/V axis formation in the sea urchin embryo provides an interesting system to address this question. The D/V axis of the sea urchin embryo is thought to be specified largely in the absence of maternal determinants, as evidenced by the conspicuous developmental plasticity of the early blastomeres, and to rely instead on an asymmetry of the expression of the zygotic gene <italic>nodal</italic> established by a reaction-diffusion mechanism with its antagonist Lefty. Yet, are the concepts of maternal determination of axis formation and regulative development necessarily mutually exclusive?</p>
<p>In this study, we uncovered a very important and early function for a maternally expressed TGF-β ligand in the orientation of the D/V axis of the zygote through the spatial regulation of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. A key observation that was at the basis of this work was the finding that double inactivation of Alk1/2 and Alk3/6 produced an extreme radialization due to the unrestricted expression of <italic>nodal</italic>. Since this phenotype was much stronger than the <italic>bmp2/4</italic> morphant phenotype, and since the effects of abolishing BMP signaling on <italic>nodal</italic> expression could be observed well before the onset of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> expression, the inescapable conclusion was that another TGF-β ligand acting through these two TGF-β receptors was cooperating with BMP2/4 during D/V axis formation. Using a double morpholino injection assay, we identified this factor as Panda, a TGF-β ligand related to Inhibins, TGF-β and Lefty factors. These findings strongly impact on the current models of D/V axis formation since they reveal that the spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression critically requires a maternally provided spatial cue. In addition, by showing that the graded localization of a maternal RNA provides a blueprint of the D/V axis in the highly regulative sea urchin embryo, they also provide additional support to the idea that the concept of maternal determination of axis specification and developmental plasticity are not necessarily exclusive. Finally, our findings that the orientation of <italic>nodal</italic> expression in the early embryo is negatively controlled by the spatially restricted activity of a TGF-β ligand that requires BMP type I receptors highlight the crucial role played by the antagonism between Nodal and BMP signaling in axis specification and suggest that this antagonism may represent an ancestral way to specify the axes during development.</p>

<title>The Spatially Restricted Activity of a Maternal TGF-β Ligand as the Initial Asymmetry That Specifies the D/V Axis of the Sea Urchin Embryo</title>
<p>The current prevailing model postulates that redox gradients generated by mitochondria asymmetrically distributed in the egg regulate the activity of redox-sensitive transcription factors that control the initial asymmetry of <italic>nodal</italic> expression [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, although very attractive, the hypothesis that mitochondrial redox gradients drive <italic>nodal</italic> expression is not strongly supported by the extensive experimental work that has addressed this question.</p>
<p>Here we provided several lines of evidence demonstrating that the maternally expressed TGF-β ligand Panda acts as an early and central player in the establishment of the D/V axis. First, we showed that the function of Panda is required very early to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression. Second, we showed that <italic>panda</italic> mRNA is expressed in a broad gradient in the early embryo and that the activity of Panda is spatially restricted. Third, we showed that overexpression of <italic>panda</italic> promotes the overexpression of <italic>tbx2/3</italic>, the earliest zygotic dorsal gene marker. Finally, we showed that local misexpression of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA or local inhibition of <italic>panda</italic> very efficiently orients the D/V axis. The broad distribution of Panda mRNA raises the possibility that some other localized factor may be required in the normal embryo for imposing D/V polarity on Panda function. The fact that only local overexpression, and not global overexpression, of Panda rescues the D/V axis of Panda morphants strongly suggests that this is probably not the case, since if another localized factor was playing the role of a maternal determinant, then injection of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA into the egg would rescue the D/V axis of <italic>panda</italic> morphants. Therefore, Panda is, to our knowledge, the first signaling factor whose activity is spatially restricted in the embryo and that is both necessary and sufficient to efficiently orient the D/V axis upstream of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. How can we reconcile the roles of Panda as a maternal signal that orients the D/V axis with the wealth of data correlating redox gradients and the asymmetric distribution of mitochondria with the secondary axis? One possible mechanism that would reconcile the two bodies of evidence is that formation of the gradient of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA may be dependent on the activity or the distribution of mitochondria. Alternatively, redox gradients could differentially affect the stability/activity of Panda as shown recently in the case of another TGF-β ligand [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Similarly, these findings on Panda could be correlated to the role of p38 in promoting <italic>nodal</italic> expression during D/V axis formation. As shown by Bradham and colleagues, p38 activity is required for <italic>nodal</italic> expression, and after a period of ubiquitous activation, it is specifically down-regulated on the presumptive dorsal side [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Panda, acting through Alk1/2 and Alk3/6, may be responsible for this down-regulation of p38 activity on the dorsal side, which may in turn prevent Nodal autoregulation, a hypothesis that we are currently testing.</p>

<title>Maternal Determinants of D/V Axis Formation and Developmental Plasticity of the Early Blastomeres</title>
<p>The sea urchin embryo is well known for its remarkable developmental plasticity, the best example of this flexibility being the ability of each blastomere of the four-cell stage to regulate and to develop into smaller but normally patterned pluteus larvae. The outcome of this experiment deeply influenced ideas about how the D/V axis may be specified in this embryo, leading to the commonly accepted view that D/V patterning of the sea urchin embryo relies on cell interactions in the zygote and not on asymmetrically distributed determinants. On the other hand, classical experiments of Horstadius using unfertilized eggs showed that artificially activated meridional halves frequently differentiate as left-right or D/V pairs. These observations led Horstadius to conclude that "there seems to be no doubt as to the existence of a ventral-dorsal axis in the unfertilized sea urchin egg" [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The finding that the spatially restricted activity of Panda directs D/V axis formation strongly supports this conclusion. However, the finding that the spatially restricted activity of maternal <italic>panda</italic> mRNA directs the orientation of the D/V axis may seem at odds with the results of the Driesch experiment. How can we reconcile the fact that the first blastomeres show an equivalent potential to reestablish a secondary axis with the graded activity of a maternal factor controlling formation of the D/V axis in the early embryo? Following dissociation, each blastomere is expected to inherit a portion of the gradient of activity of Panda. One possibility is therefore that the portion of the gradient of activity of Panda inherited by each blastomere following dissociation is sufficient to reestablish the secondary axis. Indeed, with a reduced gradient of activity of Panda, the reaction-diffusion mechanism between Nodal and Lefty may in some cases be sufficient to amplify an initial asymmetry of the expression of <italic>nodal</italic> or <italic>lefty</italic>, leading to the restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression and to reestablishment of the secondary axis.</p>
<p>Hörstadius repeated and extended the Driesch experiment by rearing each of the four blastomeres in a separate dish [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interestingly, he noted that in some cases one or two embryos of the quartet differentiated and established a D/V axis faster than the others. This is exactly what would be expected if the blastomeres inherit different portions of the gradient of activity of Panda. The results of Hörstadius are therefore consistent with our finding that there is a maternal gradient of a dorsalizing activity in the early embryo.</p>

<title>An Antagonism between Nodal Signaling and Signaling from the BMP Type I Receptors as an Ancestral Mechanism Used to Specify the D/V Axis?</title>
<p>Our finding that the activity of two type I BMP receptors is essential to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression in the sea urchin embryo adds further support to the previously suggested idea that an antagonism between Nodal and BMP signaling may be an ancestral mechanism to specify the axes [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Evidence is accumulating that both in chordates and in echinoderms, a correct balance between BMP signals and Nodal signals is required for normal D/V patterning [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Both in echinoderms and in vertebrates, inactivation of the BMP pathway promotes cell fates controlled by Nodal. The process of specification of the distal visceral endoderm in the mouse embryo offers a striking example of such an antagonism. Formation and positioning of the distal visceral endoderm is regulated by an antagonism between BMP-Smad1 and Activin/Nodal-Smad2 signaling, and activin receptor II (ACVRII) has been shown to act as a limiting factor in this process [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Similarly, there is accumulating evidence that during left-right axis specification, the opposing activities of Nodal and BMPs are required for proper patterning along this axis and that BMP signaling is required to spatially restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For example, mouse embryos mutant for <italic>smad1</italic>, <italic>smad5</italic>, <italic>spc4</italic>, or for the gene encoding the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 display bilateral expression of <italic>nodal</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Intriguingly, although this antagonism may be fundamental for axis specification, the underlying mechanism is not well understood, and how the two pathways interact is not known. This antagonism may result from a direct interaction at the level of the signaling components. For example, it has been suggested that a competition at the level of Smad4 may set a threshold on Nodal signaling [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Alternatively, this antagonism may result from an interplay at the level of the ligands and secreted antagonists produced downstream of each pathway or at the level of ACVRII, which acts as a common receptor for both pathways. Finally, an antagonism at the level of the transcription factors induced by Nodal or BMP may be responsible for the antagonism between the two signaling pathways. Interestingly, a recent study proposed that the gene encoding the homeobox repressor Hbox12, a member of the Hbox12/pmar1/micro1 family [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], is expressed early on the dorsal side of the embryo and that it represses <italic>nodal</italic> expression [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], raising the possibility that this gene may act downstream of Panda to repress <italic>nodal</italic> expression. However, preliminary experiments to test this idea did not provide evidence for a link between Panda and Hbox12 (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Mechanism of Panda Inhibition of Nodal Signaling</title>
<p>Although we have detected expanded phospho-Smad signaling following misexpression of <italic>panda</italic> at the beginning of gastrulation, we failed to detect activation of Smad1/5/8 signaling during the early cleavage period, i.e., when <italic>panda</italic> is supposed to work, in embryos overexpressing <italic>panda</italic>. Therefore, Panda may not activate pSmad1/5/8 signaling directly, and the mechanism by which Panda antagonizes Nodal signaling during early stages remains presently unclear. We can envision several scenarios. Panda may antagonize Nodal signaling by heterodimerizing with Nodal and blocking its function. Such an activity has been reported in the case of BMP7 as well as in the case of Lefty [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Another possibility for the mechanism by which Panda may antagonize Nodal is that Panda may work like the Nodal antagonist Lefty, by sequestering a factor essential for Nodal signaling such as the co-receptor Cripto, ACVRII, or Alk4/5/7 [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The finding that blocking locally Nodal or ACVRII fully mimics the effects of overexpressing <italic>panda</italic> on the orientation of the D/V axis is consistent with this idea. However, these two hypotheses both predict that overexpression of Panda should strongly antagonize Nodal signaling, an activity that is not observed following overexpression of <italic>panda</italic>. One possibility to explain this result is that Panda may require another factor to act as a strong antagonist of Nodal signaling when overexpressed. Panda may therefore antagonize Nodal signaling in a way similar to that of Inhibin, which disrupts Activin signaling by acting through an intermediary factor and sequesters a factor required for Activin signaling [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A major difference between Panda and Inhibin is that while Inhibins have never been shown to require any type I receptor to function, our results indicate that Panda most likely requires the two BMP type I receptors Alk1/2 and Alk3/6 to antagonize Nodal. Therefore, if Panda acts by sequestering a factor required for Nodal signaling, this activity may also require functional Alk1/2 and Alk3/6, possibly in a complex with these two receptors. Finally, it remains also possible that Panda signals through these type I receptors and activates a noncanonical non-Smad pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] that in turn may antagonize the Nodal pathway. In line with this conclusion, members of the Panda/Maverick/GDF15 subfamily lack a highly conserved leucine residue present in the so-called "wrist" domain of all BMP ligands (Leu 51 in human BMP2) that is critically required for binding of these factors to the type I BMP receptor. This suggests that members of the Panda/Maverick/GDF15 subfamily are low-affinity ligands for the BMP type I receptors or that the interaction between members of this subfamily and the BMP type I receptor may involve residues different from those involved in the interaction between canonical BMP ligands and the BMP type I receptors [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Also along these lines, it is intriguing to note that the mechanisms by which vertebrate GDF15 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Maverick work remain also largely unknown. During <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, the <italic>maverick</italic> gene is broadly expressed during oogenesis and embryogenesis and throughout the larval stages [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Its function has long been enigmatic, but recent studies have uncovered a key role for Maverick during synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junctions [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Maverick produced by glial cells was shown to promote expression of Glass bottom boat (Gbb), the fly ortholog of BMP7, in muscles. Similarly, the function of GDF15 in mice and humans is poorly understood. GDF15 is weakly expressed in most tissues, but its expression is induced in response to tissue injury, notably in the heart following myocardial infarction [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Neither <italic>Drosophila</italic> Maverick nor vertebrate GDF15 have been shown so far to activate any of the signaling pathways normally activated by BMP or Activin type ligands, and the mechanism by which these factors work remains unknown [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Our results showing that Panda antagonizes <italic>nodal</italic> expression by acting through type I BMP receptors and that overexpressed Panda induces <italic>tbx2/3</italic> without detectably activating Smad1/5/8 signaling points to non-Smad signaling as a potential mechanism for the crosstalk between the Nodal and BMP pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that Panda may induce a level of Smad1/5/8 activation below the current limits of detection, a level that would be sufficient to mediate its effects. Finally, a combination of the different mechanisms mentioned above including antagonism between Smad1 and Smad2, sequestration of rate-limiting components, and antagonism between transcription factors induced downstream of Smads may underlie the antagonism between Nodal and BMP signaling in the sea urchin embryo. Biochemical and functional experiments will therefore be required to dissect the mechanism by which Panda antagonizes Nodal signaling in the sea urchin embryo.</p>

<title>Distinct and Sequential Roles for Panda, Lefty, and BMP2/4 during D/V Axis Formation</title>
<p>An interesting parallel can be drawn between the identification of Panda as a maternal TGF-β ligand acting through BMP receptors that cooperates with the zygotic BMP2/4 and the finding that maternal Univin, a Vg1 related ligand, cooperates with the zygotic Nodal. In the case of Nodal and Univin, it has been suggested that Nodal may heterodimerize with Univin and increase its specific activity [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Indeed, while Nodal is a strong ventralizing factor, overexpression of Univin has very modest effects on D/V patterning. Similarly, BMP2/4 has an extremely strong dorsalizing activity, while Panda essentially lacks dorsalizing activity. Heterodimer formation is, however, probably not the mechanism by which Panda and BMP2/4 cooperate, since Panda and BMP2/4 act at different periods during D/V axis formation and the activities of these factors appear to be qualitatively different. Panda is required early, starting at cleavage stages, well before BMP2/4 starts to be expressed, for the spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression, while BMP2/4 is required much later, starting after hatching. Furthermore, while the only known activity of Panda is to limit and orient <italic>nodal</italic> expression and to induce <italic>tbx2/3</italic>, BMP2/4 has a key role in activating a cohort of dorsally expressed transcription factors and signaling molecules. Finally, while BMP2/4 strongly activates phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad1/5/8, Panda only appears capable of weakly activating pSmad signaling. Therefore, D/V axis specification in the sea urchin embryo requires two phases of signaling from the BMP receptors, but these two phases are temporally and qualitatively different. The first phase of signaling, which covers the period of cleavage up to hatching blastula, is the consequence of maternal Panda signaling through Alk3/6 and Alk1/2, either through very low canonical Smad signaling or possibly through noncanonical Smad signaling, while the second phase, which starts after hatching and continues late in gastrulation, is the result of zygotically produced BMP2/4 factors binding to the same receptors but activating canonical phospho-Smad signaling.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Panda and Lefty are both expressed early and that both factors are required nonredundantly to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression, the function of Panda is also clearly different from that of Lefty. Panda is capable of orienting the D/V axis when expressed into one blastomere at the two-cell stage, but overexpression of Panda in the egg does not suppress Nodal signaling. Furthermore, Panda is not sufficient to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression in <italic>lefty</italic> morphants. Therefore, the function of Panda appears to be to break the radial symmetry and to create the asymmetry of <italic>nodal</italic> expression rather than to maintain the asymmetry of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. In support of this idea, in the absence of Panda, <italic>nodal</italic> remains radially expressed up to the beginning of gastrulation. Therefore, although the function of Lefty is normal in these embryos, its activity is not sufficient to restrict <italic>nodal</italic> expression in the absence of Panda. In other words, without Panda, Lefty is unable to create an asymmetry of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. The function of Lefty appears therefore important to maintain the asymmetry of <italic>nodal</italic> expression previously established by Panda rather than to create this asymmetry.</p>

<title>A Revised Model of D/V Axis Specification: Panda Breaks the Radial Symmetry by Restricting Nodal Expression</title>
<p>We have identified the maternal TGF-β ligand Panda as a novel and central player of the pathway controlling D/V axis formation. Although previous models placed Nodal as the first extracellular signal conveying spatial information for D/V axis formation, we can now place maternal Panda as the earliest known signal orienting the D/V axis upstream of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. A new model of D/V axis formation in the sea urchin embryo is the following (<xref rid="pbio.1002247.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). During oogenesis, maternal <italic>panda</italic> mRNA is deposited into the egg, possibly in a graded manner along the D/V axis, and following fertilization, this gradient of mRNA is translated into a shallow gradient of Panda protein. Starting at the 32/60-cell stage, ubiquitously expressed maternal transcription factors and maternal Wnt and Univin signaling activate <italic>nodal</italic> expression very broadly in the presumptive ectoderm. However, on the presumptive dorsal side, the increased activity of Panda weakly antagonizes <italic>nodal</italic> expression, introducing a first bias in <italic>nodal</italic> autoregulation that will initiate the spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression to the presumptive ventral side. Then, starting at the early blastula stage, Nodal signaling induces expression of <italic>lefty</italic>, and the reaction-diffusion mechanism between Nodal and Lefty further contributes to maintain the spatial restriction of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. Finally, at the prehatching blastula stage, Nodal induces <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>chordin</italic> expression. Chordin prevents BMP2/4 signaling on the ventral side while it shuttles BMP2/4 to the opposite dorsal side, where BMP2/4 activates the gene regulatory network responsible for specification of the dorsal side of the embryo.</p>

<p>In conclusion, although Nodal remains the pivotal factor that regulates D/V axis formation in the sea urchin embryo, we have shown that the reaction-diffusion mechanism between Nodal and Lefty is not sufficient to break the radial symmetry of the embryo. This process of symmetry breaking is accomplished by a maternal factor, Panda, whose activity is required early and locally in the embryo to restrict the spatial expression of <italic>nodal</italic>. This work therefore illustrates how in the highly regulative sea urchin embryo, the secondary axis is already "penciled in " by the graded maternal information deposited into the egg in the form of a gradient of <italic>panda</italic> mRNA. Since <italic>nodal</italic> plays a key role in specification of the proximal distal axis in mammals and in specification of the secondary and left-right axes in a number of species, this raises the question as to whether members of the Panda/Maverick/GDF15 also provide a blueprint of axial development in these embryos.</p>

<p>Adult sea urchins (<italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic>) were collected in the bay of Villefranche. Embryos were cultured as described in Lepage and Gache (1989, 1990) [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p>
<p>For immunostaining and in situ hybridization at early stages, fertilization envelopes were removed by adding 2 mM 3-amino-1,2,4 triazole 1 min before insemination to prevent hardening of this envelope, followed by filtration through a 75 μm nylon net. Treatments with recombinant BMP2/4 or Nodal proteins were performed by adding the recombinant protein diluted from stocks in 1 mM HCl, in 24-well plates containing about 1,000 embryos in 2 ml of artificial sea water [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Treatments with NiCl<sub>2</sub> were performed by exposing embryos to 0.2–0.3 mM of chemical. All treatments were carried out from 30 min to 48 h post fertilization.</p>

For the characterization of the splice-blocking morpholino, RNA was extracted at the pluteus stage from batches of 400 embryos injected with increasing doses of the morpholino. Following treatment with DNase-I and phenol-chloroform extraction, RNA samples were reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit from Quiagen and following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The in vivo specificity and efficiency of this morpholino were monitored via semiquantitative RT-PCR using 40 cycles of PCR. PCR primers flanking intron 1 were used to amplify the cDNA products generated in the presence of this splice-blocking oligonucleotide. Both the Phusion DNA polymerase and the kit long-expand PCR from Roche that allows amplification of long DNA fragments were used following the recommendations of the manufacturers.

<p>The antibody we used is an anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 from Cell Signaling (Ref 9511) raised against a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to residues surrounding Ser463/465 contained in the motif SSVS of human Smad5. Embryos were fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% in microfiltrated sea water (MFSW) for 15 min and then briefly permeabilized with methanol. Embryos were rinsed once with Phosphate Buffered Saline Tween (PBST), four times with PBST–bovine serum albumine (BSA) 2%, and incubated overnight at +4°C with the primary antibody diluted 1/400 in PBST supplemented with 2% BSA. Embryos were washed six times with PBST-BSA 2%, and then the secondary antibody diluted in PBST-BSA 2% was added to the embryos. In all cases, the antibody was incubated overnight at +4°C. For immunofluorescence, the secondary antibody was washed six times with PBST. Two last rinses were made with PBST-Glycerol 25% and 50%, respectively. Embryos were mounted in a drop of the Citifluor antibleaching mounting medium and then observed under a conventional fluorescence microscope or with a confocal microscope. For Alkaline phosphatase revelation, two rinses were made with PBST following the secondary antibody incubation, and two with Tris Buffered Saline Tween (TBST). Embryos were washed twice with the alkaline phosphatase buffer supplemented with Tween 0.1%, and staining was performed with nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) as substrates at the final concentration of 50 mM each. In both cases, staining was stopped by four rinses with PBST + EDTA 5 mM and then two rinses with PBST containing glycerol at 25% and 50%. Embryos were mounted and observed with a DIC microscope.</p>

<title>Overexpression Analysis and Morpholino Injections</title>
<p>For overexpression studies, the coding sequence of the genes analyzed was amplified by PCR with a high-fidelity DNA polymerase using oligonucleotides containing restriction sites and cloned into pCS2. Capped mRNAs were synthesized from NotI-linearized templates using mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). After synthesis, capped RNAs were purified on Sephadex G50 columns and quantitated by spectrophotometry. RNAs were mixed with Rhodamine Lysine-Fixable Dextran (RLDX) (10,000 MW) or Fluoresceinated Lysine-Fixable Dextran (FLDX) (70,000 MW) at 5 mg/ml and injected in the concentration range of 100–2,000 μg/ml.</p>
<p>Wild-type <italic>panda</italic> and mutated <italic>panda</italic> mRNAs were injected at 1,000 μg/ml. mRNAs encoding the activated form of <italic>alk3/6</italic> and <italic>alk1/2</italic>, Alk3/6Q230D (Alk3/6QD), and Alk1/2Q225D (Alk1/2QD) [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were injected at 200 μg/ml. <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>nodal</italic> mRNAs were injected at 400 μg/ml. To make the Panda and Alk1/2 rescue constructs, oligonucleotides containing nine mismatches in the sequences recognized by the morpholinos were used to amplify the coding sequences.

<title>Structural analysis of Panda.</title>
<p>Scheme describing the characteristic pattern of cysteines found in the mature forms of different subfamilies of TGF-β ligands. On the basis of their pattern of cysteines, TGF-β ligands can be classified in three major groups. The hallmark of members of the first group is a characteristic pattern of nine cysteines in the ligand domain. This group includes ligands such as Panda/Maverick, TGF-β, Myostatin, Inhibins, or GDF15. Members of the second family lack the sixth cysteine that is involved in dimer formation and therefore contain eight cysteines instead of nine. Members of this second family include ligands such as Lefty, GDF3, and GDF9/BMP15. All the other TGF-β ligands have a characteristic pattern of seven cysteines. This is the case for Nodal, for GDF1/univin, and for all members of the BMP family of TGF-β ligands.</p>

<p>Immature oocytes were collected from gonads and analyzed for the expression of <italic>panda</italic> by in situ hybridization. Results are presented for a randomly selected set of 16 ovocytes. The position of the animal-vegetal axis of the ovocyte is revealed by the asymmetrical localization of the germinal vesicle. The germinal vesicle and its nucleolus are closer to the animal pole where the micropyle and polar bodies will form [<xref rid="pbio.1002247.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. When possible, for each ovocyte, a lateral view showing the animal-vegetal axis as a dashed line (top image) and an axial view showing it as a dot (lower image) are shown. Note, however, that at this stage it is not possible to recognize the future D/V embryonic axis. The subcortical localization of the in situ hybridization signal suggests that <italic>panda</italic> mRNA could be localized to the egg cortex.</p>
