<p>Abrescia and colleagues demonstrate how the bacteriophage PRD1, a model membrane-containing virus, generates a self-polymerizing protein-lipid nanotube to deliver its viral genome to a host cell.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>In internal membrane-containing viruses, a lipid vesicle enclosed by the icosahedral capsid protects the genome. It has been postulated that this internal membrane is the genome delivery device of the virus. Viruses built with this architectural principle infect hosts in all three domains of cellular life. Here, using a combination of electron microscopy techniques, we investigate bacteriophage PRD1, the best understood model for such viruses, to unveil the mechanism behind the genome translocation across the cell envelope. To deliver its double-stranded DNA, the icosahedral protein-rich virus membrane transforms into a tubular structure protruding from one of the 12 vertices of the capsid. We suggest that this viral nanotube exits from the same vertex used for DNA packaging, which is biochemically distinct from the other 11. The tube crosses the capsid through an aperture corresponding to the loss of the peripentonal P3 major capsid protein trimers, penton protein P31 and membrane protein P16. The remodeling of the internal viral membrane is nucleated by changes in osmolarity and loss of capsid-membrane interactions as consequence of the de-capping of the vertices. This engages the polymerization of the tail tube, which is structured by membrane-associated proteins. We have observed that the proteo-lipidic tube <italic>in vivo</italic> can pierce the gram-negative bacterial cell envelope allowing the viral genome to be shuttled to the host cell. The internal diameter of the tube allows one double-stranded DNA chain to be translocated. We conclude that the assembly principles of the viral tunneling nanotube take advantage of proteo-lipid interactions that confer to the tail tube elastic, mechanical and functional properties employed also in other protein-membrane systems.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Viral survival and propagation depend on the ability of the viruses to transfer their genetic material to a host cell. Viral genome delivery has been described for viruses that directly enclose their genome in a capsid or nucleocapsid, but not for internal membrane-containing viruses in which the genome is protected by a lipid vesicle enclosed by the icosahedral capsid. The latter infect organisms across the three domains of life. We use a range of electron microscopy techniques to reveal how one such virus, the bacteriophage PRD1, which uses gram negative bacteria as its host, delivers its double-stranded DNA to the bacteria across the cell envelope. The PRD1 bacteriophage is special in that it doesn't carry a rigid tail; rather it creates a tube tail when needed at the time of infection to pass its DNA through to the host. We now show that this tube formation is accomplished via concerted restructuring of the icosahedral capsid and remodeling of the internal icosahedral protein-rich virus membrane. We also find that this tail tube is studded with membrane-associated proteins and its internal diameter allows one double-stranded DNA chain to be injected. Finally, we capture PRD1 in 3-D with the proteo-lipidic tail piercing the gram-negative bacterial cell and shuttling its viral genome <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results provide insights into a new mechanism of viral genome delivery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A fundamental step in the lifecycle of all known viruses is the genome translocation into the target cell. Although this process has been elucidated for several enveloped viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Harrison1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Kadlec1">[2]</xref>, and for double-stranded (ds) DNA head-tailed bacteriophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Hu1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Leiman1">[7]</xref>, equivalent information on internal membrane-containing viruses is scarce.</p>
<p>PRD1 is an internal membrane-containing dsDNA bacteriophage (family <italic>Tectiviridae</italic>) whose crystallographic studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, left) have provided unprecedented insights into the assembly mechanism of large complex viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Abrescia1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Benson1">[10]</xref>. With several other such examples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Zhang1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Roberts1">[16]</xref>, this has led to a novel principle of classifying viruses based on their major capsid protein (MCP) fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Abrescia3">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Bamford1">[18]</xref>. Such viruses pose fundamental questions about the morphogenesis of the membrane and the genome packaging and ejection processes that utilize the lipid bilayer enclosing the genome.</p>

<p>PRD1 packages its genome capped with terminal protein P8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Stromsten1">[19]</xref> into a preformed membrane-containing procapsid using the packaging complex at the unique vertex specifically composed of (<italic>i</italic>) the packaging ATPase P9, (<italic>ii</italic>) the packaging accessory protein P6, and (<italic>iii</italic>) two small membrane proteins P20 and P22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, right) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Stromsten1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Ziedaite1">[22]</xref>. The other 11 vertices are different, being constructed from (<italic>i</italic>) the vertex-stabilizing membrane protein P16, (<italic>ii</italic>) penton protein P31, (<italic>iii</italic>) spike protein P5, and (<italic>iv</italic>) receptor binding protein P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, right) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Abrescia1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Huiskonen1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Xu1">[25]</xref>. So far, the 3D structure of this unique vertex is not known.</p>
<p>Interestingly, PBCV-1, an algae infecting virus, and the largest virus described, Mimivirus infecting <italic>Acanthamoeba polyphaga</italic>, both with an internal membrane and thought to belong to the same structure-based virus lineage with PRD1, have also recently been shown to possess a unique vertex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Zhang2">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Zauberman1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>Activation of the PRD1 infection process in a broad range of gram-negative hosts such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is triggered by specific binding of the viral protein P2 to the cellular receptor. A model for DNA delivery has been postulated from biochemical and genetic studies which point to the involvement of viral membrane proteins P7/P14, P18, and P32 in the formation of the putative membranous tail tube protruding from one vertex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Grahn1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Bamford2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we combine immuno-labelling, cryo-electron microscopy, and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET; single-particle, subtomogram averaging, and cellular tomography) analyses using wild-type (wt) PRD1, DNA-packaging-deficient mutant Sus1 particles (i.e., procapsids) and <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of virus-infected cells to report a new principle of virus–cell interaction essential for viral genome translocation.</p>
<p>We suggest that the PRD1 tube protrudes from the same unique vertex used for DNA packaging and that it is structured, implying the direct involvement of self-assembling and lattice forming membrane-associated proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the internal vesicle in DNA-less procapsids can undergo acrobatics. This ability underscores the general elasto-mechanical properties of giant unilamellar (proteo-)vesicles and the triggering factors of the viral vesicle shape transition leading to the assembly of the tail tube. This assembly process and the tunnelling of the viral tail tube through the cell envelope is reminiscent of cellular membrane nanotubes used in cell-to-cell communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Kimura1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Gurke1">[33]</xref>.</p>

<title>DNA Packaging and Ejection: A “Code-Sharing” Usage of the Same Vertex</title>
<p>The samples used throughout this study contained a mixture of intact viruses and empty particles as well as particles with a tube and individual tubes devoid of capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In 2D cryo-images of PRD1 tail tube at 50,000× magnification, the tube's wall appeared as a bilayer structure with dimensions similar to those of the vesicle within the capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We adopted ageing of the PRD1 sample as a way to obtain particles with a tube because a trigger for synchronous genome ejection <italic>in vitro</italic> is as yet unknown. Whether the genome ejection machinery uses the same vertex through which the genome is packaged remains unclear. Circumstantial evidence based on immuno-labelling of packaging-vertex-associating proteins P20 and P6 suggested that the DNA packaging and ejection vertices might coincide, implying that upon tube formation P20 and P6 may be dislocated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s010">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We also performed subtomogram averaging of intact wt PRD1 particles with no imposition of icosahedral symmetry and with a loose shell mask that included the vesicle in the alignment process in the attempt to detect coarse asymmetrical structural features. Although we confirmed previous results on the conformational flexibility of the spike complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Huiskonen1">[23]</xref>, at this level of analysis we could not firmly detect structural differences between the 12 vertices [5.8 nm resolution at the 0.5 threshold of the Fourier shell correlation (FSC); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s002">Figure S2A</xref>]. Further classification and higher resolution studies are required to fully resolve the structure of the packaging vertex.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Structural Transition of the Internal Membrane from Icosahedral to Tubular</title>
<p>We focused our analysis on 3D tomographic reconstructions of individual PRD1 particles with a tube on which icosahedral symmetry was not imposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These tomographic reconstructions showed that the icosahedral capsid was largely preserved, with a unique tube with a diameter of ∼14 nm and with variable lengths (mean 51.4±9.4 nm, <italic>n</italic> = 70) protruding from a single vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1D–E</xref>). In rare cases the distal part of the tube appeared closed (black arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, top left). As far as can be judged in the presence of the missing-wedge effect, the capsid is not structurally compromised except at some vertices, including the one with the protruding tube, where an opening of ∼15 nm diameter allows the tube to exit through the vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g002">2A</xref>, left). Overall capsid and membrane thicknesses agree with those reported from previous PRD1 studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g002">Figure 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Abrescia1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Cockburn1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-SanMartin1">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, subtomogram averaging of the capsids with a tube carried out using <italic>Dynamo</italic> software (at 6.4 nm resolution, no icosahedral symmetry imposed; Figures 2A, right and S2B, top left) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-CastanoDiez1">[35]</xref> suggests that there is preferential de-capping of contiguous vertices, one of which is adjacent to the vertex from which the tube protrudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These apertures imply the loss of the peripentonal MCPs (P3), membrane proteins P16, penton proteins P31, and vertex-associating proteins P2 and P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In turn, this de-capping of the vertices leads to the loss of the P16 protein interactions and P3 N-terminal contacts with the underlying membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

(B, Right) Cut-through of the PRD1 particle isosurface (rotate by 180° from left) showing the missing density of the vesicle regions proximal to the de-capped vertices (contoured at 0.35σ).

<p>Whereas in the virions the membrane follows icosahedral symmetry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Abrescia1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Cockburn1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-SanMartin1">[34]</xref>, distinct vesicle morphologies were detected in the individual tomograms of the particles with a tail tube.

The change in the vesicle size from an icosahedral one to a membrane with a protruding tail tube (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, below) causes a drastic reduction in membrane area (∼30%) and volume (∼60%), reflecting one of the last stages in DNA translocation. Additionally, the exit direction of the tail tube was not always aligned with the icosahedral 5-fold axis but angled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom), in some cases, with a deflection of ∼20° (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s011">Protocol S2</xref>).</p>

<title>PRD1 Procapsids Devoid of the Genome Can Form Nanotubes</title>
<p>In previous studies, the membrane isolated from empty PRD1 procapsids (<italic>sus1</italic> mutant) by guanidine hydrochloride treatment has been shown to form tubular structures, whereas the DNA-containing vesicles isolated from the virions mainly adopt a spherical shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Bamford2">[31]</xref>. Mutant <italic>sus1</italic> has a defect in the packaging ATPase gene <italic>IX</italic> (encoding protein P9), and thus it does not package DNA. Using a similar ageing regime and buffer conditions to that used for wt PRD1, we inspected the ability of the procapsid to form the tail tube and the procapsid membrane morphology by 2D and cryo-ET imaging. Indeed, tubes were assembled and projected from one of the vertices as for wt PRD1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Remarkably, the membrane in the procapsid exhibited far more varied morphologies than the membrane in the virion. These diverse membrane shapes within the capsid included stomatocyte-like, discocyte-like shapes, and internal tubes budding and pinching off as extra vesicle from the larger one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Intriguingly, these tails tubulate and pinch off tangentially to the vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g003">Figure 3B–D</xref>). This direction of tubulation is completely different from that observed in other PRD1-tube particles in which the tube polymerizes orthogonally to the vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g004">4</xref>, and S3).

<p>Thus, we performed rotational symmetry and classification analyses on a set of orthogonal tubes (<italic>n</italic> = 1,758) extracted from 2D cryo-images of PRD1 procapsids (see Material and Methods). These analyses suggested a subset of tubes with a 3-fold rotational symmetry (18%) besides those displaying 2-fold symmetry (28%), spurious symmetries (35%), or higher symmetries (together summing up to 19%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s004">S4</xref>). Such a distribution of rotational symmetries prompted the possibility that (<italic>i</italic>) we were framing tubes at different stages of assembly (or disassembly) with structural heterogeneity, (<italic>ii</italic>) we were not viewing the tubes exactly along their symmetry axis, and/or (<italic>iii</italic>) the structure of the tube possessed also a helical component. Therefore, we extended this study to reconstructed cryo-electron tomograms of wt PRD1 particles with a tube (also showing the preferential longitudinal orientation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Due to the well-known missing wedge effect on cylindrical objects in this orientation, we performed subtomogram averaging of the tubes to increase signal-to-noise, to compensate for the missing-wedge loss, and to reliably assess the presence of a density pattern. However, no symmetry was assumed or imposed during this process. Prior to averaging, 167 subboxed tubes (with the axes oriented along the <italic>z</italic>-direction) were classified using a multireference alignment approach with four references (see Material and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s011">Protocol S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Of the four resulting classes (class 1, <italic>n</italic> = 35; class 2, <italic>n</italic> = 33; class 3, <italic>n</italic> = 64; class 4, <italic>n</italic> = 35), based on relatively higher mean cross-correlation (cc) with the corresponding references, reasonable angular distribution of the set of tubes covering the geometric sphere and visual inspection of the densities, only class 2 and class 3 tube averages were further considered [class 1 recapitulated basic structural features of class 2 and 3 (respectively cc<sub>1–2</sub> = 0.61 and c<sub>1–3</sub> = 0.69), whereas class 4 was the most structurally incongruous (cc<sub>4–2</sub> = 0.49 and cc<sub>4–3</sub> = 0.53; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s005">Figure S5B</xref>)]. The corresponding <italic>z</italic>-slices showed a pattern of alternating strong (red dots) and weak (cyan arrows) densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, top and insets) that we interpreted as the cross-sectional views of upright strands (stronger densities) skeletonizing the tail tube and interacting laterally to each other. This pattern was not fixed across the <italic>z</italic>-slices (see, e.g., <italic>xy</italic>-slice 20 <italic>versus xy</italic>-slice 25 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, left top). To assess whether this lobular distribution of density was artifactual, simulation of tomographic data using a featureless cylindrical shell supported the <italic>bona fide</italic> averaged reconstructed tube models (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s012">Protocol S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s005">Figure S5D</xref>). Furthermore, both averaged volumes contained an additional unique ring-like structure (Ø∼18 nm) crowning the tube, although it was much more distinctive in class 2 (gold arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom; this ring was not present in the averaged volume of class 1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Thus, both 2D image and 3D volume analyses indicated that the tube possesses a degree of order and structure. However, the morphological variability noted in individually visualized PRD1 particles with a tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figures 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g002">2A</xref>, left, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g003">3</xref>), in the distribution of rotational symmetries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), as well as in the resulting averaged tube volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s005">S5B</xref>) imply that the structure of the tube is variable. The parameters of the two averaged tube models calculated from the mean density profile along <italic>z</italic> of the central <italic>xz</italic> section indicate that both tubes possess an equivalent inner diameter (2r<sub>1</sub>∼4.5 nm) but possibly slightly different outer diameters (the smallest being 2r<sub>2</sub>∼14 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>Dynamics of the Viral Membrane</title>
<p>Using PRD1 procapsids we have clarified that the internal pressure due to the packaged DNA does not induce the membrane transformation and consequently both lipids and membrane-associated proteins orchestrate the membrane transition as originally observed in the quantitative biochemical virus dissociation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Bamford2">[31]</xref>. Our data reveal a range of viral membrane shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figures 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g002">2A</xref>, left, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g003">3</xref>).

<title>Schematics of PRD1 genome translocation via tunnelling nanotube and model of PRD1 membranous tail tube structure.</title>
<p>(A) Sequential steps of PRD1 infection and tube formation. Step 1, PRD1 particles approach the cell surface in a random orientation. Step 2, after binding to the cellular receptor, partial rolling/tumbling of the particle due to solvent movement and/or binding of further viral protein P2 or secondary binders such as P5 proteins to cellular receptors guide the re-orientation of the unique vertex almost orthogonal to the cell. De-capping of the cell-interacting vertex triggers the membrane reshaping as a consequence of the loss of vertex-stabilizing protein P16 interactions and the influx of components of the extracellular milieu through the opened vertex (cf., change in osmolarity). Step 3, the vesicle transformation leads to the tube polymerization and piercing of the cell envelope as well as digestion of the peptidoglycan layer by virion-associated enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Grahn1">[30]</xref>.

<p>These are universal membrane morphologies that can be modelled by considering the reduction in vesicle volume versus the reduction of monolayer area difference between the two leaflets (area-difference-elasticity theory) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Lim1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Sakashita1">[39]</xref>. Under specific environmental conditions, vesicles composed only of lipids can also form tubes favoured, for example, by specific lipid compositions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Li1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Derenyi1">[41]</xref>. In particular, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species lead to negative curvature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Stachowiak1">[42]</xref>, whereas lipids with negatively charged headgroups respond to changes in pH and/or concentration of ionic strength. Notably, the PRD1 vesicle is composed mainly of PE (53%) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG; 43%), with an asymmetrical distribution of lipids between the two membrane layers with the PE and PG species mainly segregated in the inner and outer leaflet, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Cockburn1">[9]</xref>. However, in PRD1, the transformation of the membrane implies the redistribution of the membrane-associated proteins (occupying ∼50% of the membrane volume) of which only the vertex-stabilizing protein P16 is icosahedrally ordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Abrescia1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Jaatinen1">[24]</xref>. This redistribution of the proteins facilitating the tube formation and scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) is in line with several other model protein-membrane systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Derenyi1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Zimmerberg1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus, considered as a giant unilamellar (proteo-)vesicle, the PRD1 membrane is primed to readily react to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, right), rationalising previous observations where, for example, changes in buffer and/or temperature increased tube formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Grahn2">[44]</xref>.</p>

<title>Assembly of the Viral Proteo-Lipidic Tunnelling Nanotube</title>
<p>The viral vesicle does not form a hollow cylinder but rather a structured tube (∼4.8 nm thick), implying that the viral membrane-associated proteins act as a scaffold for the tube. Indeed, cross-sectional views for the most ordered tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) show alternate regions of high and low density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5B–C</xref>), possibly indicating a multistrand architecture. Also, visual inspection of the two averaged tubes superimposed using the ring-like structure as pivot corroborates that the differences might be variations on a common core assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p>The observed high-contrast density regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, insets) may be segregated membrane domains enriched in proteins polymerizing outward from the gate, possibly in an ordered fashion and with a coiling component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g007">Figure 7B–C</xref>). The weaker intercalating density could indicate that lateral contacts between the polymerizing building blocks are more labile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, bottom), reflecting the dramatic curvature needed in the proteo-lipidic tube (2r∼8.8 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Candidate scaffolding proteins include the single-pass transmembrane proteins P7/P14 and P32 and the multipass transmembrane protein P18, whose knock-out impairs tube formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Grahn1">[30]</xref>. The primary sequences of these do not have any significant similarity with known viral and cellular proteins.</p>
<p>In mature virions, the assembly of the tail tube and its correct direction through the opening of the vertex could be linked to the DNA counterpressure. The limited space in the virion restricts the conformational changes of the vesicle. The putative interaction of ATPase P9 with the viral genome via its terminal protein P8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Karhu1">[20]</xref> might serve the nucleation point and guide tail tube polymerization. This is consistent with the fact that in the wt PRD1 the majority of the tubes were rarely seen as short as those detected in the procapsids and confined within the capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Biochemical evidence supports structural crosstalk between the membrane and the unique vertex via the interactions of P22, P20, and P6 in complex with P9 and the packaged viral genome via the terminal protein P8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Stromsten1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Karhu1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Ziedaite1">[22]</xref>. Intriguingly, the observed ring-like structure in the two averaged tube volumes matches into the capsid density at the aperture of the de-capped vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, inset), suggesting that the ring might be composed of capsid proteins such as peripentonal P3 monomers remaining attached during the tube ejection or proteins specific to the unique vertex.</p>
<p>Finally, the overall geometric parameters of the tail tube—outer diameter ∼14 nm, internal diameter ∼4.5 nm (as from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), and average length ∼50 nm—make this the smallest membrane nanotubes known to be capable of transporting biological material.

<title>Model of the Viral DNA Entry Process Via a Tunnelling Nanotube</title>
<p>Our 3D studies of PRD1–cell interactions map <italic>in vivo</italic> the sequence of events leading to infection. The overall <italic>in vitro</italic> tube characteristics are preserved, and in the cellular context, the viral genome delivery device enters almost orthogonally to the cell surface (variance ∼30°). Occasionally, the virus capsid was seen juxtaposed to the cell, producing a detectable infolding of the outer and inner membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g006">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s009">Movie S2</xref>), with the polymerizing tail tube practically drilling through the entire bacterial cell envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Such membrane perforation has also been indirectly followed by measurements of ion gradients across the cell membranes during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Grahn1">[30]</xref>, pinpointing proteins P11 and P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, right) as the effectors of host cell penetration. In other cases, the virus capsid was seen at a few nanometers from the cell surface, with the assembled tail tube tunnelling through the outer membrane and the cell wall reaching the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, right, and 6B). The viral tail tube wall does not fuse with the cellular membrane, probably as a result of protein scaffolding protection. The length of the tube, which is on average at least three times longer than the thickness of a typical cell envelope of <italic>S. enterica</italic> (∼15 nm thick), guarantees genome protection during delivery into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, right, and 6B). Once in the cytoplasmic compartment, release of the viral genomic DNA might be triggered by the intracellular pH conditions that would favour the opening of the distal part (tip) of the tube (black arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, top left), allowing the DNA to exit through it, fuelled initially by the energy stored in the pressurized capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Additionally, the reactivity of the PRD1 vesicle to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001667-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) implicates osmotic pressure as a driving force of the genome translocation. The internal diameter of 4.5 nm of the viral nanotube suggests that one double-stranded DNA chain (Ø∼2.6 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Cockburn1">[9]</xref>) can be translocated. The internal diameter of this tail tube is in line with that of the proteinaceous tails of the head-tailed bacteriophages.

Tomographic single-axis tilt series of wt and Sus1 particles were collected under low-dose conditions on an UltraScan 4000, 4K×4K Gatan CCD camera (Gatan Inc.), over a tilt range of ±64 with 1.5° increments and at underfocus values ranging from 5 to 8 µm, using the semiautomatic data acquisition software SerialEM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-Mastronarde1">[54]</xref>.

<title>Subtomogram Averaging of Intact PRD1 Particles, PRD1 Particles with Tube, Exit-Portal, and Tube Alone</title>
<p>Subtomogram averaging was carried out using <italic>Dynamo</italic> software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-CastanoDiez1">[35]</xref>. The resolution of the different subtomogram averaged maps was assessed by Fourier shell correlation (FSC) between independent half datasets at the 0.5 threshold criterion in <italic>Dynamo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>In single-particle averaging of intact PRD1 particles, a full range of rotational searches was performed against a PRD1 template model filtered at 8.0 nm with a loose spherical-shell mask including the vesicle and virus spikes (inner and outer radii of 16 and 49 nm). Subsequent refinements of the initial alignment parameters were scaled down to finer search angles and angular intervals but never imposing 60-fold symmetry. A total of 824 subtomograms aligned with a cross-correlation higher than 0.5 of the mean cross-correlation with the reference contributed to the nonicosahedral averaged wt PRD1 structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s002">Figure S2A</xref>).</p>
<p>For nonintact PRD1 particles, the rough orientations of the single subtomograms relative to the tube were clearly recognizable, enabling the construction of a first set of alignment parameters by manual operation on the particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s011">Protocol S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). As a result of this coarse alignment, a crude averaged model filtered to 8 nm was generated and used as a starting template for the global computerized alignment and averaging protocol. Shifts along the tube long axis were limited, whereas a 360° rotation around this particle orientation was searched; a mask inclusive of capsid and tube was used during this process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). The angular search allowed the particle to pivot inside a cone with an aperture of 60° and rotate inside a full range of 360°. An initial angular sampling of 15° was employed in both cases, with three subsequent coarse-to-fine refinement steps that halved the angular interval and operated a new search around the previous cross-correlation maximum. The set of best orientations provided the alignment parameters that generated the reference used in the next iteration. This procedure was iterated four times onto binned particles and the alignment parameters used to compute a constrained covariance matrix of the initial 251 PRD1-tube and tube sub-volumes. The posterior classification by principal component analysis (PCA) using <italic>Dynamo</italic> software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001667-CastanoDiez1">[35]</xref> allowed reducing the structural heterogeneity of the selected structures to a set of 174 sub-volumes. Then, further steps with finer sampling were carried out onto fully sized particle (pivoting range of 20° and azymuthal rotation range of 20°, in both cases with an initial angular interval of 5°) until no further improvement in the alignment parameters was observed.</p>
<p>Then, different subboxing schemes and masks were used for the single-particle subtomogram averaging of the capsid alone, exit-portal, and tube (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001667.s011">Protocol S2</xref>).</p>
