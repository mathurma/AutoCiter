<abstract>
<p>Altered metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancers. Deregulation of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA) in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is known to promote tumorigenesis in liver, lung, and breast tissues. Yet, the molecular mechanism of RPIA-mediated colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. Our study demonstrates a noncanonical function of RPIA in CRC. Data from the mRNAs of 80 patients’ CRC tissues and paired nontumor tissues and protein levels, as well as a CRC tissue array, indicate RPIA is significantly elevated in CRC. RPIA modulates cell proliferation and oncogenicity via activation of β-catenin in colon cancer cell lines. Unlike its role in PPP in which RPIA functions within the cytosol, RPIA enters the nucleus to form a complex with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and β-catenin. This association protects β-catenin by preventing its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation. The C-terminus of RPIA (amino acids 290 to 311), a region distinct from its enzymatic domain, is necessary for RPIA-mediated tumorigenesis. Consistent with results in vitro, RPIA increases the expression of β-catenin and its target genes, and induces tumorigenesis in gut-specific promotor-carrying RPIA transgenic zebrafish. Together, we demonstrate a novel function of RPIA in CRC formation in which RPIA enters the nucleus and stabilizes β-catenin activity and suggests that RPIA might be a biomarker for targeted therapy and prognosis.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The pentose phosphate pathway generates NADPH, pentose, and ribose-5-phosphate by RPIA for nucleotide synthesis. Deregulation of RPIA is known to promote tumorigenesis in liver, lung, and breast tissues; however, the molecular mechanism of RPIA-mediated CRC is unknown. Here, we demonstrate a role of RPIA in CRC formation distinct from its role in these other tissues. We showed that RPIA is significantly elevated in CRC. RPIA increased cell proliferation and oncogenicity via activation of β-catenin, with RPIA entering the nucleus to form a complex with APC and β-catenin. Further investigation suggested that RPIA protects β-catenin by preventing its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation. In addition, the C-terminus of RPIA (amino acids 290 to 311), a portion of the protein not previously characterized, is necessary for RPIA-mediated tumorigenesis. Finally, we observed that transgenic expression of RPIA increases the expression of β-catenin and its target genes and induces tumorigenesis. Our findings suggest that RPIA can enter the nucleus and associate with APC/β-catenin, and suggest precise treatment of human CRC by targeting its nonenzymatic domain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common forms of cancers and results in more than 600,000 deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref003">3</xref>]. Mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and β-catenin, members of the Wnt signaling cascade, are among the major causes of colon tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref006">6</xref>]. APC acts as a cytoplasmic scaffolding protein and induces the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of β-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref007">7</xref>]. In addition to its cytoplasmic activity, APC also modulates nuclear β-catenin levels as a result of its intrinsic nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref011">11</xref>]. Truncation of APC protein results in accumulation of nuclear β-catenin in CRC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref014">14</xref>]. However, existing APC truncation mutants differentially affect the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of β-catenin, suggesting that these functions may be controlled by different APC domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref016">16</xref>]. In the nucleus, β-catenin acts as a coactivator with T-cell transcription factor 4 (Tcf-4)/lymphocyte enhancement factor (LEF) to activate the transcription of downstream targets such as <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> (<italic>CCND1</italic>) and <italic>Cyclin E2</italic> (<italic>CCNE2</italic>). Abnormal activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway can lead to increased cell proliferation and immortalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref019">19</xref>]. For example, a human CRC cell line expressing wild-type (WT) APC and a mutant version of β-catenin protein (with a single amino acid deletion at residue S45) is sufficient to induce a cancerous phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref020">20</xref>]. However, the precise activation process of β-catenin signaling is still largely unknown.</p>
<p>The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is critical for cancer cell survival and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref022">22</xref>]. Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA) is an important integral member of the PPP and regulates cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref024">24</xref>]. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), RPIA expression is required for maintenance of tumor cells overexpressing KRas<sup>G12D</sup>, an activated form of Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref023">23</xref>]. Our previous study showed that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RPIA regulates tumorigenesis via PP2A and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref024">24</xref>]. Studies performed in colon tumor tissues expressing microRNA-124 revealed that cells expressing low RPIA levels led to a reduced tumor size, while high RPIA expression was correlated with reduced survival and increased tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we report that in CRC tissue RPIA is significantly up-regulated, and it is expressed at multiple stages of tumorigenesis, including early stages. It directly interacts with β-catenin and APC to activate target genes downstream of β-catenin that are important for carcinogenesis. High levels of RPIA expression stabilize β-catenin levels by preventing phosphorylation and ubiquitination of β-catenin. Transgenic zebrafish overexpressing RPIA under the control of a gut-specific promoter exhibited enhanced β-catenin expression and elevated mRNA levels of the colon cancer marker gene <italic>ccne1</italic>. Our work uncovers a new role of RPIA and provides a molecular mechanism of RPIA-mediated β-catenin stabilization and activation necessary for colon cancer formation.</p>

<title>RPIA is highly expressed in different stages of human CRC tissue</title>
<p>To assess the role of RPIA in the progression of CRC, we measured RPIA protein levels using immunohistochemistry (IHC) with tissue arrays from stage I through IVB and metastatic colon cancer. The RPIA immunoreactive score (IRS) was calculated by multiplying the staining intensity by the proportion of positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref025">25</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Highly elevated RPIA expression was found in all stages of colon cancer when compared to non-cancerous samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). A control, non-immune antibody was employed to assess background staining and was stained negative. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, “normal colon” shows dark staining in an epithelial region to the lower left that is of much lower intensity than that of the tumor samples. IRS quantification revealed that RPIA expression is significantly up-regulated in all stages of colon adenocarcinoma and even in metastatic carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To examine whether the RPIA mRNA level is also up-regulated in CRC patients, 80 paired tissues, including tumors and the adjacent normal tissues, were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). In 78% (62 of 80) of the CRC specimens, RPIA mRNA was more than 2-fold overexpressed from stage I to IV and in metastatic carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Taken together, we found that RPIA is overexpressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in all stages of colon cancer formation.</p>

<title>RPIA levels are positively correlated with β-catenin protein levels, cellular proliferation, and oncogenicity</title>
<p>To examine the effects of RPIA overexpression on cellular proliferation, two colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and SW480, were used. SW480 is a human colon cancer cell line with APC C-terminal truncation at 1338, but the β-catenin binding region is retained; HCT116 is a highly metastatic cell line with WT APC and both an S45 mutation and the WT allele for β-catenin, but most of the β-catenin protein comes from the mutant allele. WST-1 assays examine metabolic activity that represent the viability of the cell. We tested three small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), which were pooled or treated separately, and found all three siRNAs had similar effects. Therefore, we selected number 3 siRNA for the rest of the experiments. Knock down of RPIA significantly decreased cell proliferation in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).

In the knockdown and followed by overexpressing the RPIA for rescue, the results clearly showed that RPIA small interfering RNA (si-RPIA) decreased proliferation and β-catenin protein level can be rescued by overexpression RPIA in both HCT116 and SW480 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).

<title>RPIA regulates colon cell proliferation through β-catenin expression in HCT116 cells.</title>
<p>(A) Knockdown of RPIA significantly reduced cell proliferation and RPIA overexpression enhanced cell proliferation in HCT116 cells. Co-treatment of si-RPIA and pcDNA-RPIA rescued the reduction of cellular proliferation upon knockdown of RPIA in HCT116. Cell viability assays were performed by measuring the cells at the second, third, fourth, and fifth days and the proliferation fold is compared to control cell at the first day. Control: Co-transfect with scramble RNA and pcDNA empty vector as negative control. (B) RPIA knockdown significantly reduced colony formation ability, and RPIA overexpression enhanced colony formation ability in HCT116 cells. si-NC: Transfect with scramble siRNA as negative control. Representative images of colonies were shown on top of the quantification result. (C) Knockdown of RPIA reduced β-catenin protein levels as measured by western blotting (left panel) and quantified using Image J (middle panel) but did not significantly alter mRNA levels of β-catenin as measured by qPCR (right panel) in HCT116 cells. (D) RPIA overexpression increased β-catenin protein levels (left and middle panels) but did not affect β-catenin mRNA levels (right panel) in HCT116 cells. (E) Knock down of RPIA reduced the β-catenin/TCF luciferase reporter activity in HCT116 cells. (F) Overexpression of RPIA induced the β-catenin/TCF luciferase reporter activity in HCT116 cells.

<p>Aberrant β-catenin accumulation is a major cause of uncontrollable proliferation in colon cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref027">27</xref>]. β-catenin exerts its proliferation-promoting effects via translocation to the nucleus where it binds to T-cell transcription factor (TCF)/LEF to activate the transcription of downstream β-catenin target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref028">28</xref>]. Therefore, we were interested in determining whether RPIA affects the β-catenin level in colon cancer cells using HCT116 and SW480 cells.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that knockdown of RPIA decreased the β-catenin protein level in both HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and SW480 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s002">S2C Fig</xref>) without affecting β-catenin (encoded by <italic>CTNNB1</italic> gene) mRNA levels. Conversely, RPIA overexpression increased β-catenin protein expression levels in both HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) and SW480 cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s002">S2D Fig</xref>), while β-catenin mRNA levels were unchanged. Using TOPflash/FOPflash luciferase reporter assay, we found that β-catenin activity was significantly attenuated upon RPIA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g002">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s002">S2E Fig</xref>) and dramatically increased when RPIA was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g002">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s002">S2F Fig</xref>).

However, the effect of overexpression of RPIA was not as dramatic as that of knock down of RPIA, likely because CRC cell lines already overexpress RPIA. These results suggest that the RPIA expression level is positively correlated with β-catenin protein levels and its transcriptional activity.</p>

<title>RPIA-mediated stabilization of β-catenin in colon cancer cells does not involve ERK signaling</title>
<p>Our previous study indicates that ERK signaling participates in RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref024">24</xref>]. These observations, in combination with other studies demonstrating crosstalk between β-catenin and ERK in other types of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref030">30</xref>], led us to investigate whether ERK signaling might also play a role in RPIA-mediated tumorigenesis in colon cancer. Therefore, the effects of both RPIA overexpression and reduction on both β-catenin and ERK protein levels were examined in HCT116 and SW480 cells. Reduction of RPIA by knockdown significantly decreased nuclear β-catenin protein levels in HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and both cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin protein were decreased in SW480 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), but did not affect the levels of activated, phosphorylated ERK (pERK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of RPIA increased β-catenin protein levels in HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and SW480 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) cells without altering both cytoplasmic and nuclear level of pERK and ERK levels in these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Other mechanisms important for intestinal cell proliferation such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling were also examined. Neither EGFR protein level nor the phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) were altered upon overexpression or knockdown RPIA in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Furthermore, IHC staining analyses revealed that both RPIA and β-catenin protein levels were significantly higher in the nuclei of colon cancer tissues than in the nuclei of normal tissues. In addition, a positive correlation was presented between RPIA and β-catenin protein levels in the nuclei of colon cancer tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). These data suggest that promotion of β-catenin signaling, but not ERK or EGFR signaling, is involved in transducing the effects of RPIA-mediated colon cancer tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>(A) Knockdown of RPIA reduced β-catenin protein levels and overexpression of RPIA increased β-catenin protein levels in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HCT116 cells. (B) Knockdown of RPIA did not decrease ERK and pERK protein levels, which were measured by western blotting in total protein analysis (up panel) in HCT116.

(C) Scatter plots show a positive correlation between RPIA and β-catenin expression in the colon tissue or nucleus. (D) To determine the half-life of β-catenin protein, western blots were used to measure the abundance of β-catenin at different time points following the addition of 10 μg/ml of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX to HCT116 cells transfected with either control siRNA or RPIA-siRNA. The lower panels show plots of the relative β-catenin protein level, expressed as a percentage as a function of time after CHX treatment. (E) RPIA-ΔD lost the ability to stabilize β-catenin. Relative β-catenin protein levels as measured by quantification of western blot are shown in HCT116 cells. (F) The reduced β-catenin levels by RPIA knockdown were rescued by 5 μM of MG132 treatment (left panel). Inhibition of RPIA stimulated ubiquitination of β-catenin (right panel). β-Catenin was precipitated by specific antibody. Coprecipitated ubiquitin levels were examined via western blot with antiubiquitin antibody. (G) Phosphorylated β-catenin (at Ser33/Ser37) versus total β-catenin was elevated upon RPIA knockdown.

<p>As only β-catenin protein levels were affected by the levels of RPIA expression, we proposed that RPIA increased β-catenin protein stability in colon cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) was used to determine the half-life of β-catenin in cell lines with either reduced or elevated levels of RPIA. Reduction of RPIA by knockdown decreased the β-catenin protein half-life from 3 to 1.1 h in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) and from 2.7 to 0.9 h in SW480 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of RPIA strongly increased the half-life of β-catenin from 5.6 to 10.4 h in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) and from 4.9 to 9.9 h in SW480 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that RPIA increases β-catenin protein stability in colon cancer cells.</p>
<p>Because it has been shown that β-catenin protein levels can be controlled by ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref031">31</xref>], we tested whether RPIA could modulate β-catenin protein levels in colon cancer cell lines by changing the ubiquitination-mediated degradation process. As shown previously, RPIA knockdown resulted in a reduction in β-catenin protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3F Fig</xref>, left panel). Treatment with 5 μM MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, rescued the reduction in β-catenin protein levels observed in cells expressing RPIA siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3F Fig</xref>, left panel). Immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed that more ubiquitin was coprecipitated with β-catenin in RPIA-siRNA-treated cells than in negative control siRNA (si-NC)-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3F Fig</xref>, right panel). In addition, the phosphorylated, targeted for degradation form of β-catenin (with phosphorylation at residues Ser33/Ser37) was elevated upon RPIA knockdown relative to total β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3G Fig</xref>). Moreover, expression of a non-degradable β-catenin mutant (S33Y) rescued the reduction of proliferation upon RPIA knockdown in HCT116 and SW480 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3H Fig</xref>). To demonstrate that β-catenin is indeed required downstream of RPIA, the β-catenin inhibitor ICRT14 was applied to the RPIA overexpression cells. The results showed that RPIA-promoted cellular proliferation was attenuated in a dose-dependent manner by ICRT14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3I Fig</xref>). This confirms that β-catenin is required for RPIA overexpression-mediated cell proliferation. The levels of an inactive form of GSK3β (with phosphorylation at residue ser9; pGSK3β<sup>ser9</sup>), which does not have the ability to phosphorylate β-catenin, were further examined. Because phosphorylated GSK3β<sup>ser9</sup> was elevated upon overexpression of RPIA in both HCT116 and SW480 cell lines and there is no difference in the nucleus GSK3β, we suggest the RPIA modulate GSK3β only in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3J Fig</xref>). Moreover, treatment with GSK3β inhibitors (lithium chloride [LiCl] or CHIR99021) rescued the reduction of proliferation upon RPIA knockdown, indicating the involvement of GSK3β in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3K Fig</xref>). These data show that RPIA retains a novel function to protect β-catenin from phosphorylation-mediated ubiquitination and degradation via proteasomes.</p>

<title>RPIA forms a complex with β-catenin and APC in both the nucleus and cytoplasm</title>
<p>The cytoplasmic complex that targets β-catenin for degradation includes the scaffolding protein APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref032">32</xref>]. In addition, APC associates with β-catenin in the nucleus and directs the nucleocytoplasmic export of β-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref011">11</xref>]. We used immunostaining to detect RPIA localization. In the pcDNA3 vector only control (pcDNA), RPIA was expressed in the cytoplasm exclusively. Overexpression of RPIA in both HCT116 and SW480 cells resulted in an increase in nuclear and cytoplasmic RPIA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) with a punctate pattern of RPIA in the nucleus of the DAPI-negative nucleoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref033">33</xref>]. IP of different proteins followed by western blotting indicated that RPIA can form a complex with APC and β-catenin in the nucleus in both HCT116 and SW480 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed the minor difference between these cells. In HCT116, RPIA interacted strongly with APC and β-catenin, respectively, in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In addition, RPIA/APC and RPIA/β-catenin complex levels are induced by RPIA WT (RPIA-WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). In HCT116, the nuclear interaction of RPIA-β-catenin is much weaker than in cytoplasm. We suspect the interaction between RPIA and β-catenin in the nucleus might be indirectly through APC. In SW480, the nuclear RPIA-β-catenin interaction is much stronger than in cytoplasm. However, only the β-catenin bond to RPIA and promoted from RPIA-WT in cytoplasm in SW480 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>) and the nuclear β-catenin-RPIA interaction can be regulated by the RPIA amount. The differences in HCT116 and SW480 might be caused by the truncated APC in SW480, and HCT116 has an S45 mutation from β-catenin.</p>

<title>The C-terminal domain of RPIA is necessary for enhanced cell proliferation in colon cancer cells</title>
<p>The RPIA protein sequence is conserved among humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). To determine which protein domain(s) are important for RPIA-mediated tumor cell proliferation, five RPIA deletion mutants were generated. These include RPIA-ΔA (deletion of the active domain of RPIA), RPIA-ΔB (deletion of the catalytic domain of RPIA), RPIA-Δ(A+B), RPIA-ΔC, and RPIA deletion domain D mutant (RPIA-ΔD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The WT and five deletion mutants were transfected into HCT116 and SW480 cells. WST-1 assays were performed to examine metabolic activity, and the RNA and protein levels from the WT and five deletion mutants were verified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). We noticed that different RNA constructs might have different regulation of RPIA stability. Interestingly, only the expression of RPIA-ΔD failed to enhance cell proliferation, while the other mutants produced no significant changes in proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). These data suggest that the C-terminal domain D of RPIA (AAs 290 to 311) is essential for RPIA-mediated tumor cell proliferation. Domain D also seems to be necessary for the RPIA-mediated increase in β-catenin protein stability in colon cancer cells because overexpression of RPIA-ΔD did not stabilize β-catenin protein levels like the WT RPIA. Following overexpression of RPIA-ΔD, the half-life of β-catenin was approximately 6.1 and 3.3 h in HCT116 and SW480 cells, respectively, which was similar to that of the pcDNA vector alone (5.6 and 4.9 h in HCT116 and SW480 cells, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g003">Fig 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). Moreover, RPIA-ΔD did not interact with APC and β-catenin in either the cytoplasm or nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003714.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).

These results demonstrate that domain D of RPIA is essential for the RPIA-mediated increase in β-catenin protein stability, activation of β-catenin target genes, and cell proliferation advantages seen in colon cancer cells. Together, our data also indicated that the RPIA D domain exhibits a novel function in addition to the enzymatic region.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent findings have revealed that the non-oxidative PPP is a critical pathway for tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref021">21</xref>]. Aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway has also been shown to be involved in gastrointestinal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref036">36</xref>]. In cancer cells, β-catenin protein has a dual function: at the membrane, β-catenin coordinates adherent junctions for maintenance of epithelial cell barriers, while in the nucleus, β-catenin acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate proliferation genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref044">44</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate that RPIA exhibits a novel role in CRC through association with and activation of β-catenin. High levels of RPIA expression were detected early and throughout multiple stages of 80 paired samples in CRC human patients. These results are consistent with the Human Gene Database and the Human Protein Atlas, which indicates about the 10-fold higher expression of RPIA in CRC patients than in normal tissues. Furthermore, we found RPIA stabilizes and subsequently promotes activation of β-catenin downstream target genes. We suggest that the increased cellular proliferation and oncogenicity are induced by RPIA through β-catenin pathway.</p>
<p>In other cancer types, RPIA promotes tumorigenesis via different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref024">24</xref>]. In pancreatic and hepatic cancers, RPIA expression is required for maintenance of tumor cells overexpressing KRas<sup>G12D</sup>, while in HCC, RPIA regulates tumorigenesis via PP2A and ERK signaling. Interestingly, the RPIA-mediated CRC tumorigenesis does not involve the activation of ERK and presumably Ras signaling. This observation raises an interesting question: "Is RPIA-mediated stabilization and activation of β-catenin merely in CRC?" If valid, it may influence the decision of choosing different therapeutic targets of molecules and/or signaling pathways for treating different cancer types.</p>
<p>In the canonical β-catenin signaling pathway, APC binds to β-catenin in the cytoplasm in normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This recruits GSK3β phosphorylates β-catenin, resulting in the eventual proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. We propose that in CRC cells, overexpression of RPIA results in the binding of RPIA to β-catenin and protects β-catenin from phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic degradation. Intriguingly, we also found that RPIA interacts with APC and β-catenin in the nucleus. According to current studies, superfluous β-catenin is shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref038">38</xref>]. We propose that RPIA might interrupt the APC-mediated process of exporting β-catenin by forming a complex in the nucleus. Consequently, colon cells developed tumorigenesis. Moreover, we found that C-terminal 22 amino acid of RPIA D domain is required for the RPIA-mediated β-catenin activation, stabilization, and enhanced colon cancer cell proliferation. This region is distinct from its enzymatic domain and a portion of the protein not previously identified as playing a role in CRC. Thus far, nothing is known about the function of the D domain, except this report. Cross species comparison of RPIA protein sequences between human, mouse, and zebrafish reveals that D domain is highly conserved across species. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the RPIA D domain exhibits a novel function in addition to the enzymatic region. It may associate with important partners, such as APC, β-catenin, and other proteins and form multimolecular complexes in both the cytosol and the nucleus. The phenomenon raises the questions such as “Does RPIA act as transcription co-activator?” and “Does RPIA have different protein partners in various cancer types?” We are currently searching for additional proteins that interact with RPIA in cancer cells.</p>

<title>Model of the RPIA mechanism for induction of β-catenin signaling in CRCs.</title>
<p>Schematic representation shows the role of RPIA and β-catenin signaling in normal and CRC cells. In normal cells, RPIA does not interfere with GSK3β-mediated β-catenin degradation. In CRC, RPIA is overexpressed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus; RPIA then binds to β-catenin in cytoplasm, and this prevents the degradation of β-catenin mediated by GSK3β. Within the nucleus, increased levels of β-catenin protein might also be caused by RPIA interrupting the APC-mediated transport of β-catenin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overall, this would result in activation of downstream β-catenin target genes. β-cat, β-catenin; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CRC, colorectal cancer; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3′; RPIA, ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A, TCF, T-cell transcription factor.</p>

<p>The observation that RPIA is expressed at high levels early and throughout CRC is consistent with a role for RPIA in initiation and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Linking the clinical samples to our in vivo studies in zebrafish, misexpression of RPIA in the intestines of zebrafish is sufficient to induce spontaneous tumor formation in fish as young as 3 month and to cause additional physiological hallmarks of cancer, including reduced body weight, body width, and intestinal length in adult fish. These in vivo results are consistent with the observation that in cancer cell lines, downregulation of RPIA using microRNA reduces cell growth and colony formation ability, while overexpression of RPIA is correlated with enhanced growth and lower survival rates. In addition, the examination of apc/+ zebrafish revealed high levels of β-catenin that are disorganized and accumulate both in the cytoplasm and nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref045">45</xref>], and similar to our study, these fish develop spontaneous, intestinal tumors. In human patients, we noticed that RPIA expression was slightly decreased at the metastasis stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003714.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). It was reported that invasive CRC cells exhibit low levels of proliferation markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref046">46</xref>]. We suggest that RPIA is necessary for primary tumorigenesis and that the RPIA level decreases at the metastasis stage so that tumor cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Taken together, our studies demonstrate that RPIA functions as an activator for β-catenin-mediated colon tumorigenesis at the initiation stage.</p>
<p>One of the important functions of PPP is to generate ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. ATP provides the phosphate group via the salvage pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref047">47</xref>], and RPIA mediates this enzymatic step in the cytoplasm. It has been proposed that knockdown of RPIA hinders tumor cell proliferation by reducing nucleotide synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003714.ref002">2</xref>]. However, in colorectal cells, the RPIA enzymatic and catalytic domain deletion mutants still promoted cell proliferation and activated β-catenin downstream target genes, revealing that at least in this type of cancer this is not how RPIA modulates tumor growth. In these cells, the RPIA D domain is necessary for cell proliferation, stabilization of β-catenin, and formation of a β-catenin/APC complex. Accordingly, D domain may be a therapeutic target for inhibiting the oncogenicity ability without affecting RPIA canonical enzymatic function in PPP. We therefore suggest that combination of anti-RPIA D domain therapy with conventional chemotherapy might improve the inhibition of CRC progression.</p>

<title>IRS standards of RPIA immunohistochemical staining.</title>
<p>(A) The arbitrary IRS were calculated as compared to the IRS standards shown. Following RPIA IHC in multiple colon cancer tissue arrays (representing stage I, stage II, stage IIIB, stage IIIC, stage IVA, stage IVB, and metastatic) were graded for staining intensity as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong) and the percentage of positive cells were scored as 1 (&lt;10%), 2 (11%–50%), 3 (51%–80%), and 4 (&gt;80%). The IRS value is determined by the multiplication of the 2 different scores. Magnification: 200 X. Scale bar: 500 μm. (B) Three siRNA was designed from Invitrogen and pooled for using in colon cancer cell lines. The relative position of siRNA was shown. NCBI reference sequence of RPIA: NM_144563.2.

<title>RPIA regulates colon cell proliferation through β-catenin expression in SW480 cells.</title>
<p>(A) Knock down of RPIA significantly reduced cell proliferation, and RPIA overexpression enhanced cell proliferation in SW480 cells. Co-treatment of si-RPIA and pcDNA-RPIA rescued the reduction of cellular proliferation which upon knockdown of RPIA in SW480. Cell viability assays were performed by measuring the cells at the second, third, fourth, and fifth days as compared to the first day result of control cells. Control: Co-transfect with scramble RNA and pcDNA empty vector. (B) RPIA knockdown significantly reduced colony formation ability, and RPIA overexpression enhanced colony formation ability in SW480 cells. si-NC: Transfect with scramble siRNA as negative control. Representative images of the colonies were shown on top of the quantification result of colony formation. (C) Knockdown of RPIA reduced β-catenin protein levels as measured by western blotting (left panel) and quantified by image J (middle panel) but did not significantly alter mRNA levels of β-catenin as measured by qPCR (right panel) in SW480 cells. (D) RPIA overexpression increased β-catenin protein levels (left and middle panels) but did not affect β-catenin mRNA levels (right panel) in SW480 cells. (E) Knockdown of RPIA reduced the β-catenin/TCF luciferase reporter activity in SW480 cells. (F) Overexpression of RPIA induced the β-catenin/TCF luciferase reporter activity in SW480 cells. (G) Knockdown of RPIA decreased the mRNA levels of β-catenin target genes <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>CCNE2</italic> in SW480 cells.

<title>RPIA expression is positively correlated with β-catenin protein levels and stability in SW480 cells.</title>
<p>(A) Knockdown of RPIA reduced β-catenin protein levels and RPIA overexpression increased β-catenin protein levels in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of SW480 cells. (B) Knockdown of RPIA did not decrease ERK and pERK protein levels which were measured by western blotting in total protein analysis (up panel) in SW480. Conversely, overexpression of RPIA did not increase ERK and pERK protein levels (up panel). In the low panel, both cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction showed that ERK and pERK protein levels were not up-regulated in SW480. (C) Knockdown of RPIA did not decrease EGFR and pEGFR protein levels, which were measured by western blotting in total protein from HCT116 or SW480. (D) To determine the half-life of β-catenin protein, western blots were used to measure the abundance of β-catenin at different time points following the addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX (10 μg/ml) in SW480 cells transfected with either control siRNA or RPIA-siRNA. The lower panels show plots of the relative β-catenin protein level, expressed as a percentage as a function of time after CHX treatment. (E) RPIA-ΔD lost the ability to stabilize β-catenin. Relative β-catenin protein levels as measured by quantification of western blot are shown in SW480 cells. (F) In SW480 cell, the reduced β-catenin levels by RPIA knockdown were rescued by 5 μM of MG132 treatment (left panel). Inhibition of RPIA stimulated ubiquitination of β-catenin (right panel). β-Catenin was precipitated by specific antibody. Coprecipitated ubiquitin levels were examined via western blot with anti-ubiquitin antibody. (G) The phosphorylated β-catenin (at Ser33/Ser37) versus total β-catenin was elevated upon RPIA knockdown. Gel images are shown on the up panel. (H) Overexpression of nondegradable β-catenin can overcome the growth inhibition by RPIA knockdown in SW480 cells. The proliferation fold is compared to pMCV6 transfected control cell at first day. (I) The elevated viability by expression of RPIA was decreased upon ICRT14 (β-catenin inhibitor) treatment. Dose-dependent effects were revealed in SW480. (J) pGSK3β<sup>Ser9</sup> protein expression levels were up-regulated in cytoplasmic extraction upon overexpression of RPIA-WT, but not upon RPIA-ΔD in SW480 cells. (K) Cell proliferation was measured in RPIA knockdown in SW480 combined with 2.5 mM LiCl or 5 μM CHIR99021, respectively. The statistical significance was calculated by Student <italic>t</italic> test (* 0.01 &lt; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 0.001 &lt; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, *** <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).

<title>The expression level of β-catenin target genes was in 5-month-old and body weight, body width, intestine length and body length in 1-year-old RPIA Tg fish.</title>
<p>The expression level of β-catenin target genes was analyzed in 5-month-old control fish (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and RPIA Tg fish (<italic>n</italic> = 18) from three portions of guts. The gene expression levels were analyzed with qPCR. There are extreme data in each group, so they are removed for the statistical analysis.
