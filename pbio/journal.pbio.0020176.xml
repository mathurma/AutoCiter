				<article-title>Deconstructing Brain Waves: Background, Cue, and Response</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Scalp-recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals produced by partial synchronization of cortical field activity mix locally synchronous electrical activities of many cortical areas. Analysis of event-related EEG signals typically assumes that poststimulus potentials emerge out of a flat baseline. Signals associated with a particular type of cognitive event are then assessed by averaging data from each scalp channel across trials, producing averaged event-related potentials (ERPs). ERP averaging, however, filters out much of the information about cortical dynamics available in the unaveraged data trials. Here, we studied the dynamics of cortical electrical activity while subjects detected and manually responded to visual targets, viewing signals retained in ERP averages not as responses of an otherwise silent system but as resulting from event-related alterations in ongoing EEG processes. We applied infomax independent component analysis to parse the dynamics of the unaveraged 31-channel EEG signals into maximally independent processes, then clustered the resulting processes across subjects by similarities in their scalp maps and activity power spectra, identifying nine classes of EEG processes with distinct spatial distributions and event-related dynamics. Coupled two-cycle postmotor theta bursts followed button presses in frontal midline and somatomotor clusters, while the broad postmotor “P300” positivity summed distinct contributions from several classes of frontal, parietal, and occipital processes. The observed event-related changes in local field activities, within and between cortical areas, may serve to modulate the strength of spike-based communication between cortical areas to update attention, expectancy, memory, and motor preparation during and after target recognition and speeded responding.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The waking brain updates and fulfills intentions through brain processes that operate within and across multiple brain areas to integrate perception, association, and action. Fulfillment of intentions is facilitated by features of these and other processes that support informed anticipation of and selective attention to events and their probable consequences. The dynamics of ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded from the human scalp differ markedly with state of attention and intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig2">Makeig and Inlow 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Worden1">Worden et al. 2000</xref>), yet most event-related EEG research has assumed that the effects of events on EEG signals emerge out of a flat baseline, as in the typical averaged event-related potential (ERP). The electrophysiological consequences of stimulus events spread quickly in the brain. By 50–150 ms, sensory stimulus information is widely distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Hupe1">Hupe et al. 2001</xref>), perturbing ongoing patterns of local field activity in many brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Klopp1">Klopp et al. 2000</xref>). There is little chance, therefore, that any but still earlier ERP features occur within single brain areas.</p>
      <p>The adequacy of time-domain ERP averaging for modeling macroscopic brain dynamics also depends on the assumption that the cortical sources of EEG activity contributing to and not contributing to average ERP waveforms are somehow distinct. The scalp topographies of unaveraged EEG and averaged ERP data may, however, be quite similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig8">Makeig et al. 2002</xref>), strongly suggesting that areas contributing to ongoing EEG signals may also contribute to ERP averages. EEG processes not contributing to response averages may also be affected by experimental events, and several types of dynamic EEG response processes are not reflected in ERP averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Pfurtscheller1">Pfurtscheller and Aranibar 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig1">Makeig 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig8">Makeig et al. 2002</xref>). A more comprehensive model of event-related brain dynamics is therefore needed to capture features of EEG signals that index the dynamic interplay between spatially coherent brain processes supporting anticipation of, attention towards, associations to, and behavioral responses following experimental events.</p>
      <p>The above considerations suggest that event-related EEG dynamics may be better modeled as coordinated event-related perturbations in the statistics of multiple, intermittently active local field processes. Since the volume-conducted scalp projections of such processes generally overlap, they cannot be separately identified in the scalp-recorded data. An alternate approach we adopt here is to separate the contributions of local field processes by using distinct differences in their time courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig3">Makeig et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig4">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Jung3">Jung et al. 2001a</xref>).</p>
      <p>Following stimuli belonging to an anticipated but infrequently presented category, the averaged ERP is dominated by a broad vertex-positive peak often called P300 after its earliest appearance in auditory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Sutton1">Sutton et al. 1965</xref>; for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Soltani1">Soltani and Knight, 2001</xref>). Results of ERP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Ruchkin1">Ruchkin et al. 1990</xref>) and brain lesion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Halgren1">Halgren et al. 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Knight1">Knight et al. 1989</xref>) and of functional imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Ford1">Ford et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Ebmeier1">Ebmeier et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Ardekani1">Ardekani et al. 2002</xref>) strongly suggest that P300 is actually a late positive-going response complex that sums effects of local field perturbations in several brain regions. A more inclusive model of the event-related EEG brain dynamics occurring in such data should consider, therefore, how target stimulus presentations and subject motor responses perturb the dynamics of ongoing EEG signals both within and across single subjects. Here, we present such a model.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The independent component analysis (ICA) method provides a complete decomposition of single-trial (or continuous) EEG data, separating the data into distinct information sources. As the results presented below show, the amount of information about cortical dynamics provided by this method is large. Here, we detail for the first time dynamics occurring within single trials of the classes of maximally independent EEG processes whose event-related activities contribute to 31-channel visual target responses recorded during a test of spatial selective visual attention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Response Dynamics of the Scalp Recordings: ERPs and ERP Images</title>
        <p>To orient readers used to analyses of the raw scalp-channel data, we first present conventional ERP results at selected channels. As we previously reported, in these experiments performance level was high; more than 95% of targets were followed by a button press within the allotted response window (150–1000 ms). Mean subject-median reaction time (RT) was 352 ms. The average ERP time locked to onset of the target stimulus followed by a subject button press contained the expected late positive complex or P300 positivity following early stimulus-locked peaks conventionally termed P1, N1, P2, and N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The scalp topography of the late positive complex varied continuously through its extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, scalp maps).</p>

        <p>In the grand average of the same epochs, each time-locked to the subject response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), the early response-locked peaks became smeared out, and the P300 and succeeding negative dip more concentrated. In two-dimensional “ERP-image” plots of the 8,413 single trials from all 15 subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">2</xref>F), potential fluctuations in single trials are shown as color-coded horizontal lines, here normalized by channel baseline variability then sorted (across all trials) by RT and smoothed (vertically) with a 300-trial moving average. The ERP images clearly show that the early visual response peaks at central posterior site Pz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) were time-locked to stimulus onset, while the late positivity at Pz immediately followed the button press (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">2</xref>F) except in the trials with the quickest RTs. Over half of these were contributed by two fast-responding subjects whose responses, unlike those of the other 13 subjects, preceded P300 onset.</p>
        <p>At frontocentral channel Fz, however, the late positivity in the stimulus-locked grand average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, bottom) was largely composed of two response-locked positive peaks, separated by 200 ms, that, together with intervening and flanking negativities, could be partially modeled by a two-cycle, 5-Hz wavelet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The single P300 peak at Fz in the stimulus-locked ERP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) “smears out” the two-cycle pattern that is captured clearly in the response-locked average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">2</xref>D), while highlighting a concurrent, broader, and possibly stimulus-locked positivity in faster-RT trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p>

        <p>Conventionally, characterizing the sources of ERP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>) or event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g003">Figure 3</xref>) processes is thought to be difficult because the scalp sensors are relatively far from the actual brain sources and therefore each sums the volume-conducted activities of several source areas. Moreover, the biophysical inverse problem of determining the potential source distribution from a given scalp map is in general severely underconstrained, with many mathematically correct but physiologically different solutions. Nonetheless, infomax ICA, applied to the concatenated single trials for each subject, after removing trials containing out-of-bounds or uncharacteristic artifacts, decomposed the whole set of concatenated EEG signals into 31 spatially fixed, maximally temporally independent component processes, and the scalp maps associated with many of these processes resembled the scalp projections of synchronous activity in either one or sometimes two nearly bilaterally symmetric cortical patches</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows two single trials at site Pz (black traces) from one subject after removal of six eye and muscle artifact components. Projected activities of the three independent components most strongly contributing to each trial are shown as thin colored traces and accompanying scalp maps. Since infomax ICA provides a complete linear decomposition, the observed data (black traces) are in each case the sum of the remaining 25 (31 minus six) component projections, including the three component projections shown. In the upper trial, and typically, the single-trial P300 at Pz was accounted by ICA as summing contributions from at least two independent EEG processes. Component IC1 for this subject (ranked first by amount of total EEG variance accounted for) was later included in the parietal “P3b” component cluster (described below) on the basis of its scalp map and activity power spectrum.</p>

              <p>Black traces indicate two of 561 single target-response trials from one subject at scalp site Pz (upper right scalp map). Solid vertical lines indicate stimulus onsets; dashed vertical lines indicate button presses. A prominent late positivity occurred in the upper trial. All 561 1-sec, 31-channel EEG epochs time-locked to target stimuli were concate-nated and decomposed by infomax ICA, yielding 31 maximally independent data components. Colored traces show the projections (in microvolts) to this scalp channel of the three (nonartifact) independent components contributing the largest variance to each postresponse data window, linked to (individually scaled) maps of their scalp topographies. Component numbers (IC1–IC6), ranked by total EEG variance accounted for, and cluster affiliations (P3f, P3b, FM, P3b, Rα) are indicated above the scalp maps. Note differences in the time courses of IC1.</p>

          <p>While component IC1 accounted for the largest part of the P300 peak in the upper trial, in the lower trial the same IC1 process showed mixed low alpha and beta activity with a smaller postmotor response positivity. Note that the positive postresponse contribution of IC1 in this trial (thin blue trace) was sometimes larger than the observed positivity in the whole-channel data (thick black trace). At these times, some of the other 24 components contributed negative potentials to the signal at this scalp channel, partially canceling the IC1 positivity in the recorded data. Thus ICA, applied to the continuous or concatenated single-trial data, may actually recover more of the actual projected signals than are available in the single-channel data.</p>

          <p>Cluster analysis, applied to the normalized scalp topographies and power spectra of all 465 components from the 15 subjects (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), identified at least 15 clusters of components having similar power spectra and scalp projections. These component clusters also showed functionally distinct activity patterns. Six distinct component clusters (data not shown) accounted for eye blinks, horizontal eye movements, and left and right temporal muscle noises, respectively.

          <p>The location of the equivalent dipole for a radially oriented cortical source patch (or here, effective sum of patches) is typically deeper than the cortical patch itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Baillet1">Baillet et al. 2001</xref>). The equivalent dipoles for individual components in the P3b cluster (data not shown) were scattered across parietal and central cortex (as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g005">Figure 5</xref> by P3b's larger spatial standard deviation). Therefore, the equivalent dipole for the mean scalp map of the P3b cluster was unnaturally deep and represented the center of the active cortical source distribution only symbolically. The mean equivalent dipole location for the cluster designated “P3f” was estimated chiefly from the two periocular electrodes. Moreover, the complicated geometry of the frontal skull cannot be well fit to the spherical head model used here. Thus, the mislocalization of the P3f cluster equivalent dipole below the orbitofrontal brain surface should not be taken literally.</p>
          <p>The spatial standard deviations of the other component cluster dipoles were smaller. Their equivalent dipoles indicate the respective dominant cortical regions of their source domains. Though the mean cluster scalp map for the central occipital alpha cluster (Cα) could be fit satisfactorily by a single equivalent dipole located in the central occiput, for several of the cluster components a better model of the component scalp map was obtained from a symmetric dipole pair in left and right pericalcarine cortex (data not shown).</p>

          <title>Two clusters contributing to the late positive response (P3f and P3b)</title>
          <p>Two component clusters made distinct contributions to the late positive complex of the target ERP. After subtracting the larger back-projected scalp-data contributions of components accounting for blinks and saccadic eye movements, the response-locked ERP at both periocular channels contained a broad, approximately 2-μV positive-going scalp potential peaking on average 39 ms before the recorded button press. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">6</xref>D shows the mean scalp map and dynamic properties of a cluster of ten independent components from ten subjects that together largely accounted for an ERP feature whose time course was highly similar to the peak we labeled P3f (for P3-frontal) in an earlier report on decomposing the matrix of 25 condition ERPs from these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig5">Makeig et al. 1999a</xref>). Note, in the ERP image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), the absence of sharp excursions not regularly time-locked to experimental events, which would mark blinks or lateral eye movements. Such activity at far frontal and periocular channels was effectively separated out by ICA into artifact components (data not shown). Instead, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, the P3f component cluster accounted for nearly all the positivity occurring before the button press (designated P3f by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig5">Makeig et al. 1999a</xref>), particularly in shorter latency-response trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>C).</p>
          <p>The P3f cluster-mean response-locked positivity began near 150 ms, consistent with direct neurophysiological evidence that by 150 ms after stimulus onset, visual information is spread throughout the brain by a complex web of afferent and efferent connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Klopp1">Klopp et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Hupe1">Hupe et al. 2001</xref>). Subtracting the button travel time (approximately 25 ms, roughly estimated from electromyographic recording during one experimental session) and the neuromuscular conduction time (approximately 15 ms) suggested that the P3f peak at 39 ms before the button press occurred very near the moment of the subcortical motor command. It is thus tempting to speculate that the P3f process should originate in frontal structures involved in motivated decision making and response selection, such as orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Ikeda1">Ikeda et al. 1996</xref>), though the sparse spatial sampling of the present data does not allow more specific conclusions.</p>
          <p>The far-frontal (P3f) component cluster response appears similar to the 280-ms “P2a” peak noted in responses to (foveal) visual “oddball” stimuli by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Potts2">Potts et al. (1998)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Potts1">Potts and Tucker (2001)</xref> reported that P2a was maximal near the eyes but can be recorded over most of the face and may also be found in attention conditions involving no subject button press. The scalp map of the ERP-derived P3f component derived by ICA applied to the 25 condition ERPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig5">Makeig et al. 1999a</xref>) also included bilateral parietal features not seen here in the P3f component cluster. Evidently, the temporal and far-frontal projections joined in the ERP-derived P3f component map did not cohere in the much more extensive single-trial data and so were separated by ICA applied to the concatenated single-trial data. This detail points to the advantage of decomposing a sufficient number of unaveraged data trials over decomposing even a relatively large set of averaged responses.</p>
          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">6</xref>H shows the mean scalp map and activity patterns of a bilaterally distributed cluster of 15 components (from nine subjects) that projected most strongly to posterior and central scalp sites and made a substantial contribution to the slow postmotor P300 or P3b positivity. Examination of the raw ERP waveforms of the six subjects not contributing to this cluster suggested the absence of a typical central parietal positivity in their target responses. The mean cluster scalp map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>E) resembled that of the response-locked parietal ERP peak itself (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The ERP image of the normalized single-trial component activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>G) includes an early series of small, positive and negative, wave fronts following the (sorted) time of stimulus delivery (dashed curve) by fixed delays. These are followed by a large response-locked positivity (red area) accounting for 62% of postre-sponse ERP variance at 300 ms for site Pz. The P3b cluster positivity is clearly smaller in late-response trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>G, top), consistent with the Pz data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). The mean cluster ERSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>H) reveals a significant (3-dB) post-response low-theta power increase.</p>
          <p>The significance of the stimulus-locked P300 (or P3b) peak over central parietal cortex has long been debated. Our results clearly show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) that in these experiments, this peak was time-locked to and predominantly followed the motor response. P3b onset occurred at about the moment of the motor command, coincident with the P3f peak. It could not, therefore, index activity involved in making the motor decision or action, as this is seemingly associated with the P3f process. The equivalent dipole distribution of the P3b cluster was broad, the strongest commonality being dipole orientation toward the central parietal scalp. Between-subject variability in locations of P3b generators have also been reported by researchers using other source localization methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Moores1">Moores et al. 2003</xref>). It is possible that more advanced three-dimensional component clustering methods, applied to decompositions from more subjects and more data channels, might allow further distinctions among processes in this cluster.</p>

          <p>Though the equivalent dipole locations of components in the two midline clusters were somewhat overlapping (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g005">Figure 5</xref>), their mean equivalent dipole locations were generally consistent with sources in or near the dorsal anterior cingulate and cingulate motor areas, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Ullsperger1">Ullsberger and von Cramon 2003</xref>). These areas are implicated by fMRI and neurophysiological experiments as participating in motor response selection and anticipation of the consequences of events, including those involving self-perceived errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Shima1">Shima and Tanji 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Luu1">Luu and Tucker 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Manthey1">Manthey et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Ullsperger1">Ullsperger and von Cramon 2003</xref>).

Inverse source modeling has placed the generating cortical domain of the ERN and fmθ in or near the dorsal anterior cingulate.

In common with the midline clusters, the mu component clusters contained the two-cycle postmotor theta pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g008">Figure 8</xref>D) concurrent with a mean theta power increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g008">Figure 8</xref>H). They also made slower, positive-going contributions to the parietal ERP, particularly to the late “slow wave” phase of the stimulus-locked P300 complex that, unlike the main (P3b) peak, exhibits a polarity reversal over the central scalp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Simson1">Simson et al. 1977</xref>).</p>
          <p>In a previous ICA analysis of ERPs from these experiments, the late slow wave phase of the stimulus-locked P300 complex was confined to a single component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig5">Makeig et al. 1999a</xref>), but here it was separated into distinct left and right mu rhythm processes in at least ten of the subjects. More detailed source analysis of magnetoencephalographic mu rhythms has assigned their source mainly to somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Forss1">Forss and Silen 2001</xref>). Thus, the postresponse slow positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g008">Figure 8</xref>C) of the Lμ cluster, larger following slower responses, might index tactile feedback from the hand and button surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig5">Makeig et al. 1999a</xref>).</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">Figure 9</xref> shows the dynamics of three clusters of components projecting to the posterior scalp. Each had a distinct near 10-Hz alpha frequency peak in its activity spectrum, most pronounced in components of the central cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">Figure 9</xref>F, inset). The stimulus-locked ERP contributions of the two lateral posterior alpha clusters, shown as sloping wave fronts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">Figure 9</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">9</xref>K, included an early stimulus-locked peak accounting for most of the P1 ERP peak (near 145 ms) and for part of the succeeding N1 peak, which summed contributions from several clusters. In the central alpha component cluster, the initial stimulus-locked response feature was followed by a train of approximately 10-Hz stimulus-locked waves. These can be said to be produced by partial phase resetting of the intermittent alpha activity of these components following stimulus onsets, since they were accompanied by <italic>no</italic> mean increase in alpha power. The central alpha cluster also made an appreciably broad, triangular contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">Figure 9</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">9</xref>G) to the P300 positivity, while the contributions of the lateral clusters to the response-locked ERP, beginning just before the button press, were small and narrow. The mean response-related ERSPs for these three clusters were weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">Figure 9</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">9</xref>H, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">9</xref>L), and their postresponse alpha and beta blocking were brief and weak, compared to the two mu clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The lateral clusters, but not the central cluster, exhibited a low beta increase above baseline (near 14 Hz) beginning near the button press.</p>
          <p>While the existence of multiple alpha rhythms has long been noted, ICA here neatly separated their activities and identified their complete, overlapping scalp maps based on the relative independence of their activity patterns in the unaveraged data. The central posterior alpha processes had a stronger alpha-band peak than lateral posterior alpha components, and showed longer-lasting phase resetting following visual stimulus onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">Figure 9</xref>G). The longer phase memory implied by the prolonged phase resetting is compatible with longer bursts of alpha activity in these components. Possibly, the distinct dynamics of the central and lateral posterior clusters may serve different though still unknown purposes.</p>
          <p>The “trapezoidal” signature of several of the central posterior component scalp maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">Figure 9</xref>E) is compatible with a model comprising two equivalent dipoles located symmetrically in left and right pericalcarine cortex. To be fused into a single infomax ICA component, activity in both hemispheres must have been largely synchronous with negligible phase delay. Alpha-band activity in two cortical areas can indeed be synchronous if the two areas are densely connected, here most likely via corpus callosum. Synchronization of bilateral generator regions via dense callosal coupling might also support the observed sharp (around 10-dB) alpha peak in the activity spectra of these components.</p>
          <p>In these data, the lateral posterior alpha components were always unilateral and never bilateral. Possibly this may reflect the lower density of direct connections between these areas. Early ERP features in these experiments appeared predominantly contralateral to the stimulus locations. No doubt this was because these stimuli were presented above and usually lateral to fixation. In other data, we have noted that visual ERPs time-locked to foveally presented stimuli usually contain a bilateral posterior P1/N1/P2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig9">Makeig et al. 2004</xref>).</p>

        <p>Note that stimulus-locked component cluster ERP activity first appeared in the lateral posterior alpha clusters (at 100 ms). Onset of the stimulus-locked ERP of the P3b cluster at about the same time was soon followed by the far-frontal P3f cluster onset (near 120 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g010">Figure 10</xref>C). The stimulus-locked ERP deflection began at the same moment in the four postmotor theta clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g010">Figure 10</xref>E). Six of the nine clusters had a negative peak in their stimulus-locked ERP average near 200 ms, confirming the spatial complexity of the N1 peak, as indicated by invasive measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Klopp1">Klopp et al. 2000</xref>) and comparable to previous analysis of nontarget epochs from this data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig8">Makeig et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
        <p>In the response-locked cluster ERPs, note that the P3f cluster activity appeared to begin early, while response-related activity in the P3b cluster ERP diverged from baseline 10–20 ms before the P3f peak, concurrent with a posterior-negative peak in the left mu cluster ERP. The posterior-positive peaks in the response-locked ERPs of both mu clusters, the early shoulder of the P3b cluster ERP peak, the central cluster ERP slow wave, and the negative-going peak of the FM cluster ERP all occurred together, about 100 ms after the P3f peak.</p>

This selectivity diminishes the possibility that the observed transient phase linkages were produced by appearance of postresponse EEG activity not separated out by ICA into a separate component and therefore misattributed by the ICA model to nearby independent components.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>ICA used the temporal information contained in the single-trial EEG time courses to identify and separate maximally independent processes. These were associated with overlapping scalp maps and time courses whose distinctive features were no longer blurred by volume conduction as in the scalp electrode data. The nine independent component clusters here identified by their similar scalp projections and activity spectra resemble classes of EEG phenomena long described by neurologists from observation of paper data displays—central and lateral alpha, left and right mu, and FM theta rhythms. By cleanly separating the EEG contributions of these processes, ICA allowed exploration of their individual and joint event-related dynamics. Our finding of selective theta synchronization between FM, motor, and parietal processes (<xref ref-type="other" rid="pbio-0020176-s001">Video S1</xref>) was only possible using ICA. The clear separation of “alpha ringing” in the stimulus-locked response from the other ERP features (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g010">Figure 10</xref>G) also illustrates the power of ICA to separate temporally and functionally distinct activities that are generated in different brain areas but project to the same scalp channels.</p>
      <p>The nine clusters largely reproduced the component clusters we obtained previously from ICA decomposition of brief (100-ms) poststimulus time windows following nontarget and target stimuli in these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig8">Makeig et al. 2002</xref>). The major difference in the two sets of clusters was the inclusion, here, of a parietal P3b component cluster. In both analyses, the clustering omitted many small components with “noisy” scalp maps and time courses, and also omitted “outlier” components specific to single subjects. After removing clear ocular and muscle artifact components from the raw data, however, the nine identified EEG component clusters together accounted for over 90% of the grand mean ERP variance (over all channels) as well as almost 60% of variance in the whole EEG. By contrast, the ERP data themselves accounted for only 6% of poststimulus EEG variance, supporting our claim that this analysis presents a more complete model of the event-related EEG dynamics occurring in these data than the averaged ERP.</p>

        <title>Cluster Localization</title>
        <p>The group mean equivalent dipole locations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g005">Figure 5</xref> only symbolize the actual distribution of the component source domains. The relation between processes derived by ICA from scalp data and processes seen in invasively recorded cortical data are not yet clear. For example, the equivalent dipole localization of the P3b cluster-mean scalp map does not correspond directly to all the cortical areas noted to generate P3b-like local field potentials in implanted presurgical epileptic patients by Halgren et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Halgren2">1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Halgren3">1995b</xref>)—parts of the superior parietal lobule, inferior frontal, and temporal cortices, as well as the limbic medial temporal lobe. However, in general it is difficult to infer the cortical distribution of a cortical source domain from equivalent dipole location. Clearly, more inclusive methods of ICA component source localization fitted to actual subject cortical geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Dale1">Dale and Sereno 1993</xref>) may be useful for further research. It is not clear, however, whether “hot spots” recorded by sparsely implanted intracranial electrodes necessarily map activity that dominates the scalp EEG dynamics; hot spots might arise from focal or more spatially diffuse activities in other areas.</p>

        <p>Production of scalp EEG signals requires partial synchronies in local field activity extending across the relatively large (2-cm or more) domains of neuropile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Nunez1">Nunez 1981</xref>). These must be dynamically maintained, and might well be perturbed by biological systems and mechanisms that implement and reinforce “top-down” cognitive decisions such as, as here, to selectively attend and respond to relatively infrequent visual stimuli while ignoring frequent nontargets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Giesbrecht1">Giesbrecht et al. 2003</xref>). Posterior alpha, in particular, increases promptly when visual attention shifts between hemifields or between visual and auditory stimulus streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Worden1">Worden et al. 2000</xref>). Most of the spectral perturbations appearing in this analysis have been previously reported in some form, for instance, the alpha blocking following visual stimuli cueing visual attention and mu blocking accompanying cued finger movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Hari1">Hari et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Pfurtscheller2">Pfurtscheller et al. 2000</xref>).

How is this possible? First, “independent” components returned by infomax decomposition of EEG data are never perfectly independent, but are instead those found by infomax to be maximally independent. This is not a mere play on words, but an advantageous feature of infomax decomposition that allows it to separate activity from different cortical areas even when the independence of synchronous activities within those areas is not unbroken or absolute. Second, the infomax independence metric is weighted toward separation by phase differences rather than by power spectral differences. The observed spectral perturbations may reflect, in part, common modulatory influences of central neurotransmitter-labeled brainstem systems involved in orienting and arousal, which project widely to cortex and are known to change the spectral properties of cortical field activity following novel or meaningful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Aston-Jones1">Aston-Jones et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Fries1">Fries et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Hasselmo1">Hasselmo et al. 2002</xref>).</p>

        <title>Functional Significance of the Postmotor Theta Bursts</title>
        <p>At and after the button press, a mean frontocentral theta power increase appeared in all 15 subjects' data. It was partially phase coherent in four of the component clusters and was not eliminated by removing the subject-mean ERP from each trial. Local bursts of theta-band activity are widely distributed on the human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Kahana1">Kahana et al. 1999</xref>) and associated with cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Caplan1">Caplan et al. 2003</xref>). In hippocampus, an association between theta phase and high-frequency “sharp wave” activity has been observed in nonhuman animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Csicsvari1">Csicsvari et al. 2003</xref>). In turn, high-frequency activity can index the organization of spike timing of similarly tuned neurons into brief near-synchronous volleys more likely to trigger further spikes in common target neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Fries1">Fries et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Salinas1">Salinas &amp; Sejnowski 2002</xref>).</p>
        <p>Following nontarget stimuli in this experiment, FM components exhibited weak “theta ringing” (partial poststimulus theta phase locking) not accompanied by increased theta power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig8">Makeig et al. 2002</xref>). Here, following targets, a two-cycle period of increased theta activity appeared, time-locked to the motor response and weakly phase coherent between FM, parietal, and motor areas. Coherent theta activity might enhance the speed, salience, and reliability of spike-based communication between these and other brain areas connected with them, including hippocampus and related limbic structures such as the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Seidenbecher1">Seidenbacher et al. 2003</xref>). The result might be facilitation of information transfer to and from memory structures about the event and its anticipated consequences, and selective retuning of attentional states in relevant cortical areas based on anticipatory evaluation of the consequences of the cued motor response, including readjusted sensory and motor expectancies.</p>
        <p>The postmotor theta bursts seen here following correct speeded responses very likely are tightly linked to the ERP feature with strong theta-band energy that follows highly speeded manual (or foot) responses in the Erickson flanker task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Holroyd1">Holroyd et al. 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Luu1">Luu and Tucker (2001)</xref> have suggested that the so-called error-related negativity in the response-locked ERP following responses the subject knows immediately to be in error partly represents partial phase locking of transiently increased theta-band activity in FM and other sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Luu2">Luu et al. 2004</xref>).

Our animation of the event-related theta-band dynamics in our data (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="pbio-0020176-s001">Video S1</xref>) demonstrates that correct speeded button presses produce partially synchronized theta-band increases in frontal (but not central) medial and contralateral somatomotor process clusters. Mean coherence phase lag between the midline clusters suggests that the postmotor theta activity in the FM cluster components leads that of the CM components by about 8 ms, a physiologically plausible value whose statistical reliability should be tested on a larger data set.</p>

        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Elbert1">Elbert and Rockstroh (1987)</xref> have proposed that cortical surface positivities in general index periods of relative neural depolarization and concomitant insensitivity (“disfacilitation”) of the involved cortex to distal input, possibly explaining the concurrent attentional blink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-McArthur1">McArthur et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Kranczioch1">Kranczioch et al. 2003</xref>) and amplitude decrease in the auditory steady-state response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Rockstroh1">Rockstroh et al. 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-von1">von Stein et al. (2000)</xref>, on the other hand, have reported that following delivery of visual targets to cats, coherence in the theta band occurred between the output layer of a higher and the input layer of a lower visual cortical area. They did not observe this coherence following nontarget stimuli. Thus, the postmotor P300 and the theta burst response may have complementary functions: to decrease bottom-up environmental sensitivity and to concurrently apply the results of top-down processing to cortical perceptual areas. Although probably not available for observation in scalp data, the postmotor theta-band synchronization might extend to limbic areas (hippocampus, amygdala, and others) and play a role in memory updating (e.g., of learned/remembered “context”) following goal-directed actions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Seidenbecher1">Seidenbecher et al. 2003</xref>). Thus, we suggest that the postmotor theta burst may reflect directly “context-updating” processes previously proposed to be indexed by the broad P300 positivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Dien1">Dien et al. 2003</xref>).</p>

        <title>Evoked Responses</title>
        <p>In this speeded response paradigm at least, the ERP P300 positivity was nearly strictly time-locked to and predominantly followed the motor response. The P300 positivity was, here, indeed a late positive complex of potentials generated in several brain areas, confirming results of invasive recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Smith1">Smith et al. 1990</xref>) and clinical group-difference studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Potts2">Potts et al. 1998</xref>). ICA decomposed the unaveraged EEG signals composing the target-response ERP into several classes of brain EEG processes originating predominantly in frontal, central, parietal, and occipital cortex. This result adds to longstanding doubts about the specificity of ERP peak measures. In particular, it shows that parietal sources may account for less than half of the peak amplitude of the stimulus-locked positive peak at Pz (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g011">Figure 11</xref>C), the most commonly used index of P300 magnitude. Altogether, we found four component clusters contributing to the P300 maximum at Pz—in descending order, central parietal, left and right mu, and central occipital alpha EEG processes. As well, the (3-fold) largest EEG contributor to the stimulus-locked P300 positivity at Fz is volume-conducted from the same parietal (P3b cluster) sources, casting strong doubt on the specificity of peak amplitude at Fz for indexing frontal function.</p>

        <title>Phase Resetting</title>
        <p>As in our previous single-trial analysis of some of these data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig8">Makeig et al. 2002</xref>), partial phase resetting of ongoing intermittent alpha and theta EEG processes contributes to some features of the average ERP. However, partial phase resetting is not a sufficient model for all the ERP features. For example, the central posterior alpha cluster actually showed a postmotor response decrease in alpha power during its prolonged alpha-ringing ERP contribution (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g009">Figure 9</xref>G and 9H), whereas the monopolar parietal P300 (or P3b) ERP feature was associated with an event-related increase in both whole EEG variance in the central parietal channel (Pz; data not shown) and in component activity variance of the P3b, Cα, and Lμ clusters that contributed the most to it.</p>
        <p>The central posterior alpha-ringing feature of the stimulus-locked ERP can be parsimoniously described as arising through alpha phase resetting. The P300/P3b feature, on the other hand, might better conform to the usual conception of an ERP as measuring evoked response activity added to ongoing EEG activity. Note in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g006">Figure 6</xref>H, however, that the low-frequency energy of the P3b cluster component activities increased by less than 3 dB at 3 Hz, demonstrating that the “baseline” activity of these processes included slow-wave processes with similar spectral characteristics. The postmotor theta burst phenomenon comprised both a frequency-specific power increase and significant (though partial) phase locking through its two-cycle ERP duration.</p>
        <p>The variety of these ERP features suggests that assuming a strict dichotomy between evoked and phase-reset activities is unproductive. Rather, each ERP feature may be usefully and better characterized as summing event-related perturbations of various sorts in the ongoing activities of one or more localized cortical EEG processes. To produce a reproducible peak or peaks in the average ERP, these perturbations should involve some degree of (partial) phase locking of the contributing process activities to the time-locking events in one or more frequency regions. At very low (near-DC) frequencies, event-related “phase locking” implies event-related “sign locking.” For example, the P300 would never appear in ERP averages at all if it were negative-going in half the trials. Similarly, there need be no strong dichotomy between evoked phenomena that involve partial phase locking and so contribute to average ERPs, and induced phenomena that may involve changes in spectral amplitudes but do not show phase locking and thus do not contribute to average ERPs. Rather, it is important to realize that most event-related EEG dynamics have <italic>both</italic> induced and evoked aspects.</p>

They reported three maximally independent ERP components of interest which they labeled P3f, P3b, and Pmp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig6">Makeig et al.

ICA separates component processes mixed in scalp data based on their relative temporal independence, which should be maximally expressed in the <italic>unaveraged</italic> data.

          <title>Independent component analysis</title>
          <p>Infomax ICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Bell1">Bell &amp; Sejnowski 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig3">Makeig et al. 1996</xref>) is one of a family of algorithms that exploit temporal independence to perform blind separation of underlying data sources. Lee et al. (1999) have shown that these algorithms have a common information-theoretic basis, differing chiefly in the form of distribution assumed for the sources, which may not be critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Amari1">Amari 1998</xref>). Infomax ICA finds, by natural gradient ascent, a square “unmixing” matrix that maximizes the joint entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Cover1">Cover and Thomas 1991</xref>) of a nonlinearly transformed ensemble of zero-mean input data vectors. Maximizing joint entropy implies, under reasonable assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Bell1">Bell and Sejnowski 1995</xref>), minimizing mutual information among the component activities. This means that information about the simultaneous activity values of any number of the components gives minimum information about the concurrent activity values of any other components.</p>
          <p>Independent component activities are minimally correlated, both in standard second-order and in higher-order senses. That is, they each appear to ICA to be “free-running” and in this sense act as separate sources of information in the data. The power of infomax source separation in a growing range of signal processing applications derives from its basic aim to identify <italic>information sources</italic> in data, in contrast to previous root-mean-square estimation methods that aim simply to model data <italic>variance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Jung3">Jung et al. 2001a</xref>). Natural-gradient logistic infomax ICA in the automated form we use here (the runica algorithm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig4">Makeig et al. 1997</xref>) can accurately decompose mixtures of component processes having symmetric or skewed distributions without requiring nonlinearities specifically tailored to them, and can be usefully applied to EEG data from 100 or more channels. The number of time points required for training may be as few as several times the number of unmixing weights (usually the square of the number of channels), though using more (clean) training data are preferable. In turn, the number of channels must be at least equal to (and preferably larger than) the number of interpretable components to be separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig5">Makeig et al. 1999a</xref>).</p>
          <p>The success of ICA applied to EEG data is strictly determined by the degree to which EEG dynamics fit the ICA model. The first requirement, that the underlying sources mix linearly in the electrode recordings, is assured by the biophysics of volume conduction at EEG frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Nunez1">Nunez 1981</xref>). The assumption of relative spatial stationarity of EEG sources is compatible, at least, with evidence of brain modularity from anatomy and functional imaging. The assumption of relative independence of the source signals is compatible with physiological models that emphasize local, short-range intracortical and radial thalamocortical coupling in the generation of local electrical synchronies in the EEG range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Salinas1">Salinas and Sejnowski 2001</xref>).</p>
          <p>The ultimate validity of the assumptions above in any data set cannot be guaranteed a priori. The consistency and physiologic plausibility of the results of ICA decompositions, such as we present here, including their often tight linkage to behavioral and cognitive variables, are strong indirect evidence for the workability of the assumptions and of the ICA model. Direct physiological testing of the model and its physiologic assumptions will require development of multiscale recording methods. Meanwhile, yet more flexible (but also more intricate) ICA models of EEG activity are possible (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Anemueller1">Anemueller et al. 2003</xref>). It remains to be seen, however, whether the information gain offered by such models exceeds the loss of statistical power associated with their higher complexity.</p>
          <p>As first demonstrated by simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig7">Makeig et al. 2000</xref>), when training data consist of fewer large source components than channels, plus many more small source components, as might be expected in actual EEG data, large source components are accurately separated into separate output components, with the remaining output components consisting of mixtures of smaller source components. In this sense, performance of the infomax ICA algorithm degrades gracefully as the amount of noise in the data increases. For more details about applying ICA to ERP and EEG data, see Makeig et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig5">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig2">2002</xref>) and Jung et al.

          <p>Here, the runica algorithm (available for download with the EEGLAB toolbox of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Delorme1">Delorme and Makeig [2004a</xref>] from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab" xlink:type="simple">http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab</ext-link>) was applied to sets of 400 to 600 1-s trials (31 channels, 256 time points) time-locked from −200 ms before to +800 ms after onsets of target stimuli presented at any of the five stimulus locations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020176-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Target trials in which the subject did not respond with a button press (fewer than 5%) were removed from the data. Learning batch size was 50. Initial learning rate began near 0.0004 and gradually reduced to 10<sup>−6</sup> during 50–150 training iterations that required about 30 min of computer time. Results of the analysis were relatively insensitive to the exact choice of learning rate or batch size. Reducing the stopping weight change from 10<sup>−6</sup> to 10<sup>−7</sup> did not appear to change the resulting decompositions qualitatively, although when decomposing data from many more channels, we have since noted an advantage to continuing to train until weight change falls below 10<sup>−7</sup>.</p>

          <title>Component clustering</title>
          <p>Commonly in ERP research, neural activity expressed in periocular data channels is ignored for fear of mislabeling eye-activity artifacts as brain activity. Some ICA components of EEG records can be clearly identified as accounting primarily for eye movements, line or muscle noise, or other artifacts through their characteristic scalp maps and activity time courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Makeig3">Makeig et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Jung1">Jung et al. 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Jung2">2000b</xref>). Subtracting the projections of artifactual components from averaged or single-trial data can eliminate or strongly reduce these artifacts while preserving the remaining nonartifactual EEG phenomena in all of the data channels. ICA thus makes it possible to examine periocular EEG activity apart from eye movements.</p>
          <p>Here, the total of 465 (31 times 15) component maps and mean activity log spectra from the 15 subjects were clustered by applying a modified Mahalanobis distance measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Enghoff1">Enghoff, 1999</xref> see Appendix of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Jung2">Jung et al. 2001b</xref>) to vectors coding differences in the component 31-channel (x, y) map gradients and activity log spectra after reduction to 12 and five dimensions respectively by principal component analysis. Cluster membership was in a few cases then further adjusted by eye for uniformity. Clustering based on scalp map gradients and activity spectra, as reported here, is one of several possible component clustering approaches, whose relative advantages have not yet been explored.</p>

ERSPs show changes in decibels from baseline in spectral power across a broad frequency range (here, 3–50 Hz). The time/frequency analysis used Hanning-windowed sinusoidal wavelets of 3 cycles at 3 Hz, rising linearly to about 15 cycles at 30 Hz. This modified wavelet transform was selected to optimize the trade-off between temporal resolution at lower frequencies and stability at higher frequencies.</p>
          <p>Constructing surrogate data sets by shuffling the data epoch subwindows used to construct the time-locked spectral average allowed choosing an initial within-subject significance cutoff (not corrected for multiple comparisons) of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01.

ERSP transforms of the data were computed at each channel and then for each clustered data component.

          <title>Equivalent dipole modeling</title>
          <p>Both simple anatomic considerations and observed results of ICA decomposition suggest that cortical EEG sources may be usefully modeled as patches of cortex with partially synchronous local field activities. In brief, the high local coupling density of both excitatory and, particularly, inhibitory neurons in cortex means that local field potentials sufficiently synchronous to create measurable EEG signals should tend to extend through a compact spatial domain—roughly speaking, a patch of cortex of unspecified extent. Through volume conduction, partially synchronous activities within cortical source patches produce far-field potentials throughout the brain and on the scalp. The distribution of the scalp electrical field produced by such a source patch is nearly identical to that of a small dipolar potential element whose geometry is like a tiny flashlight battery oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface. This “battery” is termed the equivalent dipole for the cortical source.</p>
          <p>Here, we used a relatively simple and well-known method for fitting the positions and orientations of equivalent dipoles in a four-shell spherical head model for each component (BESA; Megis Software, Munich, Germany). To reduce the time required to process the 485 component maps, we used a version (3.0) of the BESA software that allowed batch processing to fit single-dipole models to each component scalp map. (A dipfit tool set by R. Oostenveld, producing equivalent results, is now available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/dipfit.html" xlink:type="simple">http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/dipfit.html</ext-link>). Some bilaterally symmetric component maps were better fit with symmetric dual-dipole models. The successful fits of single-dipole models for many of the clustered components is compatible with their generation within a single, compact patch of cortex, while bilateral dual-dipole models are compatible with tightly coupled oscillatory activity (without net phase delay) in two bilaterally symmetric cortical patches densely connected via corpus callosum or common subcortical drive.</p>
          <p>To distinguish the relative regional locations of the component clusters, the scalp maps for the individual components in each cluster were first oriented similarly (e.g., so as to all be positively correlated), normalized, and averaged. These cluster mean maps were then fit with single-dipole models to roughly illustrate the regional distinctions between the sources of the component clusters. Finally, the cluster-mean dipoles and event-related time/frequency information measured by ERSP, intertrial phase coherence,and event-related phase coherence analysis of all the single trials were visualized together in three dimensions using an animated display developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020176-Delorme3">Delorme et al.

Log spectral power changes (relative to prestimulus baseline) are indicated by the sizes of the spheres (see key, bottom right). Nongrey sphere colors indicate consistent intertrial phase locking (intertrial phase coherence). Colored cylinders joining spheres indicate significant event-related phase coherence between cluster components.</p>
