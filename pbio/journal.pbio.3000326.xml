<abstract>
<p>Sensory hair cells are mechanoreceptors required for hearing and balance functions. From embryonic development, hair cells acquire apical stereociliary bundles for mechanosensation, basolateral ion channels that shape receptor potential, and synaptic contacts for conveying information centrally. These key maturation steps are sequential and presumed coupled; however, whether hair cells emerging postnatally mature similarly is unknown. Here, we show that in vivo postnatally generated and regenerated hair cells in the utricle, a vestibular organ detecting linear acceleration, acquired some mature somatic features but hair bundles appeared nonfunctional and short. The utricle consists of two hair cell subtypes with distinct morphological, electrophysiological and synaptic features. In both the undamaged and damaged utricle, fate-mapping and electrophysiology experiments showed that Plp1<sup>+</sup> supporting cells took on type II hair cell properties based on molecular markers, basolateral conductances and synaptic properties yet stereociliary bundles were absent, or small and nonfunctional. By contrast, Lgr5<sup>+</sup> supporting cells regenerated hair cells with type I and II properties, representing a distinct hair cell precursor subtype. Lastly, direct physiological measurements showed that utricular function abolished by damage was partially regained during regeneration. Together, our data reveal a previously unrecognized aberrant maturation program for hair cells generated and regenerated postnatally and may have broad implications for inner ear regenerative therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inner ear hair cells are mechanoreceptors critical for auditory and vestibular functions, and their degeneration are primary causes of hearing and balance dysfunction. In mammals, cochlear hair cell loss is irreversible, leading to permanent hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref001">1</xref>]. By contrast, spontaneous yet limited hair cell regeneration occurs in both the neonatal and mature mammalian utricle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref010">10</xref>], a vestibular sensory organ that functions to detect linear acceleration such as gravity.</p>
<p>During utricular development, hair cells are specified between embryonic day (E) 11.5–12.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref011">11</xref>]. At birth, some hair cells exhibit mature-appearing stereociliary bundles bearing the actin-bundling protein espin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref012">12</xref>]. Electrophysiological measurements show that vestibular hair cells are mechanically sensitive as early as E16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref013">13</xref>]. Outward and inward rectifier voltage-dependent conductances characteristic of type I and II hair cells are present before birth, and their properties continue to mature during the first two postnatal weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>]. Formation of a calyx, a specialized nerve terminal specific for type I hair cells, begins neonatally and is presumed to be mature within the first postnatal month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>]. Thus, within four weeks of specification, utricular hair cells can first display mature bundle and then somatic (electrophysiological, synaptic, and molecular) features representing specialization of hair cell subtypes. These properties, which are presumed to be orderly and coupled, are used as references for characterizing induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell- and progenitor cell-derived hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref020">20</xref>]. However, over 50% of utricular hair cells are added after birth, with most addition occurring during the first postnatal week when the organ gains detectable function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref022">22</xref>]. At present, the time course and extent of functional maturation acquired by postnatally developed hair cells are unexplored, leaving open the question of whether they display properties similar to those born in the embryonic period.</p>
<p>Following damage to the mammalian utricle, hair cells bearing immature stereociliary bundles reminiscent of nascent hair cells repopulate the sensory epithelium one to six months later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref010">10</xref>]. In the mature mouse utricle, the extent of regenerated hair cells is rather limited, whereas more robust regeneration occurs in utricles from younger animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref009">9</xref>]. Using length of stereociliary bundles as a surrogate marker of maturation, most regenerated hair cells appear nascent even months after damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref005">5</xref>]. Given this limited degree of hair cell regeneration and bundle maturation, it is currently unclear whether the somatic properties (basolateral conductances, synaptic/nerve terminal formation and molecular markers) of regenerated hair cells mature and if the overall vestibular function is restored.</p>
<p>As in other vestibular organs, hair cells in the utricle specialize into type I and II subtypes, which can be distinguished by molecular markers (Osteopontin for mature type I, Mapt for mature type II and Annexin A4 for immature and mature type II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref023">23</xref>], morphology of cell body (amphora-shaped with apical neck for type I and cylindrical or goblet-shaped for type II), nerve terminals (calyces for type I and boutons for type II), and basolateral conductances (low-voltage-activated, delayed rectifier potassium conductance [gKL] for type I and slow inward rectifier non-specific cation conductance [gH] for both type I and II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref029">29</xref>]. Type I hair cells display larger mechanotransducer currents and are postulated to detect faster acceleration stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref032">32</xref>], but both subtypes are deemed essential for organ function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref033">33</xref>]. In the damaged mature mammalian utricle, regeneration of only type II hair cells has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref006">6</xref>], whereas hair cells regenerated in the neonatal utricle displayed molecular characteristics of both type I and II hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref009">9</xref>]. At present, the extent of maturity achieved by postnatally generated and regenerated hair cells into hair cell subtypes—including their acquisition of basolateral conductances, nerve terminals, and molecular markers—has not been fully defined in either the neonatal or mature utricle.</p>
<p>Here, we found that postnatally generated hair cells displayed electrophysiological and molecular characteristics of type II hair cells but had relatively immature stereociliary bundles. Using lineage markers differentially expressed in extrastriolar (peripheral) and striolar (central) supporting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref009">9</xref>], we show that regenerated hair cells derived from Plp1<sup>+</sup> supporting cells displayed type II hair cell properties whereas those from the Lgr5<sup>+</sup> lineage exhibited either type I or II hair cell properties, suggesting regional segregation of hair cell precursors. In contrast to somatic properties (morphology, hair cell subtype markers, synaptic markers, nerve terminals, and basolateral conductances), regenerated hair cells showed relatively immature or nonfunctional bundle characteristics (morphology and mechanotransduction [MET] channel function). Collectively, our study reveals that postnatally generated and regenerated hair cells acquire many somatic properties but retain relatively immature bundle features, thus displaying previously unrecognized aberrant maturation programs distinct from embryonic hair cells.</p>

<title>Fate-mapping early and late postnatally generated hair cells</title>
<p>In the postnatal mouse utricle, most hair cells are added during the first week after birth in both the striolar and extrastriolar regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref021">21</xref>].

Tamoxifen (0.075 mg/g intraperitoneal [IP]) administration at postnatal day (P) 3 induced tdTomato labeling of 73.0 ± 10.3% and 14.1 ± 4.0% supporting cells in the extrastriolar and striolar regions, respectively, two days later (<italic>n =</italic> 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Hair cells were rarely tdTomato-labeled at this age (0.5 ± 0.3 and 0.3 ± 0.5%, <italic>n =</italic> 742 extrastriolar and 663 striolar hair cells from 4 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g001">Fig 1C and 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s001">S1B and S1E Fig</xref>). At P30, 14.1 ± 3.7% of Myosin7a<sup>+</sup> hair cells in the extrastriola and 5.2 ± 3.7% in the striola were tdTomato-labeled (<italic>n =</italic> 2,507 extrastriolar and 1,858 striolar hair cells from 11 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g001">Fig 1D and 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s001">S1C and S1E Fig</xref>), both significantly more than P5 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 in extrastriola and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 in striola). Control experiments using corn oil on P3 <italic>Plp1-tdTomato</italic> mice revealed no labeled hair cells (<italic>n =</italic> 665 and 608 hair cells in the extrastriola and striola from 3 mice) and only rare labeled supporting cells at P30 (0.5% of 954 extrastriolar and 0.1% of 946 striolar supporting cells from 3 mice, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). This suggests that P3 Plp1<sup>+</sup> supporting cells contribute to postnatally generated hair cells, which we term HC<sup>PG3</sup> hereon.</p>

<p>The number of hair cells in the mouse utricle continues to increase during the first postnatal week, with marginal increases thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref021">21</xref>]. To identify these late postnatally generated hair cells, we administered tamoxifen (0.075 mg/g IP) to P8 <italic>Plp1-Tomato</italic> mice and found 4.6 ± 2.0% and 2.5 ± 2.5% of Myosin7a<sup>+</sup> hair cells tdTomato-labeled in the extrastriola and striola, respectively, at P30 (<italic>n =</italic> 3,002 extrastriolar and 2,561 striolar hair cells from 16 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s001">S1D and S1E Fig</xref>). There were significantly fewer late traced hair cells (HC<sup>PG8</sup>) than HC<sup>PG3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s001">S1E Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>), consistent with the decline in hair cell production after the first postnatal week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref021">21</xref>]. To assess the electrophysiological properties of HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup>, we probed both cohorts at P30, allowing time for both groups of hair cells to mature. Traced hair cells (HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup>) and untraced hair cells (controls), which likely contained more mature hair cells derived from supporting cells earlier than P8, were probed for delayed rectifier potassium currents (IDR). Normally found in nascent and mature vestibular hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>], IDR were observed in all three groups of hair cells (<italic>n =</italic> 13 HC<sup>PG3</sup>, 9 HC<sup>PG8</sup>, 9 untraced hair cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g001">Fig 1G–1I</xref>). From conductance-voltage plots, we found that values for maximal conductance, half-activation voltage and slope of the Boltzmann function were similar among groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g001">Fig 1J–1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>), with small but significant differences among the latter two measurements possibly attributed to splice variants or phosphorylation state. Lastly, we used two additional measurements to estimate hair cell maturation: 1) cell capacitance as a proxy for cell size and 2) resting potentials which become more negative as hair cells mature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref015">15</xref>]. We found that traced hair cells (HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup>) most closely matched perinatal hair cells in both size and resting potentials and estimate that they were comparably mature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s009">S2 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref015">15</xref>]. Together, these data show that both early and late postnatally generated hair cells exhibit fundamental hair cell properties, leading us next to probe whether they acquire specialized hair cell subtype characteristics.</p>

<title>Specialization of postnatally generated hair cells into type II hair cells</title>
<p>Vestibular hair cell subtypes can be identified based on morphology, molecular markers, electrophysiological and synaptic properties. In addition, hair cell age can be intimated by the complement of ion channels present, synaptic function, and the morphology and functional state of hair bundles. Here, we first used molecular markers and electrophysiological properties to determine whether traced hair cells differentiate into hair cell subtypes.</p>
<p>Type I hair cells display amphora-shaped cell bodies and long thin apical necks, endowed with a consistent and simple electrophysiological fingerprint: a hyperpolarized activating delayed rectifier current (IKL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>]. Type II hair cells are goblet-shaped with short, thick necks and basolateral cytoplasmic processes, but are more complex in that they contain diverse ion channels that vary with age and location, including the voltage-gated inward rectifying, nonspecific cation currents (IH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

We found that Osteopontin was expressed at the apical neck of type I hair cells with Tuj1<sup>+</sup> calyces, while Annexin A4 and Mapt were expressed in the cell membrane of type II hair cells throughout the P30 utricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2A–2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">2K–2N</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2J and S2K Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>When examining HC<sup>PG3</sup> in the P30 <italic>Plp1-Tomato</italic> utricles, we found that most traced hair cells expressed Annexin A4 (85.1 ± 25.8% of 117 and 94.9 ± 8.9% of 24 HC<sup>PG3</sup> in the extrastriola and striola from 3 mice, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Similarly, most HC<sup>PG8</sup> were Annexin A4<sup>+</sup> (95.2 ± 8.2% of 24 and 100% ± 0% of 12 HC<sup>PG8</sup> in extrastriola and striola from 3 mice, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2A and S2C Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s010">S3 Table</xref>). We examined 95 Annexin A4<sup>+</sup> HC<sup>PG3</sup> and 35 Annexin A4<sup>+</sup> HC<sup>PG8</sup> and found that 69–79% were goblet-shaped, with other rare morphologic subtypes also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2C and S2F Fig</xref>). Lastly, Annexin A4<sup>+</sup> HC<sup>PG8</sup> also expressed Mapt, a marker of mature type II hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref023">23</xref>] (82.4% of 17 extrastriolar cells and 76.5% of 17 striolar cells from 3 mice) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2I–S2K Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s011">S4 Table</xref>), suggesting that most postnatally generated hair cells from the Plp1 lineage have acquired a type II hair cell phenotype.</p>
<p>To verify their identity as type II hair cells, we probed HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup> from P30 <italic>Plp1-Tomato</italic> utricles for both IKL, characteristic of type I hair cells, and IH non-specific cation currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>]. The presence of IKL indicates a type I hair cell electrophysiological phenotype. To account for possible variations in measurements, we compared traced hair cells to untraced cells in a similar location within the sensory epithelium. To probe for IH we voltage-clamped hair cells at -69 mV and hyperpolarized between -74 and -156 mV for 400 ms and then back to -69 mV. Hair cells from each group (10/10 HC<sup>PG3</sup>, 9/9 HC<sup>PG8</sup> and 5/5 untraced hair cells) displayed IH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2E–2G</xref>), with similar properties (peak conductance, half-activation and slope) measured in all three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2H–2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess whether postnatally generated hair cells can acquire features of type I hair cells, we immunostained for and found that a subset of HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup> expressed Osteopontin (21.2 ± 32.6% of 87 and 19.3 ± 26.2% of 49 HC<sup>PG3</sup> in the extrastriola and striola, respectively, from 3–4 mice, and 4.0 ± 6.8% of 81 and 1.7 ± 4.1% of 28 HC<sup>PG8</sup> in the extrastriola and striola from 7–8 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2M and 2N</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2D and S2E Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Among 24 Osteopontin<sup>+</sup> HC<sup>PG3</sup> and 2 HC<sup>PG8</sup> examined, most (75–100%) displayed the classic amphora shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2M and 2N</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2E and S2G Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To further investigate whether postnatally generated hair cells exhibit type I hair cell electrophysiological properties, we probed and found no significant IKL in either HC<sup>PG3</sup> or HC<sup>PG8</sup> (<italic>n =</italic> 10 and 8 cells, respectively), suggesting that these groups do not contain HCs with a type I electrophysiological phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2O, 2P and 2R</xref>). By contrast, IKL was detected in 75% of (9 of 12) untraced hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2Q and 2R</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>), with half-activation and slope comparable to those in mature type I hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">Fig 2S and 2T</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The presence of IH and the lack of IKL in fate-mapped HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup> suggest a non-type I hair cell phenotype. Although few postnatally generated hair cells displayed molecular and morphologic features of type I hair cells, none displayed such electrophysiological properties. This is consistent with the previous results that most postnatally generated hair cells displayed molecular and morphologic features representing a type II hair cell phenotype.</p>
<p>Of note, several conductances were not explored in detail, in part because they were not observed. Sodium conductances, often described in immature hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref036">36</xref>] were not observed in either traced or untraced cells, likely suggesting that all cells had matured past this developmental stage. A-type potassium conductances, which are often found in extrastriolar hair cells and used as a marker for maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>], were not observed in traced or untraced cells, likely indicating that we recorded from a location where this conductance was not observed.</p>
<p>In summary, these data indicate that Plp1<sup>+</sup> supporting cells primarily give rise to type II hair cells, whereas few type I hair cells were generated in the postnatal period. In comparison, untraced Myosin7a<sup>+</sup> hair cells, which likely represent hair cells that arose earlier than P8, more commonly expressed the type I hair cell marker Osteopontin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s010">S3 Table</xref>) and the signature IKL at P30.</p>

<p>We next examined whether HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup> were capable of synaptic vesicle release. Calcium currents were isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g003">Fig 3G–3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>), current-voltage plots were generated from peak current responses, and the maximal current and half activating voltage were extracted from these plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g003">Fig 3J and 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>). Like untraced hair cells (4/4), all 14 HC<sup>PG3</sup> and 8 HC<sup>PG8</sup> displayed calcium current responses supportive of the potential for presynaptic activity. The presence of calcium currents is also supportive of traced cells taking on a hair cell phenotype. Slight differences in half-activation values may indicate different states of maturity and warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>To assess functional activity of presynaptic sites, vesicle fusion was monitored using a dual sine wave technique as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref040">40</xref>].

We found that most (13/17 HC<sup>PG3</sup>, 7/8 HC<sup>PG8</sup>, 4/4 untraced hair cells) of the recorded cells had greater than 50 fF of capacitance change.

<title>Immature stereociliary bundles and MET channels in postnatally generated hair cells</title>

<p>To test whether MET channels were functional in HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup>, we administered Texas-Red conjugated gentamicin (GTTR, 0.85 mg/ml for 1 hr), which enters hair cells via MET channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref043">43</xref>], to freshly harvested utricles. The presence of GTTR labeling indicates a population of MET channels that have a non-zero open probability. From early tracing (P3-P30) experiments, we found that GTTR labeled 83.7 ± 11.0% and 61.0 ± 7.8% of untraced hair cells in the extrastriola and striola of undamaged P30 utricles (<italic>n =</italic> 649 and 700 from 3 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g004">Fig 4I–4L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>). This starkly contrasts the Plp1-traced hair cells, of which only 31.0 ± 19.0% and 38.9 ± 9.6% were GTTR-labeled (<italic>n =</italic> 117 and 48 in the extrastriola and striola regions from 3 mice). Similarly in the late tracing experiments (P8-P30), significantly more untraced hair cells were GTTR-labeled (84.2 ± 7.2% of 951 and 73.4 ± 3.4% of 740 hair cells in the extrastriola and striola from 4 mice) than traced hair cells (29.2 ± 6.7% of 30 and 39.2 ± 7.8% of 16 traced HCs in the extrastriola and striola from 4 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g004">Fig 4I–4L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>).

<p>In utricles from the P30 <italic>Pou4f3-DTR; Plp1-Tomato</italic> mice, almost all HC<sup>R</sup> expressed Annexin A4 (95.8 ± 7.2% of 19 extrastriolar and 97.0 ± 5.2% of 22 striolar hair cells from 3 mice) and few expressed Osteopontin (16.2 ± 13.0% of 85 extrastriolar and 15.6 ± 12.0% of 83 striolar cells from 7 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g006">Fig 6G–6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Most Annexin A4<sup>+</sup> HC<sup>R</sup>, expressed the mature type II hair cell marker Mapt (76.5% of 17 extrastriolar cells and 58.8% of 17 striolar cells from 4 mice, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s005">S5F and S5G Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s011">S4 Table</xref>). By contrast, the majority of untraced hair cells from damaged utricles expressed Osteopontin (68.0 ± 9.2% of 266 and 68.5 ± 11.4% of 292 untraced hair cells from 4 mice in the extrastriola and striola, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Thus, the composition of untraced hair cells from damaged utricles, which likely represent surviving hair cells, is consistent with the previously reported ratios of type I and II hair cells in the striola and extrastriola (1.47 and 1.19) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref046">46</xref>], whereas HC<sup>R</sup> mainly displayed a type II hair cell phenotype. Unlike HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup>, many regenerated Annexin A4<sup>+</sup> hair cells displayed short, rounded cell bodies without basolateral processes, while others displayed basolateral processes associated with classic type II hair cells (<italic>n =</italic> 37 cells from 3 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s005">S5D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>All regenerated Osteopontin<sup>+</sup> hair cells examined (18/18) were also morphologically distinct from undamaged counterparts, appearing pear-shaped with short necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g006">Fig 6I and 6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s005">S5E Fig</xref>) and no amphora-shaped Osteopontin<sup>+</sup>, Plp1-traced hair cells were detected in the damaged organs. These results suggest that Plp1-traced HC<sup>R</sup>, like HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup>, preferentially acquire properties of type II hair cells and less commonly those of type I hair cells. However, many type II HC<sup>R</sup> and all type I HC<sup>R</sup> observed were morphologically distinct from HC<sup>PG3</sup> and HC<sup>PG8</sup>.</p>
<p>We next assessed the electrophysiological properties of Plp1-traced HC<sup>R</sup> and untraced hair cells in P30 <italic>Pou4f3-DTR; Plp1-Tomato</italic> utricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>), and compared them to Plp1-traced HC<sup>PG8</sup> from undamaged <italic>Plp1-Tomato</italic> utricles (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g002">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g007">7B</xref>). IDR were detected in all hair cells from the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g007">Fig 7A–7C</xref>, <italic>n =</italic> 17 HC<sup>R</sup>, 9 HC<sup>PG8</sup> and 14 untraced hair cells, respectively) with similar corresponding maximal conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g007">Fig 7D–7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>), despite differences in half-activation and slope. Cell capacitance was used as a proxy for cell size, which serves as a marker for hair cell maturation. Traced hair cells, like untraced hair cells, displayed capacitance measurements similar to those of postnatal utricular hair cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s009">S2 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>]. Similarly resting potential data varies with cell maturity and measured values suggest that HC<sup>R</sup> were at least as mature as postnatal hair cells previously reported. Although the absolute level of maturity cannot be deduced from these parameters, these data suggests that traced hair cells match untraced hair cells.</p>

<p>To further characterize HC<sup>R</sup> for the presence of functional presynaptic elements, we assessed calcium currents and monitored presynaptic vesicle fusion via capacitance changes in response to depolarization in HC<sup>R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g008">Fig 8F–8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s005">S5H–S5J Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s012">S1 Data</xref>).

The presence of calcium currents supports a hair cell phenotype and the potential for presynaptic activity.

<title>Damage-activated Lgr5<sup>+</sup> supporting cells regenerate type I and II hair cells</title>
<p>Thus far, we have shown that the Plp1-lineage supporting cells primarily regenerated hair cells displaying a type II hair cell phenotype. Previously, we found that damage activates Lgr5<sup>+</sup> supporting cells in the striolar region to regenerate both type I and II hair cells, which were defined only by expression of Calbindin, Sox2, and the presence of Tuj1<sup>+</sup> calyx nerve terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref009">9</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mechanoreceptors are critical for hearing and balance functions. In mammals, the cochlea lacks the ability to regenerate, and vestibular hair cells are replenished in a limited fashion. As stereociliary bundles house the apparatus for MET, many prior studies examining regenerated hair cells or newly generated hair cells in ex vivo conditions have relied on assessing bundle morphology to determine hair cell maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref020">20</xref>]. In this study, we show that Plp1-traced postnatally generated and regenerated hair cells exhibit several morphologic, molecular and electrophysiological properties of type II hair cells, though they continue to display largely immature hair bundles. Lgr5<sup>+</sup> supporting cell-derived hair cells display underdeveloped hair bundles as well, but contain morphological, molecular and electrophysiological properties of both type I and type II hair cells, confirming and extending previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref009">9</xref>]. Our study indicates that hair cells postnatally re/generated from Plp1<sup>+</sup> and Lgr5<sup>+</sup> supporting cells can reach a quasi-mature level with regards to somatic properties, although the apical stereociliary bundles and MET machinery appear largely underdeveloped, suggesting that complex and partially distinct mechanisms are involved.</p>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Discrepancy between bundle and somatic features in postnatally generated and regenerated hair cells</title>
<p>In the developing utricle, hair cells are first specified between E11.5–12.5 with a second wave appearing at approximately E15, with hair cell addition presumably mainly in the peripheral regions of the sensory epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref050">50</xref>]. Hair cell bundles first emerge at E13.5 and remain relatively uniform in height throughout the central region at E15, when hair cells gain mechanosensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref051">51</xref>]. Géléoc and colleagues reported that a delayed rectifier potassium conductance (gDR) and a fast inward rectifier potassium conductance (gK1) begin to appear around E14-E15 and continue to be present into the postnatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>]. The transient expression of sodium conductances (gNA) in immature hair cell has also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref036">36</xref>]. In addition, cell size based on capacitance measurements and resting membrane potentials change as hair cells mature from the embryonic to postnatal periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Transmission electron microscopy shows that afferent neurites appear as early as E13, and bouton synaptic contacts between hair cells and afferent nerve fibers form at E15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref052">52</xref>]. However, calyceal afferent endings, which are uniquely coupled to type I hair cells, only begin to take shape several days before birth and continue developing and maturing during the first postnatal month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref053">53</xref>]. Moreover, embryonic hair cells acquire synaptic elements and display calcium-dependent exocytotic activities, which have been reported to mature postnatally although the time course is largely unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>Lastly, the type I hair cell-specific delayed rectifier potassium conductance (gKL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>] is first detected at E18, shortly before birth. The delayed, inward rectifier H-type conductance (gH) is also detected in embryonic hair cells and both types of hair cells in the postnatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>]. In the mature utricle, the inward rectifier potassium conductances (gKIR) are expressed in type II hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The maturation process of hair cells derived from the prenatal period is orderly with the maturation of bundle and somatic properties seemingly coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g012">Fig 12A</xref>). Our current and previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref009">9</xref>] indicate that hair cells generated in vivo in the postnatal utricle have dramatically underdeveloped hair bundles and MET channel function, though seemingly mature for defined properties in the somatic compartment (presence of gDR, gKIR, gH, gKL, lack of gNA, large cell size, negative resting membrane potentials) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g012">Fig 12B–12D</xref>). These somatic properties suggest that postnatally re/generated hair cells are comparable to those present in the postnatal utricle, although the underdeveloped stereociliary bundles and MET function imply components of the hair bundle lagged behind in maturation. This interpretation is further supported by the findings that postnatally re/generated hair cells have comparable somatic properties to untraced hair cells (presumably older and derived from the embryonic period). It is therefore possible that overlapping but distinct mechanisms direct the maturation of hair cell apical and somatic domains. In support of this notion, Oshima and colleagues reported that vestibular hair cell-like cells differentiated in vitro from mouse embryonic stem (ES) and iPS cells acquired mechanosensitivity and stereocilia with certain mature features (e.g. staircase pattern), but relatively immature basolateral ion channel properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref020">20</xref>]. Moreover, ectopic cochlear hair cells formed as a result of in utero gene transfer of <italic>Atoh1</italic> to the developing inner ear were crowned with relatively immature stereociliary bundles while displaying age-appropriate conductances and synaptic components on their basolateral surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref048">48</xref>]. At present, there is a paucity of knowledge on mechanisms regulating the maturation of individual components of postnatal vestibular hair cells.</p>

<title>Classification of vestibular hair cells subtypes</title>
<p>Vestibular hair cell subtypes are traditionally characterized according to morphology, molecular markers, electrophysiological properties, and innervation patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref029">29</xref>]. Recent studies have further characterized the unique basolateral processes of type II hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref026">26</xref>]. Using markers of type I and II hair cells identified via single cell RNA sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref023">23</xref>], we found type I and II hair cells with various morphologies: around 69–79% of the Annexin A4<sup>+</sup> type II hair cells displayed typical basolateral process, while others were devoid of this feature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). Conversely, type I hair cells showed more uniform morphologies, with the majority (75–100%) being amphora-shaped with long apical necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g012">Fig 12B</xref>). We found occasional Osteopontin<sup>+</sup> type I hair cells with shorter cell bodies and necks, with nuclei located in the upper third of the epithelium closer to the type II hair cell nuclei level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2G Fig</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed occasional type II hair cells with thick apical necks with nuclei located in the middle third of the epithelium as seen in type I hair cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). While one may perceive similarities in morphology between some type I and II hair cells, whether their lineages are related remains unclear. Such a relationship between type I and type II hair cells has been previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref061">61</xref>]. In the undamaged tissues, one likely explanation for the various morphologies is that the P30 utricle, though functionally mature, contains a heterogeneous population of hair cells at various developmental stages. Similarly, in the neonatal utricle where new hair cells continue to be generated, hair cells with various morphologies were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>]. Cell shapes were further modified as a result of damage, where a noticeable flattening of the sensory epithelium leads to shortening/rounding of both type I and II hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g012">Fig 12C</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the heterogeneous morphologies of Annexin A4<sup>+</sup> type II hair cells, they displayed remarkably similar channel (gDR and gH) and presynaptic properties, suggesting acquisition of these features may occur before cell morphology becomes more uniform. On the other hand, none of the Osteopontin<sup>+</sup> type I hair cells derived from Plp1<sup>+</sup> supporting cells displayed gKL or calyx-type nerve terminals, and only a subset of those from Lgr5<sup>+</sup> supporting cells showed gKL (28.6%) or calyx nerve terminals (24.4%). Using embryonic and neonatal hair cell development as a reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref016">16</xref>], we hypothesize that type I hair cells first express Osteopontin and become amphora-shaped before acquiring gKL, with calyx formation being one of the last maturation steps. In other words, Plp1-traced Osteopontin<sup>+</sup> type I hair cells, unlike the Lgr5-traced Osteopontin<sup>+</sup> type I hair cells, failed to display gKL or calyx nerve terminals, and as such are likely to be more immature. Whether these immature type I hair cells further mature over time should be of interest for future studies.</p>
<p>As a cardinal feature of mature hair cells, stereociliary bundles elongate as hair cells mature and gain mechanosensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref041">41</xref>]. Hair cell subtypes also display different bundle morphologies, with type I hair cells having thicker and longer stereociliary bundles than type II hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref062">62</xref>]. Traditionally, bundle length and morphology have been employed as criteria for hair cell identity and maturation. Since results from the current and other studies suggest that hair bundles of postnatally produced hair cells might develop at a different pace compared to other hair cell properties, we propose that bundle features should not be the sole measure of hair cell maturity.</p>

<title>Supporting cells with distinct competence to regenerate hair cells</title>
<p>In the adult mouse utricle, the ratios of type I and type II hair cells are estimated to be 1.47 and 1.19 in the striola and extrastriola, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref046">46</xref>]. While both hair cell types are presumably important for organ function, only regeneration of type II hair cells has been reported in the mature utricle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref006">6</xref>]. However, our previous and current study suggest that the striolar region in the neonatal utricle uniquely harbors hair cell progenitors capable of regenerating bona fide type I hair cells. The overwhelming majority of Plp1-traced supporting cells occupied the extrastriolar region with few striolar supporting cells also traced, but ~90% traced hair cells displayed type II characteristics and the ~10% Osteopontin<sup>+</sup> type I hair cells failed to display gKL or calyx innervation. By contrast, Lgr5 becomes highly expressed in striolar supporting cells after damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref009">9</xref>], giving rise to type I hair cells fulfilling morphologic, molecular, electrophysiological, and innervation criteria. Therefore Lgr5<sup>+</sup> striolar supporting cells may represent a specialized supporting cell population capable of regenerating both type I and II hair cells via mitotic regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref009">9</xref>]. In support of the concept that distinct populations of hair cell precursors/progenitors exist, striolar supporting cells are more competent to divide and form ectopic hair cells upon inhibition of Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref064">64</xref>].</p>

<title>Time course of functional recovery and hair cell maturation</title>
<p>Hair cell regeneration is robust in avian auditory and vestibular organs, leading to near-normal densities of hair cells and functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref001">1</xref>]. In the mammalian utricle where regeneration is limited, previous studies examining whether a recovery of function occurs have yielded mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref066">66</xref>]. In the current study, after hair cell ablation in the neonatal utricle, only 8% of hair cells remained at P15 and 94% of mice lost VsEP responses. At P30 and P60, 36% and 59% of these mice partially regained VsEP thresholds, which coincided and correlated with increases in hair cell numbers (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.62, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000326.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). As most of the regenerated hair cells we characterized displayed immature apical stereociliary bundles and poor GTTR uptake, they are unlikely to be fully functional or to significantly contribute to the observed functional recovery. Since many hair cells derived from the Plp1-traced and Lgr5-traced supporting cells appear nonfunctional, it is possible that other supporting cells/progenitor cells contribute to functional hair cells that are produced in the postnatal utricle.</p>
<p>Overall, we estimate that postnatally generated hair cells with immature stereociliary bundles constitute ~13% of the hair cell population. It is possible that these hair cells act as a reserve population that replenishes lost hair cells in response to damage. Alternatively, they may function to replace hair cells lost during the homeostatic turnover of hair cells in the adult utricle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref060">60</xref>]. Moreover, surviving hair cells and a change in the innervating patterns may permit the activation of neurons from fewer stimulated hair cells, which in turn contribute to functional recovery. The <italic>Pou4f3-DTR</italic> mouse is an ideal model to further investigate these possibilities.</p>
<p>In summary, both hair cells generated in the postnatal utricle and hair cells regenerated after damage demonstrated features of mature somatic properties yet immature apical stereociliary bundles and MET function. Based on these results, we propose a new classification of postnatal vestibular hair cells independent of apical bundle morphology, which warrants further characterization in the normal and damaged postnatal utricle. Moreover, our data may guide future efforts in inner ear regeneration, including delineating the relationship between hair cell regeneration and vestibular function.</p>

<p>VsEPs were recorded from mice at various ages (P15, P30 and P60) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref045">45</xref>]. Briefly, mice were first anesthetized with a 1:1 cocktail of ketamine (60 to 100 mg/kg) and xylazine (6 to 10 mg/kg). Subcutaneous stainless steel electrodes were then placed, and a head clip was used to secure the head to the mechanical shaker used to deliver linear motion stimuli along the naso-occipital axis. Vertical motion of the shaker was monitored with an accelerometer (model no. 1018, Vibra-Metrics) and adjusted to produce the stimulus waveforms. Jerk stimuli ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 g/ms were presented (g/ms where 1 g = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref045">45</xref>]. Signals were amplified and filtered. Responses from normal and inverted stimulus polarities were collected and added together for a total of 256 sweeps for each waveform. A masker (90 dB SPL; bandwidth 50 Hz to 50 kHz) from a free-field speaker driver (model no. FF1, Tucker Davis Technologies) was used to prevent responses from the auditory components of cranial nerve VIII. All primary response parameters were blindly quantified via three components: threshold (g/ms), P1 latency (ms) and P1-N1 amplitude (μV). Thresholds were defined as the stimulus intensity halfway between the minimum response intensity and the maximum intensity that failed to elicit a response. Latencies were measured as the time to onset of the stimulus for the first positive response peak (P1). Amplitudes represented peak-to-peak magnitudes between P1 and N1 waveforms. Whereas the first positive and negative response peaks (P1 and N1, respectively) reflect activity of the peripheral vestibular nerve, peaks beyond N1 reflect activity of the brainstem and central vestibular relays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref045">45</xref>].</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Utricular tissues were dissected from mice at ages denoted and secured in a recording chamber where epifluorescence, cell morphology and location could be observed for identification and classification. An Olympus, BX50 microscope with a 100x (1.0 NA) objective was used for all observations. Tissues were isolated and incubated for recording in a solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 2.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 6 mM D-glucose, 2 mM creatine, 2 mM ascorbate, 2 mM Na pyruvate, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. 100 nM apamin was included to block the SK K<sup>+</sup> channel. The patch pipette contained 135 mM KCl, 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis (B-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub> Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 5 mM creatine phosphate, 10 mM HEPES, and 5 mM ascorbate. For isolation of the calcium current and for capacitance measurements, KCl was replaced with 90 mM CsCl and 15 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA). Additionally, 3 mM CsCl was added to the external solution to block inward rectifier currents.</p>
<p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were elicited using standard technology including axopatch 200b amplifier, an A/D, D/A board (IOTech) driven by JClamp software (SciSoft). The various conductances were grossly separated using specific voltage protocols as outlined below.</p>
<p>For characterizing the delayed rectifier currents IDR, cells were voltage clamped at -69 mV and stepped in 10 mV increments for 400 ms between -94 mV and 24 mV. Activation curves were generated from the tail current responses using peak current at 3 ms following the end of the step. To convert from current to conductance we assayed reversal potential using a protocol that held the cell at -89 mV for 10 ms, stepped to 14mV for 250 ms and then stepped between -116 mV and 14 mV in 5 mV increments for 50 ms after which it returned to -89 mV. A plot of peak current against voltage during the 5 mV incremental steps allows for estimation of the reversal potential. From this protocol, the reverse potential is estimated at -73 mV.</p>
<p>We used IKL to define type I hair cells. The absence of IKL and the presence of IH were used to define non-type I, and thus a type II, hair cell phenotype. We did not assess IH in the presence of IKL.</p>
<p>Characterization of IKL involved voltage-clamping cells at -89 mV, stepping to -124 mV for 250 ms and then stepping between -124 mV and -45 mV in 5 mV increments for 150 ms. A trace showing the classical deactivation of the IKL is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s007">S7F Fig</xref>. Plots of peak current versus voltage step were generated and converted to conductance plots after the reversal potential was identified from a protocol where a cell was voltage-clamped at -89 mV depolarized to -69 mV for 250 ms and then stepped between -124 and -41 mV in 5 mV for 150 ms, returning then to -89 mV. From this protocol, the reverse potential is estimated at -73 mV.</p>
<p>For characterizing the inward rectifier current IH, cells were voltage clamped at -69 mV, hyperpolarized between -74 and -156 mV for 400 ms, and then back to -69 mV. Current-voltage plots were generated for maximal current elicited during hyperpolarization. These were converted to conductance plots by obtaining reversal potentials using a protocol that voltage-clamped a cell at -104 mV for 500 ms and then stepped between -120 and -55 mV for 5 ms, at which time it returned to -84 mV. Current-voltage plots identified the reversal potential that allowed for conductance estimates as shown in the text. From this protocol, the reverse potential is estimated at -62 mV.</p>
<p>From conductance-voltage plots of IDR, we found values for maximal conductance, half-activation voltage and slope of the Boltzmann function using methods detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000326.s007">S7 Fig</xref>. Similar methods were used for IH and IKL.</p>
<p>Calcium currents were isolated by replacing potassium with a cesium-based intracellular solution using a protocol that voltage-clamped the hair cell at -69 mV and stepped for 10 ms between -69 mV and 26 mV in 10 mV increments. Current-voltage plots were generated from peak current responses and maximal current and half activating voltage were extracted from these plots.</p>
<p>To assess functional activity of presynaptic sites, vesicle fusion was monitored using a dual sine wave technique as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000326.ref040">40</xref>]. Hair cells were depolarized to the voltage of maximal calcium current for 3 seconds, and changes in capacitance were monitored in real time. The sine wave amplitude was 30 mV and the frequencies selected were 6250 and 3125 Hz. Protocols were run after 10 minutes to ensure equilibration of internal solution and stabilization of calcium currents.</p>
