<p>Manipulation of yeast cell polarity by external electric fields reveals electrochemical pathways that influence the distribution of membrane lipids and the polarity regulator Cdc4p.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Cells are naturally surrounded by organized electrical signals in the form of local ion fluxes, membrane potential, and electric fields (EFs) at their surface. Although the contribution of electrochemical elements to cell polarity and migration is beginning to be appreciated, underlying mechanisms are not known. Here we show that an exogenous EF can orient cell polarization in budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) cells, directing the growth of mating projections towards sites of hyperpolarized membrane potential, while directing bud emergence in the opposite direction, towards sites of depolarized potential. Using an optogenetic approach, we demonstrate that a local change in membrane potential triggered by light is sufficient to direct cell polarization. Screens for mutants with altered EF responses identify genes involved in transducing electrochemical signals to the polarity machinery. Membrane potential, which is regulated by the potassium transporter Trk1p, is required for polarity orientation during mating and EF response. Membrane potential may regulate membrane charges through negatively charged phosphatidylserines (PSs), which act to position the Cdc42p-based polarity machinery. These studies thus define an electrochemical pathway that directs the orientation of cell polarization.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The ability of cells to orient towards spatial cues is critical for processes such as migration, wound healing, and development. Although the role of electrochemical signals is well characterized in processes such as neuronal signaling, their function in cell polarity is much less understood or appreciated. Application of exogenous electric fields can direct cell polarization in many cell types, and electric fields of similar magnitude surround cells and tissues naturally. However, the significance and mechanism of these responses remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) as a powerful model system to study electrochemical regulation of cell polarity. We show that application of electric fields causes budding yeast to polarize in particular directions. We begin to identify key proteins involved in this response, which implicate an electrochemical pathway involving membrane potential, membrane charge, and an ion channel, which ultimately regulate the central polarity factor Cdc42p. These key proteins are not only needed for response to electric fields, but also contribute to cell polarity more generally. To test whether a change in membrane potential is sufficient to control cell polarization, we introduce a light-sensitive ion channel into yeast and show that we can now control the site of polarization simply by using a focused laser beam. Thus, our study shows that electrochemical regulation is an integral component of cell polarity pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell polarization arises from the asymmetric accumulation of cellular components near a region of the plasma membrane. Although the roles of polarity proteins such as small GTPases and cytoskeletal elements have been studied extensively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Drubin1">[1]</xref>, much less is known about the possible contribution of electrochemical elements. Recent studies identifying certain ion transporters in regulating processes such as cell migration and polarized cell growth indicate potential roles of local pH, ion fluxes, and membrane potentials at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Campetelli1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Chang1">[8]</xref>. How these elements interface with established modules of polarity networks remains to be defined.</p>
<p>The importance of electricity in cell polarization is illustrated by the ability of electric fields (EFs) to direct cell polarization. It has been appreciated for decades that most cells—ranging from bacteria, fungi, and amoebas to animal cells—are electrotactic, and robustly orient polarity, migration, or division to applied exogenous EFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Sun1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Bonazzi1">[14]</xref>. EFs of similar intensities as those used in these experiments naturally surround cells in tissues, and even individual cells such as fungal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Zhao1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Jaffe1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Kropf1">[16]</xref>. The physiological relevance of endogenous EFs has been demonstrated in fungal infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-vanWest1">[17]</xref>, immune cell response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Lin1">[18]</xref>, wound healing, regeneration, and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Levin1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Zhao1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Hotary1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Zhao2">[20]</xref>. These findings have led to the proposal that in addition to responding to chemical and mechanical signals, cells may also be responding to endogenous electrotactic signals to guide cell polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Zhao2">[20]</xref>. The response of cells to exogenous EFs provides a powerful tool to study electrochemical elements in cell polarization.</p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms of cell polarity are currently best understood in the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Polarized cell growth in these cells is tightly controlled by intrinsic and extrinsic spatial cues. Haploid budding yeast cells display an axial budding pattern, in which new buds form adjacent to previous bud sites, while diploid cells exhibit a bipolar pattern, in which buds emerge at sites of previous division or growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Drubin2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Chang2">[22]</xref>. During mating, cells of opposite mating type polarize towards each other in response to gradients of secreted pheromones; exogenous application of the pheromone α-factor causes cells to grow a mating projection, forming a pear-shaped “shmoo.” The core polarity machinery required for both bud and shmoo formation is organized around  the small GTPase Cdc42p, which coordinates actin assembly and exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Chant1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Nern1">[25]</xref>. Bud site selection is specified by a Ras-like protein Rsr1p and its regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Chant1">[23]</xref>. During mating, these spatial cues used to direct budding are turned off, so that cells can polarize towards the mating partner. This reorientation of polarity involves Far1p and its interactions with the receptor-coupled Gβ protein and Cdc42 GEF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Nern1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Nern2">[27]</xref>. As demonstrated by mutants affected in the regulation of only shmoos or only budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Chant1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Evangelista1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Chenevert1">[29]</xref>, there are specific molecular differences in the mechanisms governing budding and shmoo polarity. In general, still little is appreciated about electrochemical aspects of cell polarization in this cell type.</p>
<p>Here, we show that cell polarity can be directed by exogenous EFs in budding yeast. Although EFs have been shown to direct polarized growth in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Minc1">[13]</xref> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Brand1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Brand2">[31]</xref>, there have been no reports to date in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We find that although EFs do not appear to affect wild-type (WT) budding cells, they do have robust effects on cells in the presence of pheromone and on mutants defective in bud site selection. We find a potassium channel and membrane lipid charges as components mediating EF responses. We further show, using a light-activated rhodopsin, that local membrane potential itself is capable of directing polarization. Our results demonstrate the importance of electrochemical signaling in cell polarity and begin to define mechanistically how they contribute to polarized cell growth.</p>

<title>Electrotactic Responses of Budding Yeast Polarity</title>
<p>We tested whether exogenous EFs can influence cell polarization in budding yeast. Yeast cells were grown in the presence of EFs in microfluidic channels, which allow for defined EF lines and heat control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Minc1">[13]</xref>. Haploid WT cells were mostly resistant to EF effects and budded at their normal axial position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). The bud site selection mutant <italic>rsr1</italic>Δ forms buds in random directions, in the absence of EF. In the EF, however, almost all new buds emerged at the cathode-facing side of the <italic>rsr1</italic>Δ cells after 1 h of exposure to an EF of 50 V/cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s011">Movie S1</xref>). Cells did not exhibit any major signs of stress, cell death, or stress pathway activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Ferrigno1">[32]</xref>, but grew with slightly reduced growth rates and prolonged cell cycle length as controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Cathodal bud orientation displayed dose dependence on EF intensity and duration of application (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s002">Figure S2A and S2C</xref>). Diploid WT cells also polarized towards the cathode significantly more than WT haploids; this may reflect a less stringent regulation of budding pattern in diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the EF was not able to efficiently override the normal spatial cues involved in axial budding, but could direct bud site polarization if these cues were absent or weak.</p>

<p>The application of EFs also directed the site of shmoo tip formation but, surprisingly, in the opposite direction. In the presence of uniform concentrations of α-factor and an EF, budding yeast cells showed a strong polarization towards the anode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g001">Figures 1C, 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s002">Figure S1S2B, S2D, and S2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s012">Movie S2</xref>). Changing the EF direction induced the formation of a second shmoo tip towards the new anode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s013">Movie S3</xref>). To rule out possible effects of adding mating factor exogenously, we also noted similar effects in mating pairs of cells. The EF disrupted mating and caused cells to polarize towards the anode of the EF instead of towards each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g001">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s002">S2F</xref>). Cells that were induced to shmoo without external pheromones, by overexpressing Ste4p, the β subunit of the G protein involved in pheromone response, also polarized toward the anode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Whiteway1">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s014">Movies S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s015">S5</xref>). Thus, although bud and shmoo formation use many of the same components of the polarity machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Drubin2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Chang2">[22]</xref>, there is a striking difference in directionality (cathodal versus anodal) for how budding and shmooing yeasts respond to EFs.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>EF Response Involves the Cdc42p-Based Polarity Machinery</title>
<p>We next tested whether cell polarization in response to EF requires the same polarity machinery normally used in budding or shmooing. The highly conserved small GTPase Cdc42p was required to polarize buds and shmoos in the absence or presence of the EF, as assessed with the loss-of-function mutant allele <italic>cdc42-118</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g002">Figures 2A, 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s003">S3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Kozminski1">[34]</xref>. In addition, mutants specifically defective in establishing polarity during mating but not budding, such as <italic>bem1-s1</italic> (a point mutant in the scaffold protein Bem1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Chenevert1">[29]</xref>) and the formin null mutant <italic>bni1</italic>Δ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Evangelista1">[28]</xref>, showed similar polarization defects in the absence or presence of the EF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g002">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s003">S3B, and S3E</xref>). Imaging GFP-Cdc42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-WedlichSoldner1">[35]</xref> and the associated components Cdc24-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Nern3">[36]</xref> (a GEF for Cdc42p) and Bem1-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Butty2">[37]</xref> revealed that polarity caps assembled and oriented to the EF prior to bud or shmoo emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g002">Figure 2C–2E</xref>). Bem1-GFP cap assembly was dependent on Cdc42p in the presence or absence of EF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s003">Figure S3C and S3D</xref>). Actin also appeared to similarly mediate cell polarization in both instances. In budding cells, actin was dispensable for EF-induced Bem1-GFP cap cathodal orientation, although actin depolymerization appeared to accelerate polar cap accumulation at the cathodal side. In shmooing cells, actin inhibition caused rapid disappearance of the cap in the presence or absence of the EF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Nern2">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g002">Figures 2D, 2F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s003">S3F</xref>). Together, these data show that the EF acts in reorienting polarized cell growth through the normal polarity machinery, including Cdc42p and its regulators.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These are the first studies, to our knowledge, showing the input of membrane electrochemistry in the regulation of cell polarity in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We find that EFs direct the site of bud formation and mating projections in different directions. Our optogenetic experiments further show that in shmooing cells, local hyperpolarization of membrane potential is actually sufficient for polarity reorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002029-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The mating defects of <italic>trk1</italic>Δ and <italic>cho1</italic>Δ mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Fairn1">[58]</xref>, for instance, demonstrate that this pathway contributes to cell polarization even in the absence of EFs. Our results suggest a model in which the asymmetric segregation of Trk1p and possibly other transporters produces positive charges at the back of the cell and negative charges on PS lipids at the front of the cell, which promotes the polarized distribution of Cdc42. In the absence of EFs, the asymmetry of Trk1p localization may arise from initial polarization of membrane insertion. These electrochemical pathways may thus represent a positive feedback loop that stabilizes the axis of Cdc42-based polarity for chemotropism.</p>

<p>(A) During normal cell polarization, electrochemical layers segregate to the front and the back of the cell and may influence polarization processes, for instance during mating. (B) In an EF, the anode-facing side has hyperpolarized membrane potential, which drives anodal growth of the shmoos, in a Trk1-, Cho1<italic>-</italic>, and Far1-dependent manner. The secondary default orientation mode appears to be the cathodal orientation, which drives bud emergence and shmoo growth in <italic>trk1</italic>Δ, <italic>cho1</italic>Δ, and <italic>far1-s</italic> mutants by a yet unknown mechanism.

<p>A surprising finding of this study is the different behavior of budding versus shmooing cells. Although these polarization systems share downstream polarity regulators, we found clear differences in the requirement for upstream electrochemical elements. <italic>rsr1</italic>Δ cells bud towards the cathode, while the same strain shmoos towards the anode. Mutations in Far1, Cdc24, Trk1, and Cho1 all cause cells to shmoo in an abnormal direction in response to EF and have mating defects in the absence of EF, but have little or no effect on bud site selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Nern2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Fairn1">[58]</xref>. The cathodal orientation of budding cells in EFs suggests that buds originate at sites of depolarized TMP. However, genetic and optogenetic analysis demonstrate that they may not be dependent on gradients of membrane potential or PS levels, suggesting that regulation of bud site selection is determined by a distinct mechanism. Although it is not yet known what elements act upstream of Cdc42p to drive cathodal growth, a plausible hypothesis is that EFs may localize some charged membrane proteins by direct electrophoresis, as suggested in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Minc1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Allen1">[40]</xref>. The EF thus causes a tug-of-war between two competitive pathways that steer polarity in different directions, with the anodal one being dominant in response to mating factors.</p>
<p>The observed responses of cells to exogenously applied EFs lead to a question of whether EFs normally contribute to polarity regulation. Tissues and even individual polarized cells are surrounded by EFs, which may arise from asymmetries in ion transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Nuccitelli1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Nuccitelli2">[65]</xref>. We speculate that fungi may respond to their own EFs, possibly during mating, in the context of fungal communities such as biofilms, and in their natural environment to guide them during invasion of host tissues, for instance. It would be interesting to examine the role of genes such as Trk1 on various fungal behaviors.</p>
<p>Mechanisms of electrochemical regulation of cell polarity are likely conserved. Our data are consistent with recent findings implicating a similar set of actors in fission yeast, neutrophils, keratocytes, and slime molds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Sun1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Zhao1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Sato1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Minc1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Allen1">[40]</xref>. Fission yeasts respond to EFs by orienting their growth axis perpendicular to the EF, producing bent morphologies. Cdc42, formins, and the Pma1 proton pump at the plasma membrane are identified as critical elements. Pma1 affects cell polarity and actin assembly even in the absence of exogenous EFs, indicating a role for membrane potential and intracellular pH in regulating normal tip growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Minc1">[13]</xref>. Migrating neutrophils, keratocytes, and slime molds orient migration to exogenous EFs, possibly through effects on membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Zhao1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Gao1">[66]</xref>.

For shmooing experiments with saturating pheromones, 50 µM of α-factor was added to the medium, and cells were placed in the channel 30 min prior to EF application. Because of their slow growth, <italic>cho1</italic>Δ cells were placed in the channel 1 h prior to EF application. Reservoirs connecting electrodes to the channels contained 4% agarose blocks made of medium, which protect cells in the channel from potentially toxic products emanating from the electrodes. Electrodes connected to a generator were immersed in liquid medium added on top of the reservoirs. In these conditions, growth rate and cell cycle periods were almost unaffected, and no significant stress was induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Optogenetics</title>
<p>The optogenetic assay used a 535-nm laser, with a power of ∼5 mW, interfaced with an iLas system (Roper Scientific) mounted on a confocal spinning disk and a 63× objective. This allowed irradiation of multiple regions of interest (of 20×20 px<sup>2</sup>) in a given field of view. Cells were placed on a 2% agar pad containing 20 µM of all-trans retinal and 50 µM of α-factor for shmooing experiments. Cells were put on the pad 30 min prior to laser excitation. The laser was turned on for a continuous period of 20 min, and the cells were subsequently filmed for 2 h to monitor polarized growth. Laser exposure did not induce major changes in growth rate or stress levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s008">Figure S8A–S8C</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantitative Mating Assays</title>
<p>Efficiency of mating in <italic>trk1</italic>Δ mutants was assayed by quantitative counting of mating diploids. WT Mat α (AC 131), WT Mat a (AC 129), and <italic>trk1</italic>Δ Mat a (AC 31) cells were grown to mid-log phase in YPD medium and concentrated to 10 OD/ml; WT Mat α cells were incubated at a 10∶1 ratio with target WT or <italic>trk1</italic>Δ Mat a cells, and collected into a soft pellet by centrifugation. After 4 h of mating at 30 °C, cells were suspended in liquid YPD, and serial dilutions were plated on medium selective for diploids. Mating efficiency was compared between WT and <italic>trk1</italic>Δ by counting the number of diploid colonies obtained at different dilutions. About 500 colonies were counted for each condition, and the assay was repeated twice.</p>
<p>In addition to this assay, we also counted the number of genuine zygotes by microscopy after 4 h of mating. To this aim, WT Mat α, WT Mat a, and <italic>trk1</italic>Δ Mat a cells were grown in YPD liquid medium to mid-log phase and concentrated to 10 OD/ml. WT Mat α cells were stained with calcofluor for 5 min, subsequently rinsed with YPD, and incubated at a 10∶1 ratio with target WT or <italic>trk1</italic>Δ Mat a cells. A 10-µl drop of each mixture was then spotted onto a YPD plate and incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. The mixtures were then imaged on a microscope, and mating efficiency was computed as the ratio of genuine zygotes to the total number of Mat α cells in the field of view. About 500 cells were counted for each condition, and the assay was repeated twice. This assay yielded a mating efficiency in the <italic>trk1</italic>Δ of about 30% of the WT.</p>

<title>Budding Patterns</title>
<p>To test the role of Trk1p in axial budding, we generated a <italic>trk1</italic>Δ strain in the W303 background with a WT copy of the BUD4 gene (AC 134). Cells were then grown to mid-log phase in YPD medium and stained with calcofluor for 5 min to mark bud scars. Axially budding cells were counted when more than three scars were clustered at one site on the surface.</p>

<title>Chemotropism Efficiency in Zygotes</title>
<p>To compare the efficiency of chemotropism in WT versus <italic>trk1</italic>Δ cells, we used a previously described assay that takes advantage of the fact that WT cells grow towards their mating partners irrespective of previous bud site selection, while mutants with defective mating polarity (like <italic>far1-s</italic> or <italic>cdc24-m</italic>) use bud site selection cues to grow shmoos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Follette1">[74]</xref>. WT Mat α, WT Mat a, and <italic>trk1</italic>Δ Mat a cells were grown in YPD liquid medium to mid-log phase and concentrated to 10 OD/ml. WT Mat a and <italic>trk1</italic>Δ Mat a cells were stained with calcofluor for 5 min, subsequently rinsed with YPD, and incubated at a 1∶1 ratio with target WT Mat α cells. A 10-µl drop of each mixture was then spotted onto a YPD plate and incubated for 4 h at 30°C. The mixtures were then imaged to assess the position of the bud scar relative to the fusion site in each newly formed zygote. Only zygotes with a single fluorescent bud scar were counted. Zygotes were scored as proximal if the bud scar was in the one-third of the cell adjacent to the fusion site, medial for the middle one-third, and distal for the one-third away from the fusion site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002029.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Membrane Potential Measurement</title>
<p>To measure global membrane potential in single budding yeast cells, we used the membrane potential dye DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3) (Invitrogen), which absorbs in blue light and depicts increased membrane fluorescence upon membrane depolarization, with a sensitivity of nearly 1% per millivolt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Inaba1">[7]</xref>. Cells were incubated with a concentration of 50 µM dye for 30 min, and images were taken on a confocal spinning disk. Relative membrane potential values were then quantified as membrane signal subtracted from background signal. To assess membrane hyperpolarization by Halorhodopsin, cells were immobilized at the bottom of a microfluidic chamber, between a dialysis membrane and the coverslip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002029-Charvin1">[75]</xref>. Cells expressing Halorhodopsin-GFP were bleached by long-time exposure with a blue laser. Medium was subsequently exchanged with YPD containing 50 µM DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3) dye, and the dye was left to stain the cells for 30 min. Dye staining intensity at the membrane was then measured in the same pre-bleached cells at two consecutive time points spaced by 3 min (<italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub>) to compute dye photo-bleaching. These cells were then exposed to the yellow laser for 3 min, and the final dye staining was computed again (<italic>I</italic><sub>2</sub>). The specific loss of dye staining associated with Halorhodopsin effects on membrane potential was then computed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002029.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is expected to be negative for membrane hyperpolarization and positive for membrane depolarization.</p>
