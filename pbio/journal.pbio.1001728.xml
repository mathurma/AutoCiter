<abstract>
<p>Eukaryotic cells utilize an arsenal of processive transport systems to deliver macromolecules to specific subcellular sites. In prokaryotes, such transport mechanisms have only been shown to mediate gliding motility, a form of microbial surface translocation. Here, we show that the motility function of the <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> Agl-Glt machinery results from the recent specialization of a versatile class of bacterial transporters. Specifically, we demonstrate that the Agl motility motor is modular and dissociates from the rest of the gliding machinery (the Glt complex) to bind the newly expressed Nfs complex, a close Glt paralogue, during sporulation. Following this association, the Agl system transports Nfs proteins directionally around the spore surface. Since the main spore coat polymer is secreted at discrete sites around the spore surface, its transport by Agl-Nfs ensures its distribution around the spore. Thus, the Agl-Glt/Nfs machineries may constitute a novel class of directional bacterial surface transporters that can be diversified to specific tasks depending on the cognate cargo and machinery-specific accessories.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many living cells use processive cytoskeletal motors to transport proteins and subcellular organelles to specific subcellular sites. In bacteria, this type of transport has yet to be identified and it is generally thought that random protein collisions underlie most biochemical processes. In recent years, our view of the bacterial cell was changed by the discovery of subcellular compartmentalization and a cytoskeleton, suggesting that processive motors might also operate in prokaryotes. We previously characterized a mechanism of intracellular transport that drives cell motility across solid surfaces in the gram-negative bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>. Since the transport apparatus was also found in bacterial species that do not move on surfaces, we postulated that intracellular transport underlies other cellular processes in bacteria. Indeed, we show here that the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> motility motor can be adapted to transport sporulation-specific proteins around the nascent spore surface. Because the transported proteins are linked to the main spore coat, this motion assists the assembly of a protective spore coat. In conclusion, the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> motility/sporulation transport machinery defines an emerging class of versatile transport systems, suggesting that processive transport has been overlooked and may well orchestrate many processes in bacteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, motor-assisted intracellular transport regulates fundamental cellular processes including cell division, macromolecule secretion, and cell migration. Because of its small size, the bacterial cell has long been considered to be a disordered compartment where biochemical reactions and cellular processes are governed by diffusion-driven random collisions. However, in recent years, it has become clear that bacteria are highly organized and contain a complex cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Gitai1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Shapiro1">[2]</xref>. Despite the identification of bacterial counterparts of actin, tubulin, and intermediate filaments, processive cytoskeletal motors akin to myosin, kinesin, or dynein have yet to be found in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-IngersonMahar1">[3]</xref>. Previously, while studying a mechanism of surface motility in <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>, we have shown that the motility machinery consists of a new type of processive transport system (Agl-Glt) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Sun1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>. Phylogenomic studies suggested that the motility function of the Agl-Glt machinery emerged from the recent specialization of an older system, predicting that bacterial Agl-Glt–like transporters may be adapted to other functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>. Here, we show that in the same bacterium, Agl, the motor component of Agl-Glt machinery, forms a second transport system that propels spore coat assembly proteins during sporulation. This finding suggests that a previously overseen type of bacterial surface transport can be adapted to mediate very different cellular tasks in prokaryotes.</p>
<p><italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells move across solid surfaces by a process termed gliding (A)-motility where surface translocation occurs in the absence of extracellular organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mauriello1">[6]</xref>. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made to elucidate the motility mechanism with the first identification of the motility machinery and the tracking of its localization in live gliding cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Zhang1">[7]</xref>. The motility machinery consists of a molecular motor, Agl (AglR, Q, and S), a three subunit flagellar-type proton channel that assembles in the bacterial inner membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Sun1">[4]</xref>. During motility, the Agl motor harvests the proton motive force (pmf) to move directionally along a looped continuous path spanning the entire cell length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Nan1">[8]</xref>. Helical trafficking of the motor may occur through a connection with the actin-like MreB cytoskeleton on the cytosolic side <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Nan1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mauriello2">[9]</xref>. In the cell envelope, mechanical work from the motor is transduced to the cell surface by the Glt (<bold>Gl</bold>iding <bold>t</bold>ransducer, GltA–K) complex through a direct interaction involving AglR and GltG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Nan2">[10]</xref>. Transported Glt proteins produce thrust when the machinery comes in contact with the underlying substrate at areas termed focal adhesions (FAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Sun1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Nan3">[11]</xref>. How exactly the Glt proteins contact the substrate is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Zhang1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Kaimer1">[12]</xref>, but adhesion is facilitated by slime, a yet undefined sugar polysaccharide specifically bound by the outermost components of the motility machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Ducret1">[13]</xref>. Thus, the Agl-Glt machinery may be viewed as a modular transport system where an active transport unit (Agl) combines with a specific cargo (Glt) to propel the cells on surfaces.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the <italic>glt</italic> genes are paralogous to the <italic>nfs</italic> (necessary for sporulation, <italic>nfsA–H</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g001">Figure 1</xref>) genes involved in assembly of the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> spore coat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Muller1">[14]</xref>. Bacterial sporulation is a stress-induced differentiation leading to the formation of highly resistant quiescent cell types. In the model bacteria <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp., a spore is formed after elaboration of a complex proteinaceous outer shell, called the spore coat. However, the coat proteins and assembly mechanisms are unrelated (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Higgins1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-McCormick1">[16]</xref>). <italic>Myxococcus</italic> spores are formed following starvation in multicellular fruiting bodies. During multicellular development, the initiating signals have not been identified, but sporulation can be conveniently induced <italic>in vitro</italic> by the addition of glycerol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Muller1">[14]</xref>. Glycerol-induced spores display certain morphological differences compared to fruiting body spores (e.g., the absence of the outermost protein cuticula) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Lee1">[17]</xref>, but they also share many similarities: resistance to heat and sonic disruption as well as germination. Contrary to <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spores, the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> spore coat is mostly composed of two carbohydrates, N-acetyl-galactosamine and glucose, in a molar ratio of 3∶1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Kottel1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Sutherland1">[19]</xref>. The exact structure of the spore coat polymer(s) is unknown, and glucose molecules may form an alpha 1,3-glycan chain independently from the N-acetyl-galactosamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Kottel1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Sutherland1">[19]</xref>. Recently, a locus of nine genes, named <italic>exoA–I</italic>, has been shown to be essential for spore coat synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>. Annotation of <italic>exoA–I</italic> indicates that the main spore coat polymer is likely a capsular-type polysaccharide, exported by an outer membrane Wza-like translocon (the ExoA protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>. For simplicity, the <italic>exo</italic>-dependent spore coat polymer will be named Exo throughout the rest of this article. <italic>Myxococcus</italic> sporulation is a stepwise process. During the first step of sporulation, the peptidoglycan (PG) layer is seemingly degraded, an MreB-dependent process, which leads to cell rounding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>. Subsequently, the Exo polymer is exported by ExoA and deposited around the collapsed inner and outer membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>. Tight wrapping of Exo around the spore membranes requires the Nfs complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>. How exactly the Nfs system promotes spore coat assembly is unknown and is addressed in this article.</p>

<p>The Glt and Nfs proteins are highly similar and seem to associate with extracellular sugar polymers (slime and Exo, respectively). Thus, starting from the premise that both systems share similar operating principles, we investigated the function of Nfs in spore coat assembly. Doing so, we discovered that following the onset of sporulation, the Agl motility motor dissociates from the Glt complex and becomes recruited to the Nfs complex to transport it around the spore membranes. We further show that following its secretion at discrete sites around the spore surface, the Exo polymer is recruited by mobile Nfs units, suggesting that the Agl-Nfs machinery constructs the coat by wrapping Exo strands around the cell surface. We conclude that the Agl-Glt/Nfs machineries constitute a versatile class of active surface transport machineries that may carry out multiple functions in bacterial cell surface organization.</p>

<title>The Nfs and Glt Complexes Are Paralogous Complexes</title>
<p>A recent phylogenetic study showed that the <italic>glt</italic> and <italic>nfs</italic> genes likely arose from the recent duplication of a single gene system in one of the terminal branches of the deltaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>. Thus, the Nfs and Glt proteins are paralogues, and when predictable, protein domains are systematically conserved between Nfs and Glt proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s015">Table S1</xref>). The <italic>nfs</italic> complex consists of eight genes, <italic>nfsA–H</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), respectively, homologous to <italic>gltA–H</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s015">Table S1</xref>). Nfs is therefore predicted to be a somewhat simpler assemblage, missing paralogues to GltI, J, and K. Gene synteny is maintained between the <italic>nfs</italic> and <italic>glt</italic> clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Of note, however, <italic>gltA–C</italic> and <italic>gltD–H</italic> form two distinct genomic clusters, but the <italic>nfsA–H</italic> genes are clustered in a single genomic region, possibly forming an operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>. Consistent with the notion that the <italic>nfs</italic> genes form a complex in the spore membrane, all <italic>nfs</italic> genes are essential for sporulation and their products localize to the cell envelope (tested for NfsA, B, C, D, E, and G and predicted for NfsF and H) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>, like their <italic>glt</italic> counterpart (tested for GltD, E, F, G, and H and predicted for GltA, B, C, J, and K) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Nan2">[10]</xref>. Therefore, we predict that the Nfs proteins assemble a Glt-like membrane sporulation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>aglRQS</italic> and <italic>nfs</italic> Are Part of a Sporulation Pathway</title>
<p>Previous works showed that Glt promotes motility in association with the Agl motor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Sun1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Nan1">[8]</xref>. Therefore, although Nfs might be functional on its own, its function may also require an Agl-like motor. Reasoning that each complex may have its own dedicated motor, we tested whether the <italic>MXAN_3003–5</italic> genes, which encode the only additional complete set of Agl homologues in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and are dispensable for motility, are required for sporulation like the <italic>nfs</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>. Because <italic>nfs</italic> mutants are defective for sporulation whether they are extracted from fruiting bodies or after glycerol-induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Muller1">[14]</xref>, we measured sporulation after glycerol induction throughout this study. Under these conditions, a mutant carrying an in-frame deletion in the <italic>MXAN_3004</italic> gene (the <italic>aglQ</italic> homologue) formed perfectly viable spores, indicating that the putative MXAN_3003–5 motor does not play a significant role in sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>We next tested whether AglRQS itself may be required for sporulation. Strikingly, the <italic>aglR</italic>, <italic>aglQ</italic>, and <italic>aglS</italic> mutants all showed a severe sporulation defect, comparable to the sporulation defects of the <italic>nfsD</italic> mutant and the <italic>exoA</italic> mutant lacking the Wza homologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). An <italic>aglQ<sub>D28N</sub></italic> point mutant, carrying a substitution in the AglRQS channel previously shown to abolish proton conductance and to paralyze the Agl-Glt motility machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Sun1">[4]</xref>, also failed to sporulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, the AglRQS complex and, importantly, its proton-conducting activity are required for both motility and sporulation.</p>

<title><italic>aglRQS</italic> Are Required for Spore Coat Assembly</title>
<p>In the <italic>nfs</italic> mutants, the sporulation program is correctly initiated following glycerol induction: the cells round up and the Exo polymer is produced and exported to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>. However, in absence of Nfs, Exo is loosely attached to the spore surface, which results in loss of cell integrity and abortive sporulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>. By Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), we also observed a thin and complex electron dense layer around the membranes of WT spores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref>, suggesting the presence of a spore coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

On WT spores, GSL-I staining decorated the entire surface with occasional brighter dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, as expected if the spore coat was loosely attached, GSL-I staining of <italic>aglQ</italic> and <italic>nfsD</italic> mutants was not compact around the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s001">S1</xref>). Taken together, the TEM and lectin-staining experiments suggest that a function of the Agl-Nfs machinery is to promote the formation of a compact spore coat layer around the spore membrane.

<title>A Genetic Switch Activates the Agl-Nfs Machinery at the Onset of Sporulation</title>
<p><italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells do not complete the sporulation process when spotted directly on an agar pad atop a microscope slide. Thus, to monitor sporulation by live microscopy and elucidate how the Agl-Nfs machinery drives spore coat assembly, we developed a microfluidic chamber assay where cells are immobilized and sporulate in liquid directly on the microscope stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s002">Figure S2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s010">Movie S1</xref>).

<title>The AglRQS Motor Rotates the Nfs Complex Around the Spore Surface</title>
<p>In sharp contrast to the focal localization of AglQ during motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Sun1">[4]</xref>, AglQ-sfGFP accumulated circumferentially all around the spore membrane throughout the sporulation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). However, when we analyzed the localization of NfsD-mCherry, we found that this protein covered the entire cell surface during the initial stage of sporulation but later formed fluorescent-bright clusters at the end of the cell-rounding phase, a sporulation stage where the Nfs complex would be expected to become active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In time-lapse experiments, the NfsD-mCherry foci were observed to move in orbital trajectories around the spore surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s011">Movie S2</xref>). Orbital trajectories could be captured both when the microscope focal plane was set to the middle or to the top of a sporulating cell, showing that NfsD rotates all around the spore circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4Ai and 4Aii</xref>). Rotating NfsD-mCherry clusters could be tracked for distances between 3/4 and up to a full spore circumference, suggesting a high level of directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figures 4Ai</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s005">S5</xref>). To measure the movement parameters of NfsD-mCherry precisely, we designed a computational method to measure the distance traveled by NfsD-mCherry foci at subpixel resolution. Moreover, since sporulating cells are spherical, the distance that separates two clusters at distinct times is not the euclidian distance but the orthodromic distance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Orthodromic distances traveled by NfsD-mCherry clusters were thus calculated for each time point by projection (see Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This analysis revealed that NfsD-mCherry foci moved at instantaneous speeds ranging from 0.1–0.3 µm.min<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Movement was clearly directional because (i) the distance to the origin increased over the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and (ii) NfsD-mCherry movements could be described by a Mean Square Displacement (MSD) over time that increased by 4<italic>Dt+v<sup>2</sup>t<sup>2</sup></italic> relation (with <italic>v</italic> the mean velocity, <italic>v</italic> = 0.12±0.05 µm.min<sup>−1</sup>, and <italic>D</italic> the apparent diffusion coefficient, <italic>D</italic> = 0.012±0.007 µm<sup>2</sup>.min<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>To test whether Exo is the terminal cargo of the Agl-Nfs machinery, we stained NsfD-mCherry–expressing spores with GSL-I and imaged each fluorophore simultaneously 4 h after the induction of sporulation. As already mentioned, GSL-I staining covers the entire spore surface but also forms prominent fluorescent clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). When these clusters were imaged by time-lapse, they rotated together with NfsD-mCherry clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s013">Movie S4</xref>).

<title>The Exo Polymer Is Essential for Transport Directionality</title>
<p>What is the mechanism of Nfs transport? In absence of a rigid scaffold (i.e., MreB filaments and the PG), Agl motor units may distribute circumferentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) to transport Nfs proteins from one motor unit to the next, similar to actin filaments being moved by immobilized Myosin motors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Kron1">[24]</xref>. Alternatively and because the Nfs proteins are terminally associated with the Exo polymer, Exo secretion itself could push Nfs proteins around the spore surface in a mechanism reminiscent of PG glycan strand insertion rotating PG synthetic complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-VanTeeffelen1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-DomnguezEscobar1">[27]</xref>. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we tested NfsD-mCherry dynamics in the <italic>exoA</italic> mutant. In the absence of ExoA, several critical features of Nfs transport emerged: (i) NfsD-mCherry clusters formed foci that appeared smaller in <italic>exoA</italic> mutant than in WT cells, suggesting that Exo polymers organize NfsD-mCherry clustering at the spore surface (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4G and A</xref>); and (ii) NfsD-mCherry movement was erratic and characterized by frequent reversals and saltatory motions, suggesting that directionality is lost in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). To test this possibility, we computed the MSD of NfsD-mCherry clusters as a function of time in <italic>exoA</italic> mutant cells and found it to be mostly linear, a characteristic of undirected random motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, the MSD of WT cells is characteristic of directed motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>In the <italic>exoA</italic> mutant, although NfsD-mCherry clusters appear to move randomly, this movement is unlikely to be driven by diffusion alone because many clusters showed short and fast movement phases with burst speeds similar to NfsD-mCherry clusters in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4B,C,G</xref>). These fast movements depend on the activity of the Agl-motor because (i) they were completely abolished by CCCP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s007">Figure S7A</xref>) or in an <italic>exoA aglQ</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figures 4B,C,D,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s007">S7B</xref>) and (ii) the MSD of NfsD-mCherry was constant over time in the <italic>exoA aglQ</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Finally to prove that AglQ-dependent transport can still occur in absence of the Exo polymer, we further tested bead transport in absence in the <italic>exoA</italic> mutant. Similar to the movements of NfsD-mCherry clusters in the <italic>exoA</italic> mutant, bursts of fast bead movements were observed in this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Since movements were completely abolished by the addition of CCCP or in an aglQ mutant background and thus depend on the activity of the Agl motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), all together, these results show that surface movements at the cell surface (Nfs and beads) result from active Agl-dependent transport and not spore coat polymer secretion, which may instead serve to guide motion (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<title>The Exo Export System Localizes at Discrete Sites Around the Spore</title>

Although in general proteobacterial Wzc proteins carry both a transmembrane and a cytosolic BY-kinase domains, in <italic>Myxococcus</italic> the Wzc transmembrane domain and the kinase Wzc domain are carried by two distinct polypeptides (respectively named ExoC and ExoD/BtkA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Kimura1">[28]</xref>, a conformation often found in firmicutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Grangeasse1">[29]</xref>.

We successfully obtained a functional BtkA-sfGFP fusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Consistent with previous expression studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Kimura1">[28]</xref>, BtkA-sfGFP was only expressed following sporulation induction. At 4 h, BtkA-sfGFP formed prominent foci in ≈50% of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g006">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Each cell contained on average 1.7±1 clusters (counted for 305 cells, with a maximum number of clusters of six per cell), all located near the spore membrane suggesting that BtkA-sfGFP is indeed recruited to the export apparatus. Z-sections of 4-h-old spores and 3D reconstructions further revealed that BtkA-sfGFP foci form at discrete sites around the spore periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g006">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s014">Movie S5</xref>).

<title>Agl-Glt/Nfs Machineries Are Surface Transport Systems</title>
<p>In this report, we show that the Agl motility motor is modular and interacts with Glt or Nfs proteins, depending on the growth phase.

Both Agl-Glt and Agl-Nfs interact with extracellular polysaccharides (respectively, slime and the Exo polymer) and the specific function of each system may be linked, at least partially, to the chemical properties of the cognate polymer. For example, motility could be facilitated by the chemical adhesiveness of slime, while the structure of Exo might make it particularly suited to form a coat around the spore membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Phase specific interactions between Agl and Glt/Nfs promote motility or sporulation.</title>
<p>The Agl motor (yellow), a three protein MotAB-like channel harvests the pmf and interacts either with Glt (orange) or Nfs (light blue) to transport slime (red) or the Exo polymer (blue) depending on the growth phase. Both Glt and Nfs are shown spanning the entire cell surface because they both contain predicted inner and outer membrane proteins. The connection between the Glt complex and the MreB cytoskeleton is shown in black. IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane; the PG is not represented because its connection with Glt is unresolved and spores apparently lack PG. In both cases, the transport mechanism remains to be elucidated. In motile cells, the current model proposes that Glt proteins and attached slime (orange-red dots circled in black) traffic along a closed loop helix (grey) and generate propulsion as they interact with the underlying substratum. At the lagging cell pole, the motility complexes become de-activated (orange circles), potentially by removing their connection to slime, which thus becomes deposited on the substrate. In spores, Nfs proteins may associate with Exo polymers following their secretion by the Exo export machinery (green). Distributed Agl motor units could move Exo-linked Nfs complexes from one motor to the next, guided by the Exo polymer.</p>

<p>Since both slime and the Exo polymer are still detected at the cell surface in <italic>agl</italic> mutants, Agl-Glt/Nfs systems are not involved in the synthesis/export of associated sugars. This is particularly clear during sporulation where the synthesis and transport of the Exo polymer is controlled by the <italic>exo</italic> locus. Rather, several lines of evidence suggest that Agl-Glt/Nfs system transport their cognate polymers after export along the cell surface: (i) AglRQS form a flagellar motor-like complex, a predicted pmf-driven motor that interacts both with Glt and Nfs proteins (through a specific interaction between AglR and GltG/NfsG). Accordingly, both the Agl system and the pmf are required for Glt and Nfs movements (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Nan1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Nan3">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano2">[30]</xref>). (ii) Agl exerts transport activity at the surface of motile cells and spores, monitored by addition of polystyrene beads. Transport of slime and Exo was observed directly with fluorescent lectins, and in both cases mobile lectin patches were translocated together with mobile AglQ (slime) and NfsD (Exo) complexes (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Ducret1">[13]</xref>). (iii) During sporulation, secretion of the Exo polymer is not a significant driving force for Nfs movement. Thus, rotation does not result from a pushing action of the Exo polymer, for example, like when MreB-associated PG synthetic complexes are moved circumferentially by the incorporation of new glycan strands in the PG meshwork <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-VanTeeffelen1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-DomnguezEscobar1">[27]</xref>. Importantly, however, transport directionality was lost in absence of Exo polymer secretion. When Agl-Nfs–linked Exo strands become deposited at the spore surface, they could act like a molecular ratchet, preventing motor back steps and restricting Agl-Nfs movements in one dimension. The rigidity of the growing Exo meshwork may also support Nfs movements, especially since MreB and the PG may not be involved or present. In the motility system, slime could perform analogous functions and explain the mysterious directionality of Agl-Glt complexes. Unfortunately this could not be tested because the main slime polymer has not been characterized.</p>
<p>Although it is still unclear how the Agl-Glt machinery accommodates the rigid PG layer during gliding, the situation may be simpler in spores: circumferential AglQ motors may transport Nfs subunits from one motor to the next, fueled by the pmf and guided by linked Exo strands. Testing this mechanism further will require defining the structure of the Exo polymer and its connection with the Nfs proteins.</p>

<title>Spore Coat Assembly by Agl-Nfs</title>
<p>The connection between Agl-Nfs and Exo and the severe spore coat assembly defect observed in <italic>nfs</italic> and <italic>agl</italic> mutants suggests that Agl-Nfs mediates spore coat assembly directly. As discussed above Nfs function can be separated from secretion. Using a BtkA-sfGFP fusion, we localized the Exo secretion apparatus and found it to form a limited number of sites around the spore periphery, suggesting that secretion is spatially constricted. This localization is not surprising because immunolocalization of Wza only suggested that the export apparatus forms discrete sites in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Dong1">[31]</xref>. Thus, a rotary transport complex may be needed to build a homogenous glycan layer all around the spore. Our experiments and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Mller1">[20]</xref> suggest that the activity of Agl-Nfs is necessary to anchor the spore coat polymer at the surface. In this process, scanning Agl-Nfs complexes may capture newly secreted glycan Exo strands and incorporate/deposit them where necessary in the growing spore coat meshwork. This could occur, for example, if a glycosyl transferase activity is linked to the Nfs complex. However, other mechanisms are also possible and more work is needed to understand how Agl-Nfs contributes to spore coat assembly at the molecular level.</p>

<title>Agl-Glt/Nfs Proteins Define a Versatile Class of Transport Systems in Bacteria</title>
<p>The Agl-Glt/Nfs machineries likely evolved by modular expansion of a conserved system of seven proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s009">Figure S9</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>. This “core” system is found as a standalone machinery in many gammaproteobacteria and some deltaproteobacteria, suggesting that it carries function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>. Because the core complex consists of an Agl-like motor and a simplified Nfs/Glt-like apparatus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s009">Figure S9</xref>), this machinery may constitute a basal transport machinery. A survey of Agl-Glt/Nfs-like machineries in the deltaproteobacteria shows that these machineries adopt many potential conformations and therefore may cover a potentially broad functional repertoire (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s009">Figure S9</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>. Functional specialization of Agl-Glt/Nfs machineries may be linked to the type of transported cargo, and thus expansion of the core system in the deltaproteobacteria may have evolved diverse tasks, sugar polymer transport (Nfs and Glt), but also potentially protein and lipid transport. Even though <italic>glt</italic> and <italic>nfs</italic> paralogues have a rather narrow distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Luciano1">[5]</xref>, the Agl motor itself is a member of a ubiquitous family of bacterial motors (Mot/Tol/Exb) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Sun1">[4]</xref>. Therefore, it is conceivable that other motor associations also promote processive transport in bacteria.</p>
<p>Many Agl-Glt/Nfs systems are present in bacteria that are not currently genetically tractable. Computational genetic reconstruction of ancestral assemblages is an emerging powerful means to explore both the function of a macromolecular complex and how it evolved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Finnigan1">[32]</xref>. In future works, the reductive genetic study of the Agl-Glt/Nfs machineries in <italic>Myxococcus</italic> should be instrumental to characterize functional intermediates and test the functional repertoire of these systems. Such study would also allow deciphering the evolution of this complex biological machine with high likelihood, an emerging challenge in evolution biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001728-Abby1">[33]</xref>. Finally, critical traits of the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> lifestyle evolved from the diversification of a single molecular system, showing that modifications of a single genetic system can give rise to profound ecological adaptations.</p>

<p>All image analysis was performed under Image J (NIH).

<title>Subpixel Resolution Tracking of Fluorescent Foci at the Surface of Sporulating Cells</title>
<p>For each experiment, stacks of images were first normalized to correct for background fluctuations over time. If required, the background intensity of phase contrast images was subtracted to optimize auto-thresholding operations. Cell boundary and major and minor axis were detected using a specifically developed plug-in for ImageJ. Briefly, cells were detected using an autothresholding function, and subpixel resolution refined cell contours were obtained using a cubic spline-fitting algorithm. Major axis was deduced from the skeleton and expended in both directions to the most probable point, maximizing the cell-boundary curvature and minimizing the angle between the centerline and the cell boundary. Fluorescent foci were detected using a local and subpixel resolution maxima detection algorithm. The position of each focus is first determined using a polar coordinate system (r, θ), where the radial distance (r) represents the distance from the focus position and the cell center and the angular coordinate (θ) represents the angle formed between the major cell axis and the focus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Since sporulating cells are spherical and NsfD-mCherry foci form close to the cell surface, the polar coordinate system was extended to a 3D spherical coordinate system (p, θ, φ), where the radial distance (p) represents the distance from the cell center to the cell boundary, the angular coordinate (θ) represents the angle formed between the major cell axis and the orthogonal projection of the focus position on the focus plane, and the azimuthal angle (φ) is deduced using the relation φ = arcos(r/p) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001728.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The distance between two points at the surface of a spherical spore of respective spherical coordinates (p1, θ1, φ1) and (p2, θ2, φ2) was deduced from the relation d = p·arcos(cos(θ1) ·cos(φ1) · cos(θ2) · cos(φ2)+sin(θ1) · cos(φ1) · sin(θ2) · cos(φ2)+sin(φ1) · sin(φ2)). By convention, a positive angular coordinate means that the angle θ is measured counterclockwise from the polar axis formed by the major axis.</p>
<p>Fluorescent foci were tracked over time with a specifically developed plug-in for ImageJ. Briefly, cells are tracked with an optimized nearest-neighbor linking algorithm using the polar (r, θ) or the spherical coordinates (p, θ, φ). From foci trajectories, the distance between two temporal points was used to calculate instantaneous speeds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001728-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and combined with the cumulated distance and the distance from the origin to compute the Mean Square Displacement (MSD).
