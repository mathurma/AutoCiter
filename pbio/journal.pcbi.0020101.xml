These transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) have been mathematically described using a Boolean formalism, in which the state of a gene is represented as either transcribed or not transcribed in response to regulatory signals. The Boolean formalism results in a series of regulatory rules for the individual genes of a TRN that in turn can be used to link environmental cues to the transcription state of a genome, thereby forming a complete transcriptional regulatory system (TRS). Herein, we develop a formalism that represents such a set of regulatory rules in a matrix form. Matrix formalism allows for the systemic characterization of the properties of a TRS and facilitates the computation of the transcriptional state of the genome under any given set of environmental conditions. Additionally, it provides a means to incorporate mechanistic detail of a TRS as it becomes available. In this study, the regulatory network matrix, <bold>R</bold>, for a prototypic TRS is characterized and the fundamental subspaces of this matrix are described. We illustrate how the matrix representation of a TRS coupled with its environment (<bold>R*</bold>) allows for a sampling of all possible expression states of a given network, and furthermore, how the fundamental subspaces of the matrix provide a way to study key TRS features and may assist in experimental design.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Complex regulatory networks control the transcription state of a genome that defines the components of a biochemical network. These transcriptional regulatory networks have been mathematically described. The purpose of many such mathematical models is to allow for the prediction of gene expression under a variety of environmental conditions. However, to date, quantitative models have been limited in scope due to a paucity of relevant data, and models of larger networks have been limited in their quantitative predictive power. Herein, Gianchandani and colleagues present a formalism that represents regulatory rules in a matrix form which attempts to address these issues. This matrix formalism allows for the systemic characterization of the properties of a transcriptional regulatory system and facilitates the computation of the transcriptional state of the corresponding genome under any given set of environmental conditions. Additionally, it provides a means to incorporate mechanistic detail of a transcriptional regulatory system as it becomes available. The authors illustrate how this matrix representation allows for a sampling of all possible expression states of a given network and provides a way to study key features.

Consequently, there is an effort under way to reconstruct the TRNs of model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b001">1</xref>]. Because the number of regulated genes and associated regulatory proteins is quite large and their interconnectivity is extensive, there is a significant need for a structured framework to integrate regulatory rules and interrogate TRN functions in a systematic fashion. Such a framework should generate hypotheses for experimental investigation to further characterize a given regulatory program.</p><p>Several approaches have been used to characterize features of TRNs, including Bayesian networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b002">2</xref>], Boolean networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b006">6</xref>], and stochastic equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b007">7</xref>] (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b008">8</xref>] for a review of many such methods). While most of these methods have been applied to relatively small systems due to a lack of relevant data, there are notable exceptions (for examples, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b012">12</xref>]). Two of these are briefly described. First, a reconstruction of the regulatory network that controls sea urchin development has been formulated, and the temporal profile of 40 genes involved in the embryogenesis of the sea urchin characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b012">12</xref>]. Second, an integrated analysis of metabolic and regulatory networks in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b009">9</xref>] through dual perturbation experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b013">13</xref>]. This systematic approach to reconstructing and interrogating the integrated network of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> led to the novel characterization of multiple regulatory rules and an expansion of a genome-scale TRN, based on a model-driven analysis of multiple high-throughput datasets.</p><p>Although the components and component interactions of large-scale TRNs have been reconstructed, the properties of the functional states of these networks have not yet been extensively investigated. Consequently, there is a need for a structured, self-contained representation of TRNs that can be quantitatively interrogated. This paper presents a novel approach for describing a complete transcriptional regulatory system (TRS), including inputs and outputs to the set of internal reactions defined by the TRN, in a functional matrix form (called a regulatory network matrix, or <bold>R</bold>) that connects environmental cues to transcriptional responses. It can be used to compute the expression (i.e., functional) state of the TRS that it represents. To illustrate this approach, the regulatory network matrix for the <italic>lac</italic> operon TRS in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> is characterized and the fundamental subspaces of the matrix are described. Furthermore, this matrix representation of transcriptional regulation is used to efficiently sample all possible expression states of a prototypic TRS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Conceptual Framework</title><p>The process of converting a network map to a functional description of the network is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020101-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Networks comprise components and interactions between them, often graphically displayed as maps that illustrate the relationships between the input state of a network and its corresponding output state. Maps can be represented mathematically as incidence matrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b014">14</xref>]. If the underlying chemical reactions of the network can be delineated, the network can be described with a stoichiometric matrix, <bold>S</bold>, that captures the reaction stoichiometries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b015">15</xref>]. Once the network boundaries are defined, inputs and outputs are delineated and a system is defined. Matrix analysis methods can then be used to generate functional descriptions of network properties and states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b016">16</xref>].

For the sample environment shown, the presence of <italic>Metabolite A</italic> is indicated by a +1 in the row “<italic>A</italic><sub>PRESENCE</sub>” and the column “<italic>A</italic><sub>AVAIL</sub>,” whereas the absence of <italic>Metabolite B</italic> is indicated by a +1 in the row “<italic>B</italic><sub>ABSENCE</sub>” and the column “B<sub>AVAIL</sub>,” and similarly for <italic>Metabolite C</italic> and <italic>Metabolite D</italic>. Initially, for any environment, the proteins that are part of the TRS are assumed to be absent, and the values of these columns are subsequently updated as <bold>R</bold> is analyzed in silico. Just as the continuous production of proteins (the outputs from the TRS) is balanced by exchange reactions, the columns representing a particular set of environmental cues serve to balance the set of environmental cues. Thus, these exchange reactions describe the role of the environmental cues as inputs to the TRS. Once they enter the TRS, they can participate in the regulatory reactions and initiate gene transcription. Since the compounds in <bold>R</bold> must be balanced with the environment in <bold>E</bold>, the resultant matrix <bold>R*</bold> is used to calculate expression (i.e., functional) states of a TRS. In a similar fashion, the analysis of the functional states of stoichiometric networks through <bold>S</bold> needs the definition of exchange reactions and their associated connections with a particular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b018">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analysis of Functional States of a TRS</title><p>Many methods for analyzing genome-scale stoichiometric matrices have been developed and used to gain biological insight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b024">24</xref>]. One such approach is called extreme pathway analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b025">25</xref>]. Extreme pathway analysis has previously been applied to metabolic and signaling networks to determine the set of systemically independent pathways through a network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b028">28</xref>]. Briefly, the extreme pathways are a minimal and unique set of generating vectors that define the edges of the convex solution space that contains all valid steady-state flux distributions in a network. Any possible solution or flux distribution can be described as a non-negative linear combination of these extreme pathways. In effect, the extreme pathways span a convex space that circumscribes all potential functional states (i.e., phenotypes) of a network.</p><p>Analogously, for a TRS, extreme pathway analysis yields a set of generating vectors that encompasses all possible expression states of the network. Consequently, extreme pathway analysis represents an in silico technique for evaluating global characteristics of gene expression. The extreme pathways are a set of systemically independent, convex basis vectors. As such, they represent the extreme states of the TRS; any possible expression state of a TRS is a non-negative combination of these basis vectors. Following the formalism previously developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b025">25</xref>], the internal regulatory reactions, or relationships, can only have non-negative weights, while the environmental reactions, or relationships, may have values of −1 or +1 to represent the absence or presence of a given component, respectively. As described below, the pervasiveness of signal inputs, percentage of environments in which a given gene is expressed, numbers of genes expressed together, and correlated gene sets represent the type of data that can be readily generated for a TRS by analyzing <bold>R*</bold> in different environments using this approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The Four Fundamental Subspaces of R*</title><p>The four fundamental subspaces, namely the null space, left null space, row space, and column space, describe key properties of a matrix, and consequently the system that it represents. For a stoichiometric matrix that represents a biological network, these fundamental subspaces represent key system properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b018">18</xref>]. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to decompose a matrix into three matrices, often referred to as <bold>U</bold>, <bold>Σ</bold>, and <bold>V</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b029">29</xref>], that delineate the four fundamental subspaces (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b029">29</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b018">18</xref>]).</p><p>Each of these four fundamental subspaces contains particular information about the original matrix. A vector <bold>e</bold> that satisfies the equation (<bold>R*</bold>)•<bold>e</bold> = <bold>0</bold> lies in the null space. Every such vector, therefore, can be multiplied into all rows of <bold>R*</bold> (i.e., each metabolite, transcription factor, and protein product of the TRS) and yield zero. For this result to be the case, the relationship between each metabolite, transcription factor, and protein product of the corresponding TRS must be conserved within the TRS as represented in the vector <bold>e</bold>. Consequently, each vector <bold>e</bold> that is part of the null space represents a balance for a given network component (row of the matrix) between the internal regulatory network (or TRN) and the environment. Therefore, a given vector <bold>e</bold> is the collection of active/inactive genes (columns of the matrix) that balance the TRN with the environmental cues (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b027">27</xref>] for further description of similar pathways, as seen in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway of the human B cell). Thus, these pathways represent link-neutral states of the TRS; each internal component (row) has an input reaction and an output reaction. The null space of <bold>R*</bold> captures all possible balanced expression (i.e., functional) states of the TRS that it represents.</p><p>For the equation (<bold>R*</bold>)<sup>T</sup>•<bold>u</bold> = <bold>0</bold>, the set of vectors <bold>u</bold> that satisfy the equation lie in the left null space, where (<bold>R*</bold>)<sup>T</sup> is the transpose of <bold>R*</bold>. The multiplication of each row of (<bold>R*</bold>)<sup>T</sup> (or conversely each column of <bold>R*</bold>) by a given vector <bold>u</bold> yields zero. Consequently, each vector <bold>u</bold> represents an invariant pool of network components (rows of <bold>R*</bold>) across all component interactions (columns of <bold>R*</bold>). Therefore, the left null space of <bold>R*</bold> contains pools or aggregates of network components that are invariant across all the regulatory rules of the TRS. Thus, these pools represent node-neutral states of the TRS; each internal reaction or relationship (column) has an input node and an output node. For example, in detailed reconstructions, these pools represented by <bold>u</bold> may be groups of open reading frames that are coordinately regulated and can be classified as regulated units, or regulons.</p><p>The columns of <bold>R*</bold> (that are vectors in the column space of <bold>R*</bold>) contain information regarding the similarity or difference between how genes (and the corresponding protein products) are regulated. For example, a small angle between a pair of columns (i.e., the corresponding vectors) in <bold>R*</bold> indicates that the regulatory rules of the two corresponding genes are very similar and affect the state of the TRS in a similar fashion. Conversely, a large angle between a pair of columns in <bold>R*</bold> indicates that the genes are regulated by very different sets of rules. Note that, for any given gene, multiple columns may be required to capture different parts of a complex Boolean regulatory rule.</p><p>The rows of <bold>R*</bold> (that are vectors in the row space of<bold> R*</bold>) contain information about the overall similarity of network component participation in the generation of expression states. For example, for the rows corresponding to environmental cues, the row vectors describe the influence that these environmental cues have in generating an expression state. A small angle between a pair of these rows in <bold>R*</bold> indicates that the corresponding environmental cues have very similar effects on the expression state of the network. Conversely, a large angle between a pair of these rows in <bold>R*</bold> indicates that the corresponding environmental cues have very different effects on the expression state of the network. Although not investigated in the present study, the further exploration of this concept may yield important insight into how a TRS moves from one functional state to another.</p><p>These properties contained within the fundamental subspaces of <bold>R*</bold> can translate to experimental design. For example, in selecting a set of environmental conditions to probe the functions of a given TRS, the set of inputs which generate very different effects on the expression state of the TRS would provide the most information in a given experiment.

As previously described, each row in <bold>R</bold> describes a TRS component (i.e., gene, metabolite, transcription factor, or protein product), and each column specifies a regulatory event (i.e., reaction). For the purposes of this analysis, each gene/operon is depicted within the matrix twice: <italic>lacI</italic> and <italic>lacI*</italic>, as well as <italic>lacZYA</italic> and <italic>lacZYA*</italic>. The former entity represents the open form, whereas the latter, asterisk-marked entity, represents the actively transcribed form of the gene. This level of detail is not required in formulating <bold>R</bold> as the actively transcribed form of the gene is only a transient entity between transcription and translation. However, as such mechanistic detail about open reading frames and other network relationships becomes available for actual TRSs, the formalism presented herein can readily incorporate it.</p><p>Null space vectors <bold>e</bold> that satisfy (<bold>R*</bold>)•<bold>e = 0</bold> and left null space vectors <bold>u</bold> that satisfy (<bold>R*</bold>)<sup>T</sup>•<bold>u</bold> = <bold>0</bold> were then calculated for the defined <italic>lac</italic> TRS. All possible network expression states are defined by the two vectors that span the null space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020101-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). (It is important to note that, in calculating these expression states, it was assumed that Crp is a part of the TRS and always present whereas allolactose is a part of the TRS but variable by environment. This assumption was made to avoid accounting for the specific regulation of Crp production in order to maintain the relative simplicity of this example. In other words, only two possible environments were evaluated, one in which allolactose is present and another in which it is absent.) These vectors are the extreme pathways of the TRS. For reaction names prefaced with a “v,” a 1 indicates that the reaction is active, and a 0 indicates that it is inactive. In the remaining reactions that specify flow across the system boundary, a 1 indicates flow out of the system (for example, a protein is produced), a −1 indicates flow into the system, and a 0 indicates that the associated component is neither produced nor consumed. Note that these entries denote an active connection, and series of connections lead to a causal path. The first vector represents the LacI-mediated inhibition of the <italic>lac</italic> operon. The second vector defines the inhibition of LacI by allolactose, thus allowing for Crp-activated expression of <italic>lacZYA</italic>. These two vectors thus represent the two expression states of the <italic>lac</italic> operon system, and they are further depicted graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020101-g004">Figure 4</xref>F.</p><p>Analysis of the left null space identified two intra-network pools in the defined <italic>lac</italic> TRS, and these are represented by two convex vectors that represent the extreme states of the TRS, calculated by determining the extreme pathways of the transpose of <bold>R*</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020101-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). In the vectors specified for <bold>u</bold>, a 1 represents that the system component denoted by the column header in the pool is present, and a 0 indicates that the system component is absent from the pool. The pool depicted by the first vector specifies the <italic>lacI</italic> gene pool, as the open (<italic>lacI</italic>) and actively transcribed (<italic>lacI*</italic>) forms of the gene together represent a conserved quantity within the system. Likewise, the second vector describes the conserved <italic>lac</italic> operon pool by specifying the <italic>lacZYA–lacZYA*</italic> conserved quantity. Again, these conserved quantities are the extreme states of the TRS. For the <italic>lac</italic> operon system, these two pools are relatively straightforward; <italic>lacZYA</italic> will be either open <italic>or</italic> actively transcribed. Thus, the corresponding pool represents this invariant grouping. For larger systems, these pools may be groups of open and/or actively transcribed sets of genes. Such invariant groupings may correspond to complex regulated transcriptional units, or regulons, across a genome.</p><p>Pools of open reading frames are not the only type of conserved quantities that could emerge from <bold>R*</bold>. For example, one could explicitly model the activation of a transcription factor by a small molecule or metabolite (i.e., cyclic AMP [cAMP] activation of Crp). In this case, one would expect to detect a free transcription factor/metabolite/metabolite-bound transcription factor pool within the system (i.e., following from the previously mentioned example, a Crp/cAMP/Crp–cAMP pool would be identified). This pool would emerge because the collective presence of Crp, cAMP, and Crp-cAMP would be constant. Similarly, complex groupings of metabolites and transcription factors may emerge from genome-scale TRS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Prototypic TRS</title><p>The use of the proposed formalism for analyzing the classical <italic>lac</italic> operon is illuminating.

Since <italic>Gene 9</italic> is expressed in so many of the possible environments, these in silico expression data suggest that this gene may be necessary for critical cellular objectives.

Since the set of all possible inputs is not indicative of the “typical” or “average” environments a given TRN may encounter, particular environments are certainly much more probable for a given TRN. The present analysis interrogates the structure of the TRS and the extreme points of all its possible states. Recent studies have demonstrated that metabolic networks occasionally operate at the extremes of their network capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b034">34</xref>]; thus, characterizing the set of possible states that encompass the capabilities of a network is particularly relevant.</p><p>The set of possible expression states was also evaluated to identify the correlated presence (and absence) of groups of genes. Specifically, the correlation coefficient (<italic>r<sub>ij</sub></italic>) between any two genes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> in the network across all 64 environments was calculated. The matrix of pairwise correlation coefficients for all 25 genes was computed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020101-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Pairs of genes that are expressed together have positive correlation coefficients, whereas a pair of genes in which one gene is expressed and another gene is not expressed has a negative correlation coefficient. Genes whose expression is completely independent of each other have an <italic>r</italic>-value equal to zero. For example, the expression of <italic>Gene 13</italic> and <italic>Gene 15</italic> are strongly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.75) (indicated by the solid arrow), whereas <italic>Gene 17</italic> and <italic>Gene 16</italic> are strongly anticorrelated (<italic>r</italic> = −0.68) (indicated by the striped arrow). Again, because regulatory rules are inherently complex (e.g., the expression of <italic>Gene 17</italic> is dependent upon the simultaneous presence of Protein 8 and Protein 11, whereas the expression of <italic>Gene 16</italic> is dependent upon the simultaneous presence of Protein 6 and absence of Protein 8), it is difficult to identify correlated gene sets without the kind of formalism and associated analysis presented herein. Correlated gene sets can describe which genes function together as well as which genes function independently and may provide insights into genes that are part of the same regulated units, much as correlated reaction sets represent reactions in metabolic and signaling networks that always appear together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b035">35</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0020101-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020101.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>The Correlation between Gene Expression across All the Environments for the Prototypic TRS</title><p>Colors indicate that the expression of two genes is correlated (green if the expression of one gene is correlated with the expression of another, red if the expression of one gene is correlated with the lack of expression of another), and the darker the color the stronger the correlation.

The TRS of the <italic>lac</italic> operon in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> was described. Furthermore, the TRS for a prototypic system that mimics features of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> TRS was characterized and the fundamental subspaces of the corresponding <bold>R</bold>* matrix were described. Key results of this study are: 1) a systems definition and approach to TRNs, distinguishing between a TRS and a TRN; 2) the matrix formalization of a TRS as an alternative to a Boolean formalism; 3) the characterization of the null and left null spaces of <bold>R*</bold>; and 4) the exhaustive enumeration of the effect of all possible environments and consequent systemic interpretations.</p><p>The formalism presented herein is a conceptual shift in the representation of a TRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020101-g001">Figure 1</xref>). While a network map illustrates relationships between components of a network, it does not allow for the computation of functional states. However, TRNs can be represented mathematically with the quasi-stoichiometric formalism presented herein. With careful delineation of inputs and outputs, a TRS is defined from which functional states can be computed.</p><p>There is a growing set of computational tools and approaches for the analysis of biological systems. For example, stoichiometric matrices are analyzed with flux-balance analysis, extreme pathway analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b025">25</xref>], Monte Carlo sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b016">16</xref>], and energy balance analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b036">36</xref>], among many other such computational tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b016">16</xref>]. These analysis methods generate unbiased descriptions of the functional states of biochemical networks. As TRSs are reconstructed with a matrix formalism as presented herein, these analysis tools can be used to characterize fundamental features of such systems.</p><p>Key properties of the TRS are found in the two null spaces of <bold>R*</bold>. As stated in the description of the quasi-stoichiometric formalism above, the null space of <bold>R*</bold> represents the set of causality pathways that connect given environments to the expression state of the TRS, accounting for the primary, secondary, and tertiary regulatory relationships. This null space can be described by a unique set of link-neutral pathways in which all regulatory rules or links are balanced. This balanced set of pathways can be calculated with extreme pathway analysis which characterizes the extreme pathways of the given TRS from which all expression (i.e., functional) states can be described. The left null space of <bold>R*</bold> contains the pools of invariant quantities of the TRS. These invariant pools represent transcriptional units in the given system that may generate hypotheses regarding correlated regulatory programs. Extreme pathway analysis can also be used to calculate these invariant pools by defining the node-neutral set of extreme states.</p><p>All possible expression states of the prototypic TRS are readily evaluated. This data allows for the classification of the percentage of environments in which a given gene is expressed as well as the average number of genes expressed in a set of environments. This analysis clearly delineates the genes that are generally active or generally inactive across a variety of environments and perhaps more critical or less critical for network function. For larger TRSs, sampling algorithms can be implemented to perform similar analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b021">21</xref>]. Characterizing the space of possible expression states also leads to the identification of correlated gene sets. These correlations identify how “related” the expression profiles are for the associated pairs, and can generate hypotheses regarding operon or regulon structure. These correlations also identify genes that are anticorrelated or that behave independently. By analyzing all possible expression states of a TRS, such systems-level properties are readily described.</p><p>The regulatory network matrices presented herein are in quasi-stoichiometric formalism. As more data emerges regarding specific chemical transformations and interactions that define TRSs, increasingly detailed matrices to include the precise underlying reaction stoichiometry may be generated. The analysis of the <italic>lac</italic> operon network presented herein led to results representative of what may be seen in genome-scale analyses. The analysis of the stoichiometric matrix for the set of regulatory mechanism reactions (e.g., the binding of a transcription factor and associated regulatory proteins to a specific region of DNA) will reveal much greater quantitative detail regarding TRSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b017">17</xref>]. However, the necessary data is only now becoming available. The matrix formalism presented herein is a structured method for organizing the set of hypotheses regarding TRS function. For example, additional novel regulatory rules for the expression of genes can be added to the matrix as they are characterized and existing rules can be refined as the specific reaction stoichiometries are more clearly defined. Any change in network properties resulting from the inclusion of new rules can be verified to support or refute the given hypothesis. Furthermore, as greater stoichiometric detail becomes available, this framework readily incorporates the associated data. If one regulatory reaction is better characterized, the associated quasi-stoichiometric reaction is replaced with the stoichiometric detail (the corresponding column of <bold>R</bold> is replaced).</p><p>Previous work characterized essential nodes for the processing of signaling inputs to TRNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b037">37</xref>]. These subnetworks, called “origons,” are believed to represent specific topological units of TRNs that detect the decomposed elementary components of complex environmental signals and subsequently develop a reassembled, large-scale transcriptional response. Furthermore, “network motifs,” or patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies higher than those found in randomized networks, have been evaluated, and may define basic building blocks of TRNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020101-b038">38</xref>]. The study described herein differs from these previous works because it focuses on the structure of an entire TRS that is reconstructed by delineating functional relationships between genes and inputs. As such, the characterizations described herein are more directly connected to network function as opposed to network structure.</p><p>With this formalism in hand, the challenge now becomes to scale it up and construct genome-scale TRS matrices for model organisms, such as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacillus subtilis</named-content>. With these matrices in hand, experimental programs can be systematized and guided with predictions regarding which signaling inputs may provide the greatest characterization of network function. Furthermore, these analyses will generate predictions regarding the coordinated regulatory programs that drive cellular phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020101-sd001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020101.sd001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><title>Stoichiometric Network Reconstruction and Associated Analyses Techniques</title><p>Found at DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020101.sd001" xlink:type="simple">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020101.sd001</ext-link> (58 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020101-sd002" mimetype="application/pdf" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020101.sd002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the Prototypic TRS</title><p>Found at DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020101.sd002" xlink:type="simple">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020101.sd002</ext-link> (106 KB PDF)</p></caption></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="ack1"><title/></sec></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>cAMP</term><def><p>cyclic AMP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TRN</term><def><p>transcriptional regulatory network</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TRS</term><def><p>transcriptional regulatory system</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pcbi-0020101-b001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" xlink:type="simple">
