				<article-title>Autoimmunity: A Barrier to Gene Flow in Plants?</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Epistatic interactions between genes are a major factor in evolution. Hybrid necrosis is an example of a deleterious phenotype caused by epistatic interactions that is observed in many intra- and interspecific plant hybrids. A large number of hybrid necrosis cases share phenotypic similarities, suggesting a common underlying mechanism across a wide range of plant species. Here, we report that approximately 2% of intraspecific crosses in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> yield F<sub>1</sub> progeny that express necrosis when grown under conditions typical of their natural habitats. We show that several independent cases result from epistatic interactions that trigger autoimmune-like responses. In at least one case, an allele of an <italic>NB-LRR</italic> disease resistance gene homolog is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of hybrid necrosis, when combined with a specific allele at a second locus. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> cases provide insights into the molecular causes of hybrid necrosis, and serve as a model for further investigation of intra- and interspecific incompatibilities caused by a simple epistatic interaction. Moreover, our finding that plant immune-system genes are involved in hybrid necrosis suggests that selective pressures related to host–pathogen conflict might cause the evolution of gene flow barriers in plants.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>Hybridization brings together genetic material from different genomes. Sometimes, the novel combinations of genes are deleterious in the offspring, even though the genes were innocuous, or even beneficial, in their parents. Such “genetic incompatibilities” have been observed in crosses within and between species in plants, animals, and fungi, and could contribute to the maintenance of population or species boundaries. We have investigated a highly deleterious genetic incompatibility called hybrid necrosis that is observed in many plant taxa. Using different wild strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> as a model<italic>,</italic> we show that hybrid necrosis is often associated with inappropriate activation of the plant immune system—effectively plant autoimmunity. We identified a gene in one strain that triggers necrosis when combined with a second locus from another strain. The product of this gene is an NB-LRR protein, the most common type of plant disease resistance protein. This finding raises the possibility that selective pressure exerted by pathogens can promote rapid evolution of gene variants that might provide benefits to the parent lineage but can cause serious problems for hybrid progeny.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epistasis—the nonadditive interaction between genes—is a critical determinant for the performance of hybrid genotypes. It encompasses a spectrum of important genetic phenomena, from positive heterosis (hybrid vigor) to negative heterosis (hybrid sterility or lethality). In plants, two prevalent examples of the latter are cytoplasmic male sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b001">1</xref>] and hybrid necrosis or weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b002">2</xref>]. Cytoplasmic male sterility and hybrid necrosis have unfortunately received relatively little attention outside the plant genetics literature, even though one of the earliest described cases of hybrid necrosis is between two <italic>Crepis</italic> species and conforms to the tenets for Dobzhansky-Muller type incompatibilities, which establish or maintain gene flow barriers between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b004">4</xref>]. The Dobzhansky-Muller model posits that genetic incompatibility in hybrids results from deleterious interactions between alleles that, while innocuous in their native genomic context, have followed independent evolutionary trajectories in each parental lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b003">3</xref>]. The Dobzhansky-Muller model is agnostic with respect to why causal genes diverge, but evidence from several studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggests that hybrid incompatibility may arise as a by-product of adaptive evolution, since the few known incompatibility genes are all rapidly evolving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b007">7</xref>]. However, despite advances in our knowledge of the genetics of hybrid incompatibility, the prevalence and mechanisms of early-arising gene flow barriers between members of the same species are not yet well understood.</p>
      <p>Because hybrid necrosis is found in both inter- and intraspecific crosses, it may result from recurrent evolutionary processes observed at different temporal levels of genetic divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b002">2</xref>]. Strikingly, hybrid necrosis cases, whether observed in out-crossing or inbreeding plants, share a suite of phenotypic properties that suggest a common underlying mechanism. Among these is that they are generally genetically simple, with often only two causal loci involved.</p>
      <p>We investigated whether the reference plant <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> might serve as a model for the mechanistic understanding of hybrid necrosis. Surprisingly, hybrid necrosis in crosses between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> strains occurs with a prevalence of about 2% (among 861 unique F<sub>1</sub> progenies derived from crosses between 280 distinct parental strains). The 20 cases of hybrid necrosis that we identified are caused by at least five genetically independent systems, each involving epistatic interactions of two to four loci. We demonstrate that four independent cases involve activation of genes typically associated with plant response to pathogen attack, suggesting that autoimmune-like responses are triggered by different epistatic interactions in these hybrids. We demonstrate for one case that this response, and the consequent hybrid necrosis, requires an <italic>NB-LRR</italic> disease resistance gene homolog from one parent, which interacts with an allele at a single locus from a second strain. The involvement of the plant immune system in several independent cases of hybrid necrosis implicates aberrant activation of disease resistance signaling as a general mechanism. The phenotypic similarities of hybrid necrosis cases in other species to those we describe in <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> including in the expression of defense-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b009">9</xref>], suggest that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> is an accessible model for studying the molecular causes of this type of genetic incompatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b002">2</xref>]. Since hybrid necrosis afflicts interspecific hybrids in several taxa, it is conceivable that in some cases hybrid necrosis may give rise to gene flow barriers. As a working hypothesis, we propose that host–pathogen conflict could drive a recurrent genetic syndrome that might contribute to the establishment or maintenance of certain hybrid incompatibilities in plants.</p>

        <title>Mapping of Two Incompatible Genomic Regions</title>
        <p>Our foray into genetic incompatibilities started with the observation that the F<sub>1</sub> progeny from a cross of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> strains Uk-1 and Uk-3 became severely necrotic and did not reach the flowering stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The phenotype of the Uk-1/Uk-3 hybrids resembled previously described cases of hybrid necrosis in other plants, which similarly involve signs of oxidative stress such as leaf lesioning, yellowing, and abnormal morphologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b002">2</xref>]. The compromised phenotype was fully penetrant at 16 °C, a habitat temperature typical for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> in the wild [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b010">10</xref>], but could be conveniently suppressed at 23 °C, allowing seeds to be obtained for genetic analysis. The “F<sub>1</sub>” phenotype reappeared at high frequency in the F<sub>2</sub> generation, together with a more severe growth arrest phenotype, suggesting a relatively simple genetic basis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050236-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>We investigated how many genomic regions contribute to the necrotic phenotype by performing whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scans of F<sub>2</sub> plants that exhibited the F<sub>1</sub>-like phenotype. Although there was some ambiguity in classifying plants as belonging to either the “F<sub>1</sub>” or the more severe “F<sub>2</sub>” phenotypic class, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified two unlinked regions, one contributed by each parent, as being the major loci responsible for hybrid necrosis. The <italic>DM1 (DANGEROUS MIX 1)</italic> locus was derived from Uk-3 and mapped to Chromosome 5, while the <italic>DM2</italic> locus from Uk-1 mapped to Chromosome 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Lines with each region introgressed separately into the common laboratory accession, Col-0, were phenotypically indistinguishable from pure Col-0. However, crosses between the Chromosome 3 (Uk-1) and Chromosome 5 (Uk-3) introgression lines yielded F<sub>1</sub> plants that recapitulated the Uk-1/Uk-3 necrotic phenotype (not shown). Thus, we conclude that the epistatic interaction between the derived alleles of <italic>DM1</italic> from Uk-3 and <italic>DM2</italic> from Uk-1 is both necessary and sufficient for necrosis of Uk-1/Uk-3 hybrids. This finding is consistent with the results from a two-dimensional genome scan under a two-QTL model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p>
        <p>We selected 1,200 F<sub>2</sub> plants with an “F<sub>1</sub>” phenotype for fine mapping, assuming that these were heterozygous for the <italic>DM1</italic> and <italic>DM2</italic> loci. We mapped <italic>DM1</italic> to a 43.2-kb interval in reference to the genome sequence from Col-0. The <italic>DM1</italic> region contains seven annotated genes in Col-0, including two tandem duplicate genes, <italic>AT5G41740</italic> and <italic>AT5G41750,</italic> that encode closely related Toll interleukin receptor (TIR)–type NB-LRR proteins. <italic>NB-LRR</italic> genes are the most common class of disease resistance <italic>(R)</italic> genes in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b011">11</xref>]. An ethyl-methanesulfonate-induced missense mutation in the NB region has been described for an <italic>AT5G41740/AT5G41750</italic> allele in the No-0 accession. This mutation, <italic>SSI4 (suppressor of salicylic acid insensitivity of npr1 4),</italic> causes spontaneous lesioning and dwarfed growth associated with ectopic activation of plant immune responses at 23 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b012">12</xref>]. We found that <italic>SSI4</italic> was seedling lethal at 16 °C. The similar necrotic phenotypes and similar temperature responsiveness of <italic>ssi4</italic> and the Uk-1/Uk-3 hybrid plants suggested that the Uk-3 allele of <italic>AT5G41740/AT5G41750</italic> was a candidate for <italic>DM1</italic>.</p>
        <p>Because of difficulties with obtaining fine-scale recombinants of the correct phenotypic class, we were not able to narrow the final <italic>DM2</italic> interval to less than ∼148 kb (in the Col-0 reference genome sequence). The nonrecombining region spans <italic>AT3G44550</italic> to <italic>AT3G44730,</italic> which includes two annotated <italic>NB-LRR</italic> genes in Col-0 <italic>(AT3G44630</italic> and <italic>AT3G44670)</italic>.</p>
        <p><italic>NB-LRR</italic> genes and <italic>NB-LRR</italic> gene clusters are often very polymorphic, varying both in sequence and gene copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b014">14</xref>]. We therefore isolated and sequenced fosmids covering the <italic>DM1</italic> region from both Uk-1 and Uk-3. The 43.2-kb mapping interval in Col-0 corresponds to 46.2 kb in Uk-3, and 49.0 kb in Uk-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). There are numerous large-scale differences among the three accessions, many involving LINE, MULE, gypsy, and copia retrotransposons. The <italic>NB-LRR</italic> genes are also very different. Uk-1, which carries an innocuous haplotype at this locus, has two gene fragments that encode only the TIR and NB domains, as well as a full-length gene with a premature stop codon in its open reading frame. In contrast, Uk-3, which harbors the Uk-1-incompatible allele, contains only a single <italic>NB-LRR</italic> gene, which has an intact reading frame (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050236-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The Uk-3 allele of this protein has 20% and 13.5% amino acid substitutions relative to AT5G41740 and AT5G41750, respectively.</p>

        <title>Hybrid Necrosis Caused by a Naturally Occurring <italic>NB-LRR</italic> Allele</title>
        <p>We attempted to inactivate five candidate genes in the <italic>DM1</italic> region with artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b015">15</xref>]. amiRNA constructs were transformed into Uk-3, and first-generation transgenic plants (T<sub>1</sub>) were crossed with Uk-1. We recovered phenotypically normal Uk-1/Uk-3 F<sub>1</sub> plants only when the plants carried amiRNAs targeting the <italic>NB-LRR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Rescue was quantitative and varied depending on the T<sub>1</sub> line used, but several transgenic lines segregated phenotypically normal plants that did not show any indication of necrosis at 16 °C. The suppression of hybrid necrosis co-segregated with the amiRNA transgene. Hence, the Uk-3 allele that corresponds to the <italic>AT5G41740/AT5G41750</italic> genes in Col-0 is necessary for hybrid necrosis in crosses with Uk-1.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the Uk-3 <italic>NB-LRR</italic> gene is also sufficient for the deleterious epistatic interaction, we transformed a 7.5-kb genomic fragment containing this gene into Uk-1, Uk-3, and Col-0. All eight independent T<sub>1</sub> lines in Uk-1 exhibited a strong growth arrest phenotype even at 23 °C; this was not observed in any of 12 T<sub>1</sub> lines in Col-0 or eight T<sub>1</sub> lines in Uk-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). We also crossed Col-0 lines carrying the Uk-3 <italic>NB-LRR</italic> gene with Uk-1. F<sub>1</sub> progeny exhibited strong hybrid necrosis indistinguishable from that observed in F<sub>1</sub> plants obtained in Uk-1 × Uk-3 crosses, confirming that no other Uk-3-specific region is required for the Uk-1/Uk-3 incompatibility. Together, these experiments identify an allele of an <italic>NB-LRR</italic> disease resistance gene homolog as <italic>DM1</italic>. The Uk-3 allele of <italic>DM1</italic> is both necessary and sufficient for hybrid necrosis in combination with the Uk-1 allele of <italic>DM2,</italic> which maps to an unlinked region on Chromosome 3.</p>
        <p>The Uk-3 strain has been maintained in the laboratory since 1954 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b016">16</xref>]. To address whether the Uk-3 <italic>DM1</italic> allele arose naturally, we test-crossed 46 accessions selected from the worldwide range of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> to Uk-1. Only one cross, to Nc-1, produced progeny with a phenotype very similar to the Uk-1/Uk-3 hybrid (not shown). To confirm genetically that the same locus is likely to be involved, we crossed Uk-3/Nc-1 F<sub>1</sub> plants, which are phenotypically normal, with Uk-1. All progeny showed the incompatibility phenotype, indicating that the Uk-1-incompatible locus from Nc-1 resides at the same genomic location as that from Uk-3. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that markers closely linked to <italic>DM1</italic> in Nc-1 are identical in sequence to those in Uk-3. Nc-1 was originally collected near Nancy, France, which lies about 160 km from Umkirch, Germany, where Uk-3 originated. We also collected new strains in and around Umkirch itself, and found that one of them, Uk-6, is Uk-1-incompatible as well, and also features identical sequences at <italic>DM1</italic>-linked markers.</p>
        <p>Though Uk-3, Uk-6, and Nc-1 carry similar haplotypes at <italic>DM1,</italic> all three strains are unique and diverged throughout the rest of the genome. Among 311 genome-wide SNPs, Nc-1 differs from Uk-3 at 132 positions, and Uk-6 differs from Uk-3 at 122 positions. This divergence is similar to differentiation between Uk-3 and numerous other accessions from the worldwide range of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> (which have from 102 to 188 differences at these 311 SNPs). Hence, the functionally relevant <italic>DM1</italic> polymorphism is not associated exclusively with a single, self-fertilizing lineage. Together, these data suggest that the <italic>DM1</italic> allele originally identified in Uk-3 arose, and has been maintained, in the wild.</p>

        <title>Genetic Incompatibility Due to Autoimmunity</title>
        <p>The identification of <italic>DM1</italic> as an <italic>NB-LRR</italic> allele, together with the known effects of the <italic>ssi4</italic> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b012">12</xref>], suggested an autoimmune-like response as the mechanism of hybrid necrosis. To test this hypothesis, we turned to whole-genome transcriptome analyses. Because of the hybrid growth defects, we initially analyzed shoot apices including young leaves from plants that were raised at the permissive temperature of 23 °C, and then shifted to 16 °C. A few genes were differentially expressed at 23 °C, while many more genes were aberrantly expressed in the F<sub>1</sub> plants after transfer to 16 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). We examined Gene Ontology annotations of genes differentially expressed at 16 °C, and all significantly overrepresented Gene Ontology categories were associated with immune system responses to infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050236-st001">Table S1</xref>). This suggests that Uk-1/Uk-3 progeny suffer from an autoimmune response that is largely suppressed at 23 °C, but deleterious or lethal at 16 °C. The aberrant activation of immune responses in the F<sub>1</sub> hybrids at 16 °C explains both the lethal phenotype and its sensitivity to environmental conditions. Constitutive immune response activation can cause dwarfing and autonecrosis similar to that observed in these hybrids (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b017">17</xref>]), which, in some cases, is suppressed by higher temperature (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b019">19</xref>]).</p>

        <title>Prevalence of Hybrid Necrosis and Hybrid Sterility in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content></title>
        <p>To determine the frequency with which hybrid necrosis or other negative epistatic interactions occur in F<sub>1</sub> progeny among <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> strains, we performed crosses among a larger panel of wild strains and screened their F<sub>1</sub> progeny for deleterious phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050236-st003">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050236-st004">S4</xref>). Together with the Uk crosses described above, this screen included 280 wild strains in 861 unique combinations. As before, we examined the viability and fertility of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids at 16 °C, to mimic more closely the environment typical for the places of origin of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> accessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b010">10</xref>], rather than the standard laboratory growth temperatures of 20–23 °C. Based on phenotypes observed previously in inter-and intraspecific hybrids in other plants, we expected not only hybrid necrosis, but also early embryo (seed) lethality, sterility, or prezygotic barriers that prevent fertilization. No significant prezygotic barriers were observed; all crosses were successful and resulted in seed set. Fifteen crosses showed high seed abortion, both in the cross itself, and in the F<sub>1</sub> progeny, but all of these could be attributed to known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b020">20</xref>] or subsequently identified ploidy differences between the parents, and were not pursued further.</p>
        <p>The majority of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids were morphologically normal and vigorous at 16 °C, and, with the exception of the triploid progeny of the aforementioned interploidy crosses, none suffered from substantial (greater than about 20%) reduction in seed set, indicating normal or near-normal fertility. However, 20, or about 2% of combinations, developed a common set of symptoms, similar to those seen in Uk-1/Uk-3 hybrids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050236-st004">Table S4</xref>). Intercrosses between parents of necrotic hybrids indicated that the incompatibilities were attributable to at least five genetically distinct systems of epistatic interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050236-st005">Table S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Several phenotypes recurred in independent crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), including dwarfism, leaf abnormalities, lesioning, and extensive tissue necrosis similar to those seen in Uk-1/Uk-3 hybrids.

        <p>All hybrids tested were entirely or mostly rescued when plants were grown at 23 °C, like the Uk-1/Uk-3 hybrids. Importantly, several cases of hybrid necrosis in other plants were reported to be temperature sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b025">25</xref>]. These parallels strengthen the assertion that the examples of hybrid necrosis we have identified in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> share a common mechanism with, and thus provide a tractable model for, cases observed in other plants.</p>
        <p>We grouped the 20 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> cases into three phenotypic categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Six hybrids (class 1) developed initially normally, but progressively succumbed to late-onset growth inhibition accompanied by extensive necrotic lesioning and cell death. Though they remained considerably smaller than their parents, these hybrids were still fertile at 16 °C. Eight hybrids (class 2) had more severe morphological defects compared to class 1 hybrids, including leaf warping, twisting, moderate to severe dwarfing, and loss of apical dominance. Macroscopically visible necrotic lesions were less pronounced than in class 1 hybrids, but there was nevertheless extensive cell death in leaves. Inflorescences were greatly reduced but still fertile at 16 °C. The six strongest cases (class 3, including Uk-1/Uk-3) were all severely stunted, with small, abnormal leaves that had a waterlogged appearance, and developed macroscopically visible lesions. These hybrids almost never flowered; if they did, they were sterile due to severe inflorescence and flower defects. REN11/Wei-1 hybrids were an exception; these sometimes produced tiny inflorescences at 16 °C, which in rare cases yielded a very small number of seeds.</p>
        <p>In six tested cases (KZ10/Mrk-0, Uk-1/Uk-3, REN11/Wei-1, Bla-1/Hh-0, Mir-0/Se-0, and Bla-1/Shahdara), reciprocal crosses resulted in the same F<sub>1</sub> hybrid necrosis phenotypes regardless of the direction of the cross, demonstrating that these are not caused by aberrant nuclear–cytoplasmic interactions, such as those involved in cytoplasmic male sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b001">1</xref>].</p>

        <title>Autoimmunity among Independent Necrotic Hybrids</title>
        <p>To investigate whether temperature-sensitive autoimmune-like responses similar to those observed in Uk-1/Uk-3 affected other hybrids, we performed microarray analysis on vegetative rosettes of plants either shifted from 23 °C to 16 °C (KZ10/Mrk-0) or grown continuously at 16 °C (Bla-1/Hh-0 and Mir-0/Se-0). In total, 1,080 genes were selected as differentially expressed in at least one F<sub>1</sub> hybrid versus its parents, but not between the respective parents. As with the Uk1/Uk-3 hybrids, gene classes associated with immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b026">26</xref>] were overrepresented in this larger list as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050236-st002">Table S2</xref>). This included many well-known genes commonly used as molecular markers, or genetically required for induction of pathogen response, such as <italic>NDR1 (NON-RACE SPECIFIC RESISTANCE 1), EDS1 (ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1), PAD4 (PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4), PR1 (PATHOGENESIS RELATED 1), BGL2</italic> (<italic>BETA-1,3-GLUCANASE 2</italic>)/<italic>PR2,</italic> and <italic>PR5,</italic> which were strongly induced in all hybrids compared with their parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g003">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050236-sg003">S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>The 1,080 differentially expressed genes exhibited strikingly similar expression profiles across all of the hybrid combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), which was readily apparent in a principal component analysis (PCA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). PCA clustered the F<sub>1</sub> hybrids together, widely separated from all parental accessions, with one exception, Hh-0. That Hh-0 stands out is consistent with many of the 1,080 genes being expressed differently at 16 °C in Hh-0 compared to the other parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The Bla-1/Hh-0 F<sub>1</sub> hybrid thus appears to exacerbate a subthreshold, constitutive immune response present in the Hh-0 parent; there is no evidence for such an effect in other genotypic combinations.</p>
        <p>A common consequence of plant immune responses to infection is the hypersensitive response (HR), which can contribute to halting the spread of pathogens that require living tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b027">27</xref>]. HR is characterized by leaf lesions similar to those we observed in the necrotic F<sub>1</sub> hybrids. To determine whether the ectopic immune response suggested by the gene expression profiles correlated with HR-like cell death, we stained leaves of hybrids and their parents with Trypan Blue, an indicator of dead cells. The degree and pattern of staining varied, but all necrotic F<sub>1</sub> hybrids displayed greatly elevated levels of cell death compared with their parents at 16 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). These leaf lesioning phenotypes are similar to those observed in a class of mutants termed lesion mimics, which also suffer from autoimmune responses and ectopic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b028">28</xref>]. Some parent lines, Hh-0, Pla-1, Mrk-0, Uk-3, Uk-6, and Wei-1, showed occasional diffuse lesion-like staining, but this was mild, far less extensive than in the corresponding hybrids, and not associated with macroscopic symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p>
        <p>To confirm unambiguously that the microarray profiles reflect subthreshold activation of a functional immune response, we assayed the sensitivity of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids and their respective parents to a common natural <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> pathogen, the oomycete <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Hyaloperonospora parasitica</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b029">29</xref>]. To avoid complications due to the very different phenotypes of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids and parents at 16 °C, we carried out infections at 20–23 °C. While the different F<sub>1</sub> hybrids were asymptomatic with respect to ectopic cell death at this temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050236-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), we knew that at least the Uk-1/Uk-3 hybrid already expressed a weakly activated molecular phenotype even at 23 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). For each combination tested, we first identified <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">H. parasitica</named-content> isolates to which both parents were susceptible. We then compared susceptibility of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids and their parents to the different isolates. The Uk-1/Uk-3, KZ10/Mrk-0, and Mir-0/Se-0 F<sub>1</sub> hybrids displayed enhanced disease resistance when compared with their respective parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g005">5</xref>B), indicating an increase in functional immune responses. In contrast, Bla-1/Hh-0 hybrids were at least as sensitive as their parents to the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">H. parasitica</named-content> Emwa1 isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The most likely explanation is that subthreshold ectopic immune responses are too weak at 20–23 °C in Bla-1/Hh-0 hybrids to increase resistance to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">H. parasitica</named-content> infection.</p>

        <p>Using the Uk-1/Uk-3 case as a model, we investigated whether the interaction between the two incompatible loci, or each locus individually, is associated with an ectopic, functional immune response. We tested lines in which the <italic>DM1</italic> and <italic>DM2</italic> regions from Uk-3 and Uk-1 were introgressed separately into Col-0, which yields normal offspring with both Uk-1 and Uk-3 (see above). The introgression lines on their own did not exhibit enhanced resistance to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">H. parasitica</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050236-g005">Figure 5</xref>C); hence, the epistatic genetic interaction between <italic>DM1</italic> and <italic>DM2,</italic> which causes necrotic incompatibility at 16 °C, is also required for the increased disease resistance phenotype at 20–23 °C. We conclude that the hybrid necrosis cases we identified result from inappropriate activation of functional immune responses due to simple epistatic interactions.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the observed immune system activation was caused by intrinsic genetic incompatibility, as opposed to hypersensitivity to microorganisms present in the environment, we grew several necrotic F<sub>1</sub> hybrids in axenic conditions. We used severe class 3 hybrids (Uk-1/Uk-3, KZ10/Mrk-0, and REN11/Wei-1), since these develop symptoms sufficiently quickly to assay their phenotype in Petri dishes. Consistent with genetically programmed autoimmunity, these hybrids all displayed in sterile conditions necrosis symptoms that were similar to those seen when plants were grown on soil (not shown).</p>

        <title>Genetic Architecture of Hybrid Necrosis Cases in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content></title>
        <p>A hallmark of hybrid necrosis in other plants is that it is normally genetically simple, like the Uk-1/Uk-3 example detailed above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b002">2</xref>]. To determine whether this holds true for other cases in <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> we performed F<sub>2</sub> segregation analyses of KZ10/Mrk-0 (also class 3), as well as two representatives of milder phenotypic classes, Bla-1/Hh-0 (class 2) and Mir-0/Se-0 (class 1). In each case, discrete phenotypic categories were observed in the F<sub>2</sub> generation, with the original F<sub>1</sub>-like phenotype reappearing at high frequency, indicating a relatively simple genetic basis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050236-t001">Table 1</xref>). F<sub>2</sub> populations also generally included plants with more severe phenotypes (growth arrest and lethality) at ratios suggesting that these individuals were homozygous for incompatible alleles.</p>
        <p>Our mapping data for Uk-1/Uk-3 (see above) revealed that epistatic interaction between two unlinked semi-dominant loci, <italic>DM1</italic> and <italic>DM2,</italic> is sufficient to explain necrosis in this case. Double heterozygotes expressed hybrid necrosis, while homozygotes for the incompatible alleles suffered from growth arrest or lethality at 16 °C. When we grew F<sub>2</sub> populations at 23 °C, we observed necrotic individuals at ratios consistent with these affected plants being partially or doubly homozygous at <italic>DM1</italic> and <italic>DM2</italic> (data not shown). This result implies that the temperature rescue of the phenotype is quantitative and can be overwhelmed by increased dosage of either incompatible allele. Similar results were observed for two other hybrids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050236-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, at higher temperatures, which suppress the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid defects, the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> epistatic interactions cause milder recessive F<sub>2</sub> “hybrid breakdown” problems rather than dominant F<sub>1</sub> incompatibilities. These results underscore the importance of environmental milieu for the expression of hybrid necrosis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results demonstrate that aberrant activation of the plant immune system, due to epistatic interactions between alleles that are harmless in their native genetic context, can have highly deleterious consequences for F<sub>1</sub> hybrid progeny, even among strains within a species. For one case, we demonstrate that this is caused by <italic>DM1,</italic> an allele of an <italic>NB-LRR</italic> gene.</p>
      <p>F<sub>1</sub> incompatibilities that are phenotypically similar to the cases of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> hybrid necrosis we describe have been observed in progeny of many intra- and interspecific crosses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b033">33</xref>], suggesting that a common molecular mechanism may underlie hybrid necrosis across diverse species. In support of this hypothesis, interspecific hybrid necrosis in tobacco has been linked to activation of genes associated with pathogen responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b008">8</xref>]. Additional support for a connection between hybrid necrosis and mechanisms of disease resistance comes from the analysis of the tomato gene <italic>Cf-2</italic>. The <italic>Cf-2</italic> locus, which was originally identified in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Solanum pimpinellifolium</named-content> as conferring resistance against <italic>Cladosporum fulvum,</italic> can cause autonecrosis (a milder syndrome broadly similar to hybrid necrosis) when introgressed into domesticated tomato, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. lycopersicum</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b034">34</xref>]. However, autonecrosis occurs only in plants homozygous for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. lycopersicum</named-content> alleles at a second gene, <italic>RCR3.</italic> Based on this, and the observation that <italic>R</italic> gene alleles can cause autonecrosis when transiently expressed in tobacco, Wulff, Jones, and colleagues presciently suggested that constitutive <italic>R</italic> gene activation in hybrids might contribute to the maintenance of interspecific postzygotic hybridization barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b035">35</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>Cf-2</italic>-triggered autonecrosis is not accompanied by severe morphological defects and is thus less deleterious than the class 2 and 3 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> cases. Nevertheless, the fundamental parallels in phenotype and genetic architecture imply that these differences are likely a matter of degree. We therefore propose that the severe <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> hybrid necrosis cases represent the phenotypic extremes of a quantitative distribution of epistatic interactions that often involve <italic>R</italic> gene homologs. Notably, the <italic>Cf-2</italic> gene encodes a type of R protein that does not belong to the NB-LRR class, indicating that hybrid necrosis and related phenomena may involve <italic>R</italic> genes more generally, and that the causes are not restricted to any particular class of disease resistance genes.</p>
      <p>Known functional and evolutionary properties of the plant immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b036">36</xref>] provide a clear mechanistic framework within which to explain the widespread occurrences of hybrid necrosis observed throughout flowering plants and to understand how simple epistatic interactions causing hybrid necrosis could arise repeatedly within a species. <italic>NB-LRR</italic> genes are known to be highly diverse, and this has been interpreted as indicative of positive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b039">39</xref>]. Furthermore, proper regulation of NB-LRR protein signaling depends on combinations of NB-LRR proteins and additional host proteins, with which they genetically, and likely physically, interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b036">36</xref>]. Hence, both NB-LRR-mediated disease resistance and ectopic NB-LRR activation can result in cell death symptoms similar to those associated with hybrid necrosis.</p>
      <p>We have demonstrated that an <italic>NB-LRR</italic> gene in the Uk-3 accession (the <italic>DM1</italic> locus) is sufficient to cause genetic incompatibility with the <italic>DM2</italic> locus from the Uk-1 accession. Though we do not yet know which gene or gene product from Uk-1 interacts with <italic>DM1,</italic> it is intriguing that, at least in the Col-0 reference genome, the <italic>DM2</italic> interval also contains two annotated <italic>NB-LRR</italic> genes. No other gene known to be involved in pathogen response is found in the <italic>DM2</italic> interval. This raises the tantalizing possibility that aberrant interactions between diverged R proteins encoded by <italic>NB-LRR</italic> genes could cause hybrid necrosis when brought into the same genomic context by hybridization. Thus, co-evolution among <italic>R</italic> gene products could be important to prevent ectopic activation. Consistent with an interaction among <italic>R</italic> genes, there are several cases in which two <italic>R</italic> genes are required for disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b042">42</xref>]. The mechanistic basis, based on precedence in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b043">43</xref>] and evidence in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b044">44</xref>], could lie in heterodimeric interactions of NB-LRR proteins during pathogen recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b045">45</xref>]. However, because the causal gene in the <italic>DM2</italic> interval has not yet been identified, an alternative possibility is that the <italic>DM1</italic> NB-LRR protein normally associates with a cellular partner encoded by the <italic>DM2</italic> locus whose homeostasis it monitors, consistent with the “guard hypothesis” for NB-LRR function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b011">11</xref>]. The maintenance of such interactions would also require co-evolution of the two partners, with a failure of guard–guardee interaction resulting in dose-dependent hybrid necrosis as we observe here.</p>
      <p>Deleterious epistatic interactions involving diverse plant disease resistance genes and variable haplotypes at a second host locus could thus arise as by-products of selection related to host–pathogen conflicts. Indeed, there is a striking association in many plant taxa between selection for increased disease resistance and the occurrence of hybrid necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b002">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>The fact that hybrid necrosis is associated with numerous interspecific incompatibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b033">33</xref>] suggests that causal alleles could, at least occasionally, become fixed between populations. Indeed, the genetic architecture of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> cases bears a striking similarity to that of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities, as do many other examples of intra- and interspecies plant hybrid necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b002">2</xref>]. Though <italic>R</italic> genes are thought to be often under balancing selection, and consequently unlikely to go to fixation, there is growing evidence that <italic>R</italic> gene evolution is more complex, and that many <italic>R</italic> genes exist in other evolutionary states, including regional selective sweeps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b039">39</xref>] and rapid allelic expansion consistent with arms races [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b037">37</xref>]. Further examples of hybrid necrosis where causal alleles occur at different levels of fixation need to be characterized to determine whether <italic>R</italic> genes are also involved in these cases, and whether bona fide gene flow barriers might arise from <italic>R</italic>-gene-mediated hybrid necrosis.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> presents a useful model to understand a widespread genetic incompatibility syndrome, hybrid necrosis. The mechanisms underlying hybrid necrosis are potentially diverse, despite the apparently common involvement of the immune system. We argue, however, that a model encompassing several different incompatibilities will prove immensely valuable. We have already shown that at least one hybrid necrosis case in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> is caused by a member of the <italic>NB-LRR</italic> family, which constitutes the most common type of <italic>R</italic> genes in plants. Together with previous findings, this raises many important questions. How often is hybrid necrosis caused by <italic>R</italic> gene homologs? Do most cases involve <italic>NB-LRR</italic> genes? What are the biochemical mechanisms whereby <italic>R</italic> genes cause deleterious interactions with other genotypes? And finally, if hybrid necrosis contributes to gene flow barriers, how important is it compared to other phenomena such as prezygotic isolation or hybrid sterility?</p>

        <p>QTL mapping and testing for epistatic interaction was performed using the R/qtl package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b051">51</xref>]. This freely available software package is implemented as an add-on package for the command-line-based, open-source statistical software R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>). For QTL mapping, phenotypes were entered as 1 (no phenotype) and 2 (necrotic phenotype). Lod scores were calculated with a single-QTL model using the function “scanone.” The lod score significance threshold was established using 1,000 permutations. The epistatic interactions were calculated with the function “scantwo.” In both functions the standard expectation-maximization algorithm was used for “method.”</p>

        <title>Fosmid libraries.</title>
        <p>Fosmid libraries were prepared using 20-μg Uk-1 and Uk-3 genomic DNA prepared using the Masterpure Plant Leaf DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epibio.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.epibio.com/</ext-link>). Libraries were produced using the Copy Control Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies) following the manufacturer's protocol. Fosmid libraries were replica-plated on Hybond-N+ nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.amersham.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.amersham.com/</ext-link>). Colonies were lyzed, denatured, and fixed directly to the filters and cross-linked in a UV-Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stratagene.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.stratagene.com/</ext-link>) with default settings. Digoxigenin-labeled probes were generated by PCR using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roche.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.roche.com/</ext-link>). Filters were hybridized and screened using standard hybridization procedures. Two digoxigenin-labeled probes were used, one on each end of the interval, in <italic>AT5G41700</italic> (primers: 5′ GCA GTG CAG GTT CAC TTC AA 3′ and 5′ CAG GTG CTG AAG CAT ACG AA 3′) and in <italic>AT5G41760</italic> (5′ TGC TGT TAA TTT GCG AGT GC 3′ and 5′ AAG ATA CGT TGC CAC CAA GG 3′). Detection was performed using anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche) and CSPD chemiluminescent substrate (Applied Biosystems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/</ext-link>) following manufacturer protocols. Membranes were exposed to X-ray film (Kodak, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kodak.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.kodak.com/</ext-link>) for 15 min to overnight as needed. Positive clones were streaked from original plates on fresh LB plates (12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol) and assayed by PCR for confirmation.</p>
        <p>Positive clones were grown in liquid 2YT medium containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol and induced to high copy number using 1:100 CopyControl Induction solution (Epicentre Biotechnologies). Fosmid DNA was prepared from 200 ml of induced culture using a large construct preparation kit (Qiagen). Fosmid DNA (5–10 μg) was randomly sheared to less than 10 kb using nebulizers (Invitrogen, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.invitrogen.com/</ext-link>) and cloned into pCR4Blunt TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Sub-clone colonies were blue-white selected, and plasmid DNA was isolated from 768 positive clones using the MagAttract 96 Miniprep Core Kit (Qiagen) on a Biorobot 8000 (Qiagen). Clones were end-sequenced using T3 and T7 primers. Sequence reads were assembled into contigs using Phred Phrap Consed software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>AmiRNA rescue and genomic complementation.</title>
        <p>Constructs for constitutive expression of amiRNAs from the CaMV 35S promoter were designed and prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b015">15</xref>]. We generated amiRNA constructs targeting <italic>AT5G41700, AT5G41720,</italic> and <italic>AT5G41730,</italic> and three different constructs targeting <italic>AT5G41740/AT5G41750,</italic> always using sequences known to be present in Uk-3. The genomic complementation construct was generated by cloning an 8-kb HincII/XbaI fragment from a Uk-3 fosmid clone into the pGreen IIS vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050236-b052">52</xref>].</p>
        <p>All constructs were transformed into Uk-3, Col-0, and/or Uk-1 using <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Agrobacterium tumefasciens</named-content> (strain ASE) by dip transformation. T<sub>1</sub> plants were selected on half-strength MS plates containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin. T<sub>1</sub> plants were transplanted onto soil and grown at 23 °C. amiRNA-expressing T<sub>1</sub> plants were crossed with Uk-1, and progeny from these crosses were grown at 16 °C and scored for rescue phenotypes. A randomly selected rescuing line (KB142–2 [Uk-3] × Uk-1) was used for microarray analysis as described above. Whole aerial portions of 28-d-old sick and healthy plants were used, grouped in three pools of ten plants per phenotype.</p>
