        <p>Although many of the core components of the embryonic cell-cycle network have been elucidated, the question of how embryos achieve robust, synchronous cellular divisions post-fertilization remains unexplored. What are the different schemes that could be implemented by the embryo to achieve synchronization? By extending a cell-cycle model previously developed for embryos of the frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> to include the spatial dimensions of the embryo, we establish a novel role for the rapid, fertilization-initiated calcium wave that triggers cell-cycle oscillations. Specifically, in our simulations a fast calcium wave results in synchronized cell cycles, while a slow wave results in full-blown spatio-temporal chaos. We show that such chaos would ultimately lead to an unpredictable patchwork of cell divisions across the embryo. Given this potential for chaos, our results indicate a novel design principle whereby the fast calcium-wave trigger following embryo fertilization synchronizes cell divisions.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cell divisions across an embryo occur in rapid synchrony - like clockwork - starting within minutes of fertilization. How does an embryo achieve this remarkable uniformity? Simple diffusion is too slow: typical proteins diffuse with a rate of 10 <italic>µ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>/s, requiring nearly 14 hours to traverse a 1 mm embryo. An exciting idea is that the embryo is an active medium, much like the heart where pulses of electrical activity result in organized contractions. However, just as the heart can have arrhythmias, our model predicts that oscillations in the embryo can become chaotic. What would be the biological consequences of this behavior? How do embryos avoid chaos? Our work provides potential answers to these questions: Chaos would lead to an unpredictable patchwork of cell divisions across the embryo - clearly a fatal defect in development. To avoid chaos then, we predict that cell-cycle oscillations need to be triggered throughout the embryo at almost precisely the same time. The threat that chaos will mar development therefore explains the mystery of why embryos universally employ a fast calcium wave to trigger cell-cycle oscillations. In this way, developing organisms get the synchronizing benefits of an active medium without suffering the destructive consequences of chaotic arrhythmias.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The early stages of embryo development require the integration of two separate design principles: a network that generates sustained oscillations and a control mechanism that produces robust spatial synchronization. While considerable research has addressed oscillatory behavior in different biological contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Novak1">[1]</xref>, the question of how embryos are synchronized across large spatial dimensions has yet to be addressed. Although simple diffusion alone is insufficient to communicate the stage of the cell cycle over typical embryonic length scales (0.1–1 mm), it has been proposed that the combination of certain molecular species in a developing embryo may be regarded as an active medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Lechleiter1">[2]</xref>. Other biological examples of active media include the transmission of fast-moving cAMP waves by the single-celled organism <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Tomchik1">[3]</xref> to allow for aggregation in response to nutrient deprivation, and the heart, where waves of electrical activity lead to organized contractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Davidenko1">[4]</xref>. Active media allow for the transmission of information over large length scales at rates far greater than allowed by simple diffusion. Yet the existence of an active medium coupled to an oscillatory system does not guarantee spatial synchrony: active media can also give rise to complex spatial patterns, including chaos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Hyman1">[5]</xref>. Broadly speaking, chaos describes behaviors in which slight perturbations to initial conditions result in highly divergent, unpredictable outcomes. If the embryo indeed functions as an active medium during development, what guarantees that oscillations will be uniform and not spatially patterned or even chaotic?</p>
      <p>In vertebrates, oogenesis begins with the production of immature oocytes, which arrest in the prophase of meiosis I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Kalinowski1">[6]</xref>. These oocytes undergo maturation in response to progesterone, and, in many vertebrates (including frogs, mice, and humans) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Schmidt1">[7]</xref>, progress to and arrest in metaphase of meisosis II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Sagata1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Nishiyama1">[9]</xref>. In the egg of the African clawed frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, cell division is driven by a molecular clock that modulates Cdk1 activity through a combination of positive and negative feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Morgan1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Pomerening1">[11]</xref>. Prior to fertilization a cytoplasmic activity termed cytostatic factor (CSF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Masui1">[12]</xref> interrupts the negative feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Reimann1">[13]</xref> by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Schmidt1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Tunquist1">[14]</xref>, a ubiquitin ligase that targets mitotic cyclins for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Peters1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-King1">[16]</xref>, thereby keeping the egg arrested in metaphase. Once in metaphase of meiosis II, the oocyte is mature and able to be fertilized. Fertilization results in a rapid, transient increase in intracellular calcium, beginning at the site of sperm entry, traveling across the egg, and terminating at the antipode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Fontanilla1">[17]</xref>. The propagation of this calcium wave <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Fontanilla1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Nuccitelli1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Whitaker1">[19]</xref> leads to the destruction of CSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Meyerhof1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Lorca1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Rauh1">[22]</xref> and the onset of synchronous nuclear divisions. The diameter of an <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg is 1–1.2 mm and the calcium wave speed has been experimentally measured to be <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m/s (speed varies slightly depending on location) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Fontanilla1">[17]</xref>, so that it takes just a few minutes for the wave to travel across the egg. By inactivating CSF, the calcium wave initiates cell-cycle oscillations and the <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg subsequently undergoes 12 rounds of synchronous cell divisions in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>8 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Philpott1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>X. laevis</italic> is a model system for studying the embryonic cell-cycle network. Developing embryos have relatively simple cell cycles, each consisting of two phases, interphase and metaphase, which are characterized by low and high levels of Cdk1 activity, respectively. How does the cell-cycle network toggle between these two levels of Cdk1 activity? Experimentally, Cdk1 activity has been measured in <italic>X . laevis</italic> egg extracts in the presence of controlled amounts of a non-destructible form of cyclin, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>65-cyclin B1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Pomerening1">[11]</xref>. The sharp, hysteretic response of Cdk1 activity to changes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>65-cyclin B1 concentration indicates an underlying bistability of the network. To support this conclusion, Pomerening <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Pomerening1">[11]</xref> developed a numerical model of the embryonic cell-cycle network in which Cdk1 activity is increased by dual positive feedbacks (active Cdk1 activates its activator Cdc25 and inactivates its inhibitor Wee1), while Cdk1 activity is reduced by a single negative feedback (active Cdk1 activates APC via Plx1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002109.s001">S1</xref>). Elimination of the dual positive positive feedbacks results in damped, “sluggish” oscillations of Cdk1 activity, and thus, defective cell cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Pomerening1">[11]</xref>. Qualitatively, the system resembles a simple relaxation oscillator in which fast positive feedback leads to two stable states, and slow negative feedback leads to oscillations between these two states. Tsai <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Tsai1">[24]</xref> argued persuasively that oscillators of this type provide a good fit to the biological requirements of the cell cycle, including a freely tunable frequency and robust, large amplitude oscillations sufficient to drive mitotic phosphorylations.</p>

Through diffusion, oscillations are able to spread across the embryo via local activation of APC once a local critical threshold of overall Cdk1 activity is reached.

The species plotted in the top panel is Cyclin B-Cdk1 (active) and that plotted in the bottom panel is Cyclin B-Cdk1-YpTp (inactive). In the inactive complex, Cdk1 is phosphorylated at both Threonine-14 and Tyrosine-15.</p>

        <p>Within the picture of the embryo as an active-medium, one might expect that fertilization would initiate cell-cycle oscillations at a particular point with activity simply spreading across the embryo like fire spreading through a forest. A mechanism of this type was originally proposed by Novak and Tyson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Novak2">[29]</xref>. To test this hypothesis, we consider a 1D embryo in metaphase, and initiate oscillations at one end of the embryo. We observe that oscillations can spread across the embryo by diffusion if we let oscillations at each point commence once a local critical threshold of overall Cdk1 activity is reached (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, the Cdk1 activity threshold was chosen as 4× its initial value). We have displayed the concentration of both the active Cyclin B-Cdk1 and the doubly phosphorylated, inactive Cyclin B-Cdk1-YpTp for visual comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>. Note that sharp increases in active Cyclin B-Cdk1 occur as Cyclin B-Cdk1-YpTp sharply decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002109.s003">S3</xref>). We will display the concentration of the inactive Cyclin B-Cdk1-YpTp in subsequent figures, but we note that all protein species display similar features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002109.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, oscillations spread across the embryo at a fixed velocity, taking <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> minutes to reach the other end. This demonstrates that the set of cell-cycle equations admits traveling wave solutions. However, a chaotic pattern arises almost immediately following the progression of this initial wave and persists throughout the 200-minute simulation (in this article, we refer to chaos as the non-uniform, unpredictable occurrence of cell-cycle oscillations in the embryo). In conclusion, we find that the spreading scheme does not guarantee robust spatio-temporal synchronization; in fact, the result is chaotic oscillations. This observation motivated us to explore the role of the rapid calcium wave in synchronizing cell-cycle oscillations and preventing the emergence of chaos.</p>

        <p>In <italic>X. laevis</italic> embryos prior to fertilization, CSF activity inhibits the activity of APC, the negative regulator of Cyclin B-Cdk1 levels. As the post-fertilization calcium wave sweeps across the embryo as a plane wave, CSF activity is progressively eliminated and APC is able to target cyclins for destruction. To mimic this behavior, we performed simulations in which APC becomes active (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) at a particular point in space as soon as the calcium wave reaches that point.

      <p>Previous work has established the role of intracellular calcium in destroying CSF activity, yet the necessity of a <italic>fast</italic> post-fertilization calcium wave has yet to be addressed. Intuitively, one might have imagined that, following fertilization, cell-cycle oscillations would simply be nucleated at the site of sperm entry, and this activity would spread across the embryo, resulting in synchronous divisions. In that case, what would be the need for a calcium wave? Our work provides a possible answer to this puzzle: yes, activity could spread via diffusion from one point but the result would be chaos, not synchronized oscillations, leaving in its aftermath unpredictable variations in the number of nuclear divisions in different parts of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Instead, the fast calcium wave provides a robust solution for synchronizing embryonic cell cycles across the range of vertebrates from the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1 mm eggs of many amphibians and fish down to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>100 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m eggs in humans, mice, and other mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Jaffe1">[30]</xref>. Interestingly, for these latter smaller embryos, activity spread due to simple diffusion through an active medium could lead to synchrony (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002109.s009">Fig. S9</xref>), raising the question of whether conservation of the post-fertilization calcium wave across vertebrates is due to heredity or to additional functional constraints.</p>
      <p>For example, is there a constraint on the critical calcium wave speed due to the cell-cycle period? Though the occurrence of a sperm-entry-induced calcium wave followed by rapid nearly-synchronous cell divisions is widely conserved, the molecular details underlying this process vary by species. We have shown that the critical calcium wave transit time in <italic>X. laevis</italic> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1/10 the cell-cycle period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002109.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). When the cell-cycle period is reduced to 10 minutes, as in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the critical wave transit time is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1/2 the cell-cycle period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002109.s010">Fig. S10</xref>). Going through the cell-cycle quickly, therefore, appears to allow for calcium waves whose transit times are larger fractions of the period. Though the calcium wave speed has not been explicitly measured in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, fertilization waves are typically <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m/s in non-mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002109-Jaffe1">[30]</xref>, consistent with the requirements for synchrony.</p>
      <p>Embryonic cells of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> spend <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>20–30 minutes in interphase, during which they replicate their DNA. Duplicated DNA pairs, called sister chromatids, must then be separated before cells can divide. Since we observe a frequency doubling of the 1D chaotic oscillations, one prediction is that chaos would result in cells not having sufficient time to replicate and separate chromatid pairs, thereby halting cell division altogether.</p>
      <p>By performing simulations with a slow calcium wave in a 3D embryo-like geometry that explicitly includes cell division, we show that while some cells may continue to divide with wild-type periods despite the emergence of chaos, others will halt since they can no longer go through complete cell cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Cells cease to divide from the unequal partitioning of proteins between daughter cells and this leads to the predicted phenotype of chaos: a patchwork of cell division where some cells cease dividing altogether.</p>
      <p>Biophysical constraints can vary by species. For example, while the embryo of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is a syncytium in which the nuclei are coupled by a single cytoplasm, that of <italic>X. laevis</italic> has fully formed cells. Why have a syncytium? Clearly, it is not to establish synchrony, as one might have previously expected. Alternatively, why have cellularization? We have shown that cellularization is not sufficient to ensure synchronization. Intriguingly, for a slow calcium wave, there is a loss of phase coherence of cell-cycle components within individual cells, and this appears, as mentioned above, to halt cell division altogether in certain cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Fast waves result in phase coherence, thereby enforcing synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Our work suggests, therefore, that the presence of a syncytium or cellularization results from functional necessities independent of early synchronized cell divisions.</p>
      <p>Our further analyses probed how central parameters in the cell-cycle model affect the establishment of synchrony. The protein diffusion constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we chose for our simulations was 10 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>/s. A sensitivity analysis of cell-cycle parameters demonstrated that this choice of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002109.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is in the worst range for the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). A possible explanation is that organisms have little control over protein diffusion constants, so selection acts primarily by adjusting relative abundances or activities of cell-cycle components, since tuning of these features can be achieved by simple mutations. Yet we also find that kinetic parameters are not tuned to optimal values for robust synchronization. For example, our model predicts that decreasing APC activity would allow the embryo to tolerate slower wave speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002109-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). In this case, there are likely other determinants driving the selection of APC activity independent of achieving synchronous cell divisions post-fertilization. Importantly, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that our central results do not require fine tuning of parameters. In conclusion, we have established the fragility to chaos of the embryonic cell-cycle oscillator in spatially extended systems, thereby motivating the fast post-fertilization calcium wave as a reliable means to synchronize nuclear divisions.</p>
