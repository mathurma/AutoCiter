                    invariable between animals. It has been suggested that this feature stems from
                    genetically encoded molecular markers that guide the neurons in the final stage
                    of synaptic formation. Identifying these markers and unraveling the logic by
                    which they direct synapse formation is a key challenge. Here, we address this
                    task by constructing a probabilistic model that attempts to explain the neuronal
                    connectivity diagram of <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a function of the
                    expression patterns of its neurons. By only considering neuron pairs that are
                    known to be connected by chemical or electrical synapses, we focus on the final
                    stage of synapse formation, in which neurons identify their designated partners.
                    Our results show that for many neurons the neuronal expression map of <italic>C.
                        elegans</italic> can be used to accurately predict the subset of adjacent
                    neurons that will be chosen as its postsynaptic partners. Notably, these
                    predictions can be achieved using the expression patterns of only a small number
                    of specific genes that interact in a combinatorial fashion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Authors Summary</title><p>Synaptic wiring in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is
                    largely invariant between individuals, suggesting that this wiring is
                    genetically encoded. This is in essence the chemoaffinity hypothesis suggested
                    by Roger Sperry. However, proving this hypothesis in model organisms and
                    detecting the identities of the genes that determine the presence or absence of
                    synaptic connections is a major challenge. <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides
                    a unique opportunity to examine this hypothesis due to the availability of both
                    its neuronal wiring diagram and neuronal gene expression map. In this study we
                    show that the neuronal gene expression profiles can be used to predict the
                    subset of adjacent neurons that each neuron will connect to with good accuracy.
                    We further identify a small set of putative genes on both sides of the synapses
                    that interact in a combinatorial fashion and mediate the neuronal partner
                    selection process. The modular design in which a small set of components is
                    reutilized throughout the network is common with other known biological systems
                    and raises the possibility of a similar design in neuronal networks of more
                    complex organisms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>There was no specific funding for this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nervous system of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has exactly 302 neurons
                with a simple gross morphology, often having only a single, unbranched process.
                Processes run together in parallel bundles, forming synapses to adjacent processes.
                The neuronal bodies and their processes are found in characteristic positions and
                similar sets of synaptic connections are seen in different individuals and among
                sets of homologous cells (e.g., cells that are bilaterally symmetrical to each other
                in the worm's body) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Durbin1">[1]</xref>. Furthermore, most of the neurons are connected to
                a subset of about 50% of the neurons that are in physical proximity to
                them and this subset is fairly constant from animal to animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-White1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-White2">[3]</xref>. These observations raise
                the fundamental question in neuroscience: What are the rules that govern nervous
                system connectivity and how are these rules encoded in the genome?</p><p>The development of the nervous system can be divided into three phases: The
                generation of the correct cells in the right temporal and spatial locations, the
                outgrowth of nerve processes, and the formation of synapses. The first phase is
                determined by the lineage of the organism, which positions the neurons at the right
                temporal and spatial locations. The second phase depends mostly on the growth cone
                which migrates through the animal, spinning out the nerve process behind it. The
                third phase depends on short range communication and is feasible only between
                neurons that are in physical proximity. All of these phases show a high degree of
                specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Durbin1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-White1">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Here, we focus on the third phase in which a neuron “chooses” its
                synaptic partners from among the neurons that are in physical proximity to it. A
                classical hypothesis for this phase with many empirical proofs is Sperry's
                chemoaffinity hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Sperry1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Sperry3">[6]</xref>, which states that the
                wiring is “activity-independent,” i.e., that each neuron links
                to a postsynaptic target by selective attachment mediated by specific chemical
                molecular identifiers. These molecular identifiers are encoded in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Cline1">[7]</xref>, label
                the neurons, and determine their chemical affinity. Candidate genes which may
                constitute the molecular identifiers are the <italic>Dscam</italic> gene in
                    <italic>drosophila</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Chen1">[8]</xref> and the
                Protocadherin (<italic>Pcdh</italic>) proteins in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Shapiro1">[9]</xref>. In <italic>C.
                elegans</italic>, the most unequivocal proof for the existence of such molecular
                identifiers was demonstrated for a single neuron (HSNL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Shen1">[10]</xref>, where it was shown that
                the transmembrane proteins <italic>syg-1</italic> and <italic>syg-2</italic>,
                members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, bind together and guide the neuron to
                form the correct synapses.</p><p>The relationship between connectivity and gene expression in <italic>C.
                elegans</italic> was recently explored in two studies. Kaufman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Kaufman1">[11]</xref> was
                the first study to demonstrate a correlation between gene expression and neuronal
                connectivity using a covariation correlation analysis. They also showed that the
                expression signature of each neuron can be used to predict its outgoing connectivity
                signature using the <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbors method, i.e., neurons that
                express similar sets of genes tend to choose similar sets of synaptic partners. A
                similar result was separately shown for the incoming connectivity. They used feature
                selection to find a small set of genes whose expression carries most of the neuronal
                connectivity information. However, their approach does not provide predictions on
                the way in which these genes interact to mediate synaptic connectivity.</p><p>In a closely related study, Varadan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Varadan1">[12]</xref> applied an entropy
                minimization approach to identify sets of synergistically interacting genes whose
                joint expression pattern predicts the existence of a synapse with minimum
                uncertainty. They provide a single rule, composed of two genes in the presynaptic
                region and two genes in the postsynaptic region whose joint expression predicts the
                existence of a synapse with minimum uncertainty. This rule achieved significantly
                smaller entropy than that expected by chance, but its predictive ability was not
                examined in a cross-validation scheme.</p><p>A common feature in both of the above studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Kaufman1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Varadan1">[12]</xref> is the attempt to
                predict the formation of a chemical synapse between any pair of neurons in the worm
                based on the expression pattern of the genes, regardless of their spatial location.
                Here, we propose to integrate the spatial locations of neurons into this prediction
                task, by limiting the predictions to pairs of neurons that are certain to be in
                physical proximity to each other in the worm's body (since they are
                connected by chemical or electrical synapses). By doing so, we shift the focus from
                genes whose expression affects synaptic connectivity through mechanisms such as
                lineage, axonal guidance and neuronal migration to genes whose expression has a role
                in the crosstalk of the neurons in the final stage of the chemical synapse formation
                when neurons identify their designated partners.</p><p>Our study has two complementary goals. First, we wish to explore whether the gene
                expression signature of the neurons carries significant information on the subset of
                adjacent neurons that are chosen as their postsynaptic partners. Second, we wish to
                find a subset of genes and specific rules of interactions among them that with high
                confidence predict the choice of chemical synaptic partners. We combine the gene
                expression patterns of neurons with the neuronal wiring diagram, and apply a
                probabilistic learning algorithm for detecting the subset of relevant genes and
                their combinatorial logic, while incorporating the physical proximity of the
                neurons.</p><p>Our results confirm that neuronal gene expression can be used to accurately predict
                the choice of synaptic partners and that only a few genes with specific interaction
                patterns are sufficient to make these predictions. We suggest that this small number
                of genes imply that there may be a general genetic mechanism that wires the nervous
                system of the worm and that deeper understanding of this mechanism may contribute to
                the understanding of the development of nervous systems in higher organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Our goal is to model the dependence of the chemical synapse formation on the
                expression patterns of the genes in the neurons. To this end, we introduce a
                variable representing the chemical synapse formation between neurons and try to
                predict its value based on a stochastic logical function of the expression of the
                genes in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. We chose a model that is
                based on a probabilistic decision tree, which uses the expression pattern of genes
                in adjacent neurons to regress upon the chemical synapse formation variable. This
                model has two important virtues which make it suitable for our task. First, it
                permits context specific independencies: rather than maintaining a complete tree
                with all the possible splits for gene expression levels, it maintains only the
                branches which are relevant. For example, consider a simple mechanism of
                lock-and-key molecular identifiers such that only when the presynaptic neuron
                expresses a lock molecule and the postsynaptic neuron expresses a key molecule, a
                synapse would be formed between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000120-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). However, if a neuron does not express the lock then it will
                not form a synapse onto its neighbors, regardless of the expression of the key.
                Thus, the decision tree branch that corresponds to the scenario in which the lock is
                not expressed in the presynaptic neuron should not be split again by the key
                expression in the postsynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000120-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In this case, in the context in which the lock is not
                expressed in the presynaptic neuron, the formation of a synapse between adjacent
                neurons is independent of the expression of the key in the postsynaptic neuron. This
                way, the context specific independencies reduce the number of model parameters to
                only those that are relevant, making the model both more intuitive to interpret and
                easier to robustly learn from the data.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000120-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000120.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Context Specific Independencies Reduce the Complexity of the Model and
                        Make It Easier To Interpret.</title><p>(A) A complete decision tree for the simplified example of a lock-and-key
                        molecular identifiers mechanism: only when the presynaptic neuron expresses
                        a lock molecule and the postsynaptic neuron expresses a key molecule, a
                        synapse is formed between them. (B) A simpler decision tree that captures
                        the same logic but exhibits context specific independence. In the context in
                        which the lock is not expressed in the presynaptic neuron, the formation of
                        a synapse between adjacent neurons is independent of the expression of the
                        key in the postsynaptic neuron.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000120.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>The second virtue of our model is its probabilistic nature, which is important given
                that both the wiring diagram and the available gene expression patterns are crude
                and noisy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Kaufman1">[11]</xref>. In addition, although largely constant, the wiring
                diagram between animals displays some variability, which may be a consequence of a
                nondeterministic selection of neuronal partners based on their chemical affinities
                or a consequence of other mechanisms of synaptic plasticity such as Hebb law for
                activity-dependent synaptic formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Hebb1">[13]</xref>. For these reasons, a probabilistic model seems
                appropriate, since it can account for the noise and inherent variability in the
                problem.</p><p>Our probabilistic decision tree is an instantiation of a probabilistic graphical
                model, or Bayesian network. Specifically, we chose the tree-structured conditional
                probability distribution (tree-CPD) that was introduced by Friedman and Goldszmidt
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Friedman1">[14]</xref>. This tree-CPD assigns a conditional probability to
                every leaf. Thus, every pair of neighboring neurons is mapped to a single leaf based
                on the genes that they express and the probability of synapse formation between them
                is obtained from that leaf. For example, in the tree-CPD of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000120-g004">Figure 4F</xref>, if the postsynaptic neuron expresses
                hmr-1 and the presynaptic neuron does not expresses npr-1, then the probability of
                chemical synapse in this direction is 0.92. This probability is independent of
                akt-1, glr-1, cdh-3, osm-6, and unc-4, although these genes affect the probability
                of chemical synapse formation in other contexts.</p><p>We use both the gene expression signature of the neurons and the synaptic
                connectivity network to learn the model. Since many genes have nearly identical
                expression patterns, we clustered the neuronal expression patterns of the 251 genes
                in the dataset into 133 expression classes, thereby removing redundancies in the
                dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section).
                Recall that we wish to focus on the last phase of synaptic connectivity, in which
                neurons perform crosstalk with each other in order to correctly choose their
                designated synaptic partners. Thus, ideally, we should choose every ordered pair of
                neurons that are spatially proximal (such that a chemical synapse could be created
                between them) at some stage of development as an example to learn from. However,
                lacking detailed geometric coordinates of the neuronal processes, we use the
                connectivity pattern itself to approximate the physical proximity of any two
                neurons. Specifically, we define two neurons as being in the same neighborhood if
                they are connected by a chemical synapse in either direction or by an electrical
                synapse (gap junction). According to this definition, neurons in the same
                neighborhood are certainly close enough to form synapse in either direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000120-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Our approximation may
                miss negative examples in cases where two neurons that are close enough to form
                chemical synapse do not form any synapse in either direction. To further validate
                that our results are not biased due to this approximation, we compared them (below)
                to the results achieved by applying the same learning process under a more relaxed
                assumption according to which two neurons are considered spatially proximal if they
                are both connected by an electrical or chemical synapse to each other or to another
                neuron in the network.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000120-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000120.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The Neural Network of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Provides Examples

                        relations with other neurons. For each such combination one neuron has been
                        chosen to demonstrate it. For example the neuron RIVL is the representative
                        of the group of neurons that forms only electrical synapses with AIBL. Each
                        cross on a synapse represents one more additional identical synapse that was

                        that forms a synapse with it (chemical or electrical synapse in either

                the fit to the data and the complexity of the model, a desirable property that
                prevents overfitting. The two phase tree-CPD construction heuristic is designed to
                prevent the learning process from getting stuck in local minima by scanning the
                space of tree-CPDs in a way that allows temporary reduction of the score (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section).</p><p>We first tested whether the model learned from this data indeed demonstrates that the

                of adjacent neurons that will be chosen as the postsynaptic partners of every
                neuron. We used the tree-CPD as a classifier which predicts the presence or absence
                of a synapse for each ordered pair of neurons, and extended it by AdaBoost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Freund1">[16]</xref>, a
                boosting algorithm designed to improve the accuracy of classifiers. In general,
                AdaBoost is an iterative algorithm that iteratively learns a new tree-CPD on a
                reweighed dataset, where the reweighting in each learning iteration is done in a way
                that shifts the focus from the correctly classified examples (easy examples) to the
                wrongly classified ones (hard examples). The final classifier is a weighted majority
                vote of all of the tree-CPDs that were learned (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section). To assess the quality of the classifier,
                we compared its accuracy using the standard area under the ROC curve (AUC) for
                5-fold cross-validation, to the accuracy obtained for randomized datasets, in which

                interactions among them that explain the choice of chemical synaptic partners with
                high confidence. The model learned above provides predictions about such putative

                and the way they interact may vary for different divisions of the data into train
                and test sets, raising the question of how confident we are in the set of rules that
                were learned. To examine the confidence of the rules that were learned, we used a
                standard nonparametric bootstrap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Efron1">[17]</xref> approach of tree-CPDs, in which at each bootstrap
                iteration we learn a tree-CPD on resampled data and in the end examine the number of

                iterations we gather <italic>N</italic> tree-CPDs, and the confidence of each rule
                can then be estimated by the fraction of tree-CPDs that contain it (we used

                genes to achieve the same connectivity, for example, one gene for each synapse. Our
                result is supported by the observation of White <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-White1">[2]</xref> that if a neuron is for
                some reason (mutation or variation between isogenic individual) created in a
                slightly different surrounding than usual with a slightly different set of close
                neurons, it creates a different set of synapses. If every synapse was encoded in the
                genome independently by an independent set of genes, this would not be the case. The
                modular design we find is similar to other biological systems, such as signal
                transduction cascades, where the mapping between signal inputs to the cells and
                their response in highly different pathways and cells is carried out by a small set
                of core modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Kashtan1">[34]</xref>. It may be that this modular design, observed
                here in the context of neuronal wiring, is more optimal or evolvable than the
                alternatives. It also raises the possibility that the genetic mechanism for neuronal
                wiring in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is rather similar to the mechanism in more
                complex organisms, but this hypothesis should of course be reexamined when similar
                data becomes available for more complex organisms.</p><p>Despite its predictive power, our approach has several limitations. Currently, both
                the connectivity network and the gene expression pattern are crude and noisy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Kaufman1">[11]</xref> and
                some important pieces of information are missing. The most prominent limitation of
                our model is its inability to infer the causal relationship between gene expression
                and synapse formation. In the absence of temporal or interventional data, our model
                cannot distinguish between genes that are responsible for chemical synaptic
                specificity and genes that are over- or underexpressed in either side of a chemical
                synapse due to its formation. Another limitation of our model is that it cannot
                distinguish between genes that are directly responsible for synaptic specificity and
                genes that have only indirect affect on this process within the same gene cluster.
                This distinction can sometimes be made manually by examining the expression patterns
                of the genes in nonneuronal cells or by examining the relevant literature.</p><p>One of the strengths of our approach is that it can be easily extended to deal with
                many types of additional data. For example, the gene expression in individual cells
                is measured by GFP fluorescence or by immunostaining. These levels are of course not
                binary (on or off), but they appear as such in the single database that is currently
                available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Kaufman1">[11]</xref>. Future large-scale work could solve this problem by
                systematic detection of the continuous expression pattern of genes in a uniform way
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Dupuy1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Fox1">[36]</xref>. By minor modifications to the tree-CPD
                representation and learning procedure, we can apply our method to learn nonbinary
                tree-CPDs and automatically detect the thresholds on the expression level by which a
                split should be made.</p><p>An interesting observation by White et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-White2">[3]</xref> is that the neuron groups
                AVD, AVE and AVB all have extensive synapses onto AVA along the cord (each neuron
                group consists of neurons with similar morphologies and connectivity patterns and
                denoted by an arbitrary three-letter name <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-White2">[3]</xref>). However, in the nerve
                ring, processes from these cells do not form such synapses even though they are
                accessible to AVA (i.e. are adjacent to its processes). One possible explanation for
                this is time. It is possible that the genetic signal for synapse formation is
                changed at a specific time point during development and that this change affects
                only newer processes. Another possible explanation could be signals that are
                localized to specific regions of the cell. Knowing the specific time each synapse
                was created and the specific adjacent set of neurons in conjunction with the
                specific (preferably, intracellular) expression pattern of all the genes in the
                neighborhood at that specific time would lead to the most comprehensive and complete
                picture. All of this data could be easily incorporated into the data instances from
                which we learn with relatively minor changes. Such timing information may also
                address the problem of cause and effect that currently cannot be disentangled by our
                approach. Solving this problem would lead to the most convincing proof for the
                determination of neuronal wiring by gene expression patterns in <italic>C.

                    repository of the <italic>C. elegans</italic>'s genetic data, using a
                    stringent mining criteria and was manually curated.</p><p>The single-cell gene expression data in WormBase was gathered from many studies
                    that read the GFP levels from transgenic worms in which a GFP gene was inserted
                    downstream to the promoter of the investigated gene or stained the worm with a
                    specific protein antibody in different developmental stages. This data is
                    considered crude and noisy due to inaccuracies in the gathering process of the
                    data from the animal and due to its discretization into a Boolean expression of
                    “on” and off”.</p><p>As a preprocess stage we eliminated all the genes that were expressed in less
                    than 2% of the neurons since they carry little information for our
                    computation. In order to avoid instability of the results due to genes that have
                    very similar expression pattern over the neurons, the remaining 251 genes were
                    clustered using hierarchical clustering. First the Hamming distance (the
                    percentage of neurons that disagree on the expression) between every pair of
                    expression patterns was calculated, then a nearest neighbors algorithm was used
                    to construct a linkage tree. This tree was divided into 133 expression classes
                    by applying a cutoff of 0.8 to the inconsistency coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Jain1">[37]</xref> of
                    its edges. The average Hamming distance between different genes in the same
                    class was 1.7% and only 5% of the expression classes
                    contain more than 4 genes. The typical expression pattern of an expression class
                    that contains more than one gene was set to be the same as the expression
                    pattern of the gene that has the minimum average Hamming distance from all other
                    genes in this class. The final gene set and their assignment to expression

                    White et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-White2">[3]</xref> and Hall and Russell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Hall1">[38]</xref> that was recently
                    compiled by Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Chen2">[39]</xref>. This version contains the complete
                    connectivity of 280 nonpharyngeal neurons and it is publicly available at
                    Wormatlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormatlas.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.wormatlas.org/</ext-link>). We have used this synaptic
                    connectivity network to build the set of weighted data instances from which we
                    learn our model. The weight of a positive data instance (i.e. data instance for
                    positive example) is proportional to the number of chemical synapses that were
                    observed in this direction, whereas the weight of the negative data instance is
                    set to 1. The biological motivation for the use of weights is that the number of
                    identical synapses in the same direction is positively correlated with its
                    invariability between isogenic individuals. Specifically, some of the small,
                    single synapses are not present in some individuals and therefore may be less
                    significant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-White2">[3]</xref> while on the other hand a broad core of
                    connections that are constant in all the individuals in the population includes
                    most of the strong synaptic connections containing many synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Durbin1">[1]</xref>.</p><p>To obtain balance between the weights of the positive and the negative data
                    instances, the weights of the positive data instances were normalized such that
                    their sum would equal the sum of weights of the negative data instances. As a
                    result, the final data instances set contained 4574 weighted examples composed
                    of 48% positive and 52% negative, each carrying
                    50% of the total weights.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Learning the model</title><p>Learning the tree-CPD model from the input data requires two components. The
                    first is a scoring scheme that measures the goodness of fit of the model and
                    enables the comparison of two different models. The scoring method that we used
                    is the Bayesian score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Heckerman1">[15]</xref>. This score is a standard and a principled
                    way to tradeoff model complexity and fit to data, thus it relaxes the necessity
                    of Varadan et al. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Varadan1">[12]</xref> to predetermine the number of expected
                    interacting genes. For detailed explanation about the Bayesian score and
                    comparison to the maximum likelihood score which is a scoring method that does
                    not tradeoff model complexity and fit to the data see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000120.s002">Text S2</xref> and
                        <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000120.s007">Figure
                    S3</xref>.</p><p>The second component that is required is a search heuristic to scan the
                    exponentially large model space in order to find the highest scoring model. We
                    have adopted the approach of Friedman and Goldszmidt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Friedman1">[14]</xref> which was
                    inspired by Quinlan and Rivest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Quinlan1">[40]</xref>. According to this approach, the tree is
                    learned in two phases. In the first phase, the tree is grown in a top-down
                    fashion, starting from the trivial empty tree and growing till the maximal tree
                    is learned. In each step of this phase, we split one leaf of the tree using the
                    variable that induces the best scoring tree. During this process there might be
                    some splits that will reduce the score of the tree, but we do not stop if it
                    happens, since further growth of the tree might compensate for this temporary
                    reduction of the score. In the second phase, we trim the tree in a bottom-up
                    manner. We start from the leaves and climb to the root, checking for each inner
                    node of the tree if the replacement of the subtree rooted at it with an empty
                    tree will increase the score. If it does, we trim the tree at that node and
                    continue. The downhill splits we are willing to take during the first phase
                    prevent the learning process from getting stuck at every local minima of the
                    search space, like most of the greedy search heuristics for learning decision
                    trees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Friedman1">[14]</xref>.</p><p>We have used the standard boosting algorithm AdaBoost introduced by Freund and
                    Schapire in 1995 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Freund1">[16]</xref> to improve the classification accuracy of the
                    tree-CPD. The main idea of AdaBoost is to change the weights of the training
                    data according to the success in their classification. In each round, the
                    weights of incorrectly classified examples are increased so that in the next
                    round, the tree-CPD has to focus on the hard examples. The final combined
                    classifier is a weighted majority vote of all the tree-CPDs from all the
                    iterations. A pseudocode that summarizes this procedure is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000120.s003">Protocol
                    S1</xref>. An important advantage of AdaBoost compared to other methods such as
                    neural networks and support vector machines is that it works well without fine
                    tuning and no sophisticated nonlinear optimization is necessary. It also tends
                    not to overfit the data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Breiman1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Quinlan2">[42]</xref>. In fact, Adaboost
                    in conjugation with decision trees was described as the best
                    “off-the-shelf” classifier in the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Breiman1">[41]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Evaluating the model</title><p>The performance of the model was measured using a standard 5-fold
                    cross-validation scheme. In this procedure, we randomly partitioned the data
                    into five equal parts. We then made some small adjustments to the partition in
                    order to eliminate dependencies as described below and learned a model on each
                    of the five subsets of four parts and tested its performance on the held out
                    subset. The final performance estimator is an average of the performance of the
                    five estimators obtained.</p><p>To avoid dependencies between the train and test sets that might bias the
                    results, the partition of the data into train and test sets must consider the
                    symmetries of the connectivity diagram of <italic>C. elegans</italic> since
                    symmetrical neurons tend to form similar connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Durbin1">[1]</xref> and often express
                    similar sets of genes. The main symmetry axis in the worm is the
                    left–right axis and the secondary symmetry axis which appears
                    especially in the pharynx is the dorsal–ventral axis. Thus, for some
                    neurons there is even a 6-fold symmetry! In addition, for several neurons
                    (especially for motorneurons) there is longitudinal duplication throughout the
                    ventral and dorsal cord. The nomenclature of the neurons suggested by white et
                    al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-White2">[3]</xref>
                    captures these symmetries. E.g. the IL1 group of neurons consists of the
                    symmetrical neurons: IL1DL, IL1DR, IL1L, IL1R, IL1VL and IL1VR. The last two
                    letters show the symmetry where D, V, L, and R stand for Dorsal, Ventral, Left,
                    and Right, respectively.</p><p>To eliminate the dependence of the train and test sets, Kaufman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Kaufman1">[11]</xref>
                    used only the neurons from right side of the worm. However, this approach does
                    not eliminate dependencies of the dorsal–ventral symmetry axis and the
                    amount of data that remains for learning is reduced significantly. We have used
                    a different approach, in which if (X,Y) is an example in the train set than
                    every pair of (X′,Y′), (X′,Y) and (X,Y′)
                    will also be in the train set, where X′ and Y′ are neurons
                    that were assigned by white et al. to the same group of neurons as X and Y,
                    respectively. This approach uses all the data and eliminates the bias that might
                    be caused by the known symmetries.</p><p>Prediction accuracy of the model was measured by the standard area under the
                    receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve plots the fraction
                    of true positives versus the fraction of true negatives for a binary classifier,
                    while its discrimination threshold varies. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is
                    a measure that intuitively can be interpreted as the probability that when we
                    randomly pick one positive and one negative example, the classifier will assign
                    a higher score to the positive example than to the negative one.</p><p>Statistical significance of the prediction performance was calculated against two
                    empirical null distributions: the shuffled expression and the shuffled
                    connectivity distributions. The first was constructed by repeating the
                    prediction procedure 50 times, each time with neuronal identities reshuffled.
                    This empirical null distribution was used in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Kaufman1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Varadan1">[12]</xref>. The motivation
                    behind this test is to evaluate whether the prediction accuracy obtained for the
                    real data can be attributed to real dependence between the expression profiles
                    of the neurons and synaptic connectivity, or if it is a result of the properties
                    of the input data such as the number of different expression patterns, the
                    degree distribution of the network, etc. Indeed, the best AUC that was achieved
                    for this empirical null distribution was 0.63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000120-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This AUC is significantly above
                    the 0.5 score that a pure random guess would achieve. This means that even if
                    there was no real relation between gene expression and chemical synapse
                    formation, it is possible to find a model that is this good just by chance due
                    to the properties of the input data. To better understand this, think of the
                    extreme case of a starlike network in which there is one neuron that is
                    postsynaptic to all other neurons in the network and that there are no other
                    synapses in the network. If, after the shuffling of the identities of the
                    neurons, this single neuron expresses a gene X that no other neuron expresses
                    (it is not unreasonable if there are enough, different, gene expression
                    patterns) then the rule: “if a neuron expresses gene X than it will be
                    postsynaptic to every other neuron in its neighborhood” will have
                    strong evidence in both the train and the test sets, regardless of the partition
                    of the examples into train and test. As a consequence the classifier that is
                    learned on the train set will achieve AUC that is greater than 0.5 on the test
                    set, even though the identities of the neurons were shuffled.</p><p>The second distribution was constructed by repeating the prediction procedure 50
                    times, each time with the signs of the examples reshuffled, while maintaining
                    the same amount of positive and negative examples for each neuron. In other
                    words, each neuron chooses to create a chemical synapse to a random subset of
                    the neurons in its neighborhood while the size of this random set is equal to
                    the number of neurons it chooses in the real data. The motivation behind this
                    distribution is to test whether or not each neuron chooses to form synapses with
                    a subset of its neighboring neurons based on their gene expression profile. The
                    significance of the result with respect to this second empirical null
                    distribution is generally lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000120-g003">Figure 3</xref>), since much of the relation between gene expression and
                    synaptic connectivity from the real data is maintained due to the limited
                    shuffling (there is a correlation of ∼0.6 between the real data and each
                    shuffled data from this distribution).</p><p>To evaluate the confidence of the rules that we learned we used a nonparametric
                    Bootstrap. According to this method, we generated many resampled versions of the
                    data and learned a model from them. This way we collected many reasonable models
                    for the real data. The confidence of a rule is the percentage of models that
                    agree with it. Each resampled version of the data was generated by resampling
                    the data instances with replacement for <italic>m</italic> times, where
                        <italic>m</italic> is the number of data instances in the data, therefore it
                    is expected to contain about 63.2% of the data instances and the rest
                    are duplicates. A pseudocode that summarizes this procedure is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000120.s004">Protocol
                    S2</xref>.</p><p>The confidence of complex rules tends to be smaller relative to simpler rules due
                    to several reasons: First, the deeper the tree-CPD, the larger the search space
                    is and the probability to learn exactly the same rules in different bootstrap
                    iterations decreases. Second, decision trees are inherently unstable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000120-Breiman1">[41]</xref>,
                    i.e. slight perturbation of the data may lead to a different learned tree
                    especially when the tree is deep. Third, the gene expression data is highly
                    correlated. Although we aggregated highly correlated gene expressions into
                    expression classes there still exists correlation between these expression
                    classes. Closely related expression classes may switch roles in tree-CPDs that
                    are learned on different resampling of the data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000120.s001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000120.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Comparison between the Performance of Boosted and Nonboosted Tree-CPDs.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000120.s002" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000120.s002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>The Bayesian Score and the Maximum Likelihood Score.</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000120.s003" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000120.s003" xlink:type="simple"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Pseudocode for Boosting Tree-CPD Using AdaBoost.</p><p>(0.07 MB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000120.s004" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000120.s004" xlink:type="simple"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><p>Pseudocode for Confidence Evaluation Using Nonparametric Bootstrap.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000120.s005" mimetype="image/tiff" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000120.s005" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Summary of the Prediction Performance as a Function of the Maximal Depth of
