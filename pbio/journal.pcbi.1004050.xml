<abstract>
<p>Angiogenesis plays a key role in tumor growth and cancer progression. TIE-2-expressing monocytes (TEM) have been reported to critically account for tumor vascularization and growth in mouse tumor experimental models, but the molecular basis of their pro-angiogenic activity are largely unknown. Moreover, differences in the pro-angiogenic activity between blood circulating and tumor infiltrated TEM in human patients has not been established to date, hindering the identification of specific targets for therapeutic intervention. In this work, we investigated these differences and the phenotypic reversal of breast tumor pro-angiogenic TEM to a weak pro-angiogenic phenotype by combining Boolean modelling and experimental approaches. Firstly, we show that in breast cancer patients the pro-angiogenic activity of TEM increased drastically from blood to tumor, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment shapes the highly pro-angiogenic phenotype of TEM. Secondly, we predicted <italic>in silico</italic> all minimal perturbations transitioning the highly pro-angiogenic phenotype of tumor TEM to the weak pro-angiogenic phenotype of blood TEM and <italic>vice versa. In silico</italic> predicted perturbations were validated experimentally using patient TEM. In addition, gene expression profiling of TEM transitioned to a weak pro-angiogenic phenotype confirmed that TEM are plastic cells and can be reverted to immunological potent monocytes. Finally, the relapse-free survival analysis showed a statistically significant difference between patients with tumors with high and low expression values for genes encoding transitioning proteins detected <italic>in silico</italic> and validated on patient TEM. In conclusion, the inferred TEM regulatory network accurately captured experimental TEM behavior and highlighted crosstalk between specific angiogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways of outstanding importance to control their pro-angiogenic activity. Results showed the successful <italic>in vitro</italic> reversion of such an activity by perturbation of <italic>in silico</italic> predicted target genes in tumor derived TEM, and indicated that targeting tumor TEM plasticity may constitute a novel valid therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Tumor vascularization is essential for tumor growth and cancer progression. In breast cancer, monocytes are angiogenic, i.e. able to induce tumor vascularization. In patients, blood circulating monocytes drastically increase their angiogenic activity when reaching the tumor, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment shapes their angiogenic activity. The identification of the tumor signals inducing the angiogenic activity of monocyte is of paramount significance because it represents the rationale for anti-angiogenic therapies in breast cancer. This goal was achieved by constructing an integrative model of monocyte behavior based on experimental data. The model predicted treatments abrogating the angiogenic activity of monocytes, which were experimentally validated in monocytes isolated from patient breast carcinoma. Importantly, these treatments reverted angiogenic monocytes into immunological potent cells. The main outcome of this modeling strategy for experimental and clinical oncology is the identification of effective treatments abrogating the angiogenic activity of monocytes and thus simultaneously revealing their functional plasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Elucidating the various cell signaling cascades, pathway crosstalk, and how they influence final cell fate and behavior is crucial for defining therapeutic intervention points aimed at driving a cell towards a desired state. To this end, modeling approaches can be used to perturb a biological system <italic>in silico</italic> to test hypotheses on a scale that would be unfeasible to test experimentally. Boolean models have been extensively used in the past to simulate the behavior of cells based on their network activity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In a Boolean modeling approach, the nodes in a regulatory network represent the state of activation of a gene (protein, receptor or ligand) using discrete variables (On or Off). The state of the network at a given instant can change depending on the state of the other nodes and can ultimately stabilize into attractors of either a single state (steady state) or an oscillating set of states (cycling attractors) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Introducing perturbations in a biological regulatory network can change the attractors and even transition the system from one attractor to another one. The Boolean steady state of the network has been shown to correspond to the cellular states for various regulatory networks in the past [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Boolean modeling of steady state transitions helps in understanding the influence of perturbations on system wide behavior and has been used to identify the key molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and regulation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], cell differentiation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and signal transduction [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Most of these models were developed in synergy by wet and dry laboratories. However, to date, only few of them have reported experimental validations (in primary cells) of the proposed <italic>in silico</italic> predictions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the present study we describe the application of a Boolean modeling based approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the angiogenic function of tumor monocytes from breast cancer patients and the experimental validation of <italic>in silico</italic> predictions derived from this modeling.</p>
<p>The formation of tumor-associated vasculature, a process also referred to as tumor angiogenesis, is essential for tumor progression. Tumor vessels can form from local pre-existing capillaries. This process is promoted by the recruitment of bone marrow-derived angiogenic cells (i.e. mainly monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils) at tumor sites [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Clinical studies have demonstrated in a variety of human solid tumors a positive correlation between increased micro-vessel density, infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and unfavorable prognosis in cancer patients [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Recently, monocytes expressing the TIE-2/tek receptor tyrosine kinase (TEM: TIE-2 expressing monocytes) have been identified in peripheral blood and tumors of humans and mouse [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In experimental mouse models, TEM recruited to tumors accounted for apparently all angiogenic activity of bone marrow-derived cells since their selective ablation fully suppressed angiogenesis and induced tumor regression [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Hence, TEM appear to be key players in tumor angiogenesis but the tumor micro-environmental signals and the related signaling pathways governing their functions remain to be elucidated. Of particular interest from a disease standpoint is how TEM can be directed away from potentiating tumor angiogenesis and progression to monocytes being immunologically potent cells.</p>
<p>The VEGFR-1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1), TGFBR-1 (Tumor Growth Factor β Receptor-1), TNF-R1 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1) pathways have been reported to regulate tumor angiogenesis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but their activities have not been examined in human TEM. While we have previously reported that TIE-2 and VEGFR kinase activities drive immunosuppressive function of TEM in human breast Cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], in this study, we investigated the contribution of these pathways along with TGFBR-1 and TNF-R1 pathways to TEM pro-angiogenic activity. We observed that the pro-angiogenic activity of TEM increased drastically from blood to tumor in breast cancer patients. We constructed an integrative and predictive model of TEM behavior to predict <italic>in silico</italic> all minimal perturbations that can transition the highly pro-angiogenic phenotype of breast tumor TEM into a weak pro-angiogenic phenotype and <italic>vice versa</italic>. By experimentally validating our computational predictions, we demonstrate here that the inferred regulatory network captured accurately patient TEM behavior. Thus, the contribution of the computational approach was not only essential to predict and tune TEM pro-angiogenic activity but also to identify the key underlying components and pathways of their pro-angiogenic activity. Finally, gene expression profiling of TEM transitioned to a weak pro-angiogenic phenotype confirmed that TEM infiltrating carcinoma of the breast remain plastic cells that can be reverted from pro-angiogenic and protumoral cells to immunological potent monocytes.</p>

<title>TEM from peripheral blood and tumor tissue of breast cancer patients show distinct pro-angiogenic phenotypes</title>
<p>The angigoenic profile of TEM was investigated in a group of 40 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We characterized by flow cytometry the phenotype of TEM from patient peripheral blood and freshly dissociated tumor specimens obtained at time of surgery (see <xref rid="sec012" ref-type="sec">Material and Methods</xref>). Based on our immunostaining and flow cytometry protocol we observed that TEM did not constitute a distinct subset of monocytes. In contrast, all monocytes showed expression of TIE-2, which was particularly low in patient blood and substantially higher on monocytes isolated from tumor tissue (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, CD11b+, CD14+ monocytes from patient blood and tumor tissue were referred to as “TEM” and compared with respect to receptor and cytokine expression. However, tumor TEM co-expressed VEGFR-1 and TGFR-1 at significantly higher levels compared to peripheral blood TEM (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We next assess the pro-angiogenic activity of TEM using the <italic>in vivo</italic> corneal vascularization assay [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The cornea itself is avascular and was injected with TEM isolated from patient peripheral blood and tumor tissue. Thus, any growth of new vessels from the peripheral limbal vasculature must be due to injected TEM and reflect their pro-angiogenic activity. Tumor TEM showed a heterogeneous and consistently high pro-angiogenic activity inducing cornea and iris vascularization. By contrast, blood TEM were unable to induce <italic>de novo</italic> vascularization of the cornea but did increase the pre-existing vascular network of the iris (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Thus, tumor and blood TEM show distinct pro-angiogenic phenotypes with the expression levels of TIE-2, VEGFR-1 and TGFR-1 mirroring their pro-angiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Finally, secretions were profiled in the conditioned medium of patient-isolated TEM and revealed that tumor TEM are paracrine inducers of tumor angiogenesis by releasing high levels of angiogenic factors (i.e. VEGF, bFGF, and ANG-1) and MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Blood and tumor TEM display a mixed M1-like (tumor-associated macrophages releasing inflammatory molecules) and M2-like (immunosuppressive macrophages polarized by anti-inflammatory molecules) phenotype, with secretion of both the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-10, respectively (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Given that TEM circulating in the blood infiltrate tumor tissue where they further differentiate [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], our data suggest that the tumor microenvironment shapes their highly pro-angiogenic phenotype.</p>

<title>Combining computational and experimental approaches to delineate the pathways controlling TEM pro-angiogenic function</title>
<p>The identification of the ligands and the pathways controlling the highly pro-angiogenic activity of tumor TEM is of paramount significance because it represents the rationale for a treatment directing TEM away from being cells supporting tumor growth. The strategy we selected to reach this goal combined computational and experimental approaches to simulate and predict the behavior of patient TEM subjected to various ligand combinations. Given the limited amounts of patient specimens and the low frequency of TEM (TEM represented 6.7% ±2.5% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 22% ±2.7% of the tumor hematopoietic infiltrate), only a limited number of ligand combinations could be investigated experimentally. The availability of limited amounts of patient TEM was partially overcome by taking advantage of our recently developed model system of TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> by exposing CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood hematopoietic progenitors to breast cancer cell conditioned culture medium [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> differentiated TEM (thereafter named ivdTEM) are angiogenic [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and display an intermediate phenotype relative to blood and tumor TEM (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Consistent with their phenotype (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), ivdTEM released intermediate amounts of angiogenic factors relative to blood and tumor TEM (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Moreover, the <italic>in silico</italic> modeling and predictions helped us to focus on the most clinically relevant monocytic ligands and to spare precious patient specimen. The workflow of our approach consists of five steps (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>): 1) experimental measurement of the responses of TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> to a set of ligands, 2) construction of a dynamic regulatory network based on these experimental data, 3) <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of the treatments altering TEM behavior, 4) experimental validation of computationally predicted treatments using ivdTEM and 5) validation the best predicted treatments in patient TEM (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).

<title>Identification of critical ligands impacting the phenotype and pro-angiogenic activity of TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic>—Antagonistic effect of TGF-β and synergistic effects of TNF-α on TEM pro-angiogenic phenotype and function</title>
<p>Our strategy was to expose TEM to several treatments to identify the ligands and pathways critically controlling their pro-angiogenic activity. TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> were exposed to angiogenic factors (VEGF, PlGF and ANG-1, ANG-2 which are the ligands of VEGFR-1 and TIE-2 respectively) in combination with either TGF-β or TNF-α and the changes in their phenotype, angiogenic activity and paracrine secretion profile were examined. These experimental results were used as the foundations for a computational model that would allow predicting treatments increasing or dampening TEM proangiogenic activity. First, changes in TEM phenotype were evaluated by flow cytometry 36h post treatment. Globally, treatments combined with TGF-β or TNF-α displayed a stronger impact on TEM phenotype than single treatments with however, the exception of TGF-β. Overall, CD11b, CD14, VEGFR-1 and TIE-2 expression displayed larger changes in response to treatment than CCR5, TNF-R1 and TGFBR-1 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). A hallmark of TGF-β treatments was a strong decrease in VEGFR-1 and CD11b expression and an increase in TIE-2 expression (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). By contrast, TNF-α treatments had no impact on VEGFR-1 expression and TNF-α increased TIE-2 expression when combined with PlGF or ANG-2 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>We assessed the impact of the treatments on the pro-angiogenic activity of TEM using <italic>in vitro</italic> HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vascular Endothelial Cells) sprouting assay (see <xref rid="sec012" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Treated TEM were applied to HUVEC grown on microcarrier beads and embedded in a fibrin gel to measure their aptitude to induce HUVEC sprouting i.e. the initial step of blood vessel formation. Single treatments show no significant impact on TEM proangiogenic activity relative to untreated cells with the exception of TGF-β which significantly reduced TEM pro-angiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Interestingly, combining TGF-β with PlGF further decreased VEGFR-1 expression (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and TEM proangiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) suggesting that TGF-β synergized with PlGF to reduce TEM proangiogenic activity. We examined the impact of combined treatments on TEM using <italic>in vivo</italic> corneal vascularization assay. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> sprouting assay was preferred for quantification but is however less reliable because it does not recapitulate the intricate balance of signals from growth factors, mural cells and extracellular matrix of <italic>in vivo</italic> angiogenesis. TNF-α in combination with ANG-2 (or PlGF) significantly increased TIE-2 expression whilst leaving VEGFR-1 expression unchanged (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and raised TEM pro-angiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>. Cornea and iris vascularization in AU: control: 1; untreated: 1.81; TNF-α+Ang-2: 4.58). Conversely, TGF-β in combination with VEGF resulted in a comparable induction of TIE-2 but decreased VEGFR-1 expression (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and reduced TEM pro-angiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>. Cornea and iris vascularization in AU: TGF-β+VEGF: 1.36). Taken together these results show, for the first time, that both Tie2 and VEGFR1 pathways control TEM pro-angiogenic activity. Furthermore, TIE-2 and VEGFR1 pathways synergized with the TNF and TGF pathway to induce and reduce TEM pro-angiogenic activity respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the impact of the different ligand treatments on TEM secretions. Thus, cumulated TEM secretions from ivdTEM were measured experimentally and the secretions for TEM were mathematically inferred (ivdTEM correspond to double positive DP cell population, see <xref rid="sec012" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>) and display in <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>. Of note, none of the single or double treatments we have examined experimentally (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) shifted completely the paracrine secretion profile of TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> toward that of blood or tumor TEM (compare Fig. <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). These results suggest that transitioning ivdTEM into blood or tumor TEM requires a model to simulate computationally the impact of a larger number of ligand combinations on TEM behavior.</p>

<title>Construction of dynamical models from the experimental data using TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>The limited amounts of patient TEM and the combinatorial nature of the ligands precluded experimental testing of all the ligand combinations and was the rationale for building an integrative and predictive model of TEM behavior. We used TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> to derive a dynamical regulatory network from experimental data obtained with a selected number of ligands (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and used then as a proxy to assess the clinically most relevant ligand combinations. To create the models, data sets of receptor expression (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>) and paracrine secretion profiles (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) were combined to infer relevant relationships (or links) between ligands and receptors. Briefly, relevant links were identified based on the amplitude of their expression or secretion changes, their reproducibility, and their coherent variations across the treatments (see <xref rid="sec012" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Based on these criteria, amongst 924 possible links (7 receptors × 11 secreted factors × 12 treatments) we retained 74 relevant links (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Globally, TNF-α, TGF-β and PlGF appeared as key regulators of TEM network. However, TNF-α in contrast to TGF-β, was strongly regulated by other factors (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Dynamical Boolean modeling was then performed by integrating the retained links into an algorithm for computing Minimal Intervention Set (MIS) of TEM regulatory network. Given a regulatory network, MIS patterns represent a set of simultaneous perturbations (or treatments) to force the network into a desired steady state, where a subset of nodes remain at a fixed expression level of either low or high [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The term minimal implies that no other sub-set of an MIS pattern can lead to the desired steady state behavior. However, for a given network, there can be more than one MIS patterns to generate the same steady state. The MIS algorithm proposed by Garg <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] was used for assessing TEM regulatory network by computationally predicting all possible set of up to three simultaneous treatments that can force the TEM network into a weakly (i.e. blood TEM) or highly (i.e. tumor TEM) pro-angiogenic phenotype.</p>

<p>Relative to their blood counterparts, tumor TEM display a higher pro-angiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), a paracrine profile shifted toward angiogenesis (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and higher levels of
TIE-2 and VEGFR-1 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Therefore blood and tumor TEM can be viewed as two distinct cell steady state behaviors and ivdTEM as an intermediate state (Tables <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Using the regulatory network model of TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> we predicted the minimal treatments required for transitioning tumor TEM to blood TEM and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Because the expression levels of TIE-2 and VEGFR-1 controlled (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and mirrored (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) TEM pro-angiogenic activity, we assigned to TIE-2 and VEGFR-1 nodes a fixed polarity of either both over-expressed or down-modulated for highly pro-angiogenic (i.e. tumor TEM) or weakly pro-angiogenic (i.e. blood TEM) steady states respectively. Computationally predicted minimal perturbations sets (MIS) are reported in <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. It is interesting to note that all the predicted treatments were composed of at least two, and mostly three simultaneous perturbations. Only one treatment, combining three perturbations, was predicted by the model to promote TEM pro-angiogenic activity (TNF-α, ANG-2 and PlGF; <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Conversely, eleven distinct treatments were predicted to dampen TEM proangiogenic activity and resulted in three main groups (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The first group of treatments combined TIE-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with TGF-β and a ligand of VEGFR-1 or TIE-2. Treatments from the second group involved VEGFR-1 kinase inhibitor, and the third group of treatments associated TGF-β with TNF-α and a ligand of TIE-2 or VEGFR-1 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). It is worth noting here that we assumed that possible compensatory mechanisms resulting from the blocking of the receptor signaling (rather than knocking down the receptor) do not significantly affect the angiogenic activity. Results showed that this assumption was valid for the particular case of the receptors under study.</p>

<p>With currently available tools, VEGFR-1 kinase activity is almost impossible to manipulate. Indeed, to date, all available VEGFR-1 kinase inhibitors also inhibit VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 to a lesser extent, thus preventing experimental validation of any treatment of the second group. For experimental validations, we therefore selected the combined TNF-α/ANG-2/PlGF treatment, predicted to promote angiogenesis, two treatments of the first group (TIE-2inhibitor/TGF-β/PlGF, and TIE-2 inhibitor/TGF-β/ANG-2), one treatment of the third group (PlGF/TGF-β/TNF-α) and a TIE-2 kinase inhibitor alone. These experimental validations were first conducted in TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>As predicted, the TNF-α/ANG-2/PlGF combined treatment induced TIE-2 and VEGFR-1 expression (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and increased their proangiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Importantly, this combined treatment induced TIE-2 and VEGFR-1 expression and TEM pro-angiogenic activity more efficiently than PlGF/TNF-α (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and PlGF or ANG-2 single treatments (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). These results validate our <italic>in silico</italic> prediction and reveal the synergistic effect of TIE-2, VEGFR-1 and TNF-α pathways in controlling TEM pro-angiogenic activity.</p>

<p>The predicted inhibitory effect of the other treatments was assessed on TEM pre-treated with
TNF-α/ANG-2/PlGF, which display an increased pro-angiogenic phenotype compared to untreated cells (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). This pre-treatment increased the dynamic range and therefore the sensitivity of detecting inhibitory effects. TIE-2 kinase inhibitor/TGF-β combined with ANG-2 or PlGF significantly decreased TIE-2 and VEGFR-1 receptor expression (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) consistently reduced their pro-angiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The PlGF/TGF-β/TNF-α treatment was not as effective, but still reduced their pro-angiogenic activity. These combined treatments were synergistic and minimal since TIE-2 kinase inhibitor (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A and B</xref>) or single treatments alone (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and 2B</xref>) or double treatments (PLGF/TGF-β or TIE-2inhibitor/TGF-β display on <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, respectively) were not sufficient to decrease VEGFR-1 expression and TEM pro-angiogenic activity. By contrast, PlGF/TGF-β/TNF-α heterogeneously decreased TIE-2 and VEGFR-1 expression (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and TEM pro-angiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In summary, from these validation experiments we found that the best computationally predicted treatment promoting TEM pro-angiogenic activity was TNF-α/ANG-2/PlGF and the best dampening activity was found using TIE-2 kinase inhibitor/TGF-β associated with a ligand of TIE-2 or VEGFR-1.</p>

<title>ANG-2/ TGF-β and PlGF/ TGF-β treatments increased transcript abundance of genes regulating differentiation and immune response of TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>Having identified the critical ligands and pathways controlling TEM plasticity, we next examined in TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> whether differential gene expression might also contribute to the molecular basis of TEM plastic behavior. This analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed TEM responses. To this end, we selected VEGF/TNF-α, ANG-2/TGF-β and PlGF/TGF-β treatments for gene expression profiling using Affimetrix whole genome microarrays, because these treatments were present in 17, 16 and 14, respectively of the 74 links (treatment/receptor/cytokine) retained in TEM regulatory network (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). All the other treatments occurred less frequently. Hierarchical clustering demonstrated that TGF-β-based treatments (ANG-2/TGF-β and PlGF/TGF-β) clustered separately from VEGF/TNF-α and control treatments. A total of 398 genes were significantly (p&lt;0.05) and differentially expressed between the two clusters among which 369 and 72 genes were altered by TGF-β/ANG-2 and TGF-β/PlGF treatments respectively (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>, NT unique lists) while 43 were regulated in common (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>, NT intersect list). Enrichment analyses of the gene expression data against known pathways and functional gene categories were conducted as described in Materials and Methods. No enrichment of specific pathways of interest was observed due to the fact that the gene annotations were too general and did not correspond to specific functions of monocytes. Therefore, the 398 differentially expressed genes were annotated and classified in categories manually (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Similar expression profiles were obtained for untreated and TNF-α/VEGF treated cells consistent with their weak impact on TEM functional angiogenic phenotype (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). By contrast, ANG-2/TGF-β and PlGF/TGF-β treatments inhibited TEM pro-angiogenic activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and down-modulated the expression of pro-angiogenic genes (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Furthermore and interestingly, the expression of VASH1 (vasohibin 1) and UCN (urocortin) genes coding for anti-angiogenic proteins was simultaneously up-regulated (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). In response to both ANG-2/TGF-β and PlGF/TGF-β treatments, 95% of the genes functionally related to the cell cycle displayed a down-modulated expression indicating that TEM stopped proliferating with profound changes in their metabolism but without, however undergoing apoptosis (the expression of metabolism and apoptosis related genes was down-modulated for 76% and 88% of them respectively). TEM treated with TGF-β/ANG-2 or TGF-β/PlGF show the expression of some genes (P2RY12, TMCC3, NPDC1, IFFO1, UBASH3B, C11orf52, SLC4A7, TMEM87A, NPL, EMB, PCNA, DNA2, TMEM86A, MMP12, CTSD, AXL, RASGRP3, TUBB, FCGR1A, CR1, MX2) previously ascribed to mouse TAM [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, in response to ANG-2/TGF-β and PlGF/TGF-β treatments, TEM down-modulated the expression of genes involved in macrophage differentiation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) and started to acquire the profile (RGS1, CXCL11, CXCL9, STAT1, IFIH1, ISG20, NT5C3, ADC, PDGFRL, TNF-ASF12, IFIT5, RGS10, TRAF3IP3, CIDEB, APOBEC3A, PYGL, RRM1, MAF, NLRC4, IL10, MYC, DUT, POLE4, CXCL17) of dendritic cells matured <italic>in vitro</italic> by exposure to lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Along these lines, genes encoding for dendritic cell markers, antigen processing and adaptive immune response were upregulated while genes involved in immune suppression show markedly decreased expression (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). Finally the expression of genes related to adhesion and migration were up- and down-regulated respectively indicating that TEM mobility was strongly reduced; an observation consistent with the arrest of their cell cycle and the alteration of their differentiation program (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Along these lines, we observed experimentally that ivdTEM treated with PlGF/TGF-β/TIE-2i display reduced mobility towards the human epithelial tumor cell line MDA-231 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig.</xref>) and slowed down the growth of MDA-231 cells (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig.</xref>)</p>

<title>Validation of the predictions in patient TEM- TGF-β/TIE-2 pathways may represent a therapeutic target to inhibit tumor TEM proangiogenic function</title>
<p>We next sought to validate the computationally predicted treatments in TEM isolated from patient breast carcinoma.

Furthermore, this treatment reduced the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, MMP9, bFGF and VEGF, consistent with a paracrine profile shifted toward a M1-like phenotype and closer to the one of blood TEM (Fig. <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>).

These quartiles were computed independently for each gene, and the two groups of selected patients resulted from the intersection of them all (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B-F</xref>). The Kaplan-Meier plot showed a clear separation between patients with low (n = 40) and high (n = 62) expression for these three genes, with a p-value of 0.0257 derived from log-rank analysis (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B and F</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the same analysis repeated for patients with high and low levels of ANG-2 and CD14 or PIGF and CD14 (and not for the remaining gene) resulted on p-values not statistically significant (0.0587 and 0.521 respectively, <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C-E</xref>), suggesting that the synergistic effect of the corresponding pathways is required to have a significant impact on the survival.</p>

<p>These results suggest that TEM infiltrating a tumor microenvironment enriched in Ang-2 and PlGF, which synergistically trigger TEM angiogenic activity through Tie-2 and VEGFR-1 (Fig. <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), may contribute to a worse patient survival. Further, tumor size correlated positively with the amounts of PlGF and Ang-2 content in the tumor microenvironment (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, P&lt;0.01) while no significant correlation was observed with VEGF, Ang-1, MCP-1, SDF-1, TGF-α and TNF-β. Moreover, we measured by reverse phase protein arrays that in tumors the extent of TEM infiltration was significantly and linearly correlated with PLGF content (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) thus highlighting that Tie-2 and VEGFR-1 axes, as well as their cognate angiogenic TEM ligands Ang-2 and PlGF represent attractive therapeutic targets in breast cancer.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The key relevance of this study is a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of TEM in breast tumor vascularization. This goal was achieved by constructing an integrative and predictive model of TEM behavior based on experimental data. This model was interrogated to identify combined treatments that would alter TEM pro-angiogenic activity. Quite remarkably, four of the five predicted combined treatments that we validated experimentally proved to be extremely efficient at inhibiting or promoting tumor TEM proangiogenic activity, demonstrating the robustness of our model. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the synergistic effect of these treatments relies on crosstalk between TNF-R1, VEGFR-1, TGF-β and TIE-2 pathways resulting in altered angiogenic activity (Figs. <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), modulated expression of angiogenic receptors (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and shifted paracrine profile (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results highlight crosstalks between TIE-2, VEGFR-1, TGF-β and TNF-α pathways of outstanding importance to promote (TNF-α/ANG-2/PlGF) or abrogate (TGF-β/TIE-2 inhibitor/VGFR1 or TIE-2 ligand) patient TEM pro-angiogenic activity.</p>
<p>Another contribution of this study is an effective approach to model relatively sparse data from distinct individuals (newborns and patients), who are inherently heterogeneous in nature. This challenge was overcome by a sustained and tight collaboration between the experts in the fields of computational and experimental sciences throughout all steps of the workflow (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). By setting up a rigorous experimental design we identified coherent variations and links across biological replicates and data sets, which provided a robust basis to reconstruct the TEM signaling network (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, the modeling framework was an integral part of our experimental strategy, enabling the model predictions to address the biological questions, an issue that is of particular importance in systems biology [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In a traditional approach, it would have been unfeasible to experimentally test the complete set of up to three simultaneous perturbations using 12 distinct ligands, which would have led to 596 ligand combinations. The physiologically relevant combinations of ligands were discovered by applying the recently proposed MIS algorithm [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] to predict all minimal perturbations in the inferred regulatory network that can transition TEM into desired steady states (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The <italic>in silico</italic> minimal perturbations predicted by applying the MIS algorithm on the inferred ivdTEM regulatory network comprised not only a handful of the set of perturbations (or ligand combinations) and they were all shown to be experimentally valid when tested on ivdTEM and patient TEM (Figs. <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The <italic>in silico</italic> prediction algorithm helped us to focus on the most clinically relevant monocytic ligands and to unravel treatments abrogating TEM pro-angiogenic activity at breast tumor sites. These results highlight the importance of mutual relationship between experimental and computational sciences. Furthermore, the combined computational and experimental approach followed in this study may provide a general strategy to study the behavior of limited cell subsets from patients in cancer and other diseases.</p>
<p>The main outcome of this modeling strategy for experimental and clinical oncology is the validation of treatments abrogating tumor TEM pro-angiogenic activity and thus simultaneously revealing their functional plasticity. Our study shows that treatments targeting TEM plasticity may constitute a valid therapeutic strategy to shift TEM to acquire a more anti-tumor M1-like phenotype. Moreover, the relapse free survival analysis showed a clear separation between patients with low and high expression for pro-angiogenic genes (ANG-2 and PIGF), and suggested that the synergistic effect of the corresponding pathways is required to have a significant impact on the survival.</p>
<p>Overall, our results obtained by employing the combined modeling and experimental approach suggest novel treatments for abrogating tumor TEM pro-angiogenic activity and reveals the functional plasticity of TEM.</p>

<title>Identification of the links between treatment, receptor and cytokine</title>
<p>Within the TEM regulatory network, a link represents an effect (increase or decrease) on either receptor expression or cytokine secretion in response to single or combined ligands (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Of note, some treatments and secreted cytokines are identical. We applied the three following criteria to identify a link between treatment/receptor/cytokine. We retained only the links that are reproducible, of sufficient amplitude and coherent. Only 8% of the possible links matched these three criteria and were retained to construct the TEM regulatory network. A link was considered as reproducible when the treatment induced a reproducible effect across at least 3/4 of the biological replicates. Second, a treatment was retained if it induced a change of sufficient amplitude, i.e. when the effect of the treatment on receptor and cytokine was among the upper (the treatment increases the expression of a receptor or a cytokine) or lower (the treatment decreases the expression of a cytokine or a receptor) quartile of variation. Third, only coherent links were retained meaning that they should be always correlated or anti-correlated across the treatments, and not sometimes correlated and other times anti-correlated. As an example, a receptor A and a cytokine B are linked when they show similar or/and opposite variations across the treatments e.g. receptor A up-regulated)/ cytokine B up, and/or receptor A down/cytokine B down.

<title>Computing minimal all perturbations sets in ivdTEM regulatory network</title>
<p>The interactions between treatment/receptor/cytokine as predicted by our experimental and computational approach (see previous section) were used to generate the dynamical regulatory network of ivdTEM (Boolean equations are provided in <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>). The MIS algorithm proposed in [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] was then applied to compute all possible minimal perturbation sets to force the network into desired steady state or phenotype. The MIS algorithm starts by unrolling the inferred regulatory network of ivdTEM into a tree-like structure starting from the nodes which have a fixed polarity (i.e. either high or low) in the desired final steady state. In the angiogenesis model of ivdTEM, the nodes corresponding to TIE-2 and VEGFR-1 are assigned a fixed polarity of either both high or both low for highly pro-angiogenic and weakly pro-angiogenic steady states respectively. The nodes with the fixed polarity are referred to as the root nodes of the network. The network is unrolled along a path in the regulatory network until a duplicate node is found. At that instance the unrolling process is terminated along this path. Once the network is unrolled along all paths originating from the root node, the MIS patterns are generated by scanning this unrolled network in two iterations. In the first iteration, the required polarity (i.e. over-expression or knock-down) of each node is propagated from the root node to the leaf nodes. In the second iteration, possible perturbations that can lead to the required polarity at each node are listed by scanning the unrolled network in the reverse order from the leaf nodes towards the root node in the breadth first manner. When two paths merge at one node, then only those MIS vectors that are compatible (i.e. the same node is not over-expressed on one path and knocked-down on the other path) along both the paths are taken into consideration while scanning the rest of the network. This process when terminates at the root node, only MIS vectors that have been compatible throughout the unrolled network shall remain in the list. The MIS algorithm does not involve explicit enumeration of perturbation patterns but rather generates these patterns by traversing the topology of the network ensuring that only the patterns leading to a desired cellular behavior are generated. Detailed methodology for generation of the MIS vectors and the network unrolling process are further described in [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>

Sample correlation was performed on the top 1000 expressed probesets using Bioconductor <italic>affy</italic> and <italic>affyPLM</italic> packages in R [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This analysis indicated separate clustering of VEGF/TNF-α and ANG-2 or PIGF/TGF-β samples. Differentially expressed genes between different treatments were detected by fitting linear models and computing empirical Bayes moderated t statistics, comparing two groups at a time, using the <italic>limma</italic> package in R [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini Hochberg procedure [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and genes with an adjusted p value of &lt; = 0.05 were selected as differentially expressed. For pathway analysis, differentially expressed genes were ranked according to fold change (high to low) comparing two treatments and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed on the ranked lists against MSigDB gene sets using the NCBI gene id as a unique identifier [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Enrichment p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini Hochberg procedure [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The microarray data from this publication have been submitted to the GEO database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/linking.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/linking.html</ext-link> and assigned the identifier GSE34559.</p>

<title>Survival analysis</title>
<p>Publicly available normalized expression data from 1809 breast cancer patients was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kmplot.com" xlink:type="simple">http://kmplot.com</ext-link> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. For the relapse free survival analysis we selected lowest and highest expression values of 205572_at, 209652_s_at and 201743_at probes, corresponding with ANG-2, PIGF and CD14 genes respectively, using as threshold the first and third quartile respectively. These quartiles were computed independently for each gene, and the two groups of selected patients resulted from the intersection of them all (see <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). To generate the Kaplan-Meier plots and to evaluate the separation between groups (log-rank statistic) we used the <italic>survival</italic> package in R.

<p>Patient TEM are (CD11b<sup>-</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup> i.e. double positive DP cells) while <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated cells encompassed three cell populations: DN: double negative (CD11b<sup>-</sup>, CD14<sup>-</sup>), SP: single positive (CD11b<sup>-</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>) and DP: double positive (CD11b<sup>+</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>). The frequency of these population are as follows: DN (53.7%±10.8), SP (30.4%±11.9), DP (16.1%±5.6). <italic>In vitro</italic> differentiated TEM correspond to the DP cell population and display a phenotype and functions intermediate to blood and tumor patient TEM (<xref rid="pcbi.1004050.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref> and Tables <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004050.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). (<bold>A</bold>) The expression of receptors at the surface of TEM differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> was measured by flow cytometry at resting state in DN, SP, and DP (i.e. TEM) cell populations. Shown are cumulated data of 10 independent experiments. Box plots represent values between 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile with a line at the median (50<sup>th</sup> percentile). The whiskers extend above and below the box to show the highest and the lowest values. Significant variations between SP and DP cell phenotypes are indicated with asterisks in the DP box plots (* P &lt; 0.05, ** P &lt; 0.01, T Test). (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>In vitro</italic> differentiated cells were exposed to different combinations of ligands and changes in receptor expression at the surface of DN, SP and DP (i.e. TEM) cell populations were measured by flow cytometry 36 hours post-treatment and displayed as mean log<sub>2</sub> ratios relative to untreated cells. Shown are cumulated data of 3 to 9 independent experiments. Significant variations (P &lt; 0.05, T test) in VEGFR-1 and TIE-2 expression in SP and DP cell populations are indicated with an asterisk in the heatmap.

In contrast to receptor expression, TEM secretions were released in the culture medium and could not be measured in individual cell populations. Thus, cumulated TEM secretions from DN, SP and DP cell populations were measured experimentally and the secretions for each individual population were mathematically inferred (see <xref rid="sec012" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) and displayed as mean log<sub>2</sub> ratios relative to untreated cells.
