<p>The <italic>Neurospora</italic> RNA-dependent RNA polymerase QDE-1 is an RNA polymerase that can use both RNA and DNA as templates, suggesting a new mechanism for small RNA production.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The production of aberrant RNA (aRNA) is the initial step in several RNAi pathways. How aRNA is produced and specifically recognized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) to generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is not clear. We previously showed that in the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora</italic>, the RdRP QDE-1 is required for rDNA-specific aRNA production, suggesting that QDE-1 may be important in aRNA synthesis. Here we show that a recombinant QDE-1 is both an RdRP and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP). Its DdRP activity is much more robust than the RdRP activity and occurs on ssDNA but not dsDNA templates. We further show that Replication Protein A (RPA), a single-stranded DNA-binding complex that interacts with QDE-1, is essential for aRNA production and gene silencing. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrate that QDE-1 can produce dsRNA from ssDNA, a process that is strongly promoted by RPA. Furthermore, the interaction between QDE-1 and RPA requires the RecQ DNA helicase QDE-3, a homolog of the human Werner/Bloom Syndrome proteins. Together, these results suggest a novel small RNA biogenesis pathway in <italic>Neurospora</italic> and a new mechanism for the production of aRNA and dsRNA in RNAi pathways.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Small RNA molecules (20–30 nucleotides) play important roles in many cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms by silencing gene expression. To generate the many forms of small RNAs, DNA is first transcribed to produce single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which then is converted to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). However, it is not clear how the ssRNA templates are synthesized from DNA and specifically recognized by RdRPs amidst a sea of single-stranded, cellular RNAs. We previously showed that in the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora</italic> the production of one type of small RNA called qiRNA, which is specifically induced after DNA damage, requires the RdRP QDE-1. Here, we investigated the precise contributions of QDE-1 to the synthesis of ssRNA and dsRNA. We show that QDE-1 is surprisingly promiscuous in its template choice in that it is able to synthesize RNA from both ssRNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). These results suggest that QDE-1 first generates ssRNA from a DNA template and then converts the ssRNA into dsRNA; this combination of activities in one protein ensures the specific action by RdRP on aberrant RNA in lieu of other single-stranded cellular RNA. In addition, we identified Replication Protein A, a ssDNA-binding protein that interacts with QDE-1, as an essential factor for small RNA production. Furthermore, we were able to reconstitute synthesis of dsRNA from ssDNA in a test tube using purified QDE-1 and RPA proteins, demonstrating the ability of this relatively simple biosynthetic system to generate the nucleic acid trigger for gene regulation. Together, these results uncover the details of a new and important small RNA production mechanism in cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) refers to a group of post-transcriptional or transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms conserved from fungi to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Buhler1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Ghildiyal1">[6]</xref>. The RNAi pathway is triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is cleaved by the ribonuclease-III domain-containing enzyme Dicer to generate 20–25 nucleotide long small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. siRNA is then loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), in which an Argonaute (Ago)-family protein, guided by the siRNA, mediates the cleavage of homologous RNAs.</p>
<p>In fungi, plants, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the production of endogenous dsRNA and siRNA requires RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs), which can generate dsRNA using single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) as templates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Buhler1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Catalanotto1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Cogoni1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Xie1">[10]</xref>. Some RdRPs are also important for the amplification of dsRNA and siRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Pak1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Sijen2">[12]</xref>. However, the production mechanism of the initial ssRNA templates used by RdRPs, often called aberrant RNAs (aRNA) or pre-siRNAs, is not well understood. In addition, the nature of aRNA and how RdRPs recognize aRNA specifically over other cellular RNAs are unclear.</p>
<p>In plants, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) is important for siRNA production and RNAi-directed transcriptional silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Herr1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Onodera1">[14]</xref>. However, Pol IV homologs are not found in fungal or animal genomes. In fission yeast, mutants of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunits show loss of centromeric siRNA and RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation at the centromeric repeat regions, probably by coupling transcription with transcriptional silencing machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Buhler1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Djupedal1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Kato1">[16]</xref>. It is not known whether Pol II plays a similar role in posttranscriptional silencing and in the silencing of other chromosomal regions.</p>
<p>In the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, quelling is a post-transcriptional silencing mechanism triggered by multiple copies of transgenes during vegetative growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Catalanotto1">[2]</xref>. In the quelling pathway, QDE-1 (QUELLING DEFICIENT-1, an RdRP), QDE-2 (an Argonaute protein), QDE-3 (a RecQ DNA helicase homologous to the human Werner/Bloom Syndrome protein), and two partially redundant Dicer proteins (DCL-1 and DCL- 2) are required for silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Cogoni1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Catalanotto2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Maiti1">[21]</xref>. QDE-1 and QDE-3 are thought to be involved in the generation of dsRNA. It has been proposed that the introduction of a transgene leads to the production of transgene-specific aRNA transcripts, which are then specifically recognized and converted to dsRNA by QDE-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Catalanotto1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Cogoni3">[22]</xref>. The mechanism of aRNA production and the role of QDE-3 in this process are not known. Subsequently, Dicers cleave the dsRNA into siRNA duplexes of around 25 nt which are loaded onto QDE-2 and processed to single-stranded siRNAs with the assistance of the QIP exonuclease, resulting in the activation of RISC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Catalanotto4">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Maiti1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>We previously discovered that dsRNA, but not siRNA, activates the transcription of <italic>qde-2</italic>, as well as other RNAi and putative antiviral genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Choudhary1">[23]</xref>. More recently, we found that DNA damage induces the expression of the Argonaute protein QDE-2 and a class of small RNAs named qiRNAs for their association with QDE-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lee1">[24]</xref>. qiRNAs originate mostly from the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, the only highly repetitive DNA locus in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, and their production depends on QDE-1, QDE-3, and Dicers. qiRNA biogenesis also requires the DNA damage-induced aRNA from the rDNA locus. In <italic>qde-1</italic> and <italic>qde-3</italic> mutants, the induction of rDNA-specific aRNA by DNA damage is abolished, indicating their essential roles in aRNA production. Surprisingly, partially purified RdRP QDE-1 can generate RNA from single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in vitro, suggesting that QDE-1 is also a DdRP that generates aRNA and then converts it into dsRNA using its RdRP activity.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that QDE-1 is indeed a bona fide DNA-dependent RNA polymerase: recombinant QDE-1 displays DdRP activity that is much more robust than its RdRP activity. In addition, we further investigate the mechanism of aRNA and dsRNA production after DNA damage. Our genetic and biochemical results support a model in which QDE-1 is recruited by ssDNA-binding protein Replication Protein A (RPA) and the RecQ DNA helicase QDE-3. QDE-1 first acts as a DdRP to produce ssRNA and then as an RdRP to convert the ssRNA into dsRNA, a process that is strongly promoted by RPA. These results suggest a mechanism for the generation of aRNA and provide a potential explanation for how aRNA is specifically recognized by RdRPs.</p>

<title>Biochemical Analyses of QDE-1 RdRP and DdRP Activities</title>
<p>The crystal structure of QDE-1 has shown that its catalytic core is structurally similar to eukaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Salgado1">[25]</xref>. We previously showed that partially purified QDE-1 from <italic>Neurospora</italic> exhibits both RdRP and DdRP activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lee1">[24]</xref>. To rule out the possibility that another QDE-1-associated polymerase is responsible for this DdRP activity and to biochemically characterize the enzymatic activities of QDE-1, we purified the recombinant catalytically active C-terminal portion of QDE-1 (QDE-1ΔN, residues 377–1402) or the full-length QDE-1 expressed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to near homogeneity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000496.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Makeyev1">[8]</xref>. Both the full-length and truncated forms of QDE-1 exhibited similar activities in our biochemical assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000496.s002">Figure S2</xref>), but due to the ease of expressing QDE-1ΔN in yeast, it was used in most of the assays described in this study. We designed a synthetic 176 nt ssDNA oligonucleotide corresponding to a region of enhanced green fluorescent protein sequence. An ssRNA of the same length and sequence was used as the control template. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g001">Figure 1A</xref> (native agarose gel), QDE-1ΔN can use both ssRNA and ssDNA as templates to synthesize radioactively labeled products in a reaction mixture containing all four ribonucleotides and α-<sup>32</sup>P-UTP. In contrast, a recombinant RdRP of the bacteriophage φ6 can only use ssRNA as its template. In addition, the DdRP and RdRP activities of QDE-1ΔN were completely abolished when its conserved catalytic aspartatic acid residue (D1011) was mutated to alanine (QDE-1ΔN<sup>DA</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Makeyev1">[8]</xref>, suggesting that the same catalytic core of QDE-1 is responsible for both DdRP and RdRP activities.</p>

<p>To determine the nature of the ssDNA-templated reaction products by QDE-1, we subjected them to several different nuclease treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g001">Figure 1B, right panel</xref>s). RNase H, which cleaves the RNA strand of a DNA/RNA hybrid, degraded the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNA products and shifted the ethidium bromide stained DNA band to template length. RQ1 DNase, which degrades DNA, shifted the majority of the labeled RNA products to the template length. RNase V1, which cleaves base-paired DNA or RNA, degraded the product completely. In contrast, RNase A, which degrades RNA with single-stranded character, did not affect the reaction products. These results indicate that the products of DdRP activity of QDE-1 are mostly ssRNA hybridized to its template as DNA/RNA hybrids. As expected, the RdRP products of QDE-1ΔN were dsRNA, as neither RQ1 DNase nor RNase H had any effect on the products, while RNase V1 treatment resulted in their complete degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g001">Figure 1B, left panel</xref>s). RNase A treatment resulted in partial degradation of the dsRNA. This is due to the small single-stranded stretch of RNA that bridges the two strands together and results from RNA synthesis initiation mode known as back-priming (see below) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Makeyev1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>To compare the DdRP and RdRP activities of QDE-1, we used 3 kb ssDNA and ssRNA templates of the same length and sequence in RNA polymerase assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g001">Figure 1C</xref> (native agarose gels), in the presence of the ssDNA template, QDE-1ΔN rapidly converted almost all DNA templates into DNA/RNA hybrids within 5 min, as indicated by the disappearance of the ssDNA template and the appearance of a strong high molecular weight DNA/RNA hybrid band (lower panels). In contrast, when ssRNA was used as the template, most of the templates remained single-stranded after 30 min of the reaction and were not in dsRNA form (upper panels). The slight mobility change of ssRNA templates seen in the ethidium bromide-stained gel after the reaction was due to the formation of the QDE-1/ssRNA complex and not due to the RNA polymerase reaction because such a mobility shift was still observed in the absence of NTP and could be removed by proteinase K treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000496.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Comparison of the two activities showed that the DdRP activity of QDE-1 was about 25-fold higher than its RdRP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These results demonstrate that QDE-1 is a robust DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Similar results were also obtained with the full-length QDE-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000496.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, QDE-1ΔN cannot bind dsDNA and was inactive when dsDNA was used as the template (unpublished data). Similarly, Myc-QDE-1 purified from <italic>Neurospora</italic> exhibited no RNA polymerase activity with dsDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000496.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>

<title>RPA, an ssDNA-Binding Protein Complex That Interacts with QDE-1, Is Required for the Generation of aRNA and qiRNA</title>
<p>If QDE-1 functions as the RNA polymerase that generates the aberrant transcripts in vivo, it needs to be recruited to ssDNA where the aRNAs are expressed. Previously, QDE-1 was found to interact with Replication Protein A (RPA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Nolan1">[26]</xref>, but the role of RPA in gene silencing is not known. RPA is an ssDNA binding protein complex and is a major component involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Fanning1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Zou1">[28]</xref>. It is a conserved eukaryotic heterotrimeric complex, consisting of RPA1 (RPA70 in mammals), RPA2 (RPA32), and RPA3 (RPA14), that prevents ssDNA from damage, secondary structure formation, and re-annealing in DNA processing pathways.</p>
<p>The QDE-1-RPA interaction suggests that RPA may be the protein that recruits QDE-1 to ssDNA. If so, RPA should be required for the production of aRNA and qiRNA. To test this hypothesis, we sought to generate <italic>rpa</italic> mutants in <italic>Neurospora</italic>. The knock-outs of <italic>rpa-1</italic> and <italic>rpa-2</italic> are lethal, but the knock-out of <italic>rpa-3</italic>, the smallest subunit of RPA, is viable and does not cause severe growth and developmental defects. To obtain <italic>rpa-1</italic> and <italic>rpa-2</italic> knock-down strains, we introduced constructs that can express an inverted repeat specific for <italic>rpa-1</italic> (ds<italic>rpa-1</italic>) or <italic>rpa-2</italic> (ds<italic>rpa-2</italic>) into a wild-type strain. We first measured the induction of QDE-2 by DNA damage agent histidine, an indication of endogenous dsRNA generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Choudhary1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lee1">[24]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, the induction of QDE-2 was completely abolished in two independent <italic>rpa-3<sup>ko</sup></italic> mutants, and the basal levels of QDE-2 in the <italic>rpa-3<sup>ko</sup></italic> mutants were lower than the basal wild-type level. Also, in the ds<italic>rpa-1</italic> and ds<italic>rpa-2</italic> knockdown strains, the induction of QDE-2 by histidine was mostly abolished. In addition, DNA damage-induced qiRNA and aRNA expression at the rDNA region were both eliminated in the <italic>rpa-3<sup>ko</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Therefore, like QDE-1 and QDE-3, RPA is required for the generation of qiRNA and the rDNA-specific aRNAs.</p>

<title>RPA Is Required for Quelling</title>
<p>In addition to their roles in qiRNA production, QDE-1 and QDE-3 are also important components in the quelling pathway. The similarity between the qiRNA biogenesis pathway and the quelling pathway prompted us to examine the role of RPA in quelling by transforming a truncated <italic>al-1</italic> gene into the <italic>rpa-3<sup>ko</sup></italic> and <italic>qde-3<sup>ko</sup></italic> strains.

<title>QDE-1 Can Initiate RNA Synthesis Internally from ssDNA Templates and Can Produce dsRNA Directly from ssDNA</title>
<p>Since free ssDNA ends are rare in vivo and mostly protected by proteins, we examined whether QDE-1 can initiate RNA synthesis internally from ssDNA. In addition, since QDE-1 generates ssRNA from ssDNA, we wanted to know whether QDE-1 can directly use the ssRNAs it produces as templates to generate dsRNA. To test these possibilities, we performed RNA polymerase assays using long circular ssDNA templates (genomic ssDNA of bacteriophage M13mp18 or φX174, 7.2 and 5.4 kb, respectively). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g003">Figure 3A</xref> (native agarose gels), QDE-1ΔN exhibited robust DdRP activity with both circular templates and the band corresponding to ssDNA templates disappeared (the CTL lanes). In addition, treatment of M13 ssDNA template with Exonuclease I, which degrades linear ssDNA prior to the reactions, did not affect the activity of QDE-1. These results indicate that QDE-1 can indeed initiate RNA synthesis internally from ssDNA templates.</p>

<title>RPA promotes ssDNA-directed synthesis of dsRNA by QDE-1.</title>
<p>(A) In vitro DdRP assay using circular ssDNA from bacteriophages M13 or φX174 as templates. The nature of the products was characterized by various nuclease treatments and native agarose gel (0.6%) electrophoresis. (B) In vitro DdRP assay using full-length recombinant QDE-1 with various concentrations of the RPA complex. The 175 nt ssDNA template was pre-incubated with RPA before adding QDE-1, and the products were resolved by 6% urea containing polyacrylamide gel. The DNA/RNA hybrid refers to the single-stranded, labeled RNA products of the denatured hybrids. The dsRNA species migrated at higher molecular weight positions in the denaturing gels due to their synthesis by back-priming initiation. (C) The QDE-1 RdRP products with 0 or 70 nM RPA were treated with recombinant Dicer and resolved in 6% (top) or 16% (bottom) urea-containing polyacrylamide gels. The DNA/RNA hybrid refers to the single-stranded, labeled RNA products of the denatured hybrids.</p>

<p>There are two types of products made by QDE-1 using these circular ssDNA templates as indicated by the prominent high molecular weight bands and the low molecular weight smear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The primary high molecular weight QDE-1 products were degraded by both RQ1 DNase and RNase H. Furthermore, the RNase H treatment resulted in the reappearance of the ssDNA template band, indicating that the main products of the QDE-1 catalyzed reaction are DNA/RNA hybrids. In contrast, the low molecular weight smear products were resistant to both RQ1 DNase and RNase H but were completely degraded by RNase V1. Since RNase V1 degrades base-paired RNA or DNA, these results showed that the low molecular weight smear products are mostly dsRNA. These data also indicate that some of the short nascent RNAs can dissociate from ssDNA, providing free ssRNA for dsRNA synthesis by QDE-1, resulting in dsRNA products of variable lengths. Thus, QDE-1 can directly generate dsRNA from ssDNA templates.</p>

<title>RPA Strongly Promotes the Ability of QDE-1 to Produce dsRNA by Preventing the Formation of DNA/RNA Hybrids</title>
<p>Although QDE-1 can produce some dsRNA from ssDNA, the majority of the QDE-1 products are DNA/RNA hybrids, which prevent the generation of dsRNA. Thus, for robust dsRNA production, a mechanism should exist to unwind the nascent DNA/RNA hybrids or to prevent their formation. Since RPA binds to ssDNA, we examined its effect on QDE-1 RNA polymerase activity. In addition, we were interested to know whether QDE-1 can use RPA-bound ssDNA as a template. Different concentrations of human RPA complex were incubated with ssDNA (a 175 nt template) before the addition of recombinant full-length QDE-1. The reaction products were separated by a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>, without RPA or at a low RPA concentration (10 nM), the QDE-1 products were mostly DNA/RNA hybrids. However, when RPA concentration was increased to 35 nM, the DNA/RNA hybrid bands decreased and a high molecular weight band appeared. At 70 nM of RPA, the DNA/RNA hybrid bands completely disappeared and the high molecular weight forms became the only major QDE-1 products. This result demonstrates that QDE-1 can use RPA-bound ssDNA as a template and RPA can regulate the RNA polymerase activity of QDE-1. We also performed polymerization reactions with QDE-1 and the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) of <italic>E. coli</italic> but failed to detect a clear effect on QDE-1 activity (unpublished data). This suggests that the effect of RPA on QDE-1 activity extends beyond its ssDNA binding character.</p>
<p>It was previously shown that for ssRNA templates in vitro, QDE-1 can utilize the 3′ ends of ssRNAs to create dsRNAs in which the complementary strands are covalently attached to each other, as a result of a mode of initiation called back-priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Makeyev1">[8]</xref>. The high molecular weight products detected in the denaturing polyacrylamide gel suggest that they are most likely dsRNA molecules synthesized by back-priming initiation. To confirm this, the QDE-1 products synthesized in the presence or absence of RPA were subjected to Dicer treatment (recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dicer-2 purified from Sf9 insect cells). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, Dicer treatment removed the vast majority of the high molecular weight QDE-1 products but the DNA/RNA hybrids were unaffected. Note that some of the small QDE-1 products made in the absence of RPA were also removed by Dicer. Subsequently, the Dicer-treated products were separated in a 16% polyacrylamide gel to detect the presence of siRNAs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g003">Figure 3C</xref> (bottom panel), the QDE-1 products synthesized in the presence of RPA resulted in a significant increase of siRNA level after the Dicer treatment. Together, these results suggest that RPA strongly promotes the ability of QDE-1 to synthesize dsRNA from ssDNA by preventing the formation of DNA/RNA hybrids.</p>

<title>The Interaction between QDE-1 and RPA Requires QDE-3</title>
<p>RPA participates in many DNA metabolic processes under normal growth conditions, but qiRNA and rDNA-specific aRNA are preferentially produced after treatments with DNA damaging agents, suggesting that the interaction between QDE-1 and RPA requires additional determinant(s). QDE-3 and its eukaryotic homologs such as human BLM and WRN and yeast SGS1 play important roles in DNA repair, genome maintenance, and DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Cogoni2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Bachrati1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Bachrati2">[33]</xref>. These QDE-3 homologs display ATP dependent 3′–5′ DNA helicase activity to unwind duplex DNA and are recruited to damaged replication forks after treatment with DNA damaging agents or a blockade of replication. In addition, it has been shown that RPA interacts with BLM and WRN proteins and that RPA stimulates their DNA helicase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Bachrati2">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Choudhary2">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>To understand the function of QDE-3 in aRNA production, we examined its interaction with RPA in <italic>Neurospora</italic>. c-Myc-tagged QDE-3 and FLAG-tagged RPA-1 constructs under the control of the <italic>Neurospora</italic> quinic acid inducible promoter (a rather weak promoter) were co-transformed into a wild-type <italic>Neurospora</italic> strain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, Myc-QDE-3 was found to interact specifically with FLAG-RPA-1 by immunoprecipitation (IP) assay, suggesting that QDE-3 and RPA work together. Consistent with earlier results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Nolan1">[26]</xref>, we found that QDE-1 interacts with RPA-1 in the wild-type <italic>Neurospora</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, this interaction was abolished in the <italic>qde-3<sup>ko</sup></italic> strain, indicating that QDE-3 is important for the interaction between QDE-1 and RPA. Since QDE-3 is involved in DNA repair and its homologs are known to be recruited to DNA damage sites, these results suggest that although RPA is involved in normal DNA metabolism, it interacts with QDE-1 when QDE-3 is present at the damaged loci. Thus, aRNA and qiRNA are only induced after treatments with DNA damaging agents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The genetic and biochemical results presented here and in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lee1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Nolan1">[26]</xref> suggest that in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, QDE-1 acts both as a DdRP and an RdRP to generate aRNA and the subsequent dsRNA necessary to initiate the RNAi pathway. This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence. (i) QDE-1, but not the canonical RNA polymerases, is required for aRNA production from the rDNA locus after treatment with DNA damaging agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lee1">[24]</xref>. (ii) Both the recombinant QDE-1 and QDE-1 purified from <italic>Neurospora</italic> exhibit robust DdRP activity using ssDNA but not dsDNA templates, and the DdRP activity of QDE-1 is considerably higher than its RdRP activity. (iii) QDE-1 can directly generate dsRNA from ssDNA templates. (iv) RPA, a QDE-1-interacting protein that binds to ssDNA, is required for aRNA and qiRNA production and strongly enhances dsRNA synthesis. Therefore, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other RNA polymerases also contribute to the rDNA specific aRNA production, the evidence suggests that QDE-1 should be a major RNA polymerase involved in this process. Although it was previously shown that QDE-1 can produce some small RNAs from ssRNA in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Makeyev1">[8]</xref>, this activity does not appear to be relevant in vivo since QDE-1 is not required once dsRNA is made and is not involved in making secondary small RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Catalanotto3">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lee1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that the generation of ssDNA after DNA damage/replication stress is a trigger for the production of aRNA and small RNA. The requirement of RPA in aRNA and qiRNA production and the interaction between RPA and QDE-1 support this model and suggest that QDE-1 may be recruited to ssDNA template by RPA. In addition, like their mammalian homologs, RPA and QDE-3 apparently associate with each other in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000496-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Since RPA can stimulate the DNA helicase activity of QDE-3 homologs in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Bachrati2">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Choudhary2">[34]</xref>, it is plausible that in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, QDE-3 and RPA are responsible for the generation of ssDNA template for QDE-1. Furthermore, the loss of QDE-1-RPA interaction in the <italic>qde-3<sup>ko</sup></italic> mutant suggests that QDE-3 contributes to this interaction. The involvement of QDE-3 in this process suggests that although RPA is involved in many processes of DNA metabolism and ssDNA is generated during normal DNA replication, QDE-1 is only recruited to the ssDNA locus if both RPA and QDE-3 are present. This conclusion is supported by the observation that qiRNA and aRNA production is abolished in the <italic>qde-3<sup>ko</sup></italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lee1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results also provide a molecular explanation for how aRNAs but not other cellular RNAs are specifically recognized by QDE-1. In plants and yeast, it was proposed that RdRPs recognize their specific templates through the recruitment of RdRP by Argonaute-siRNA complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Buhler1">[1]</xref>. However, QDE-2 Argonaute is not required for the production of aRNA and qiRNA, suggesting a different mechanism of aRNA recognition by QDE-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lee1">[24]</xref>. The results presented here suggest that since the aRNA is generated by QDE-1, the close proximity between the two allows it to use the nascent aRNA as a template to make dsRNA. Thus, there is no need for a mechanism to specifically recruit QDE-1 to aRNA. Notably, the recombinant QDE-1 forms a homodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Salgado1">[25]</xref>, and thus it may employ one of its active sites for aRNA synthesis and have the other one on “standby” to convert the nascent ssRNA into dsRNA. Therefore, the specificity between QDE-1 and aRNA is determined by their shared location and by the biochemical activity of QDE-1.</p>
<p>Although most of the in vitro DdRP products of QDE-1 are DNA/RNA hybrids, some free ssRNA can be generated, as indicated by the generation of some dsRNA from ssDNA. Importantly, we showed that RPA strongly promotes dsRNA production by QDE-1 from ssDNA by preventing the formation of DNA/RNA hybrids. Therefore, RPA may have two roles in this small RNA production process: recruiting QDE-1 to ssDNA and blocking the formation of DNA/RNA hybrids. It has been shown that the human QDE-3 homolog BLM can unwind DNA/RNA hybrids to release free ssRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Popuri1">[35]</xref>. Thus, QDE-3 may also potentially contribute to the unwinding of the RNA/DNA hybrid in vivo.</p>
<p>Although we use the DNA damage-induced aRNA as a model, the mechanism of aRNA production is most likely shared by quelling, a post-transcriptional silencing mechanism against repetitive transgenes. We showed that, like QDE-1 and QDE-3, RPA is also required for quelling. In addition, QDE-1 is recruited to the transgenic locus upon quelling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Nolan1">[26]</xref>, consistent with the model we proposed here. However, QDE-1 and QDE-3 are not required for the production of other types of small RNAs, including miRNA-like RNAs and Dicer-independent small RNAs in <italic>Neurospora</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lee2">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>The rDNA region is the only highly repetitive DNA locus in the wild-type <italic>Neurospora</italic> genome. In the case of quelling, which is triggered by the transformation of transgene DNA, a second highly repetitive DNA locus with tandem repeats of transgene is created. Thus, the repetitive nature of the rDNA and the quelled locus is likely to be the cause for aRNA and small RNA production. In <italic>Neurospora</italic>, the rDNA region is a known site of frequent chromosome breakage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Butler1">[37]</xref>. It is possible that aberrant DNA structures at the repetitive DNA loci due to mutation or recombination can result in frequent replication fork stall (enhanced by DNA damage agent treatment), which may recruit QDE-3, RPA, and QDE-1 to these loci to produce ssDNA and then aRNA and dsRNA.</p>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the partially purified RdRP RDR6, which plays an important role in RNAi pathways, has also been shown to have a strong DdRP activity on ssDNA and during dsRNA synthesis, but it cannot distinguish between template RNAs with or without a cap or poly(A) tail in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Curaba1">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, a mutation of RPA2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> impairs transcriptional gene silencing at certain loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Kapoor1">[39]</xref>. These results suggest that RdRPs and RPA may have similar roles in plants as in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, although it is possible that they may function differently from those in <italic>Neurospora</italic>. Interestingly, piRNAs from rat testes were found to be associated with rRecQ1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000496-Lau1">[40]</xref>, a QDE-3 homolog, raising the possibility that rRecQ1 may have a role in generating primary transcripts, which can be used as the precursor for piRNAs in mammals.</p>

For Western blot, a monoclonal c-Myc antibody (Roche 9E10) and anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) were used. For immunoprecipitation, anti-c-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies were used at 1∶1000 and 1∶300 dilutions, respectively.</p>

<p><italic>Neurospora</italic> strains were co-transformed with 0.5 µg pBSK<italic>al-1</italic> plasmid (contains a truncated <italic>abino-1 (al-1)</italic> gene) and 0.5 µg pBT6 plasmid. The benomyl-resistant colonies were picked and grown on slants. The colors of around 100 transformants from each strain were observed for comparing silencing (quelling) efficiency of the <italic>al-1</italic> gene.</p>
