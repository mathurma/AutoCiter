<title>EGFRvIII/STAT3/PEDF signaling in GSCs.</title>
<p>(A) IB analysis of EGFR, EGFRvIII, p-EGFR, p-STAT3, STAT3, and PEDF (in medium) in 13 GSCs. α-tubulin was used as a loading control. The two α-tubulin panels are duplicated for presentation purposes, since the same IB samples were used. EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup>/PEDF<sup>high</sup> GSCs are CSC2, X01, X03, X04, X06, X08, and X09 cells. EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup>/PEDF<sup>low</sup> GSCs are MD30, 1123NS, and 83NS cells. EGFRvIII<sup>-</sup>/PEDF<sup>low</sup> GSCs are X02, Ex Vivo, and 528NS cells. (B) Histopathology of Balb-c/nu mouse brain tissue was orthotopically injected with three representative types of GSCs (A). Upper panel is hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of the whole brain. Red box indicates a site of corpus callosum far from the injection site. This site was stained by H&amp;E, Nestin, EGFRvIII, p-STAT3, and Sox2.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002367.g001">Fig 6A</xref>, the two α-tubulin loading control panels are duplicated for presentation purposes, as the results come from the same western blot samples. The authors have provided a corrected legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002367.g001">Fig 6</xref> here.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002367.g001">Fig 6B</xref>, the CSC2 p-STAT3 panel was inadvertently duplicated in the X01 panel in the published figure. The Ex Vivo Nestin panel was also inadvertently duplicated in the 1123NS panel. This figure has been remade with the correct data (new X01 and 1123NS panels). The revised version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002367.g001">Fig 6</xref> is provided here.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002367.s001">S9A Fig</xref>, the same GAPDH loading control panel is reused in Fig 1A, due to the same RNA samples being used for both figures. The authors have provided a corrected legend for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002367.s001">S9 Fig</xref> here.</p>
<p>Due to the low resolution and quality of the published bands in Fig 1C,D,F,G,K, Fig 2C,H,K, and Fig 8D, as well as S5B Fig and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002367.s001">S9B Fig</xref>, the authors would like to provide a new file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002367.s002">S1 Original Data</xref>), which contains the original blots. <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> would like to clarify that the journal checks for such quality issues pre-publication, but unfortunately on this occasion, these issues were not noticed before the paper was published. As the quality issues do not affect the scientific understanding of the paper, the journal encouraged the authors to include the higher quality data as part of this correction.</p>

<p>(A) Semiquantitative RT-PCR of PNPLA2, PLXDC1, PLXDC2, and LRP6 in GSCs and EGFRvIII-overexpressing Astrocyte. The GAPDH loading control panel is the same as that in Figure 1A, due to the same RNA samples being used in both figures. (B) Semiquantitative RT-PCR of PNPLA2, PLXDC1, and LRP6 in X01 cells transfected with siPNPLA2, siPLXDC1, siLRP6, or siControl. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (C) IB analysis of NICD, Sox2, Nestin, and GFAP in X01 cells transfected with siPNPLA2, siPLXDC1, siLRP6, or siControl. α-tubulin was used as a loading control. (D) Sphere formation assay was performed in X01cells transfected with siPNPLA2, siPLXDC1, siLRP6, or siControl. The graph represents the average proportion of sphere number.
