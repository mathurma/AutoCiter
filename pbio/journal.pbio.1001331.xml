        <p>Laser severing of individual axons in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> revealed that the apoptotic executioner caspase CED-3 and its regulator CED-4/Apaf-1 play an unexpected beneficial role in promoting axonal regeneration.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>A critical accomplishment in the rapidly developing field of regenerative medicine will be the ability to foster repair of neurons severed by injury, disease, or microsurgery. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, individual visualized axons can be laser-cut in vivo and neuronal responses to damage can be monitored to decipher genetic requirements for regeneration. With an initial interest in how local environments manage cellular debris, we performed femtosecond laser axotomies in genetic backgrounds lacking cell death gene activities. Unexpectedly, we found that the CED-3 caspase, well known as the core apoptotic cell death executioner, acts in early responses to neuronal injury to promote rapid regeneration of dissociated axons. In <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants, initial regenerative outgrowth dynamics are impaired and axon repair through reconnection of the two dissociated ends is delayed. The CED-3 activator, CED-4/Apaf-1, similarly promotes regeneration, but the upstream regulators of apoptosis CED-9/Bcl2 and BH3-domain proteins EGL-1 and CED-13 are not essential. Thus, a novel regulatory mechanism must be utilized to activate core apoptotic proteins for neuronal repair. Since calcium plays a conserved modulatory role in regeneration, we hypothesized calcium might play a critical regulatory role in the CED-3/CED-4 repair pathway. We used the calcium reporter cameleon to track in vivo calcium fluxes in the axotomized neuron. We show that when the endoplasmic reticulum calcium-storing chaperone calreticulin, CRT-1, is deleted, both calcium dynamics and initial regenerative outgrowth are impaired. Genetic data suggest that CED-3, CED-4, and CRT-1 act in the same pathway to promote early events in regeneration and that CED-3 might act downstream of CRT-1, but upstream of the conserved DLK-1 kinase implicated in regeneration across species. This study documents reconstructive roles for proteins known to orchestrate apoptotic death and links previously unconnected observations in the vertebrate literature to suggest a similar pathway may be conserved in higher organisms.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Clinical success in reconnecting neurons damaged by injury will require detailed molecular understanding of how mature axons respond to being severed. To decipher intrinsic molecular pathways that stimulate axon regeneration, we use the small transparent model, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, in which individual labeled axons can be laser-severed without damage to neighboring tissue, and regrowing axons can be observed directly in the living animal. We find that the apoptotic protein CED-3, well known for its developmental roles in cell death, also unexpectedly acts in a beneficial role to promote regeneration of severed axons. Initial post-surgery outgrowth is impaired in a <italic>ced-3</italic> mutant, suggesting that CED-3 is involved in the early steps of axonal regeneration. The activation of CED-3 caspase in this context occurs independently of major cell death regulatory pathways, but efficient regeneration does require the caspase activator CED-4/Apaf-1, the conserved regeneration kinase DLK-1, and calreticulin-dependent calcium fluxes within the severed neuron. Our data suggest a novel conserved pathway for neuronal reconstruction, and call into question the practice of blocking caspases to treat neuronal injury in the clinic.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In the injured vertebrate central nervous system (CNS), neurons often survive and sprout but encounter extrinsic and intrinsic barriers to functional regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Sun1">[1]</xref>, with devastating consequences for victims. The successful repair of neurons severed by accident or surgery is an obvious goal of modern regenerative medicine. A more detailed understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of neuronal regeneration within a physiological context will be required for design of novel and effective therapies that could shift treatment goals from palliative care to restoration of function.</p>
      <p>Considerable understanding of regeneration responses consequent to neuronal injury has been generated via study of vertebrate models in vivo and in vitro. More recently, laser technology advanced the precision of in vivo investigation to the single axon level by enabling the axotomy of individual processes in genetic model organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Gabel1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Yanik1">[3]</xref>. Moreover, the opportunity to test individual gene activities for roles in regeneration biology in whole animal context, and now to conduct high throughput genetic and pharmacological screens for such activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Rohde1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Chen1">[6]</xref>, is contributing to rapid advances in dissection of molecular mechanisms involved in neuronal regeneration. Although very much a work in progress, the emerging picture suggests regeneration may employ mechanisms conserved across species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Wang1">[5]</xref>. For example, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, like in other models, physical disruption of an axon triggers an intracellular calcium spike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Zheng1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-GhoshRoy1">[8]</xref>. Calcium waves can originate from extracellular sources via voltage-gated calcium channels and may be amplified by release from internal stores. Elevation of calcium concentration activates signaling pathways, notably cAMP and MAPK DLK-1 pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-GhoshRoy1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Yan1">[10]</xref>, which control growth cone formation and subsequent axonal elongation through cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling. Many details of the complex mechanisms involved remain to be established, the accomplishment of which might inspire strategies for directed neuronal repair.</p>
      <p>With an initial interest in whether neurons might activate death pathways to eliminate the dissociated fragments generated by axon severing, we performed femtosecond laser microsurgeries on individual <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons that lacked cell death proteins. To our surprise, we found that dissociated fragments often persisted for significant amounts of time. Moreover, CED-3 caspase, the essential core executioner protease in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Yuan1">[11]</xref>, rather than being needed for cell fragment elimination, instead acts beneficially to promote early events in neuronal regeneration. <italic>ced-3</italic> mutations affect early regenerative dynamics with the consequence of slowing initial outgrowth and delaying the physical reconnection of the regenerating axon to the severed distal segment, although <italic>ced-3</italic> deficiency does not change long-term regeneration outcome. Core apoptotic proteins CED-3 and CED-4 are mobilized via a regulatory mechanism distinct from that involving known apoptotic regulators but which requires calcium flux and regeneration kinase <italic>dlk-1</italic>. Our data pull together disconnected observations in the literature to suggest that caspases act via a conserved mechanism to promote regenerative responses in injured neurons.</p>

        <title>CED-3 Caspase Activity Is Needed for Efficient Axonal Regeneration</title>
        <p>With an initial interest in whether neurons might activate death pathways in soma or dissociated fragments in response to severe physical injury such as axon severing, we performed femtosecond laser microsurgeries on individual GFP-visualized <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons. We find that ALM mechanosensory neurons and D-type motor neurons rarely die after laser axotomy in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Moreover, the severed dissociated processes generally persist for several days post-surgery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and can remain functional, as axotomized animals were touch-sensitive 6 h after surgery and remained so up to at least 1 wk post-surgery (see data note in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Gabel1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Yanik1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Hammarlund1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Wu1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Bourgeois1">[13]</xref>, severed processes display substantial regeneration from the soma-proximal side, with the severed stump regenerating a structure that first extends multiple spike-like filopodia and then directs further axonal extension (see Movie S1 for a typical depiction of wild type (WT) regeneration). At 24 h, roughly one third of axotomized ALM axons grew back to track along the severed distal process (see below), and the remaining axons displayed dramatic outgrowth with long and branched processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1ai–iii, v</xref>). We also noted limited regrowth responses from the end of the severed soma-distal side (see below and Movies S1 and S2).</p>

        <p>As one approach toward quantitation of the regeneration response, we measured total new outgrowth length of the proximal fragment 24 h following laser surgery for those neurons that did not regrow back into the original severed process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1aiii, v</xref>; those processes that did track back to the old distal process could not be measured as the new process could not be distinguished from the old persisting process). Somewhat unexpectedly, four independent mutants of <italic>ced-3</italic> caspase, the central apoptosis executor protease required for all <italic>C. elegans</italic> programmed cell deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Yuan1">[11]</xref>, showed markedly reduced regenerative ALM outgrowth in this timeframe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1aiv, vi, 1b</xref>), a phenotype also exhibited by <italic>ced-3</italic> D-type motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). <italic>ced-3</italic> regenerative defects in severed ALM neurons diminished with time and were no longer apparent at 3 d post-surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1d</xref>). Most severe ALM deficits in <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants occur in L4 larvae, although significant regeneration differences are apparent in young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1e</xref>). Notably, mutant phenotypes in the <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic> active-site point mutant, which is deficient in in vitro protease activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Xue1">[14]</xref>, indicate that caspase activity itself is necessary for efficient axonal regeneration.</p>
        <p>Axonal regeneration involves a complex interplay of biochemical activities within the injured neuron and interactions of the neuron with signals and structures in its environment. Thus, caspases might act directly in injured neurons, in the synaptic partners that provide guidance cues, or in the surrounding tissue (hypodermis for touch neurons) to set up conditions permissive for regeneration. To address whether CED-3 caspase activity is required within the severed neuron to facilitate regeneration, we expressed <italic>ced-3</italic> in the mechanosensory neurons of the <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic> mutant. Although like others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Shaham1">[15]</xref> we found that expression of caspase transgenes is most often associated with cell toxicity, making the generation of transgenic lines extremely challenging, we identified one low copy number transgenic line with only moderate touch neuron loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We found that the regeneration defect induced by <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic> was rescued by specific expression of <italic>ced-3</italic> in the mechanosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1f</xref>), supporting that CED-3 acts in the damaged neuron for regeneration. Of note, moderate overexpression of <italic>ced-3</italic> in wild-type neurons did not trigger enhanced regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1f</xref>), which suggests that CED-3, though necessary, may not be sufficient to promote efficient regeneration. However, because it may be difficult to achieve CED-3 cellular expression levels that permit optimal repair rather than cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s002">Figure S2</xref>), whether CED-3 might have the capacity to drive regeneration on its own remains unclear.</p>

        <title>CED-3 Acts at Early Steps of Axonal Regeneration</title>
        <p>To evaluate <italic>ced-3</italic> impact on regeneration in greater detail, we acquired time-lapse images of regrowing neurons for the first 5 h following laser axotomy. We accomplished this using nematode immobilization techniques that are stable over long time periods without the use of harsh anesthetics (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s003">Figure S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-FangYen1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Hulme1">[17]</xref>. We found that both the rate and extent of new outgrowth were dramatically reduced in <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants during the initial 5 h following laser axotomy, with total outgrowth reduced by ∼45% and the average outgrowth rate reduced by 55% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). Higher resolution analysis of initial regenerative dynamics in WT and <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants revealed three striking phenotypes in regenerating <italic>ced-3</italic> neurons that impact the sprouting of short, often transient, exploratory filipodia-like processes that dominate during this early stage of outgrowth: (1) there is a significant delay in outgrowth onset after axotomy, with first signs of re-growth appearing after 91±13 min on average in <italic>ced-3</italic> mutant axons compared to 43±8 min characteristic of WT axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2b</xref>); (2) the number of sprouts initiated in <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants is greatly diminished 0–5 h post-surgery, with the greatest effect observed during the initial 0–45 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2c</xref>); and (3) <italic>ced-3</italic> extensions often appear defective or stunted, resulting in short, wide, persistent bleb-like outgrowths that are distinctly different from the transient, dynamically active filopodia-like extensions of WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2d,e</xref>, Movies S2 and S3). These dramatic defects in the initiation of regrowth responses to axotomy in <italic>ced-3</italic> contrast with overall outgrowth scores 3 d post-surgery, which no longer show differences from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1d</xref>). We conclude that the CED-3 apoptosis caspase impacts very early events in post-axotomy filipodia extension but is not essential to regrowth per se, suggesting that, like in other <italic>C. elegans</italic> regeneration studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Nix1">[18]</xref>, additional gene activities may act in parallel to promote regeneration.</p>

        <p><italic>ced-3</italic> mutant neurons are not generally defective in developmental growth cone formation or guidance. In <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants, we observed that developmental growth cones of migrating VD motor neurons in L1 larvae exhibit wild-type behaviors when they contact a new surrounding tissue: rounded in the hypodermis, and anvil-shaped when contacting the lateral nerve cord or body wall muscle cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s004">Figure S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Knobel1">[19]</xref>. In addition, when we examined the AVM touch neuron projection to the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (a model for in vivo regenerative axon guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Gabel1">[2]</xref>) by laser dissecting the AVM process half way to the VNC, we found that the <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic> mutant shows the same ability to reach the ventral nerve cord 24 h post-surgery as the wild type (WT: 63%±9.3% reach the VNC, <italic>N</italic> = 27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Gabel1">[2]</xref>; <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic>: 64.3%±9.1%, <italic>N</italic> = 28, no statistical difference by <italic>t</italic> test). Together, these observations suggest that <italic>ced-3</italic> defects in early filopodia extension dynamics and outgrowth might be limited to injury responses, although detailed quantification of developmental outgrowth and guidance needs to be accomplished before relative roles in development versus injury can be definitively assigned.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, our high-resolution time lapse studies also revealed that the distal part of the axotomized axon, disconnected from the cell body, exhibited regrowth attempts by blebbing and extending exploratory processes initially similar in appearance to those in the proximal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2d</xref> purple arrow, Movies S2 and S3). However, in the <italic>ced-3</italic> mutant 0–5 h post-surgery, growth from the distal side of the laser cut was both delayed in onset (58±13 min in WT versus 111±22 min in <italic>ced-3</italic> distal termini, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and diminished in extent (1.8±0.2 exploratory processes in WT versus 1.3±0.2 in <italic>ced-3</italic>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

Thus, it appears that a nucleus-independent mechanism of CED-3 caspase activation lies in wait in healthy processes prior to injury.</p>

        <p>A pressing question raised by the discovery of the role of CED-3 caspase in post-axotomy neuronal responses is whether other apoptotic pathway components modulate neuronal regeneration. During <italic>C. elegans</italic> developmental apoptosis, the expression of EGL-1 (BH3 domain only protein) inhibits CED-9 (Bcl-2 family member), releasing CED-4 (apoptosis protease activating factor-1 Apaf-1 homolog), which in turn activates CED-3 caspase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Lettre1">[23]</xref>; CED-8 modulates the timing of developmental apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Stanfield1">[24]</xref>.

In the <italic>dlk-1(ju476)</italic> mutant background, weak regeneration of touch neurons severed in the adult contrasts with total block of regeneration of D-type motoneurons severed at the L4 larval stage, as we measured no regeneration outgrowth following axotomy in 22/22 D-type motoneurons (unpublished data) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-GhoshRoy1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Yan1">[10]</xref>, underscoring that different molecular mechanisms might control regeneration in different cell types or developmental stages and, more specifically, that multiple redundant pathways may influence regeneration in adult ALM neurons.

        <title>CED-3 Caspase Promotes Axonal Regeneration in a Calreticulin-, Calcium-Dependent Pathway</title>
        <p>Calcium signaling is known to play a fundamental role in the neuronal responses to damage and subsequent recovery, with acute cellular insult inducing large intracellular calcium transients important for regrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Zheng1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-GhoshRoy1">[8]</xref>. To address whether calcium signaling could play a role in the CED-3/CED-4 molecular pathway during regeneration, we performed in vivo measurements of cytoplasmic calcium levels in the touch neuron cell soma during laser axotomy using two versions of the genetically encoded fluorophore cameleon (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Laser axotomy of WT neurons initiates an immediate (within &lt;3 s) and dramatic increase of cellular calcium levels reported by cameleon-based FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6a</xref>). In two independent <italic>crt-1</italic> mutants, which lack the ER calcium-binding chaperone calreticulin known to contribute to cellular calcium homeostasis, we found neuronal damage-induced calcium signals are reduced by ∼50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6a</xref>, left panel).

        <p>To genetically address the requirement for calcium in regeneration, we tested the <italic>crt-1</italic> mutants for total regenerative outgrowth and found a significant deficiency for both at the 24 h time point, which was no longer apparent after 3 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6b,c</xref>). We noted that cytoplasmic expression of calcium-binding cameleon YC2.12, which might sequester some intracellular calcium, diminished overall outgrowth, consistent with a role for calcium in directing re-growth responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s007">Figure S7</xref>). By contrast, expression of cameleon YC3.60 that has a lower calcium binding affinity does not appear to affect regeneration (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Note that despite a dampening effect of cameleon YC2.12 on total regenerative outgrowth, the relative differences between WT and <italic>crt-1</italic> mutants in regeneration of ALM mechanosensory neurons 24 h post-surgery were maintained in cameleon-expressing lines.</p>
        <p>We examined early regeneration phenotypes in <italic>crt-1(bz29)</italic> using high resolution video analysis and found that, similar to <italic>ced-3</italic>, the first signs of re-growth in axotomized <italic>crt-1</italic> mutant neurons appeared with a significant delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6d</xref>) and that numbers of exploratory processes were highly reduced over both the 0–45 min and 0–5 h time periods post-axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6e</xref>). Our combined genetic and imaging results implicate calcium changes that are activated by injury, and dependent upon calreticulin, in initiation of regeneration. Data follow recent findings that correlate reduced calcium transients resulting from nerve damage with diminished neuronal regeneration in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (see note in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> on some experimental differences) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-GhoshRoy1">[8]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To probe the relationship between <italic>crt-1</italic> and <italic>ced-3</italic> in regeneration, we compared regenerative capacity in the <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic> single mutant, the <italic>crt-1(bz29)</italic> single mutant, and the <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic>; <italic>crt-1(bz29)</italic> double mutant. We find that regeneration deficits at 5 h and at 24 h in the double mutant were similar to those in single mutants, consistent with the possibility that CED-3 and CRT-1 act via the same pathway to influence initiation of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6b,d,e</xref>). We also found that expression of our one minimally toxic <italic>ced-3</italic> transgene in the touch neurons partially rescued the <italic>crt-1(bz29)</italic> defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6b</xref>), suggesting that CRT-1/calcium elevation might act upstream of CED-3 activation during axonal regeneration. This is in agreement with the calcium imaging data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6a</xref> showing a defect in calcium signaling in the <italic>crt-1</italic> mutants but not in the <italic>ced-3</italic> or <italic>ced-4</italic> mutants. Finally, the double mutant <italic>dlk-1; crt-1</italic> showed similar defects to the single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6b</xref>), consistent with the action of <italic>dlk-1</italic> in the same pathway as <italic>crt-1/ced-4/ced-3</italic>. Taken together, our data are consistent with a model in which <italic>crt-1</italic> could act to influence intracellular calcium signals needed for CED-4-dependent localized CED-3 activation and efficient regeneration initiation promoted in part via kinase DLK-1.</p>

        <title>Caspase CED-3 Is Needed for Early Regrowth and Appears Ready for Rapid Activation</title>
        <p>High resolution video microscopy time course studies during the first 5 h post-axotomy revealed that in wild type proximal processes, distinctive filopodia-like extensions can appear within minutes, leading to active growth cones and extensive outgrowth. In <italic>ced-3</italic>, these responses are slowed and often appear markedly defective—<italic>ced-3</italic> processes take longer to initiate outgrowth, there are fewer filopodia generated, and there is less overall outgrowth. One particularly striking phenotype is that severed processes in <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants can appear to produce extensions that do not mature into filopodia—instead, ends persist as rounded blebs that lack structure and do not extend (Movie S3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2e</xref>). Previous in vitro screens have identified <italic>C. elegans</italic> cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin, tubulin, and myosin chains, as potential CED-3 targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Taylor1">[27]</xref>; and caspases can cleave mammalian cytoskeletal proteins and their regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Mashima1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Tanaka1">[29]</xref>. Thus, although critical targets in the regrowth mechanism remain to be identified, one possibility is that CED-3 activity might induce structural rearrangements needed for efficient filopodia production by cleaving cytoskeletal proteins.</p>
        <p>Eventually, both total regenerative outgrowth and reconnection to the severed distal fragment reached WT levels at longer time points in <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants, 3 d post-surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3e</xref>). This outcome is consistent with a model in which the CED-3 caspase plays a role in the kinetics of a single regeneration pathway; alternatively, other pathways may run in parallel to promote regeneration and these other pathways may eventually compensate for <italic>ced-3</italic> defects. Given the complex processes that influence regeneration in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Chen1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Nix1">[18]</xref> and mammalian systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Rossi1">[30]</xref>, and our genetic data that suggest kinase KGB-1 acts in parallel to caspase CED-3, the contribution of multiple pathways to regeneration seems like a probable scenario. The dramatic deficits in the initiation and early outgrowth dynamics suggest that CED-3 plays a prominent role during this critical stage of regeneration. Because <italic>dlk-1</italic> is needed for early growth cone formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Hammarlund1">[9]</xref>, it exhibits similar outgrowth defects to <italic>ced-3</italic>, the <italic>dlk-1 ced-3</italic> double mutant shows similar regenerative outgrowth defects as single mutants, and elevated expression of <italic>ced-3</italic> does not ameliorate the <italic>dlk-1</italic> mutant deficit, we suggest that conserved kinase DLK-1 may be an integral downstream component of this early-acting mechanism.</p>

If caspases are found to promote mammalian axonal regeneration, regulated activation of caspase-promoted regrowth/reconnection might be used to promote functional repair in regenerative microsurgery or in injury therapy; at the same time, the use of anti-caspase therapeutics to limit neuronal loss following nerve damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Ray1">[51]</xref> might be reconsidered.</p>

        <p>Laser surgery was performed as described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Chung1">[52]</xref>. A Ti:sapphire laser system (Cascade Laser, Eclipse Pulse Picker, KMLabs, Boulder, CO or Mantis PulseSwitch Laser systems Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) generated a 1 kHz train of ∼100 fs pulses in the near infrared (∼800 nm). The beam, focused to a diffraction limited spot (using either a Nikon 100×, or 60×, 1.4 N.A. microscope objective), resulted in vaporization and tissue disruption with pulse energies ranging from 5–15 nJ. Visual inspection of the targeted neuron immediately following brief laser exposure (∼100–500 ms) confirmed successful axotomy. In some cases multiple laser exposures were necessary to generate a visual break in the nerve fiber. For 24 h regeneration measurements, <italic>C. elegans</italic> were temporarily anesthetized on 2% agar pads containing 3 mM sodium azide to allow for laser surgery, subsequently rescued, and then re-anesthetized 24 h later for imaging.</p>

        <title>Regenerative Outgrowth Measurements</title>
        <p>We targeted ALM axons 20 µm from the cell body unless otherwise stated and D-type motor neurons 20 µm up from the ventral nerve cord along the ventral-dorsal commissure. For length measurements, we calculated the total outgrowth of a neuron by summing lengths of the multiple outgrowth branches (for example, the green traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figure 1av</xref>), excluding very short branches (those &lt;5 µm long). For ALM 24 h and 72 h regeneration outgrowth analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s006">Figures S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s007">S7</xref>), regrowth of the proximal end only was monitored. The outgrowth of the distal end was measured only in data presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s004">Figure S4</xref>. The integrated lines <italic>zdIs5[p<sub>mec-4</sub>gfp]</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Clark1">[53]</xref> and <italic>rnyIs014[p<sub>mec-4</sub>mCherry unc-119(+)]</italic>, a gift from K. Nehrke, U. Rochester Medical School, were used for ALM surgeries in young adults. D-motor neuron surgeries were performed in L4 larvae using <italic>oxIs12[p<sub>unc-47</sub>gfp]</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-McIntire1">[54]</xref>. Note, at 72 h, outgrowth measurements in different genetic backgrounds (data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g001">Figures 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g004">4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g005">5b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">6c</xref>) showed no statistical difference from one another by one-way ANOVA.</p>
        <p>About 35% of WT axons reconnect within 24 h. For scoring of regenerative growth, we focused on instances in which we could get an accurate measurement of the total length and <italic>excluded</italic> these potential reconnection events from outgrowth scores, as in those cases we could not distinguish new growth from old process (the old process persists and does not lose GFP signal). Wild-type data were generated in six distinct groups, taken months apart, in strains ZB154 <italic>(zdIs5[p<sub>mec-4</sub>gfp])</italic> and KWN177 <italic>(rnyIs014[p<sub>mec-4</sub>mCherry unc-119(+)])</italic> (each group consisting of experiments run on the same or adjacent days using the same reagents). We found no significant difference between 24 h regenerative outgrowth of different WT groups and different transgenic markers (by one-way ANOVA). Wild-type data from all groups were therefore pooled together to give the wild-type measurement reported in the figures.</p>
        <p>As measured in the time-lapse analysis (see below), the effect of the <italic>ced-3</italic> mutation in the first 5 h is quite striking, featuring a deficit in exploratory processes, stunted sprout morphology not seen in WT regenerating neurons, and a general delay in response. Although conducting 5 h scoring in all genetic studies might have maximized phenotypic differences, the 24 h time point was used to evaluate relative regeneration in most genetic comparisons (most of these studies were conducted prior to the 5 h measurements that revealed early action of <italic>ced-3</italic>). Because statistically significant differences were still apparent at 24 h, and 5 h high resolution video microscopy required laborious analysis of individual movies, it would have been impractical to redo all genetic analyses for the 0–5 h time points.</p>
        <p>Light touch to the anterior part of <italic>C. elegans</italic> body is sensed through a pair of ALM neurons and the AVM neuron. Interestingly, when both ALM axons were cut 20 µm from the cell body (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and AVM was ablated, we found that anterior touch was not significantly reduced, suggesting that the severed distal processes, in contact with post-synaptic interneurons to mediate the escape behavior, maintain the capacity for touch transmission. When we cut both ALM axons &gt;200 µm from the cell body (just posterior to the nerve ring, where critical contacts to interneuron targets are concentrated), touch sensitivity was diminished. Although some axons from this axotomy distance seemed to have a directed regeneration, we did not find evidence of restored touch sensitivity even several days post-axotomy, consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Wu1">[12]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Some of our scores of extent of regeneration defects differ quantitatively from some published studies. Differences may be attributed to a number of factors, including different anesthetic techniques, neuron type studied, age, and laser surgery technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Gabel1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-GhoshRoy1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Hammarlund1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Wu1">[12]</xref>. A few teams previously reported a delay of ∼10 h in the formation of the growth cone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Gabel1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Wu1">[12]</xref>. However, using nematode immobilization techniques that do not require harsh anesthetics (microfluidic devices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s003">Figure S3</xref>), as well as a 10% agarose preparation, see below), we observed no such delay: neurons often displayed initial growth within minutes of the laser damage with average initial growth time &lt;1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). We observed more robust regeneration in ALM neurons compared to that of D-motor neurons, which may explain some of our differing results with published <italic>dlk-1</italic> mutant strains (we consistently find reduction to ∼50% 24 h regrowth rather than no regrowth; minimal but non-zero regeneration in <italic>dlk-1</italic> mutant strains has been reported in the PLM neurons in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-GhoshRoy1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Yan1">[10]</xref>). Our laser ablation technique utilizing a 1 kHz femtosecond pulse train at ∼800 nm is specifically designed to deliver precise ablation with minimal collateral damage to the animal and target neuron. Other techniques using MHz femtosecond pulse trains and conventional UV lasers produce larger regions of ablation and therefore more significant damage to the targeted neuron. Although some studies have indicated that postsurgical neuronal regeneration is unaffected by laser ablation technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Wu1">[12]</xref>, under certain conditions this may not hold true, leading to possible discrepancies in details among experiments. Despite these technical differences in the field and quantitative differences in extent of regeneration reported, basic conclusions have held across the field.</p>

        <title>Reconnection Test</title>
        <p>A significant proportion of axotomized neurons grew back to the dissociated fragment and could not be monitored for total outgrowth. To determine how <italic>ced-3</italic> caspase disruption altered regeneration outcomes in this fraction of axotomized neurons, we scored for reconnection. ALM axons were severed 20 µm from the cell body in young adults using an <italic>zdIs5[p<sub>mec-4</sub>gfp]</italic> marker to visualize processes. 12 h, 24 h, or 72 h post-surgery, neurons were inspected by eye. Neurons for which the regenerative outgrowth of the proximal axon segment appeared to track to (i.e., be in close contact with) the dissociated distal segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3a</xref>) were further assayed for reconnection using the following photo-bleaching experiment: (a) An initial image of the neuron was recorded (frame 1, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, panels iii and iv). (b) Using the laser, a second cut (yellow arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, panels v and vi) was made along the distal segment ∼40 µm from the initial cut point (red arrow) and ∼20 µm from any potential reconnection points. This effectively isolated the distal segment, where there is potential reconnection, from the rest of the process. This was important to prevent GFP refilling from the distal side. (c) The relevant segment (i.e., between the two cut points) was selectively bleached using standard high intensity UV illumination and a restricted illumination field. A second image was acquired immediately after bleaching (frame 2, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, panels v and vi). (d) After 15 min a third picture was acquired (frame 3, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, panels vii and viii).</p>
        <p>GFP fluorescence level in each frame was measured as the average intensity along ∼15 µm of the nerve process starting at the second cut point (white brackets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, panels vii and viii), minus the background fluorescence measured adjacent to the nerve process (note, the same portion of the process was analyzed in each successive frame). Percent recovery was calculated as intensity increase between frames 3 and 2, relative to the intensity decrease between frames 1 and 2: percentage recovery = (if3–if2)/(if1–if2) (where if1 is the fluorescence intensity measured in frame 1, etc.). Over the short recovery time, recovery of GFP intensity indicates diffusion of non-bleached GFP into the isolated segment through a new connection point with the regenerating neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, panel vii). If there is no reconnection, the segment is truly isolated and GFP fluorescence does not recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, panel viii). Control experiments, performed by severing the axon of an intact neuron twice and immediately photo-bleaching the isolated unconnected segment, gave an average “recovery” background after 15 min of 3.05%±0.55%. We therefore set a cutoff for successful reconnection at &gt;7.37% recovery (2 sigma from the control average). The percent of reconnection at 12 h as well as additional measurements are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g003">Figure 3b–d</xref>.</p>

        <title>Time-Lapse Imaging</title>
        <p>Time-lapse movies following laser surgery were acquired using two methods of worm immobilization: (1) microfluidic devices, the design, fabrication, and use of which followed previously described methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Hulme1">[17]</xref>, and (2) a preparation of stiff 10% agarose pads and polystyrene microspheres as described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-FangYen1">[16]</xref>. Laser surgery was performed by manual alignment, but subsequent imaging was computer-automated to allow simultaneous time-lapse imaging of up to 10 regenerating neurons in separate <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Initially movies were generated using microfluidic devices at lower resolution (30 min/frame, ×40 magnification). These data were eventually pooled with that from higher resolution movies (see below) to generate the time-lapse outgrowth data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2a</xref> (<italic>n</italic> = 43 for WT, <italic>n</italic> = 40 for <italic>ced-3</italic>). For all movies, outgrowth in each frame was measured as the contour length along the new axon growth, with branches &lt;1 µm long excluded. At each time point, mean outgrowth values were calculated across all regenerating neurons of that strain type. Regression fits to the data displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2a</xref> (by the least squared error method, KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software, and restricted to pass through the origin) were used to generate the outgrowth rates displayed in the insert. These rates therefore measure the average total outgrowth of the neurons, which at this stage is largely dominated by the creation and retraction of numerous filopodial extensions rather than the elongation of an individual branch.</p>
        <p>To generate an accurate account of the initial regenerative dynamics (the number and timing of exploratory processes displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2b–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6d,e</xref> and Movies S2–S3), higher resolution movies (10 min/frame or 15 min/frame, ×60 magnification) were generated in two ways. Microfluidic devices were used as described above, with the addition of 0.05% tetramisole in the surrounding buffer. The tetramisole worked to partially paralyze the worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Knobel1">[19]</xref> in order to keep them still enough for automated re-imaging under high magnification for long time periods. Worms were also immobilized for imaging without anesthetics, using stiff 10% agarose pads and polystyrene microspheres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-FangYen1">[16]</xref>. Data were collected for 5 h post-surgery and images were analyzed by eye (counting number and timing of exploratory processes). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g002">Figure 2b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6d,e</xref> show the results of data pooled together from the two preparations, as no statistical difference was found between results from the microfluidic devices and stiff agarose protocols.</p>

Two versions of cameleon were employed: YC2.12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Suzuki1">[57]</xref> and YC3.60 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Gabel2">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Nagai1">[58]</xref>.

Because of apparent close linkage between the <italic>ced-3</italic> and the <italic>bzIs17[p<sub>mec-4</sub>YC2.12+lin-15(+)]</italic> allele, we used a second allele expressing cameleon YC3.60 under the <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter, <italic>bzIs158[p<sub>mec-4</sub>YC3.60]</italic>, for measurements in the <italic>ced-3</italic> and in the <italic>ced-4</italic> mutant backgrounds. Images were taken every 3 s with a 300 ms exposure time. The response of an individual neuron was measured as an integration of the fluorescence signal across the entire cell soma. For the YC2.12 measurements, animals were immobilized on a 2% agar pad containing 0.05% tetramisole. For the YC3.60 measurements, the 10% agarose preparation, described above, was used. Differences in the wild type calcium response between YC2.12- and YC3.60-expressing strains could be due to a number of factors including the larger dynamic range and lower calcium affinity of YC3.60, and the different worm immobilization techniques. For these reasons we compared calcium measurements only across genetic backgrounds expressing the same cameleon variant. Likewise, our measured intracellular calcium signals differ with that of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-GhoshRoy1">[8]</xref> due to a number of possibilities including differing neuron type, calcium reporter, position of cut relative to the cell body, and the portion of cell analyzed. Strains expressing cameleon YC2.12 displayed a deficit in regeneration compared to non-cameleon strains at the 24 h time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Although we observed a general reduction in overall regenerative outgrowth for all strains expressing the calcium-binding cameleon YC2.12, the ∼50% relative reduction in outgrowth compared to WT control is maintained in the <italic>crt-1</italic> mutant in the presence or absence of cameleon YC2.12, so basic conclusions on the requirement for <italic>crt-1</italic> are not compromised by the use of the cameleon YC2.12 reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s007">Figure S7</xref>).

        <p>The true <italic>ced-3</italic> null allele has not been formally defined, although many loss-of-function mutants have been described in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Shaham2">[60]</xref>. All four <italic>ced-3</italic> alleles studied are strong loss-of-function. The <italic>n2433</italic> allele encodes a point mutation that alters the caspase active site and shows weak semi-dominance regarding apoptosis; the encoded substitution generates a mutant CED-3 that has no detectable protease activity in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Xue1">[14]</xref>. We also studied regeneration in <italic>ced-3(n2452)</italic> (a 17 Kb deletion also disrupting four other putative genes: C48D1.1, F58D2.2, F58D2.4, and F58D2.1), <italic>ced-3(n717)</italic> (mutation of the conserved acceptor site of intron #7), and <italic>ced-3(n2888)</italic> (early stop codon).</p>
        <p>The <italic>crt-1(ok948)</italic> deletion mutant deletes all but the first 21 amino acids, including the stop codon. <italic>crt-1(bz29)</italic> encodes a stop codon at position 28 and lacks immunoreactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Park1">[61]</xref>. These <italic>crt-1</italic> alleles have been suggested to be functional null alleles.</p>
        <p>The <italic>dlk-1(ju476)</italic> allele is a 5 bp insertion at G631 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Nakata1">[62]</xref>; this allele has been cited to act as a null allele for axonal regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Hammarlund1">[9]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Plasmid Construction and Generation of <italic>ced-3</italic> Transgenic Animals</title>
        <p>Plasmids were constructed using standard genetic techniques. The <italic>p<sub>mec-4</sub>mCherry</italic> vector was constructed by amplification of mCherry sequence improved for expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-McNally1">[63]</xref> using the following primers: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGGATCCATGGTCTCAAAGGGTGAAGA-3′</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGAATTCTTATACAATTCATCCATGCC-3′</named-content>.

        <p>For the construction of <italic>p<sub>mec-4</sub>ced-3</italic>, <italic>ced-3</italic> cDNA was amplified from a pool of <italic>C. elegans</italic> cDNA using primers <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGATCCATGATGCGTCAAGATAGAAGGA-3′</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CAATTGTTAGACGGCAGAGTTTCGTGC-3′</named-content> and cloned into pCR2.1 using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). For further cloning purposes, the <italic>Hind</italic>III site of <italic>ced-3</italic> cDNA was inactivated while introducing the silent mutation A to G at position 609 on the cDNA giving pCR<italic>ced-3(A609G)</italic> (QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit). The GFP fragment of <italic>p<sub>mec-4</sub>GFP</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Royal1">[64]</xref> was replaced with <italic>ced-3(A609G)</italic> from pCR<italic>ced-3(A609G)</italic> using <italic>BamH</italic>I and <italic>Mfe</italic>I sites. A fragment containing the <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter fused to <italic>ced-3(A609G)</italic> cDNA from the previous vector was introduced using <italic>Apa</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic>III sites into pDP#MM016b bearing <italic>unc-119(+)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Maduro1">[65]</xref> and giving the <italic>p<sub>mec-4</sub>ced-3</italic> vector construction.</p>
        <p>The <italic>p<sub>mec-4</sub>ced-3</italic> vector and the pDP#MM016b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Maduro1">[65]</xref> vector bearing <italic>unc-119</italic> gene were used for bombarding <italic>unc-119(ed3)</italic> animals as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001331-Praitis1">[66]</xref>.

Strains were outcrossed once before further genetic constructions. Note that the line generated exhibited evidence of some touch neuron loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001331.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and that numerous repeated attempts at generation of transgenic expression of <italic>C. elegans</italic> caspase genes were unsuccessful. This is likely due to the toxicity of elevated <italic>ced-3</italic> expression. Note that although we obtained published lines overexpressing <italic>dlk-1</italic> on extrachromosomal arrays, transgenic lines were consistently sick and array transgenes were lost at a very high frequency, precluding our ability to test <italic>dlk-1</italic> overexpression in <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants.</p>

          <p>CED-3 caspase expression affects neuronal health, but one minimally toxic low copy number line can be used for rescue in touch receptor neurons. To test whether <italic>ced-3</italic>-specific expression in touch neurons could rescue the <italic>ced-3</italic> mutation defect in regeneration, we constructed transgenic lines using biolistic transformation, which generates low copy number integrated transgenes. We first engineered a control transgenic line harboring an integrated <italic>unc-119</italic> gene (the selectable marker used for biolistic transformation, which is also a critical gene for neuronal development, see details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), indicated as <italic>Is[unc-119(+)]</italic>. <italic>Is[unc-119(+)]</italic> was crossed to the <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic> mutant to generate <italic>ced-3(n2433); Is[unc-119(+)].</italic> The <italic>p<sub>mec-4</sub>ced-3</italic> cDNA was expressed in touch neurons in the wild type and <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic> backgrounds along with co-transformation marker <italic>unc-119</italic>. These strains are indicated as <italic>Is[p<sub>mec-4</sub>ced-3]</italic> and <italic>ced-3(n2433); Is[p<sub>mec-4</sub>ced-3]</italic>. To test for toxicity associated with <italic>ced-3</italic> neuronal expression from <italic>Is[p<sub>mec-4</sub>ced-3]</italic>, we compared surviving fluorescent touch neurons visualized by the <italic>zdIs5[p<sub>mec-4</sub>gfp</italic>]transgene in wild type, <italic>ced-3(n2433)</italic>, the control transgenic strains <italic>Is[unc-119(+)]</italic> and <italic>ced-3(n2433); Is[unc-119(+)]</italic>, as well as transgenic strains expressing <italic>ced-3</italic> in the touch neurons <italic>Is[p<sub>mec-4</sub>ced-3]</italic> and <italic>ced-3(n2433); Is[p<sub>mec-4</sub>ced-3]</italic>. Mean ± s.e.m. are shown.

          <p><italic>crt-1</italic> mutant axons exhibit reduced regenerative outgrowth with calcium sensor cameleon YC2.12 in the background. Since calcium-binding cameleon might sequester calcium to change regeneration events when expressed in touch neurons, we scored our cameleon strains for regenerative outgrowth. Both WT and <italic>crt-1</italic> strains that harbor cameleon YC2.12 transgenes exhibit diminished regenerative outgrowth as compared to non-cameleon strains (WT shown, compare <italic>crt-1</italic> data with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6b</xref>). However, even with cameleon transgene expression, <italic>crt-1</italic> mutants remain ∼50% reduced in 24 h regenerative outgrowth such that conclusions on calcium signaling remain valid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001331-g006">Figure 6a</xref>). The wild type strain expressing improved cameleon variant YC3.60 showed no significant defect in regenerative outgrowth at the 5 h time point but was not investigated further since a <italic>crt-1</italic> dependence for efficient regeneration was apparent even with YC2.12.
