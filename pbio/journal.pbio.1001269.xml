        <article-title>Making Magnetic Yeast</article-title>
      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>Most organisms are simply diamagnetic, while magnetotactic bacteria and migratory animals are among organisms that exploit magnetism. Biogenic magnetization not only is of fundamental interest, but also has industrial potential. However, the key factor(s) that enable biogenic magnetization in coordination with other cellular functions and metabolism remain unknown. To address the requirements for induction and the application of synthetic bio-magnetism, we explored the creation of magnetism in a simple model organism. Cell magnetization was first observed by attraction towards a magnet when normally diamagnetic yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> were grown with ferric citrate. The magnetization was further enhanced by genetic modification of iron homeostasis and introduction of ferritin. The acquired magnetizable properties enabled the cells to be attracted to a magnet, and be trapped by a magnetic column. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry confirmed and quantitatively characterized the acquired paramagnetism. Electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed electron-dense iron-containing aggregates within the magnetized cells. Magnetization-based screening of gene knockouts identified Tco89p, a component of TORC1 (Target of rapamycin complex 1), as important for magnetization; loss of <italic>TCO89</italic> and treatment with rapamycin reduced magnetization in a <italic>TCO89</italic>-dependent manner. The <italic>TCO89</italic> expression level positively correlated with magnetization, enabling inducible magnetization. Several carbon metabolism genes were also shown to affect magnetization. Redox mediators indicated that <italic>TCO89</italic> alters the intracellular redox to an oxidized state in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we demonstrated that synthetic induction of magnetization is possible and that the key factors are local redox control through carbon metabolism and iron supply.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Most organisms do not respond to magnetic fields. However, “magnetotactic” bacteria and migratory animals can sense geomagnetic fields and alter their behavior accordingly. These organisms often contain small magnetic particles that may be responsible for sensing magnetic fields. In magnetotactic bacteria, specific genes are crucial for the formation of these magnetic particles, but no such genes have yet been characterized in migratory animals. In humans, formation of magnetic particles can be observed in the neuronal tissue in neurodegenerative diseases. One explanation for the appearance of these magnetic particles is that they are the result of alterations in metabolism, which occur in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we explore this hypothesis by inducing magnetism in yeast cells, which are not naturally magnetic and examine how changes in metabolism contribute to particle formation and magnetism. We find that yeast cells expressing a set of human proteins that sequester iron contain iron particles and become attracted by a magnet when grown with ferric citrate. Through physiological and genetic studies we show that target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling, which responds to nutritional signals, is important for the magnetization of these cells by altering the intracellular oxidation (or redox) state. We also show that genes involved in carbon metabolism affect magnetization. We propose that local redox control mediated by carbon metabolism and iron homeostasis, processes that exist in normal unmagnetized cells, are key for iron particle formation and magnetization. We conclude that magnetization of normal cells will be possible with these existing gene sets.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In biology, magnetism is a unique and virtually orthogonal physical property. As magnetic interactions can be contactless, remote, and permeable, integration of magnetic properties into biological systems provides another dimension for bioengineering and therapy. Magnetic functions may provide a unique interface between cells; for example, magnetic sensing as an input and induced magnetization as an output would allow not only magnetic manipulation but also magnetometric readout such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only a few natural systems are known to exploit magnetic function. Magnetotactic bacteria produce a chain of organelles called magnetosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Balkwill1">[1]</xref>, in which ferromagnetic magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4) particles are formed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Jogler1">[2]</xref>). The cells orient and swim along geomagnetic field lines locating better growth conditions more efficiently than random swimming (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Frankel1">[3]</xref>). In the genomes of these bacterial species, specific clusters of genes called magnetosome gene islands are conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Jogler1">[2]</xref>. The recent comprehensive study has revealed several specific genes participating in various steps of formation of the magnetosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Murat1">[4]</xref>, showing the complexity of biogenesis of the organelle. A putative iron transporter gene MagA from magnetotactic bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Matsunaga1">[5]</xref> has been shown to be sufficient for producing MRI-detectable iron-containing particles in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Zurkiya1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Goldhawk1">[7]</xref>. However, MagA gene does not belong to the magnetosome gene island and the MagA protein localizes to the plasma membrane in <italic>Magnetospirillum magneticum</italic> strain AMB-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Nakamura1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Nakamura2">[9]</xref>. To date, no other successful transgenic study for magnetosomal function has been reported. Members of magnetotactic bacteria identified so far belong to α-proteobacteria, δ-proteobacteria, <italic>Nitrospira</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Jogler1">[2]</xref>), and γ-proteobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Lefvre1">[10]</xref>, while intracellular magnetic inclusions were also found in <italic>Shewanella putrefaciens</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Glasauer1">[11]</xref> and a photosynthetic purple bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Vainstein1">[12]</xref> and a geo-biological study has presented magneto-fossils that are too large for bacteria—a possible remnant of eukaryotic biogenic magnetic particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Schumann1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Migratory animals sense geomagnetic fields, an ability called magneto-reception (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Wiltschko1">[14]</xref>). The radical pair and the magnetite hypothesis are the two proposed modes for the mechanism of magneto-reception. The former may exploit a photochemical reaction affected by the magnetic field, and the latter involves small magnetic particles in the nervous system. To date, neither physiological nor molecular mechanisms for the formation of such magnetic particles in nerve tissue are understood.</p>
      <p>However, anomalous deposition of iron is found to be associated with many neurodegenerative disorders in humans, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Dobson1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-McNeill1">[16]</xref>). Being an essential element for life, iron is reactive and prone to precipitate under physiological conditions. Some modification of iron homeostasis is assumed to induce iron mineralization in nerve tissue. Recently, an iron-export ferroxidase activity of β-amyloid precursor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Duce1">[17]</xref> was identified, indicating the importance of iron homeostasis in nerve tissue integrity. Owing to its ability to catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen radical species, high concentration of free iron ions could thus be toxic. Cells may deal with this by producing ferritin, a ubiquitous iron sequestrating protein present from bacteria to human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-BouAbdallah1">[18]</xref>. Ferritin oligomerizes to form a shell of 12–15 nm in diameter in which iron is sequestered and mineralized. Iron mishandling by ferritin causes neurodegeneration with iron deposition called neuroferritinopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Curtis1">[19]</xref>. Naturally isolated ferritin from horse spleen contains paramagnetic ferrihydrite (5Fe2O3•9H2O), and every single core (8–10 nm at most) is in principle too small to be manipulated magnetically. However, the composition may vary depending on the chemical environment as magnetite-formation of ferritin was demonstrated in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Meldrum1">[20]</xref> exhibiting superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature.</p>
      <p>Here, we address these issues by exploring the synthetic induction of bio-magnetization using a model organism budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

        <title>Ferritin Complements Iron Tolerance of Yeast Deficient in Vacuolar Iron Sequestration</title>
        <p>For biogenic magnetization, significant amounts of magnetic compounds need to be formed inside the organism. This may be achieved by altering iron homeostasis either physiologically or genetically. Since ferrous iron is prone to oxidation to insoluble ferric iron, citric acid, a chelator of the ferric ion, can be included to prevent precipitation with no impact on biological availability. Wild-type yeast cells can grow at as high as 5 mM ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) ascorbate or 20 mM ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001269-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, wild type). Ferric citrate was less toxic and can thus be used to deliver iron to yeast without damaging the cells or forming precipitates in the media.</p>

        <p>Yeast cells lack ferritin and sequester iron in their vacuoles. The vacuolar iron transporter Ccc1p plays a major role in iron sequestration, loss of which abolishes iron tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Li1">[21]</xref>. Human ferritin genes consist of ferritin heavy chain FTH, ferritin light chain FTL, and the iron chaperone PCBP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Shi1">[22]</xref>. As described previously, the ccc1 knockout strain (<italic>ccc1Δ</italic>) showed intolerance at 5 mM ferrous ion while as high as 20 mM ferric citrate is required to see intolerance of <italic>ccc1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001269-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting mitigated iron toxicity of ferric citrate. We found that single copy expression in yeast of the human ferritin gene set conferred iron tolerance to <italic>ccc1Δ</italic> both in ferrous and ferric supplements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001269-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that ferritin efficiently sequesters iron in these conditions.</p>

        <title>Altered Iron Homeostasis and Ferritin Confer Magnetism to the Cell</title>
        <p>The four strains (wild type containing empty plasmid, ferritin-expressor, <italic>ccc1Δ</italic>, and <italic>ccc1Δ</italic> ferritin-expressor) were cultured in 20 mM ferric citrate liquid medium and tested for magnetization. The cell cultures were exposed to magnets and attraction was observed. Attraction of <italic>ccc1Δ</italic> ferritin-expressor was detectable as early as 2 min after exposure. After 10 min, attraction of all strains became observable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001269-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001269.s003">Video S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>For quantitative characterization of the magnetic properties of the yeast cells, a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) was used. The cells were subjected to a measurement of their magnetic moment at 300 K at various magnetic fields to analyze field-dependent magnetization. Without ferric citrate supplementation all the four strains similarly exhibited negative values proportional to the applied field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001269-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, no iron supplemented), indicating that they are diamagnetic. As is the case for most biological materials, their mass magnetic susceptibility (m<sup>3</sup>•kg<sup>−1</sup>) was comparable to that of water (−9.051×10−9) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001269-t001">Table 1</xref>). When supplemented with ferric citrate, all the strains exhibited positive values. At high fields (2,500 to 10,000 Oe), magnetization is proportional to field and not saturating, indicating a dominant contribution of paramagnetism. At low fields (0 to 2,000 Oe), an upward concave curve of magnetization was observed, indicating additional ferro/ferri-magnetic contribution, which typically saturates within this region. This suggests that the cells contain mostly paramagnetic (or superparamagnetic) material with a slight amount of ferro/ferri-magnetic material. Mass magnetic susceptibility of the paramagnetic constituent was given based on values at high fields (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001269-t001">Table 1</xref>). Those of ferritin-expressor, <italic>ccc1Δ</italic>, and <italic>ccc1Δ</italic> ferritin-expressor were approximately 1.3, 1.8, and 2.8 times larger than that of wild type, respectively. Previous studies on magnetic susceptibility of isolated ferritin ranged from 3.7×10<sup>−8</sup> to 9.4×10<sup>−8</sup> m3/kg (originally 2.95×10<sup>−6</sup> to 7.5×10<sup>−6</sup> em in cgs unit) at room temperature, depending on the sample and measuring method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Michaelis1">[23]</xref> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Zborowski1">[24]</xref>). Thus, we observed a gain of magnetic susceptibility due to ferritin expression, while a non-ferritin contribution was also present, indicating that ferric citrate supplementation induces basal magnetization in yeast. <italic>ccc1Δ</italic> showed increased magnetization compared to wild type, suggesting that non-vacuolar iron may have more magnetic contribution than previously thought. The synergistic effect of ferritin and <italic>ccc1Δ</italic> can be explained by higher availability of iron to ferritin in the cytosol.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We demonstrated that generation of bio-magnetization in yeast is possible by three ways: modulating iron homeostasis, introducing iron crystallizing proteins, and controlling redox state. Intracellular redox state is normally sufficiently reductive to allow iron to exist as soluble Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> facilitated by <italic>TCO89</italic> led to an oxidative state that induces iron precipitation and yeast magnetization.</p>
      <p>The importance of redox state in magnetization offers insight into magnetotactic bacteria. Most of these bacteria thrive exclusively in microaerobic environments, showing their strong preference to certain redox conditions. Evolutionally, formation of bio-magnetic particles may have originated as a consequence of redox mediation and/or iron sequestration, although today's magnetosomes seem so specified to magnetic function that once formed they cannot be utilized as resources by the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Frankel1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Dubbels1">[33]</xref>. In the gradient of oxygen/iron distribution in deep aqueous environments, there may exist cells adapted to certain redox and chemical conditions that were optimal for the formation of magnetite or greigite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Kopps1">[34]</xref>. In such cells magnetization and redox metabolism could have been linked. Once magneto-aerotaxis was established, the role of iron as a redox mediator became less important as seen in today's magnetotactic bacteria.</p>
      <p>Although TORC1 activity has been suggested to be redox-sensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Dames1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Sarbassov1">[36]</xref>, its redox control has not been demonstrated. Considering TORC1 function in the regulation of carbon metabolism and energy production, which are major sources of redox flux, <italic>TCO89</italic> may control redox state through these functions. Indeed, carbon availability showed a significant impact on magnetism. In glucose-rich conditions, glycolysis and fermentation is preferred over mitochondrial TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. As the TCA cycle generates reducing equivalents that then reduce oxygen, down-regulation of mitochondrial TCA cycle may result in a shift to a more oxidized state inside mitochondria. In agreement, recent studies have detected ferric phosphate nano-particles in mitochondria from fermenting yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-GarberMorales1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-HolmesHampton1">[38]</xref>. Combined with the results that iron deposits were found in mitochondria of <italic>ccc1Δ</italic>, oxidizing conditions in mitochondria could facilitate iron deposition that has greater magnetism. Iron deposition in neurodegeneration may also be attributed to a failure in mitochondrial redox control in concert with energy metabolism because of the brain's high demand for energy and oxygen.</p>
      <p>Redox control may also aid in applications that involve biogenic metal precipitation such as bioremediation and nano-particle production. Because our choice of organism was not based on any potential of magnetization of yeast, these ideas could be easily applied to a number of other organisms to confer them with similar or possibly greater properties, or to find key components for redox control.</p>

The genes were then cloned into yeast single-copy plasmid pRS316 or multi-copy plasmid pRS416 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Sikorski1">[41]</xref>. Plasmids were transformed into BY4741 (<italic>MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0</italic>) or <italic>ccc1Δ</italic> (<italic>his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 ccc1::kanMX4</italic>). All knockout strains were obtained from Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001269-Winzeler1">[42]</xref> that have BY4741 background with gene deletion by kanMX4. <italic>TCO89</italic> gene including promoter and terminator region was PCR amplified and cloned into pRS316 or pRS426. For galactose induction, <italic>TCO89</italic> without promoter region was cloned under pGAL1 in pRS316. Cells were grown in synthetic medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base) or synthetic dropout medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acid, 0.2% dropout supplements) with appropriate carbon source (2% glucose, 2% raffinose, or 2% galactose) at 30°C. Ferric citrate and ferrous ascorbate were freshly added from 1 M stock solutions. Methylene blue was added from 10 mM stock solution.</p>

        <title>Attraction Test</title>
        <p>Each strain was pre-cultured in synthetic medium and then diluted into the medium supplemented with 20 mM iron citrate and grown overnight. The cells were collected by centrifugation and re-suspended to give 0.5 OD<sup>600</sup>. Five ml of the suspensions were layered onto 1 ml Optiprep density gradient medium (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Norway) in four-compartmented Petri dishes. Each dish was placed over a black paper sheet and axial pole magnets R848 (K&amp;J Magnetics, Inc. PA) aligned 4×4 reciprocally. For magnetic screening, 0.9 ml cell suspension was layered on 0.1 ml Optiprep density gradient medium in 24-well flat bottom plate. Block magnet BZ084 was attached from the bottom of the plate.</p>

Ultrathin sections (60–80 nm) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut-S microtome, placed onto copper grids, and stained with 0.2% lead citrate. Non-stained sections were also prepared to avoid staining artifacts. Specimens were examined on a JEOL 1200EX-80 kV transmission electron microscope and images were acquired with DITABIS digital imaging plates.</p>

        <p>Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.6 M sorbitol, dehydrated in −20°C acetone, and freeze-dried. Dried samples were encapsulated and weighted. Direct-current field-dependent SQUID magnetometry was performed at 300 K from 0 to 10,000 Oe (10<sup>3</sup> A/4 πm) using Quantum Design AC and DC Magnetic Property Measurement System. Specific magnetic moment was given by Am<sup>2</sup>/kg.</p>

MACS cell separation MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., CA) were placed in a ring magnet R848, equilibrated with ST, loaded with 1 ml cell suspension, washed by 1 m ST, then displaced from the magnet, and bound cells were released by 1 ml ST. The unbound fraction (flow-through and wash-out) and trapped fraction were measured by OD<sup>600</sup> and the percentage of trapped cells was calculated.</p>

        <p>Cells were grown in synthetic medium and harvested at OD<sup>600</sup> 0.6–0.7. Each culture containing about 10<sup>8</sup> cells was sampled, left to stand for 10 min, spun down at 2,400 rpm for 5 min, cooled on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS plus 0.01% Triton-X100, and subjected to extraction and detection using Fluoro NADP/NADPH (Cell Technology, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. Fluorescence was measured at 540 nm excitation and 590 nm emission in Wallac 1420 Multilabel counter (PerkinElmer, Finland).</p>
