To address this question, we compared the intranuclear trafficking kinetics of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNP) and non-snRNP proteins in the presence and absence of splicing activity. Photobleaching experiments clearly show that spliceosomal proteins move continuously throughout the entire nucleus independently of ongoing transcription or splicing. Using quantitative experimental data, a mathematical model was applied for spliceosome assembly and recycling in the nucleus. The model assumes that splicing proteins move by Brownian diffusion and interact stochastically with binding sites located at different subnuclear compartments. Inhibition of splicing, which reduces the number of pre-mRNA binding sites available for spliceosome assembly, was modeled as a decrease in the on-rate binding constant in the nucleoplasm. Simulation of microscopy experiments before and after splicing inhibition yielded results consistent with the experimental observations. Taken together, our data argue against the view that spliceosomal components are stored in nuclear speckles until a signal triggers their recruitment to nascent transcripts. Rather, the results suggest that splicing proteins are constantly diffusing throughout the entire nucleus and collide randomly and transiently with pre-mRNAs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Understanding the genomic program of an organism requires knowledge of how the information encoded in DNA is processed to generate messenger RNAs that can be translated into proteins. The initial products of gene transcription are extensively modified in the cell nucleus, and a major processing reaction consists of splicing of specific sequences from the middle of the primary transcripts. Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large complex composed of five small RNAs and over 100 different proteins. Spliceosomes form anew on primary transcripts and disassemble after splicing, but what triggers the recruitment of individual spliceosomal components to selected gene products is unclear. Here, we have combined imaging and computational approaches to address this question. We obtained quantitative experimental data on the mobility and subnuclear distribution of splicing proteins before and after splicing inhibition, and we applied mathematical models to analyze and interpret the results. We conclude that spliceosomal components do not require a signal in order to be recruited to nascent transcripts.

The building blocks of the spliceosome are uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (U snRNAs) packaged as ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) that function in conjunction with numerous non-snRNP proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b002">2</xref>]. The major spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles are the U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6 snRNPs. Each snRNP consists of one or two U snRNAs (U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6 snRNAs) bound by a protein complex that comprises seven common Sm proteins and one or more proteins specific to each snRNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b003">3</xref>]. The Sm proteins B/B′, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G are common to all spliceosomal snRNPs, except U6, and are arranged into a ring structure around a highly conserved single-stranded uridine-rich sequence of the snRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b006">6</xref>]. The biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs involves a sequence of reactions that take place at different compartments within the cell. With the exception of U6, which acquires a γ-monomethyl phosphate cap and is restricted to the nucleus, the snRNAs are transcribed as initial precursors that are rapidly exported to the cytoplasm where they associate with Sm proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b007">7</xref>]. Although in vitro Sm cores assemble readily on uridine-rich RNAs, in cells this process involves the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b008">8</xref>]. Assembly of the Sm core is a prerequisite for removal of the snRNA 3′ extension present in the precursor forms and hypermethylation of the 5′ m<sup>7</sup> G cap to m<sup>2,2,7</sup> G (m<sub>3</sub>G or TMG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b009">9</xref>]. The assembled Sm core and the modified cap then function as independent nuclear localization signals (NLS) for subsequent reimport into the nucleus. The m<sub>3</sub>G cap is recognized by Snurportin1, an import adaptor that interacts with importin-β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b011">11</xref>], whereas the Sm core–mediated transport is linked to the nuclear import of SMN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b012">12</xref>].</p><p>Spliceosomes form anew on nascent pre-mRNAs and disassemble after introns are excised and exons ligated. Thus, spliceosomal snRNPs and non-snRNP proteins in the nucleus can be either actively engaged in splicing or waiting for the next chance to assemble a spliceosome. When the mammalian cell nucleus is viewed with the electron microscope, spliceosomal components are detected in morphologically distinct structures termed Cajal bodies (CBs), interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), and perichromatin fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>The CB is highly enriched in snRNPs but is devoid of non-snRNP splicing proteins. Direct visualization of snRNPs in living cells shows that after import into the nucleus, the newly synthesized particles accumulate first in CBs and are later detected in the speckles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b014">14</xref>]. Several lines of evidence indicate that maturation of newly synthesized snRNPs is completed in CBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b015">15</xref>]. Additionally, CBs are likely to be sites where snRNPs are recycled after spliceosome disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b017">17</xref>].</p><p>The perichromatin fibrils correspond to nascent transcripts and appear scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, excluding regions of condensed chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b018">18</xref>]. Perichromatin fibrils are often closely associated with the periphery of IGCs, making it impossible to distinguish the two structures within the speckled pattern that characterizes the distribution of splicing factors observed by fluorescence microscopy. Whereas snRNPs and splicing proteins detected on perichromatin fibrils most likely correspond to active spliceosomes, a large body of evidence indicates that the spliceosomal components localized in IGCs are not primarily involved in splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b019">19</xref>]. Upon activation of a gene, the spliceosome rapidly assembles on the nascent pre-mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b021">21</xref>]. Conversely, gene inactivation increases the pool of “reserve” splicing factors that accumulate within enlarged IGCs. Consequently, the organization of the speckled pattern observed by fluorescence microscopy is a reflection of the transcriptional and splicing activity of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b022">22</xref>].</p><p>Although recruitment of splicing snRNPs and non-snRNP proteins to nascent transcripts has been visualized in several systems, how spliceosomal components are targeted to IGCs/nuclear speckles and what triggers their subsequent release and recruitment to nascent transcripts remain a controversial issue. Several lines of recent evidence suggest that the formation and maintenance of nuclear structures involved in transcription, splicing, DNA replication, and repair is governed by self-organization principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b026">26</xref>]. To determine whether the concept of self-organization applies to spliceosome assembly and recycling, we have compared the kinetics of snRNP and non-snRNP spliceosomal proteins as they move throughout the nucleus in the presence or absence of splicing activity. The quantitative experimental data obtained was then used for mathematical modeling. Our results are consistent with the view that splicing proteins move by Brownian diffusion and bind with specific on- and off-rates to other nuclear components.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Kinetics of Splicing Proteins in the Living Cell Nucleus</title><p>In the nucleus of mammalian cells, components of the spliceosome are found distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, excluding nucleoli, and concentrated in nuclear speckles or IGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>A); additionally, splicing snRNPs are detected highly enriched in CBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b028">28</xref>].

Nuclear speckles are identified as structures of heterogeneous size and shape with higher fluorescence intensity than the nucleoplasm, whereas CBs appear as brighter spherical foci approximately 0.5 μm in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b028">28</xref>]. The fluorescence of a small area located in each of these subnuclear compartments was irreversibly photobleached using a high-intensity laser, and subsequent recovery due to movement of non-bleached molecules into the bleached area was recorded by time-lapse imaging. All GFP-tagged splicing proteins were found to be mobile in each of the subnuclear compartments, with half-time fluorescence recoveries under 0.5 s. For all proteins, the recovery time was systematically lower in the nucleoplasm than in the speckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g001">1</xref>C). Quantification of FRAP recovery curves yielded effective diffusion coefficient values ranging from 0.70 to 1.84 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in the nucleoplasm and 0.30 to 1.22 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in the nuclear speckles. Some of the proteins investigated (GFP-tagged SmE, U2AF<sup>65</sup>, and SF3a120) also showed significant immobile fractions in the speckles. In the case of GFP-U2AF<sup>65</sup>, the apparent immobile fraction recovered completely when FRAP analysis was extended to longer periods of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030201-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating that the protein is transiently immobilized in the speckles.</p><p>Next, we compared the mobility of spliceosomal components in the presence and in the absence of splicing activity. HeLa cells were treated with 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB), a drug that inhibits elongation, causing premature transcriptional termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b029">29</xref>]. DRB is a nucleoside analog that inhibits the protein kinases that phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b030">30</xref>] and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b031">31</xref>]. Time-lapse analysis of cells expressing GFP-U2AF<sup>65</sup> revealed a rapid redistribution of molecules induced by DRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g002">2</xref>B, and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030201-sv001">Video S1</xref>). In less than 10 min after addition of the drug to the medium, the GFP-U2AF<sup>65</sup> fluorescence decreased in the nucleoplasm and accumulated in bigger and rounder nuclear speckles. The fluorescence intensities in the nuclear speckles and in the nucleoplasm were measured, and the corresponding ratio was calculated over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). Whereas in untreated cells, the ratio was 1.27 ± 0.07 (<italic>n</italic> = 23 speckles, 5 cells), after DRB treatment the ratio increased to 1.42 ± 0.08 (<italic>n</italic> = 25 speckles, 4 cells). In parallel, the average area fold increase of each nuclear speckle was measured to be 2.05 ± 0.81 (<italic>n</italic> = 25 speckles, 4 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>I). This effect was completely reverted after removal of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g002">2</xref>E, and 2H, and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030201-sv002">Video S2</xref>). Despite a decrease in the relative fluorescence intensity, splicing proteins were still significantly detected in the nucleoplasm of DRB-treated cells, indicating that spliceosomal components can localize to this compartment even when the bulk synthesis of mRNAs is inhibited. Our quantitative estimates further suggest that a larger pool of splicing proteins localizes to nuclear speckles in DRB-treated cells, consistent with the view that spliceosomal components are targeted to the speckles when not actively engaged in splicing. As more splicing proteins localize to nuclear speckles, the projected area of these structures become approximately 2-fold larger, whereas the relative concentration of the molecules within the compartment increases only by a factor of 1.12. Thus, the density of binding sites for splicing proteins at the nuclear speckles increases only marginally in response to DRB treatment.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030201-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030201.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The Transcriptional Inhibitor DRB Induces a Reversible Accumulation of GFP-U2AF<sup>65</sup> in Enlarged Nuclear Speckles</title><p>Steady-state distribution of GFP-U2AF<sup>65</sup> in the nucleus of a HeLa cell after addition (A,B) or removal (D,E) of DRB.</p><p>(A,B) Depict the same cell imaged immediately after addition of DRB (A) and 35 min later (B).</p><p>(D,E) Depict the same cell imaged immediately after removal of DRB (D) and 35 min later (E).

One possibility is that splicing proteins are constantly diffusing in and out of each subnuclear compartment; alternatively (or additionally), splicing proteins may receive signals to enter or leave a particular compartment. To start addressing this issue, we compared the kinetics of splicing proteins in the nucleus of HeLa cells that were either mock-treated or treated with DRB for 30 min. The results of FRAP experiments showed that none of the proteins tested was significantly immobilized in response to the drug; on the contrary, the recovery rate tended to be faster in DRB-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g003">3</xref>B). It is noteworthy that the apparent immobile fraction of GFP-U2AF<sup>65</sup> is no longer detected after DRB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), suggesting that the transient immobilization of this splicing protein in the speckles requires ongoing transcription.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030201-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030201.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Splicing Proteins Are More Mobile in Cells Treated with DRB</title><p>FRAP (A,B) and FLIP (D–F) experiments were performed on cells mock-treated (−DRB) or treated (+DRB) with DRB for 30 min.

A more direct demonstration that splicing proteins continue to move out of the nuclear speckles in the absence of newly synthesized pre-mRNA was obtained by fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP). A high-intensity laser was used to irreversibly destroy the GFP fluorescence in an area that corresponded to half of the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The same area was repeatedly bleached while the loss of fluorescence in a non-bleached speckle was monitored. Experiments performed on HeLa cells treated with DRB and expressing GFP-U2AF<sup>65</sup>, GFP-U2AF<sup>35</sup>, and GFP-SF1 yielded a faster fluorescence loss in the speckles when compared to untreated cells, and quantification of fluorescence intensities in nuclear speckles over time consistently revealed significantly faster kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g003">3</xref>F). We therefore conclude that shuttling of spliceosomal components between the nuclear speckles and the nucleoplasm is independent from ongoing pre-mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, the faster fluorescence recovery and decay detected by FRAP and FLIP experiments in cells treated with DRB suggests that splicing factors move more freely throughout the nucleus in the absence of transcription and splicing. Possibly, this is because the proteins spend less time bound to spliceosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>A Dominant-Negative Variant of Snurportin1 Blocks Splicing and Redistributes Spliceosome Components</title><p>Because drugs such as DRB can cause multiple effects on cells, we thought to use an alternative approach to inhibit splicing activity. We took advantage of snurportin1 (SPN1), a nuclear import adaptor that recognizes the 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (m<sub>3</sub>G) cap of spliceosomal snRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b032">32</xref>]. SPN1 is composed of two domains, an N-terminal domain required for binding to the import receptor importin-β, and a C-terminal m<sub>3</sub>G-cap binding region. The importin-β binding (IBB) domain comprises amino acids 1–65, and a deletion mutant lacking these residues (SPN1ΔN) retains full m<sub>3</sub>G-cap binding activity, but slows down or blocks the nuclear import of snRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b010">10</xref>]. Thus, SPN1ΔN appears to compete efficiently with endogenous SPN1 for binding to the m<sub>3</sub>G cap of the spliceosomal snRNPs. Deletion of amino acids 1–65 further prevents binding of the export receptor CRM1 to SPN1ΔN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b033">33</xref>]. As binding of SPN1 to either CRM1 or m<sub>3</sub>G cap is mutually exclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b033">33</xref>], the SPN1ΔN mutant most likely binds irreversibly to spliceosomal snRNPs in a dominant-negative way. To test this possibility, we fused either GFP or the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in frame to the amino terminus of wild-type (wt) SPN1 and SPN1ΔN. Although SPN1 is constantly shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, at steady state, the protein was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">4</xref>B). In contrast, SPN1ΔN appeared concentrated in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">4</xref>F). A deletion mutant of snurportin1 lacking the residues 286–360 (SPN1ΔC) showed the same distribution as the wt protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">4</xref>J), arguing that the changes observed for SPN1ΔN distribution were not a consequence of the smaller size of this protein when compared to wt SPN1. Double-labeling experiments further revealed that in cells expressing wt SPN1, the Sm proteins were normally detected throughout the nucleoplasm, in nuclear speckles, and in CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), whereas in cells expressing SPN1ΔN, the Sm proteins accumulated in enlarged speckles and no longer concentrated in CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>G). A similar result was obtained in cells expressing GFP-SmE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g005">5</xref>B), and after immunostaining with an antibody against the U2 snRNP protein B′′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g005">5</xref>D).

To determine whether the mutant affected transcriptional activity, cells expressing SPN1ΔN were incubated with 5-fluorouridine (FU) for 15 min. Living cells incorporate FU into nascent RNA rapidly and specifically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b034">34</xref>].

Similar results were observed in cells transfected with either wt SPN1 or SPN1ΔN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030201-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), indicating that the mutant does not inhibit bulk transcriptional activity.</p><p>To examine the effect of SPN1ΔN expression on splicing activity, we have used a reporter minigene transiently expressed in HeLa cells.

Cells were cotransfected with SPN1ΔN constructs together with the reporter plasmid, and the transcripts derived from the reporter were analyzed 24 h post-transfection by reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR).

The 375-bp band corresponds to the unprocessed primary transcript; the 257-bp and the 129-bp bands result from the two alternatively spliced transcripts obtained.

					 had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g009">Figure 9</xref>D). Thus, decreasing the number of nucleoplasmic binding sites in the model parameters is sufficient to reproduce the faster kinetics of splicing proteins observed in cells when splicing is inhibited. Furthermore, our analysis argues against the view that splicing inhibition leads to an increased affinity of splicing proteins for the nuclear speckles, as would be expected if the proteins were kept in the speckles until a signal triggered their recruitment to nascent transcripts.

Our quantitative photobleaching analysis of GFP-tagged splicing proteins in living cells, and our mathematical interpretation of the data, argue against the view that spliceosomal components are stored at nuclear speckles until a signal triggers their transit to nascent transcripts. Rather, we propose that spliceosome assembly on pre-mRNAs relies on a combination of continuous diffusion and transient interactions.</p><p>To study how spliceosomal components are recruited to newly synthesized pre-mRNAs in the nucleus, we determined the mobility kinetics of splicing proteins in the presence or absence of splicing activity. FRAP and FLIP experiments were performed using a number of GFP-tagged proteins. Previous studies confirmed that chimeras of GFP fused to ASF/SF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b021">21</xref>], snRNP proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b041">41</xref>], and SC35 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b042">42</xref>] behave similarly to the native proteins.</p><p>A classical approach to block splicing activity in vivo consists in using drugs such as actinomycin D, α-amanitin, or DRB, which primarily inhibit transcription. Here, in addition to treating cells with DRB, we thought to inhibit splicing activity by an independent mechanism. We show that expression of a dominant-negative deletion mutant of the snRNP-specific nuclear import adaptor snurportin1 (SPN1) specifically prevents splicing of a reporter minigene. SPN1 is an adaptor protein that binds simultaneously to the m<sub>3</sub>G-cap structure of spliceosomal snRNAs and to the nuclear import receptor importin-β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b032">32</xref>]. Like other adaptor proteins, SPN1 shuttles continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, binding cargo (snRNPs) in the cytoplasm, releasing the cargo in the nucleus, and recycling back to the cytoplasm without cargo. At steady state, SPN1 was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">4</xref>B), indicating that the protein exits rapidly from the nucleus. SPN1 is transported out of the nucleus by the export receptor CRM1, and binding of SPN1 to either CRM1 or m<sub>3</sub>G cap is mutually exclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b033">33</xref>]. Thus, CRM1 only exports SPN1 molecules that have already released their snRNP cargo in the nucleus. A SPN1 deletion mutant that lacks amino acids 1–65 (SPN1ΔN) retains the capacity to bind the m<sub>3</sub>G cap but blocks nuclear import of snRNPs because it lacks the IBB domain required for binding to and import by importin-β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b010">10</xref>]. Moreover, deletion of amino acids 1–65 prevents binding of CRM1 to SPN1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b033">33</xref>] and consequently impairs export of SPN1ΔN from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030201-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Because SPN1 binds very tightly to the m<sub>3</sub>G cap, in the absence of the competing CRM1 interaction, snRNPs are expected to remain bound to SPN1. In good agreement with this prediction, we observe a perfect colocalization of snRNPs and SPN1ΔN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g004">4</xref>G). SPN1ΔN is a small protein (&lt;45 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b010">10</xref>]) capable of diffusing through the nuclear pore complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b043">43</xref>]. In the nucleus, SPN1ΔN most probably binds tightly to the m<sub>3</sub>G cap of snRNPs, thereby blocking spliceosome assembly. Consistent with this view, we observe that splicing of a reporter minigene is blocked in cells that express SPN1ΔN, whereas splicing is unaffected by expression of SPN1ΔC, a deletion variant that lacks the m<sub>3</sub>G-cap binding domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030201-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Expression of SPN1ΔN further induces an accumulation of snRNPs and non-snRNP splicing proteins in enlarged nuclear speckles, similar to what is observed following splicing inhibition by treatment with transcription inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b019">19</xref>] or microinjection of oligonucleotides or antibodies targeted to disrupt splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b022">22</xref>]. Potential indirect effects caused by drug treatment have been excluded by showing that α-amanitin does not alter the distribution of snRNPs in the nucleus of cells that express an α-amanitin–resistant form of RNA polymerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b044">44</xref>]. Thus, it is generally accepted that the accumulation of spliceosomal components in enlarged nuclear speckles occurs as a consequence of splicing inhibition.</p><p>We also show here that expression of SPN1ΔN causes the disappearance of CBs with redistribution of coilin to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Because the SPN1ΔN deletion mutant blocks nuclear import of newly synthesized snRNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b010">10</xref>], this finding strengthens the view that CBs form as a result of ongoing snRNP biogenesis in the nucleus. Indeed, several recent studies reported the disappearance of CBs upon depletion of SMN, which disrupted Sm core assembly; PHAX, which blocked specifically the nuclear export of newly synthesized U snRNAs; or hTGS1, which impaired m<sup>7</sup>G-cap methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b047">47</xref>]. Additionally, CBs disassemble when splicing is inhibited by treating cells with transcription inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b048">48</xref>]. This further suggests that CBs are transient compartments, the maintenance of which requires both ongoing biogenesis of new snRNPs and continuous recycling of pre-existing snRNPs after each round of spliceosome assembly.</p><p>Previous FRAP studies using GFP-tagged ASF/SF2 and SC35 revealed that these splicing proteins are in constant flux and move throughout the entire nucleus, regardless of their initial location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b049">49</xref>]. Our results show that GFP-tagged versions of SC35, SF3a120, SF1, U2AF<sup>65</sup>, and U2AF<sup>35</sup> have diffusion rates in the nucleoplasm ranging from 1.2 to 1.4 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. By contrast, GFP-SmE diffuses at significantly lower rate (0.7 μm<sup>2</sup>/s). All proteins recovered faster in the nucleoplasm than in the speckles, but the difference is most striking for SmE, SF3a120, and U2AF<sup>65</sup>, which also showed apparent immobile fractions. We further show that the mobility of SmE is significantly lower in CBs than in the nucleoplasm and similar to the mobility observed in nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g001">1</xref>C). The dynamic exchange of several CB components has been previously demonstrated in both mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b051">51</xref>] and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> germinal vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b052">52</xref>]. In agreement with our results, the spliceosomal snRNP core proteins SmB and SmD1 were estimated to reside in CBs for several seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b051">51</xref>]. In contrast to snRNP proteins, coilin and SMN have residence times in CBs on the order of minutes, whereas the U4/U6 snRNP assembly factor SART3 dissociates from CBs after just a few seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b051">51</xref>].</p><p>We observed that all spliceosomal proteins are continuously shuttling between the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles, or between CBs, nucleoplasm, and nuclear speckles, and the exchange process occurs on the order of seconds. According to our previous estimates, GFP (27 kDa) diffuses in cells at 33 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b040">40</xref>], and an unbound GFP-fusion protein with approximately 60 KDa is expected to diffuse at approximately 25.3 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b053">53</xref>]. The significantly lower diffusion rates estimated for splicing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>) suggest that these molecules are slowed down by interactions with less-mobile nuclear components. Furthermore, the slower recovery observed in nuclear speckles and CBs relative to the nucleoplasm could be due to lower mobility of splicing proteins inside these compartments, transient immobilization caused by binding to fixed structures, or a combination of both. How long a splicing protein resides in a particular compartment depends on its binding affinity to interacting molecules located in that compartment, and the binding kinetics may change over time in response to specific signals. According to the latter view, the accumulation of spliceosomal components in enlarged nuclear speckles following transcription and/or splicing inhibition could result from a longer retention at the speckle compartment. However, the results of photobleaching experiments depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030201-g006">6</xref> argue against that possibility. Our FLIP data clearly demonstrate that spliceosomal proteins are constantly diffusing away from nuclear speckles independently of whether splicing is active or inactive, and the rate of fluorescence loss from the speckles increased after splicing inhibition. In agreement with these results, it was previously reported that the nuclear mobility of GFP-ASF increased after treating the cells with transcriptional inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b037">37</xref>].</p><p>The finding that inhibition of splicing activity leads to concentration of spliceosomal proteins in enlarged nuclear speckles and yet the proteins move away from the speckles at faster rates is counterintuitive. To address this apparent paradox, we performed mathematical simulations using a model that relies exclusively on stochastic processes. In our model, splicing proteins were considered as particles moving by Brownian diffusion. The nucleoplasm and the nuclear speckles were considered as regions that provide binding sites for splicing proteins. The on- and off-rates for the binding were considered to differ in the nucleoplasm and the nuclear speckles to be consistent with the FRAP and FLIP experimental data. Inhibition of splicing, which reduces the number of pre-mRNA binding sites available for spliceosome assembly, was modeled as a decrease in the on-rate constant in the nucleoplasm. Simulation of time-lapse microscopy and FLIP experiments before and after splicing inhibition yielded results consistent with experimental observations. Indeed, the model reproduced both the accumulation of particles in speckles and the faster mobility of particles. The model assumes that under normal conditions, a diffusing particle (representing a spliceosomal protein) can either bind to a spliceosome in the nucleoplasm or to unknown partners in the speckles. In a simulated steady-state situation, this results in 11% of the particles being bound to the speckles while 22% are bound to spliceosomes in the nucleoplasm. The remaining 67% are freely diffusing in the nucleus. By decreasing the number of binding sites in the nucleoplasm, splicing inhibition reduces the binding competition between speckles and nucleoplasm. Consequently, a particle has higher chances of binding to a speckle, becoming temporarily part of it. As more particles bind simultaneously to nuclear speckles, their concentration increases and the compartment enlarges. In parallel, there are more particles diffusing because they are no longer retained by spliceosomes in the nucleoplasm. In the simulations, the percentage of diffusing particles increases to 86% after the number of binding sites in the nucleoplasm is reduced. Because there are more particles diffusing, there is a higher chance that they will reach the bleach region, resulting in faster loss of fluorescence.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that the changes in kinetic behavior observed for spliceosomal proteins following inhibition of splicing can be reproduced in a stochastic model by simply reducing the on-rate for binding to spliceosomes in the nucleoplasm. Our simulations further demonstrate that increasing the on-rate for binding to the speckles would decrease the rate of fluorescence loss from that compartment, as opposed to the FLIP results obtained experimentally. Thus, it is unlikely that spliceosomal components require a splicing-dependent signal in order to leave the nuclear speckles. Rather, we favor the view that splicing proteins are constantly diffusing throughout the entire nucleus and collide randomly and transiently with either pre-mRNAs or nuclear speckle components.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture, transfection, and drug treatment.</title><p>Human HeLa cells (ECACC 93021013) were grown as monolayers in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids (Gibco, Invitrogen), and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Invitrogen).

Bleach pulse duration ranged from 2.2 to 3.1 s, depending on the size of the bleached region. Repetitive bleach pulses were achieved using the FLIP Macro for LSM software release 2.8, developed by Gwénaël Rabut, at the EMBL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/ExternalInfo/ellenberg/homepage/macros.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/ExternalInfo/ellenberg/homepage/macros.html</ext-link>). Image size was 512 × 512 pixels, and the pixel width was 48 nm. For imaging, the laser power was attenuated to 0.1%–0.2% of the bleach intensity. Images were background subtracted and registered to correct for cell displacement during image acquisition using ImageJ. Fluorescence intensity values in nuclear speckles and nucleoplasmic regions were measured over time in registered projection images using ImageJ. The data were then normalized to correct for loss of fluorescence due to image acquisition, using non-bleached cells to estimate imaging bleach kinetics. Loss of fluorescence due to imaging could reach 10%–20% over the time course of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Quantitative FRAP analysis.</title><p>FRAP experiments were performed essentially as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b040">40</xref>]. Each FRAP experiment started with three image scans followed by a bleach pulse of 110 ms on a spot with a diameter of 25 pixels (0.59-μm radius). A series of 97 single-section images (of size 512 × 50 and pixel width 48 nm) was then collected at intervals of 78.40 ms, again with the first image acquired 2 ms after the end of bleaching. For FRAP performed during a longer time, all parameters were kept the same, except the number of images, which was increased to 997 (total duration of acquisition thus increased to ∼80 s). For imaging, the laser power was attenuated to 1% of the bleach intensity. FRAP time series were analyzed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b040">40</xref>]. All fitting procedures were performed using the NonLinearRegress function of Mathematica 5.0 (Wolfram Research).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Mathematical modeling.</title><p>In our model, the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles were defined as circular regions with radii 8 μm and 0.7 μm, respectively, and the number of speckles was <italic>n</italic><sub>s</sub> = 14.

These probabilities are position-dependent, being different for the nucleoplasm and the speckles. Within the nucleoplasm and the nuclear speckles, we assumed that binding sites were distributed homogeneously. The values for <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> were empirically selected from FRAP and FLIP simulations.

The probability that a fluorescent molecule is bleached is <italic>p</italic><sub>bleach</sub> = 1 − exp(−<italic>K<sub>B</sub></italic>Δ<italic>t</italic>) inside the bleaching region. For FRAP simulations, the bleach region consisted of a circular area (0.7-μm radius) positioned either in the nucleoplasm or in a nuclear speckle, and for FLIP simulations, half of the circle representing the nucleus was bleached. In a simulation step, for each molecule, a random number α with uniform probability density was generated in the interval [0,1]. The random number generator used is based on an implementation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/fmg-members/geoff/mtwist.html" xlink:type="simple">http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/fmg-members/geoff/mtwist.html</ext-link>) of the Mersenne-Twister algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030201-b059">59</xref>], which generates deviates with uniform distribution. For a non-bound molecule, the binding reaction occurs if α &lt; <italic>p<sub>Bind</sub></italic>. If α &gt; <italic>p<sub>Bind</sub></italic>, then the molecule moves to another random location according to the Brownian motion algorithm. Molecules are constrained to move inside the nucleus. Bound molecules maintain their current coordinates and are freed from their sites only if α &lt; <italic>p<sub>unbind</sub></italic>. Fluorescent molecules are bleached if the particle is located inside the bleach region and if a random number β in the interval [0,1] is smaller than <italic>p<sub>bleach</sub></italic>.
