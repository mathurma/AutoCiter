<abstract>
<p>To survive starvation, the bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> forms durable spores. The initial step of sporulation is asymmetric cell division, leading to a large mother-cell and a small forespore compartment. After division is completed and the dividing septum is thinned, the mother cell engulfs the forespore in a slow process based on cell-wall degradation and synthesis. However, recently a new cell-wall independent mechanism was shown to significantly contribute, which can even lead to fast engulfment in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 60 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the cases when the cell wall is completely removed. In this backup mechanism, strong ligand-receptor binding between mother-cell protein SpoIIIAH and forespore-protein SpoIIQ leads to zipper-like engulfment, but quantitative understanding is missing. In our work, we combined fluorescence image analysis and stochastic Langevin simulations of the fluctuating membrane to investigate the origin of fast bistable engulfment in absence of the cell wall. Our cell morphologies compare favorably with experimental time-lapse microscopy, with engulfment sensitive to the number of SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH bonds in a threshold-like manner. By systematic exploration of model parameters, we predict regions of osmotic pressure and membrane-surface tension that produce successful engulfment. Indeed, decreasing the medium osmolarity in experiments prevents engulfment in line with our predictions. Forespore engulfment may thus not only be an ideal model system to study decision-making in single cells, but its biophysical principles are likely applicable to engulfment in other cell types, e.g. during phagocytosis in eukaryotes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>When the bacterium <italic>B. subtilis</italic> runs out of food, it undergoes a fundamental development process by which it forms durable spores. Sporulation is initiated by asymmetric cell division after which the larger mother cell engulfs the smaller forespore, followed by spore maturation and release. This survival strategy is so robust that engulfment even proceeds when cells are deprived of their protective cell wall. Under these severe perturbations, 60 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the mother cells still engulf their forespores in only 10 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the normal engulfment time, while the remaining 40 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of mother cells withdraw from engulfment. This all-or-none outcome of engulfment suggests decision-making, which was recently also identified in other types of engulfment, e.g. during phagocytosis when immune cells engulf and destroy pathogens. Here, we developed a biophysical model to explain fast bistable forespore engulfment in absence of the cell wall and energy sources. Our discovered principles may prove very general, thus predicting key ingredients of successful engulfment across all kingdoms of life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To survive starvation the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> develops durable spores among other survival strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Tan1">[1]</xref>. During sporulation, bacteria go through a costly developmental process under limited energy resources. The initial morphological step of sporulation is asymmetric cell division, resulting in a large mother-cell and a small forespore compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Stragier1">[2]</xref>. Subsequently, the dividing septum is largely degraded and the mother-cell membrane moves around the forespore. This membrane movement is similar to phagocytosis whereby immune cells clear our bodies from pathogens and other particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Swanson1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Underhill1">[4]</xref>. Finally, the engulfed forespore matures into a spore and the mother cell lyzes for its release. The origin of the engulfment force has been a topic of current research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-AbanesDeMello1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Rodrigues1">[11]</xref>. Cell-wall degradation and new cell-wall deposition were shown to play a significant role in advancing the mother-cell membrane leading edge. Strikingly, when the cell wall is enzymatically removed engulfment still occurs, surprisingly taking only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 1–2 min compared to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 45 min with the cell wall (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003912.s001">Movie S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, engulfment is successful in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 60 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of cells while the remaining <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 40 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> retract. This observation raises questions on the origin of bistability and decision-making in relatively simple systems under severe energy limitations.</p>

<p>In the absence of the cell wall, migration of the mother-cell membrane around the forespore depends on the two membrane proteins that bind each other with high affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Meisner1">[12]</xref>, constituting a backup mechanism under severe perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Gutierrez1">[13]</xref>: SpoIIQ expressed in the forespore and SpoIIIAH expressed in the mother cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Levdikov1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Meisner2">[15]</xref>(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g001">Fig. 1A–D</xref>). To facilitate engulfment a physical mechanism similar to a Brownian ratchet was proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>. Specifically, thermal fluctuations move the leading membrane edge forward, thus establishing new SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH bonds that prevent backward membrane movement. One striking feature, however, is that the membrane cup surrounding the forespore is very thin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, top). This either indicates a fast nonequilibrium mechanism for engulfment or additional forces that produce high membrane curvatures around the cup's neck region. Even though modeling of similar processes such as membrane budding and phagocytosis helped us understand the role of physical constraints on engulfment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Herant1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Herant2">[19]</xref>, quantitative modeling of forespore engulfment as a fundamental development process is still missing.</p>
<p>Here, using image analysis, Langevin simulations and simple analytical approaches we show that fast forespore engulfment in the absence of the cell wall occurs below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 1 min, consistent with out-of-equilibrium dynamics driven by strong SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH binding. Furthermore, we find physical parameter regimes responsible for bistable engulfment, including the number of bonds necessary for threshold-like engulfment and suitable osmotic pressures. The former prediction matches previously published data, while we successfully tested the latter with time-lapse microscopy. Hence, our model makes testable predictions on the measurable physical parameters leading to fast, energy-efficient engulfment. Forespore engulfment in the absence of the cell wall is thus an ideal system to study phagocytosis-like processes and decision-making in single-cell organisms.</p>

<title>Image analysis reveals drastic mother-cell volume loss</title>
<p>To better understand the process of engulfment in the absence of the cell wall, we analyzed the volume and surface area of sporulating cells treated with cell-wall removal enzyme (lysozyme) from previously published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>. For this purpose we used the semi-automated image-analysis software JFilament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Smith1">[20]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Briefly, JFilament software allows assisted manipulation of active contours that comply with the bright linear structures of the images. Therefore, membranes that were fluorescently stained with FM 4–64 were easily tracked over time. Information about cell-membrane position in the medial focal plane was used to calculate volume and surface area assuming rotational symmetry around the axis connecting mother and forespore center of mass.</p>
<p>Upon cell-wall removal, a drastic volume loss of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 35 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in engulfing mother cells was observed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The onset of volume loss for each cell was set to 0 min, and surface area and engulfment measurements were aligned in time based on this time point. Similar analyses showed that no changes in forespore volume were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, surface-area analysis during engulfment did reveal a minor reduction of the mother-cell surface by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 5–15 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), depending on the assumed shapes of the progressing membrane in the image analysis. To correlate the drastic volume loss with the onset of engulfment we created kymographs along the fluorescently labeled forespore membranes of the engulfing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig. 2C and D</xref>). Extracting from the kymographs the percentage of forespore engulfment over time revealed that engulfment in the absence of the cell wall occurs on a time scale of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 1–2 min as opposed to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 45 min with the cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Meyer1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<title>Image analysis reveals mother-cell volume loss during engulfment.</title>
<p>(A–D) Using active contours we measured volume, surface area, and engulfment over time for mother cells and forespores (for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The onset of volume loss for each cell was set to 0 minutes and all cell measurements were aligned in time based on 0' points. 3D volume and surface area were calculated assuming rotational symmetry around the axis that connects center of masses of forespore and mother cells. All analysis was performed on previously published movies from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>. (A) Mother-cell volume loss amounts to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 35 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> during engulfment, while forespore volume remains the same. (Inset) Typical cell shrinks longitudinally causing volume loss. (B) Surface area for mother cell was calculated using two models, termed “tight cup” or “broad cup” shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>. The broad-cup model is assumed for times <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 0' as no morphological membrane changes occur for these times (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The mother-surface area reduction is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 5–15 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while forespore-surface area remains the same. (C) Engulfment shown by FM 4–64 kymograph (pixel intensities along the forespore contour versus time) of a single representative cell treated with lysozyme coincides with onset of volume loss. (D) Average engulfment over time. (Inset) Cross-correlation coefficient versus time showing anticorrelation between mother-cell volume and engulfment, and mother-surface area and engulfment. No time delays were observed. Average +/- SEM of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>  = 6 cells.</p>

<p>Calculating cross-correlations we found significant anticorrelations between volume and engulfment, and surface area and engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). No time delays were detected (the minimum of the cross-correlation function is at 0 min) at a sampling rate of 1.3 frame/min (for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). However, under the same experimental conditions no volume or surface-area losses were observed in cells lacking SpoIIQ or SpoIIIAH zipper-molecules after cell-wall removal (see Fig. S1). Therefore, this led us to conclude that the drastic volume loss may play a facilitating role in engulfment.</p>

<title>Cup shape dynamically changes from broad to thin</title>
<p>During fast engulfment the mother-cell membrane drastically changes shape. Based on fluorescence intensity measurements, a very thin and tight cup was proposed at the late stage of engulfment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 20 min after cell-wall removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>. However, this tight cup amounts to very high membrane curvatures. Therefore, we wondered how the thin cup with high membrane-bending energy may emerge from an initial broad cup, as observed in cells prior to cell-wall removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, top). To answer this question, we analyzed fluorescence images in two channels: fluorescent FM 4–64 (red) that uniformly binds to all membranes exposed to the medium, and SpoIIIJ-GFP (green), a labeled protein that is only expressed in the mother cell where it is uniformly recruited to the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>.</p>

Fluorescent FM 4–64 labels all membrane exposed to medium, while SpoIIIJ-GFP localizes at the mother-cell membrane only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>. Therefore, the “tight-cup” model predicts four membrane folds at the mother-forespore boundary in the FM 4–64 channel and three membrane folds observed in the GFP channel. Likewise, “broad-cup” model predicts two membrane folds in the FM 4–64 channel and a single membrane in the GFP channel. (B–C) For a single cell at certain time points two average intensities were measured: average pixel intensity of mother-forespore boundary (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and average pixel intensity of mother membrane far from the boundary (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> versus time is plotted for FM 4–64 channel (B) and for SpoIIIJ-GFP (C). As before, time 0' is the onset of volume loss (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Average +/− SEM for different cells is plotted.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> the tight-cup model predicts four membrane folds at the mother-forespore boundary in the FM 4–64 channel and three membrane folds in the GFP channel. Likewise, the broad cup model predicts two membrane folds in the FM 4–64 channel and a single membrane in the GFP channel. To quantify the transition from a broad to the proposed thin cup we measured the average intensity of the mother-forespore boundary (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and mother-cell membrane intensity far from the boundary (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then used to determine the number of membrane folds on the mother-forespore interface. Relative boundary analysis of FM 4–64 intensity revealed that during late-stage engulfment cup shape conforms in between a broad and tight cup with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 3.5 membrane folds on the mother-forespore interface. Similarly, analysis of the noisy GFP channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003912.s002">Movie S2</xref>) suggests that a broad cup indeed undergoes a transition towards a thin cup through significant morphological changes at the onset of engulfment. To quantitatively explain the observed volume loss, membrane morphological changes, and fast bistable engulfment, we implemented a biophysical model of forespore engulfment using Langevin dynamics.</p>

<title>Biophysical model of engulfment</title>
<p>We hypothesized that thin cups form due to fast nonadiabatic engulfment away from equilibrium. If, however, it turns out that the engulfment dynamics are not fast enough under biophysical membrane constraints, then additional forces would need to be postulated to produce such high-curvature membrane features. To test our hypothesis we used Langevin dynamics that account for out-of equilibrium processes.</p>
<p>In our model the 3D mother-cell membrane is represented by a string of beads assuming rotational symmetry around the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-axis, while the forespore membrane was modeled as a hard sphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Indeed, experiments show negligible deformation of the forespore during engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). Specifically, the Langevin dynamic equation of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bead at position <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by:</p>

<p>The membrane-bending force (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) restores the curved membrane to the equilibrium flat configuration. The stochastic term (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is used to simulate thermal fluctuations with an effective temperature representing a driving force for the leading-edge ratchet movement. The amplitude of the membrane thermal fluctuations is chosen to be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 15 nm (see Fig. S2) as typically observed for lipid bilayers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Sackmann1">[22]</xref> and red-blood cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Betz1">[23]</xref>. The zipper-molecule force (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) accounts for the high binding affinity between SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Meisner2">[15]</xref>. This zipper mechanism is a strong driving force of the membrane leading edge. For the zipper-protein surface density (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) we initially chose the maximum possible value that corresponds to a single molecule per 100 nm<sup>2</sup> of membrane (based on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 10 nm for the size of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Levdikov1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Meisner2">[15]</xref> and assumed dense packing). The surface-tension force (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is characterized by linear (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and nonlinear (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) surface tensions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Herant1">[16]</xref>. The force due to osmotic pressure (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is characterized by the pressure difference (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) between inner and outer medium. While the surface-tension term causes membrane contraction, the pressure-difference term produces volume expansion. In thermal equilibrium these two forces balance each other. An example of an implemented simulation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>.</p>
<p>To validate our simulations we considered a spherical mother cell prior to engulfment, allowing us to quantify membrane fluctuations in thermal equilibrium. Specifically, we used the Langevin equation without the zipper term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the right-hand side of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003912.e046">Eq. 1</xref>.

This validation showed that our 3D model of the mother cell has indeed appropriate membrane biophysical properties.

In the region between retraction and thin cups we also observed successful engulfment but with adiabatic broad cups resulting in almost spherical mother cells.</p>
<p>In the region of thin cups engulfment is fast, taking only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 1–2 s which is even faster than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 1–2 min from experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). We attributed this time discrepancy to the limiting factor of cell-wall removal in the experimental setup, since residues of the cell wall can prevent significant membrane fluctuations in our simulations, therefore delaying engulfment (Fig. S4). Indeed, movies of engulfment show elongated cells even minutes after addition of lysozyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, top, at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> min (the onset of volume loss) the engulfing mother cell still has elongated shape even though this is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> min after lysozyme treatment. To explore possible simulated engulfment times we varied the kinematic parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that represents the effective medium viscosity. This parameter sets the time scale of engulfment but does not influence the morphology of the engulfing cup (Fig. S5). We found that even for extremely high, experimentally observed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, simulated engulfment times are still about an order of magnitude smaller than the experimentally observed engulfment times (Fig. S5).</p>
<p>To better understand physical changes of the simulated mother cell during engulfment, we plotted volume and surface area relative to their initial values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g005">Fig. 5C and D</xref>). In the parameter region of successful engulfment we observed a mother-cell volume loss of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 0.2<italic> µ</italic>m<sup>3</sup>, which corresponds to the forespore volume. However, the experimentally observed mother-cell volume loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) is about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 2 times higher. Furthermore, simulated surface areas increase in this region, while experimentally observed surface areas decrease slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This discrepancy may be explained by effects not included in our simulations, e.g. cytosol leakage (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

Since in experiments the expression of SpoIIQ was reduced compared to wild-type cells, we assumed that the pool of SpoIIIAH molecules is large compared to SpoIIQ. Therefore, the limiting factor in engulfment is attributed to the surface concentration of SpoIIQ proteins.

<title>Experimental test of model predictions</title>
<p>Our model predicts that high osmotic pressure differences across the mother-cell membrane lead to swelling, reduced membrane fluctuations and membrane retraction, therefore preventing the completion of engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g005">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). To assess the validity of these predictions, we followed the progression of engulfment in absence of the cell wall for different osmotic conditions by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Briefly, we resuspended sporulating cells in SMM buffer, either with 0.5 M sucrose to support protoplast engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003912.s001">Movie S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref> or without sucrose, leading to an increase in the osmotic pressure difference between the cytoplasm and the extracellular medium. We then stained cell membranes with FM 4–64, added lysozyme to remove the cell wall, and performed time-lapse microscopy as the cell wall was degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). In the presence of 0.5 M sucrose, more than 50 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the cells completed engulfment as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003912.s001">Movie S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we presented image analysis and modeling of forespore engulfment in the absence of the cell wall. Image analysis showed that engulfment occurs extremely fast (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 1–2 min compared to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 45 min with the cell wall), accompanied by a drastic volume loss (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 35 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the mother cell. During engulfment the initial broad cup dynamically changes to a thin cup, forming high-curvature membrane folds at the intersection between mother cell and forespore. Using Langevin simulations we showed that a Brownian ratchet model reproduces fast, out-of-equilibrium engulfment. Additionally, we numerically determined regions of engulfment and retraction, and predicted the number of SpoIIQ molecules necessary for successful engulfment. Similar, out-of-equilibrium Brownian ratchet mechanisms were previously used to explain molecular-motor directional movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Astumian1">[29]</xref>, Lysteria motility from actin comets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Mogilner1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Zhu1">[31]</xref>, filapodia protrusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Peskin1">[32]</xref>, and unidirectional movement of other microscopic objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-DiLeonardo1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our model makes a number of predictions. The phase diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> predicts engulfment success and mother-cell morphology for a wide range of surface tensions(<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and pressure differences (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). For example, for a given SpoIIQ surface density, high surface tension restricts the engulfment region while high osmotic pressure prevents engulfment. To test this prediction we increased the osmotic pressure difference by lowering the osmolarity of the suspended buffer. Decreased osmolarity indeed caused mother-cell swelling and stopped engulfment in line with our predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Another prediction, such as the need for an excess of mother-cell membrane, might be tested by controlling the production of FapR, the major lipid homeostasis regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Schujman1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Zhang1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>There are a number of model limitations, which raise interesting issues. Based on our current model there is no stabilizing force for maintaining high curvatures (thin cups) once engulfment is accomplished. Therefore, the restoring constrain forces (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and bending force (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) will flatten high curvatures within <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 1 s on the length scale of 1<italic> µ</italic>m (see Fig. S3C and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003912.e200">Eq. 11</xref>). To estimate the force necessary to prevent membrane flattening we measured restoring forces in the neck region after engulfment is completed (Fig. S6). Typical radial forces were about 10 pN. Three factors can contribute to experimentally observed “snowman-like” shapes at late stages of engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, top): residues of the mother cell wall, potential outer/inner membrane binding, and lipid/protein sorting. These factors could be investigated experimentally. First, fluorescent cell-wall labeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Kuru1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Liechti1">[37]</xref> could rule out possible remnants of cell wall after lysozyme treatment, which may preserve high membrane curvatures (see also Fig. S4). Second, thin cups could also form if an unknown cohesive factor binds to outer and inner cup membrane thus preventing their separation. Third, membrane lipids that localize to high negative curvatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Kawai1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Govindarajan1">[40]</xref> together with curvature sensing proteins such as SpoVM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Ramamurthi1">[41]</xref> could contribute to the formation of stable structures preventing membrane flattening. To better explore this stabilizing mechanism we simulated engulfment with membranes that have positive and negative intrinsic curvatures <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Fig. S7). We found that successful engulfment proceeds in range (−120 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 20)<italic> µ</italic>m<sup>−1</sup>. Interestingly, high negative curvatures prevent membrane flattening by forming tight and thin cups in the neck region typical for the snowman shape (Fig. S7, bottom, left). Therefore, the stability of tight cups after engulfment completion should be a topic of future experimental investigation, leading to better insights and advancement in modeling.</p>
<p>Our current model fell short in reproducing the exact volume loss and surface-area conservation. To numerically find parameter regimes that lead to thin cups and observed volume and surface-area changes, we constructed a new albeit less physically grounded model with explicit volume and surface-area constraints (see Fig. S8 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003912.s005">Text S1</xref>). Using this model we determined the parameter region in which experimentally observed volume and surface-area changes occur similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003912-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. As a result, engulfment occurs when either volume or surface area is not conserved as previously proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Lizunov1">[42]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003912.s003">Movie S3</xref>). Volume loss may contribute to engulfment by effectively decreasing the surface tension, therefore boosting excess membrane for forespore engulfment. However, by close inspection of sporulating cells, we observed leakage of the cytosol in one of the cells after membrane removal at the onset of volume loss (Fig. S9). This direct loss of cytosol was not explicitly included in our models. One plausible interpretation of volume loss can be attributed to the hypertonic solution of suspended buffer containing 0.5 M of sucrose and producing an osmotic pressure of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 12 atm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Broder1">[8]</xref>. Although this pressure is comparable to osmotic pressures inside of bacteria to balance pressures across the membrane, water leakage from bacteria and/or partial lyses after cell-wall removal is expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Koch1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Misra1">[44]</xref>. Therefore, future experiments may help address this issue.</p>
<p>An important future goal is the theoretical understanding of forespore engulfment in the presence of the cell wall, including membrane fission as the last stage of engulfment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Doan2">[45]</xref>. High turgor pressure and constraints from the cell wall and septum must provide difficult constraints for the engulfing mother cell, partially explaining the long engulfment time. In the presence of the cell wall, it has been proposed that peptidoglycan hydrolysis and new cell-wall deposition play major roles in the leading-edge membrane movement around the forespore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-AbanesDeMello1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Doan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Morlot1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Rodrigues1">[11]</xref>. First, membrane proteins SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP (DMP) form a complex and localize to the leading edge of the moving membrane. Since SpoIID and SpoIIP degrade peptidoglycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-AbanesDeMello1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Chastanet1">[46]</xref> and play an important role for thinning the septum, it has been proposed that the DMP complex is a processive motor for membrane advancement. However, a mechanistic description of this motor is still missing. Second, new cell-wall deposition at the leading edge may provide an additional motor-like mechanism for membrane movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Meyer1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Tocheva1">[47]</xref>. A similar mechanism was proposed for cytokinesis of fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, where polymerizing septum fibrils contribute to inward septum ingression. Using Brownian ratchet modeling of this process it was estimated that a single <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-glucan fibril can exert polymerization force of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003912.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 10 pN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Proctor1">[48]</xref>. Together, future modeling will produce a better understanding of the complicated process of forespore engulfment and decipher the contributions from each mechanism towards the total force at the leading membrane edge.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our quantitative model of engulfment in absence of the cell wall provided first insights into mother-cell morphologies, such as cup shape, engulfment dynamics, and bistability. Due to simplicity from cell-wall removal, energy limitations, and absence of cytoskeletal cortex, forespore engulfment could present a minimal system for studying bistability and decision-making. Interestingly, bistability and commitment to engulf were previously identified in phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Tollis1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Zhang2">[49]</xref>, thus showing similarities to forespore engulfment. This similarity becomes enhanced, if we speculate that the SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH backup mechanism may instead be the original core mechanism, which may have evolved before the more complex DMP-based mechanism. In fact, the C-terminal domain of SpoIIIAH is homologous to YscJ/FliF protein family forming multimeric rings in type-III secretion system and flagella motors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Meisner3">[50]</xref>, pointing towards an ancient mechanism. General biophysical principles may also apply to other types of engulfment including the penetration of the red blood cell by the malaria parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003912-Cowman1">[51]</xref>.</p>
