<abstract>
<p>How learned experiences persist as memory for a long time is an important question. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the persistence of memory is dependent upon amyloid-like oligomers of the Orb2 protein. However, it is not clear how the conversion of Orb2 to the amyloid-like oligomeric state is regulated. The Orb2 has two protein isoforms, and the rare Orb2A isoform is critical for oligomerization of the ubiquitous Orb2B isoform. Here, we report the discovery of a protein network comprised of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), Transducer of Erb-B2 (Tob), and Lim Kinase (LimK) that controls the abundance of Orb2A. PP2A maintains Orb2A in an unphosphorylated and unstable state, whereas Tob-LimK phosphorylates and stabilizes Orb2A. Mutation of LimK abolishes activity-dependent Orb2 oligomerization in the adult brain. Moreover, Tob-Orb2 association is modulated by neuronal activity and Tob activity in the mushroom body is required for stable memory formation. These observations suggest that the interplay between PP2A and Tob-LimK activity may dynamically regulate Orb2 amyloid-like oligomer formation and the stabilization of memories.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The formation of stable long-term memories involves the synthesis of new protein, however the biochemical basis of this process is unclear. A family of RNA binding proteins, Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding (CPEB) proteins, are known to regulate synaptic activity and stabilization of memory. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> CPEB is called Orb2, and its amyloid-like oligomers are critical for the persistence of long-lasting memories. Amyloid formation is often unregulated and stochastic in nature, and the amyloid state is usually dominant and self-sustaining. However, to serve as a substrate for long-lasting memory, the amyloid-like oligomerization of Orb2 must be regulated in a space-, time-, and stimulus-specific manner. Orb2 has two protein isoforms: Orb2A, which is present only in low abundance, and Orb2B, which is the abundant form. Orb2A is important for oligomerization as well as memory persistence. Previous studies suggested that Orb2A may act as a seed to induce oligomerization of the constitutive Orb2B isoform. Therefore, the availability of Orb2A protein would be an important determinant of Orb2 oligomerization. Here we have analyzed how Orb2 conversion to the oligomeric state is regulated. We find that Orb2A is a very unstable protein and that phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of this isoform via canonical neuronal signaling modules can regulate Orb2A stability, and thereby its abundance. We also show that Tob, a known regulator of CPEB-mediated translation, acts as a stabilizer for Orb2A and triggers Orb2 oligomerization. These observations suggest that amyloid formation can be regulated in a dynamic manner by controlling the availability of the seeding Orb2A protein.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synthesis of new protein is important for the formation of stable memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Sutton1">[1]</xref>. The Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding (CPEB) proteins are a family of RNA binding proteins that regulate the translation and subcellular distribution of a specific set of cellular mRNAs in various cell types including neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Richter1">[2]</xref>. Previous studies found that some CPEB family members play a causal role in long-term change of synaptic activity and in stabilization of memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Keleman1">[3]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Wu1">[9]</xref>. For example, in marine snail <italic>Aplysia</italic>, in the absence of a neuron-specific <italic>Ap</italic>CPEB, serotonin mediated enhancement of synaptic transmission fails to persist beyond 24 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Si2">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Miniaci1">[10]</xref>. Likewise, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CPEB, Orb2, is required specifically for long-term memory but not for learning or short-term memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Keleman1">[3]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>. In humans, a particular CPEB family member, CPEB3, has been linked to episodic memory formation, suggesting a conserved role of CPEB in synaptic plasticity and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Vogler1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <italic>Ap</italic>CPEB and Orb2 form self-sustaining amyloidogenic oligomers (prion-like) in response to the neurotransmitters serotonin in <italic>Aplysia</italic> and octopamine or tyramine in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Si1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Heinrich1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Raveendra1">[13]</xref>. More importantly, the oligomeric CPEB is required for the persistence of synaptic facilitation in <italic>Aplysia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Si1">[6]</xref> and for the stabilization of memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>. These observations led us to propose that the persistent form of memory recruits an amyloidogenic oligomeric form of neuronal CPEB to the activated synapse, which in turn maintains memory through the sustained, regulated synthesis of a specific set of synaptic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>. However, considering the dominant and stable nature of amyloids, a central question is how the conversion of neuronal CPEB to the amyloidogenic state is regulated to confer activity dependence and restrict it to the relevant neuron/synapse.</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Orb2 gene has two protein isoforms, Orb2A and Orb2B, and the oligomers are composed of both Orb2A and Orb2B. In the adult brain, in comparison to the Orb2B protein, the Orb2A protein is expressed at an extremely low level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Kruttner1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>. In spite of its low abundance, the Orb2A protein is critical for Orb2 oligomerization, and Orb2A forms oligomers more readily than Orb2B. More importantly, a mutation that impedes Orb2A oligomerization selectively affects persistence of memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>, and the Orb2A prion-like domain is sufficient for long-term memory formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Kruttner1">[4]</xref>. These observations suggested a model in which the rare Orb2A protein either acts directly as a seed to induce activity-dependent amyloid-like oligomerization of the constitutive Orb2B protein or Orb2A oligomerization indirectly affects oligomerization of Orb2B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>. In either case the amount and localization of Orb2A protein would therefore be a key determinant of when and where amyloid-like conversion would occur.</p>
<p>Here we find that Orb2A has a very short half-life and the Orb2 interacting protein Transducer of Erb2 (Tob), a known regulator of cellular growth, stabilizes Orb2A and induces Orb2 oligomerization. Expression of dsRNA against Tob in the mushroom body neurons does not affect learning, but impairs long-term memory formation. Tob recruits the neuronal protein kinase Lim Kinase (LimK) to the Tob-Orb2 complex to induce Orb2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation regulates Tob-Orb2 association as well as the stability of both proteins, and Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key regulator of the phosphorylation status of Tob and Orb2. Intriguingly, inhibition of PP2A stabilizes Orb2A, but destabilizes Orb2-associated Tob, providing a mechanism for temporal restriction on Orb2A stabilization. Since PP2A and LimK activity can be regulated in a synapse-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Pi1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Schratt1">[15]</xref>, the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of Orb2 and Tob provides a putative mechanism of restricting the Orb2 oligomerization to the activated synapse. Tob is also known to regulate the function of CPEB family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Hosoda1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, the Tob-Orb2 association-dissociation may also regulate Orb2 function in the nervous system.</p>

<title>Orb2 Interacting Proteins in the Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> Brain</title>
<p>A regulator of Orb2 oligomerization could potentially fall into at least two distinct categories: an activator that associates with Orb2 and facilitates conversion to the oligomeric state or a repressor that binds to Orb2 and prevents its oligomerization. To identify both types of regulators we used a proteomics approach to perform a comprehensive search for Orb2 interacting proteins in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. The Orb2 proteins were expressed pan-neuronally as C-terminal HA-tagged proteins (ElavGal4: UAS-Orb2AHA or Orb2BHA), and the Orb2 complex was immunopurified using anti-HA antibodies from RNaseA-treated adult head extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Previously we observed that the C-terminal tags are inaccessible in the Orb2 oligomeric state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>; thus, the anti-HA antibody preferentially immunopurified the Orb2 monomers. Therefore, to identify proteins that interact with oligomeric Orb2, we also immunopurified Orb2AHA with an anti-Orb2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g001">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The factors associated with Orb2 were identified using Multidimensional Protein Identification technology (MudPIT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s007">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Florens1">[17]</xref>.</p>

(E) Representative IPâ€“Western blots of candidate proteins that were tested for pair-wise interaction with Orb2 in S2 cells. The FLAG-tagged putative candidate proteins were coexpressed with untagged Orb2 proteins, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and Western blotted with anti-Orb2 antibody. The proteins indicated in green have consistently shown above background binding. The flotilin (Flo2) gene, indicated in red, was overrepresented but not significantly enriched in Orb2 immunoprecipitate. However, it binds to Orb2A. The asterisk indicates the position of candidate proteins in SDS-PAGE. The arrows indicate anti-FLAG antibody cross-reacting polypeptides in S2 cell extracts. Unless indicated otherwise, in IP experiments 5% of the lysate is used as loading controls. (F). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of Orb2 proteome. The FBgn IDs of the candidate Orb2-interactors were submitted to DAVID web server. Selected nonredundant terms are shown. The <italic>p</italic> values and fold enrichments were determined using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> melanogaster genome as background.

<p>We found 61 proteins that were significantly enriched (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) in the Orb2 immunoprecipitates compared to eight independent control immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g001">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s001">S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s007">Table S1</xref>). Eleven proteins were overrepresented in Orb2 IP compared to the controls, albeit not to statistical significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s007">Table S1</xref>). To determine the validity of the proteomic approach, we randomly sampled 20 candidate proteins (out of 72 proteins) by pair-wise interaction in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Approximately 50% (11 out of 20 proteins) of the proteins thus tested formed a complex with at least one of the Orb2 proteins in an RNA-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Therefore, the proteomics approach indeed identified specific components of an Orb2 protein complex in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. The candidate proteins either interact directly with Orb2 or indirectly as part of a larger Orb2 protein complex. A gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the Orb2 proteome is significantly enriched for proteins involved in translation initiation, mRNA binding, and synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The enrichment of these protein complexes supports the idea that Orb2 is involved in regulation of synaptic protein synthesis.</p>

<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Tob Stabilizes Orb2A</title>
<p>The Orb2A protein is undetectable by Western analysis, and a genomic construct expressing Orb2A-EGFP suggests it is âˆ¼100 times less abundant than Orb2B protein in the adult brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, monomeric Orb2A has a very short half-life compared to Orb2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s008">Table S2</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that availability of the Orb2A protein could be an important determinant of efficient Orb2A oligomerization and/or function. In the course of our interaction studies in S2 cells, we noticed one of the candidate proteins, Tob, may influence the Orb2A protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). To determine Orb2A and Orb2B stability independent of each other, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, in which Orb2 is normally not expressed and Tob is expressed at low levels. S2 cells were transfected with only HA-tagged Orb2 or coexpressed with Flag-tagged Tob. To determine half-life, total Orb2 or Tob protein levels were measured at several time points following treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), which blocks new protein synthesis. The coexpression of Tob nearly doubled the half-life of monomeric Orb2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, Tob had no significant effect on Orb2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that association with Tob does not automatically enhance half-life. Likewise, incubation with dsRNA against Tob reduced the level of Orb2A protein but not Orb2B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Earlier studies with Tob family members have suggested that the stability of Tob itself can be regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Sasajima1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Suzuki1">[19]</xref>. We found a fourfold increase in Tob half-life in the presence of either Orb2A or Orb2B compared to Tob alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s008">Table S2</xref>). These results suggest that not only does Tob stabilize Orb2A, but Orb2 proteins have stabilizing effects on Tob.</p>

<title>Tob stabilizes Orb2A and induces Orb2 oligomerization.</title>
<p>(A) Tob enhances Orb2A stability. Orb2 stability was examined in S2 cells expressing either Orb2A by itself (top panel, Orb2A) or in conjunction with Tob (bottom panel, +Tob). Following the addition of cycloheximide (Chx), samples were taken at the given time points and then analyzed for expression levels of Orb2A by Western blot (left panels). Right panels compare protein half-lives. Half-lives were determined by plotting the percent of protein remaining after time zero and assuming first-order kinetics. The <italic>n</italic> indicates number of independent experiments performed to determine half-lives. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test. The data are plotted as mean Â± SEM. (B) Tob has little effect on Orb2B stability. (C) Both Orb2A and Orb2B significantly enhance Tob stability. (D) Overexpression of Tob increases Orb2 oligomerization. Orb2 was immunoprecipitated from adult head extracts expressing only TdTomato (Elav-Gal4: UAS-TdTom), Tob tagged to TdTomato (Elav-Gal4: UAS-TobTdTom), or Tob lacking a 28 amino acid domain critical for binding to Orb2 (Elav-Gal4: UAS-TobÎ”28TdTom). (E) Overexpression of Tob increases the number and size of Orb2AEGFP puncta. (Left panel) Both proteins were expressed in the ellipsoid body of the central complex using a c547Gal4 driver. Each row represents a fly genotype: c547-Gal4:UAS-Orb2AEGFP (Orb2A only), c547-Gal4:UAS-Orb2AEGFP/UAS-TobTdtomato (Orb2A Tob), and c547-Gal4:UAS-Orb2AEGFP/UAS-TobÎ”28Tdtomato (Orb2A TobÎ”28). Scale bar, 25 Âµm. (Right panel) Higher magnification image of the boxed region in the left. Puncta were counted in the central portion of the ellipsoid body.

<p>The recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tob interacts with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and translated Orb2 proteins, suggesting direct interaction between these proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). In mammals, the Tob family consists of six members, with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tob most closely related to the mammalian Tob1 and Tob2 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Matsuda1">[20]</xref>.

<title>Tob Enhances Orb2 Amyloid-Like Oligomerization in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Brain</title>
<p>Does Tob influence Orb2 oligomerization in the adult fly brain? To answer this, we increased Tob level in the fly brain using the Gal4-UAS system and assessed Orb2 oligomerization by immunopurification. Overexpression of Tob-TdTomato (Elav-Gal4: UAS-TobTdTom), but not the fluorophore alone (Elav-Gal4: UAS-TdTom), increased the levels of 10% SDS and boiling-resistant oligomeric Orb2 in the fly brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The amount of Orb2 oligomers in Tob-expressing flies increased nearly 2-fold compared to control flies (fold increase in oligomers normalized to monomer Â± SEM, 1.95Â±0.27, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <italic>t</italic> test). Tob has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Yoshida1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Ezzeddine1">[25]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Wessely1">[28]</xref>, raising the possibility that the increase in Orb2 oligomerization is a secondary effect of Tob overexpression. We generated a series of deletion mutants of Tob and found that deletion of a conserved 28 amino acid motif, TobÎ”28 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), decreased the interaction between Tob and Orb2 in both S2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s003">Figure S3B</xref>) and the adult fly brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). However, it had no effect on the association between Tob and the deadenylase Pop2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s003">Figure S3D</xref>) or with the transcriptional repressor, Mad (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). Overexpression of TobÎ”28 (Elav-Gal4: UAS-TobÎ”28TdTom) in the adult brain did not enhance Orb2 oligomerization (fold increase in oligomers normalized to monomer Â± SEM, 0.5Â±0.14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Does Tob enhance oligomerization of Orb2A, Orb2B, or both? EGFP-tagged Orb2A and Orb2B formed stable oligomers in the adult fly brain and the oligomers associated with Tob (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s003">Figure S3F</xref>). To determine the effect of Tob on Orb2A and Orb2B, we coexpressed TdTomato-tagged Tob with EGFP-tagged Orb2A or Orb2B in the adult fly brain. To distinguish from the endogenous Orb2, we quantified changes in the number of fluorescent puncta, since the abundance of fluorescence puncta co-relate with extent of oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>.

<title>Neuronal Stimulation Enhances Tob-Orb2 Association</title>
<p>Is Tob involved in activity-dependent oligomerization of Orb2? Previously we and others have observed that a neurotransmitter such as tyramine or dopamine regulates Orb2 oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Kruttner1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>. Therefore, we checked whether tyramine modulates Orb2-Tob interaction. To this end, we fed-starved flies 10 mM tyramine and after 4 h immunopurified the Tob-Orb2 complex from tyramine-stimulated or -unstimulated adult fly brain using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tob-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Tyramine stimulation increased the Tob-bound oligomeric Orb2 nearly 4-fold (fold increase in oligomers normalized to monomer Â± SEM, 3.82Â±0.88, <italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š5, <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), and the oligomers are resistant to boiling in the presence of 10% SDS and 2 M urea, consistent with it being amyloid-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) had less effect on Tob-Orb2 association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), consistent with our earlier observation that Orb2 oligomerization is influenced by tyramine and not by 5-HT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>. Use of Orb2B-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel) indicated Tob-Orb2B association is enhanced by tyramine stimulation. To determine whether Tob-Orb2A association is also modulated by neuronal activity, we used a genomic construct that encompasses only Orb2A coding region and carries EGFP at the C-terminal end (pCasperOrb2AEGFP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>.

Since it is difficult to determine which neuronal populations are activated by tyramine feeding, we also directly activated the mushroom body neurons (c747-Gal4, MB247-Gal4) with the temperature-sensitive dTrpA1 channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Hamada1">[29]</xref>. The flies were transiently exposed to 30Â°C (dTrpA1 active) for 25 min and then returned to 22Â°C (dTrpA1 inactive). Compared to flies carrying only dTrpA1 or Gal4, flies carrying both transgenes (C747Gal4::UAS-dTrpA1 or MB247Gal4:UAS-dTrpA1), there was enhanced Tob-Orb2 association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

<title>Tob-Orb2 association is regulated by neuronal activity, and Tob is present in the same synaptic compartment as Orb2.</title>
<p>(A) Neuronal stimulation increases Tob-Orb2 association. Tob was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated (control) or 10 mM tyramine-stimulated head extracts and blotted with the anti-Orb2 antibody (Orb2A,B) that detects both forms of Orb2 or an antibody that detects only Orb2B (Orb2B). The preimmune serum (pre) from the same animal serves as control for Tob antibody specificity. (B) Tob-associated oligomeric Orb2 is amyloidogenic. Tob was immunoprecipitated from either unstimulated (control) or tyramine-stimulated head extracts, treated with 10% SDS and 2 M urea and blotted with the anti-Orb2 antibody. Western analysis of lysates indicates the expression levels of Orb2, Tob, and tubulin. (C) Tyramine increases Tob-Orb2A association. (Top panel) A schematic diagram of the genomic pCasperOrb2A construct, which expresses an EGFP-tagged Orb2A. The Orb2B-specific exons are indicated in blue, Orb2A-specific exon in red, and the common region in gray. (Bottom panel) Tob was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated (âˆ’) or tyramine-stimulated (+) total brain lysates with preimmune (pre) or immune serum (Tob) and probed with anti-EGFP antibody. The position of the monomeric Orb2AEGFP fusion protein is indicated. The EGFP-antibody reacting high molecular weight proteins are most likely the oligomeric form of the Orb2AEGFP protein. The asterisk indicates low molecular weight protein that is either a degradation product of Orb2AEGFP or a cross-reactive band. In the lower panel Tob is visible only in immune serum lane, indicating specificity of the pull-down. Orb2AEGFP is not detectable by Western analysis. (D) Stimulation of mushroom body neurons enhances Tob-Orb2 association. A schematic of the stimulation protocol is shown above the gel picture. The mushroom body neurons were stimulated using the temperature-sensitive dTrpA1 channel, which depolarizes and thereby activates neurons at a temperature &gt;25Â°C. More Tob-associated Orb2 oligomers were observed at 30Â°C in flies harboring both the Gal4 driver and TrpA1 transgene compared to flies with just the Gal4-driver or TrpA1.

Frontal cryosections of adult fly heads were immunostained with the preimmune serum or anti-Tob (green) antibody.

<title>Phosphorylation Regulates Tob-Orb2 Association</title>
<p>Because Tob is constitutively present in the adult fly brain, we wondered how Tob-mediated oligomerization of Orb2 could be temporally regulated by neuronal activity.

<title>Tob and Orb2 are phosphorylated, and phosphorylation regulates Tob-Orb2 association.</title>
<p>(A) Orb2 is phosphorylated in the adult fly head. Blotting of Orb2 immunoprecipitate with phospho-tagâ„¢ detects phosphorylated Orb2B. Treatment with calf-intestinal phosphatase (PPase) that removes phosphate groups from proteins shows specificity of phospho-tagâ„¢. (B) Both Orb2A and Orb2B are phosphorylated at a low level in S2cells. Orb2 immunoprecipitate from the S2 cell is probed with phospho-tagâ„¢. (C) Tob is phosphorylated in the adult fly brain. (Left panel) Approximately 2 mg of total head extracts were immunoprecipitated with preimmune (pre) or immune Tob serum. The phospho-tagâ„¢ detects a band at the position of Tob only in the immune but not in preimmune lane. Treatment with Î»-phosphatase (PPase) reduces phospho- tagâ„¢ signal. (Right panel, top) Total adult head extracts were treated with calf-intestinal phosphatase (PPase). Change in phosphorylation status of Tob was assessed as a change in mobility by Western blot analysis. (Right panel, bottom) Exogenously expressed Flag-tagged Tob protein is also phosphorylated in the adult brain. (D) The addition of the phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin (CY), dissociates the Orb2-Tob complex. S2 cells were transfected with Orb2A with and without Tob and treated with 10 Âµm CY for 1 h prior to Tob immunoprecipitation. CY treatment almost completely abolished Tob association with Orb2A oligomers and reduced association with the monomers. (E) Unphosphorylated Tob has a greater affinity for Orb2A. S2 cell lysates were first treated with the indicated units of phosphatase (uPPase), and subsequently the Orb2A-Tob complex was immunoprecipitated. More Orb2A was found to be associated with Tob following phosphatase treatment. Western blots of the lysates show the level of Orb2A and Tob (input). The 4%â€“12% gradient gels were used in these experiments. (F) Hyperphosphorylated Tob does not associate with Orb2. Untagged Orb2 and FLAG-tagged Tob complex was immunopurified using anti-Orb2 antibodies and probed with phosphor-tagâ„¢ (top panel). Phosphorylated proteins correspond to the size of Orb2 (bottom panel) but not Tob (middle panel). The hyperphosphorylated Tob proteins are visible in the total extract (input), however they are absent in the Orb2-Tob complex. The 8% gel in Tris-Glycine buffer was used in this experiment.</p>

<p>To determine if phosphorylation has any effect on Tob-Orb2 association, we blocked dephosphorylation using calyculin (CY), a cell-permeable serine-phosphatase inhibitor that blocks protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at 0.5â€“1.0 nM concentration and protein phosphatase1 (PP1) at â‰¥2 nM concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Ishihara1">[37]</xref>. We observed that an hour after treatment with 1 nM CY, the amount of Orb2A associated with Tob was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The reduction in association was not due to reduction in Tob or Orb2A protein level an hour after treatment with CY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Because phosphatases influence a large number of proteins in the cell, the reduction of Tob-Orb2 association could be a secondary consequence of phosphatase inhibition. To test more directly the effect of phosphorylation, in a reciprocal experiment, we first treated cell lysates expressing Tob and Orb2A with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) and then isolated the Tob-Orb2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). We observed that prior dephosphorylation enhanced the association of Tob with Orb2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Likewise, when the Orb2-Tob complex was immunopurified with anti-Orb2 antibody and probed with phospho-tagâ„¢, only phosphorylated Orb2, but not the hyperphosphorylated Tob, was detected in the immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate phosphorylation regulates Tob-Orb2 association. Hypophosphorylation promotes Tob-Orb2A association, and hyperphosphorylation reduces it.</p>

<title>PP2A Inactivation Destabilizes Tob But Stabilizes Orb2A</title>

<title>Tob Promotes LimKinase-Orb2 Association</title>
<p>How does Tob promote Orb2A stabilization and/or enhanced Orb2 oligomerization? Because phosphorylation enhances Orb2 stability, one possibility is that Tob prevents PP2A from accessing Orb2A. However, the association of PP2A catalytic subunit Mts or regulatory subunit Tws with Orb2 was not affected by increased levels of Tob, and the effect of PP2A on Orb2A half-life was not dependent on Tob level (Orb2A, 25.6Â±14.7 h, <italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š0.02, and Orb2B, 19.5Â±8.3, <italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š0.01) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s006">Figure S6A</xref>).

We searched for other kinases and focused on the neuronal kinase LimK for several reasons.

<title>Tob promotes LimK-Orb2 association and Orb2 phosphorylation.</title>
<p>(A) Tob is a substrate for Lim kinase. An <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed using recombinant maltose binding protein (MBP) and MBP-tagged mammalian Btg, Tob1, Tob2, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tob (dTob) as substrates (left panel). <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tob was phosphorylated, as were Tob1 and Tob2, while the more distantly related Btg exhibited background levels of phosphorylation similar to MBP (right panel). The calculated molecular weight of MBP tag is 42.5 KDa and that of MBP-tagged <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tob is âˆ¼101 KDa. (B) Lim kinase interacts with Tob. (Right panel) Tob was immunoprecipitated from adult head extracts expressing HA-tagged LimK under Elav-GeneSwitch inducible driver line and blotted with anti-HA antibodies for LimK. (Left panel) The +RU486 lane contains 5% of the lysate used for immunoprecipitation in the right panel. (C) Lim kinase phosphorylates Tob-associated Orb2A and Orb2B. Orb2 with and without Tob was immunopurified and dephosphorylated prior to use as substrates in the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay. Phosphorylation was assessed in the presence (+LimK) or absence (âˆ’LimK) of LimK. Orb2 by itself shows a low level of phosphorylation, suggesting either endogenous LimK or some other kinase is copurified. Phosphorylation significantly increases with the addition of LimK. Western blots on the right show expression levels of the individual components as loading controls. (D) LimKinase phosphorylates recombinant Orb2B in the presence of recombinant MBP-tagged Tob. Due to insolubility, it was not possible to test recombinant Orb2A in this assay. The LimK used in this study is also autophosphorylated. (E) LimKinase (tagged with V5-epitope) forms a complex with Orb2 only in the presence of Tob that interacts with Orb2. In presence of TobÎ”28, which interacts weakly with Orb2, only background level of LimK was detected in the Orb2 complex.

<p>Next we sought to determine whether Tob phosphorylation by LimK is influenced by Orb2. We performed <italic>in vitro</italic> LimK assays on immunopurified Tob-Orb2 complex or on Tob alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). To our surprise, we observed that Orb2 is phosphorylated by exogenously added LimK in the presence of Tob (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The Tob-Orb2 immunoprecipitate from cells contains other proteins in addition to Tob and Orb2, and therefore Orb2 may be phosphorylated by other kinases in the presence of LimK. To test such a possibility, we incubated recombinant-soluble Orb2B protein and LimK in the presence or absence of recombinant MBP-tagged Tob. We observed phosphorylation of Orb2B by LimK in the presence of Tob (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Furthermore, LimK copurified with both Orb2A and B only in the presence of Tob. However, in the presence of TobÎ”28, which binds efficiently to LimK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s006">Figure S6D</xref>) but not to Orb2, there was a marked reduction in the LimK-Orb2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Tob is a substrate for LimK and that Orb2 proteins become a substrate of LimK when associated with Tob.</p>

<p>To determine whether an increase in LimK activity enhances Orb2 oligomerization, we analyzed Orb2 puncta formation in the larval neuron, where unlike the adult brain, ectopic expression of LimK did not cause any observable developmental problem. We found that Orb2A-EGFP coexpressed with active LimK (ElavGal4::UAS-Orb2A-EGFP; UAS-LimK) has twice the number of puncta (16.10Â±1.36, <italic>N</italic>â€Š=â€Š24) compared with flies coexpressing a kinase dead version of LimK, LimK<sup>KD</sup> (ELAV::UAS-Orb2A-EGFP; UAS-LimK<sup>KD</sup>) (8.71Â±1.74, <italic>N</italic>â€Š=â€Š6, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) or flies expressing only Orb2A-EGFP (6.79Â±1.01, <italic>N</italic>â€Š=â€Š12, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). From these several results, we conclude that Tob serves two functions for Orb2A. First, it binds and stabilizes unphosphorylated Orb2A, and second, it allows Orb2A to be phosphorylated by LimK. Each of these events results in an increase in the effective concentration of Orb2A, which induces Orb2A and/or Orb2A-Orb2B oligomerization.</p>

<title>Tob Is Required for Long-Term Memory</title>
<p>Because Orb2 oligomerization is important for long-term memory and Tob affects Orb2 oligomerization, we wondered whether Tob activity is important for long-term memory. To this end, we used the male courtship suppression paradigm in which a virgin male fly learns to suppress its courtship behavior upon repeated exposure to an unreceptive female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Hall1">[47]</xref>.

We found that male flies expressing TobRNAi (201Y:Gal4-UAS-TobRNAi) in the Î³-lobe showed courtship suppression after training in the short term (5 min), but the courtship suppression was lost when measured at 24 h or 48 h after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). In contrast, flies harboring just the RNAi (UAS-Tob RNAi) or Gal4 (201Y:Gal4) had no impairment in courtship suppression 5 min or 24 to 48 h after training. These results are consistent with the idea that Tob activity is important for long-term courtship suppression memory.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our previous work suggested that conversion of neuronal CPEB to an amyloid-like oligomeric state provides a molecular mechanism for the persistence of memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Si1">[6]</xref>. However, it is not known how Orb2 oligomerization is regulated so that it will occur in a neuron/synapse-specific and activity-dependent manner. Here we report that factors that influence Orb2A stability and thereby abundance regulate Orb2 oligomerization.</p>
<p>We find that Tob, a previously known regulator of SMAD-dependent transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Yoshida1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Yoshida2">[24]</xref> and CPEB-mediated translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Hosoda1">[16]</xref>, associates with both forms of Orb2, but increases the half-life of only Orb2A. Stimulation with tyramine or activation of mushroom body neurons enhances the association of Tob with Orb2, and overexpression of Tob enhances Orb2 oligomerization. Both Orb2 and Tob are phosphoproteins. Phosphorylation destabilizes Orb2-associated Tob, whereas it stabilizes Orb2A. Tob promotes Orb2 phosphorylation by recruiting LimK, and PP2A controls the phosphorylation status of Orb2A and Orb2B.</p>
<p>PP2A, an autocatalytic phosphatase, is known to act as a bidirectional switch in activity-dependent changes in synaptic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Pi1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Belmeguenai1">[49]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Mulkey1">[51]</xref>. PP2A activity is down-regulated upon induction of long-term potentiation of hippocampal CA1 synapses (LTP) and up-regulated during long-term depression (LTD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Pi1">[14]</xref>. Similarly, Lim Kinase, which is synthesized locally at the synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Schratt1">[15]</xref> in response to synaptic activation, is also critical for long-term changes in synaptic activity and synaptic growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Meng1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on these observations we propose a model for activity-dependent and synapse-specific regulation of amyloid-like oligomerization of Orb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001786-g008">Figure 8</xref>). We postulate that in the basal state synaptic PP2A keeps the available Orb2A in an unphosphorylated and thereby unstable state. Neuronal stimulation results in synthesis of Orb2A by a yet unknown mechanism. The Tob protein that is constitutively present at the synapse binds to and stabilizes the unphosphorylated Orb2A and recruits the activated LimK to the Tob-Orb2 complex, allowing Orb2 phosphorylation. Concomitant decreases in PP2A activity and phosphorylation by other kinases enhances and increases Orb2A half-life. The increase in Orb2A level as well as phosphorylation may induce conformational change in Orb2A, which allows Orb2A to act as a seed. Alternatively, accumulation and oligomerization of Orb2A may create an environment that is conducive to overall Orb2 oligomerization. In the absence of an <italic>in vitro</italic> Orb2A-Orb2B oligomerization assay, we could not distinguish between these two possibilities.</p>

<title>Model of activity-dependent Orb2 oligomerization.</title>
<p>The model depicts the sequence of events that leads to oligomerization of Orb2A and destabilization of Tob. PP2A keeps both Orb2 and Tob in an unphosphorylated form, which particularly destabilizes Orb2A. Synaptic activation leads to Orb2A synthesis, and the unphosphorylated Orb2A is bound and stabilized by unphosphorylated Tob. Tob recruits activated LimK to the complex, which phosphorylates Orb2A and Tob. The initial phosphorylation of Tob and Orb2 can trigger additional phosphorylation by other kinases, which leads to the dissociation and destabilization of Tob. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of Orb2A leads to further stabilization and/or changes in conformation to induce oligomerization. The oligomeric Orb2A may directly or indirectly induce oligomerization of Orb2B. The phosphorylation of Orb2A and Orb2B may also regulate the function of both proteins.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001786.g008" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>For Tob, initial Orb2 association stabilizes Tob. However, association with Orb2 as well as suppression of PP2A activity leads to additional phosphorylation, which results in dissociation of Tob from the Orb2-Tob complex and destabilization. The destabilization of Orb2-associated Tob provides a temporal restriction to the Orb2 oligomerization process. The coincident inactivation of PP2A and activation of LimK may also provide a mechanism for stimulus specificity and synaptic restriction.</p>
<p>We find that Orb2A and Orb2B are phosphorylated at multiple sites, including serine/threonine and presumably tyrosine residues. These phosphorylation events are likely mediated by multiple kinases because overexpression of LimK did not affect Orb2 phosphorylation to the extent observed with the inhibition or activation of PP2A, raising several interesting questions. In what order do these phosphorylations occur? What function do they serve individually and in combination? What kinases are involved? Moreover, similar to mammalian CPEB family members, in addition to changing stability, phosphorylation may also influence the function of Orb2A and Orb2B.</p>
<p>Does Tob regulate Orb2 function? In mammals Tob has been shown to recruit Caf1 to CPEB3 target mRNA, resulting in deadenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Hosoda1">[16]</xref>, and CPEB3 is known to act as a translation repressor when ectopically expressed. We find <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tob also interacts with Pop2/Caf1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s003">Figure S3E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Ezzeddine1">[25]</xref> and Orb2A and Orb2B can repress translation of some mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-MastushitaSakai1">[52]</xref>. Orb2 has also been identified as a modifier of Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP)â€“dependent translation, and Fragile-X is believed to act in translation repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Cziko1">[53]</xref>. Therefore, the Tob-Orb2 association may contribute to Orb2-dependent translation repression, and the degradation of Orb2-associated Tob may relieve translation repression. Additionally, if the oligomeric Orb2 has an altered affinity for either mRNA or other translation regulators, Tob can affect Orb2 function by inducing oligomerization. However, the relationship between Tob phosphorylation and its function is unclear at this point.</p>
<p>Does involvement of Tob both in transcription and translation serve a specific purpose in the nervous system? Tob inhibits BMP-mediated activation of the Smad-family transcription activators (Smad 1/5/8) by promoting association of inhibitory Smads (Smad 6/7) with the activated receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Sasajima1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Yoshida2">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Ikematsu1">[54]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Xiong1">[56]</xref>.

<title>Plasmid Constructs</title>
<p>Orb2AHA and Orb2BHA constructs were previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-Majumdar1">[5]</xref>. The untagged Orb2 and Orb2-interacting protein constructs were made by cloning the full-length PCR products into TopoDonor vector (Invitrogen) and were subsequently transferred to p AWF using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tob cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned with Topo-TA (Invitrogen). Flag-tagged Tob was created by the subsequent transfer to the mammalian expression vector, pCMV24 (Invitrogen). Standard molecular techniques were then used to subclone into pMT (Invitrogen) for S2 cell expression and pUAST (DGRC) for use as a <italic>Drosophila</italic> transgene. To create TobÎ”28, containing an internal deletion of 28 amino acids (AA235â€“262), the amino terminal region and C-terminal regions were amplified separately and engineered to contain an internal NotI site. The two fragments (EcoRI/NotI and NotI/SalI) were cloned into pCMV24C. Standard techniques were then used to subclone into pMT and pUAST. For the imaging studies, the tdTomato cDNA was inserted in frame to the C-terminal to create pUAST-TobTdTom and pUAST-TobÎ”28TdTom. For antigen production, the cDNA encoding Tob AA 267â€“564 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pRSETA (Invitrogen) in frame with the 6XHis tag. The mammalian cDNAs for Tob1, Tob2, Ana, and Btg were amplified by RT-PCR from mouse RNA and cloned with Topo-TA, which was subsequently used to produce pCMV24. For production of recombinant proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, Tob, Tob1, Tob2, and Btg were reamplified using primers designed to produce an in-frame 6XHis tag at the C-terminus and then subcloned into pMal-c2X. A full-length cDNA encoding LimK, LD15137 was obtained from DGRC and amplified by PCR for Topo TA cloning. The insert was subsequently transferred to pAcV5 for S2 cell expression. LimK<sup>MT</sup> was engineered to mutate D500K by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). All sequences were confirmed against the NCBI sequence prior to use.</p>
<p>The pCasperOrb2AEGFP construct is comprised of a genomic fragment 1446 nucleotides 3â€² of the last Orb2B-specific exon and 1338 bp 5â€² of the exonic sequence of the neighboring gene and therefore does not contain coding region of any of the Orb2 isoforms except Orb2A. The âˆ¼8.27 Kb genomic fragment was cloned into the SpeI/XhoI site of pCasper4, and EGFP was introduced at the C-terminal end by creating an in-frame SgrA1 site.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>For immunoprecipitations from cell culture, 3Ã—10<sup>5</sup> transfected cells were used for each immunoprecipitation. The expression constructs used are as indicated in the figures. Following transfection (36â€“48 h), the cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 500 Âµl of 1% Igepal buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 [Igpal], 1 mM DTT, EDTA free protease inhibitor) and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. For immunoprecipitations from flies, adult heads were collected following flash freezing and vortexing, lysed in 1% Igepal buffer, and clarified by two rounds of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce Biotechnology), and between 1â€“4 mg of head lysate were used for each immunoprecipitation. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation: anti-HA agarose (Sigma), anti-Flag agarose (Sigma), anti-Tob antibody (raised in guinea pig 2163), and anti-Orb2 (raised in guinea pig-2233 and rabbit-273,402) in conjunction with Protein-A agarose (Repligen). The anti-Tob antibody was raised in guinea pig against the C-terminal end of Tob (Pocono Rabbit Farm), purified using Melon resin (Pierce Biotechnology), and used at 1âˆ¶100 dilution. Immunoprecipitations performed using S2 cells were incubated for 2 h at 4Â°C with continuous rocking, and immunoprecipitations performed using head lysates were incubated for 2 h, and then the ProteinA agarose beads were added with additional 2 h incubation. Following four washes, samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer containing 10% SDS and 2 mM freshly prepared DTT. For immunoprecipitation of Orb2 âˆ¼1 mg of total protein and for Orb2AEGFP âˆ¼3 mg of total protein were used. Western analysis was performed following standard protocols. The following antibodies were used for Western analysis: anti-Flag-HRP (Sigma, 1âˆ¶1,000), anti-HA-HRP (Roche, 1âˆ¶500), anti-Tob (guinea pig, 1âˆ¶1,000), anti-Orb2 (rabbit, 1âˆ¶2,000), anti-Orb2 (guinea pig, 1âˆ¶1,000), anti-Orb2B (rabbit, 1âˆ¶1,000), and anti-EGFP (MBL, 1âˆ¶1,000).</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>To examine endogenous Tob expression in wild-type CantonS flies and c547-Gal4::UAS-Orb2AEGFP and c547-Gal4::UAS-Orb2BEGFP flies, the proboscis was removed and the flies were decapitated. The heads were fixed for 2 h at 4Â°C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS, incubated overnight in 20% sucrose/PBS, followed by 2 h in a 30âˆ¶70 mixture of 20% sucrose/PBS and OCT embedding media (Tissue-Tek). The heads were then embedded in 100% OCT, and frontal cryosections were made of 12 Âµm. The sections were permeabilized in 1% TritonX containing PBS for 5 min followed by 10 min in 0.1% TritonX containing PBS (PBST). The slides were blocked in 10% goat serum containing PBST for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation in 1âˆ¶50 dilution of melon-purified (Pierce Biotechnology) anti-Tob (2163) antibody. For the CantonS flies, 1âˆ¶50 dilution of nc82 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) was also added to mark the synaptic regions. Antiâ€“guinea pig Alexa-Fluor 633 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody was used for Tob detection, and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) was used for nc-82 detection. Images were acquired at 512Ã—512 pixels with a Zeiss LSM 5.0 confocal microscope as 1 Âµm Z-stacks. Images shown are projections of 10 slices.</p>

<title>Aggregate Quantification</title>
<p>To examine changes in aggregate number in the adult Orb2EGFP flies, the whole brain was dissected to remove the exoskeleton and air sacs. The brain was fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBST for 10 min, and then the whole brain was mounted. Expression of Orb2EGFP and TobTdTom was driven using the ellipsoid body-specific driver, c547. Images were acquired as above. To quantitate the changes in aggregate number, projections of 20 slices were made for each image centering on the central structure of the ellipsoid body. To examine changes in aggregate number in Lim kinase and Orb2EGFP-expressing animals, third instar larvae were filleted and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBST for 10 min, and mounted. Images of the neurites extending from the ventral ganglia were acquired as described. Projections of 10 slices were made.</p>
<p>Axiovision software (Zeiss, v.4.7.1) was used to quantitate total area, aggregate number, and aggregate size. A commander script was written to identify the region of interest and the puncta within the region. All measurement parameters were kept constant for each image.</p>

<title>Half-Life Determination</title>
<p>pMTâˆ¶FlagTob by itself or in conjunction with pMTâˆ¶Orb2AHA or pMTâˆ¶Orb2BHA was transfected into S2 cells. Expression Tob and Orb2 were induced by adding 700 ÂµM CuSO4. Following 16 h, the cells were washed and incubated with 50 Âµg/ml cycloheximide. At the indicated times, samples were collected and later analyzed by Western blot using either anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies. Densitometric measurements were carried out using ImageQuant and plotted (percent remaining of time zero versus time) using Prism Graphpad 5. The decay curve was fitted using first-order kinetics. To determine the half-life of hyperphosphorylated Tob, a similar analysis was performed with the cells being treated with both cycloheximide and calyculin.</p>

<title>Kinase Assays</title>
<p>To examine Tob phosphorylation, amylose-bound MBP-tagged proteins were incubated with 5 ng of recombinant LimK (Upstate Biotechnology) and 10 ÂµCi of [Î³â€“<sup>32</sup>P]ATP for 20 min at 30Â°C with semiconstant shaking. Control reactions were performed identically but in the absence of LimK. Kinase dilution buffer and reaction buffer were prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications. Following phosphorylation, the proteins were washed four times in PBS with 0.1% TritonX and once with PBS prior to loading an 8% SDS/PAGE. Following electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed from 4 h to overnight. To examine phosphorylation of recombinant Orb2B, His-tagged Orb2B was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) using a slow induction protocol, and a low amount of soluble protein was purified in Ni+2 column. Approximately 10 ng of Orb2B, MBP-tagged Tob was used in the kinase reaction.</p>
<p>To examine phosphorylation of the Orb2-Tob complex, 6Ã—10<sup>5</sup> S2 cells were transfected with pActâˆ¶Orb2AHA or pActâˆ¶Orb2B individually and in combination with pMTâˆ¶Tob. The cells were lysed in 1% Igepal buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 [Igpal], 1 mM DTT, EDTA free protease inhibitor) and incubated for 15 min with 50 U/ml CIP. Following centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4Â°C with anti-HA agarose. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1% Igepal buffer and once with a modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Igepal). The sample was then split into thirds, with one-third examined by Western blot to ensure equality in protein levels and the other two-thirds used for the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay described above. For the Tob alone samples, 12Ã—10<sup>5</sup> S2 cells were transfected with pAcOrb2AHA and pMTTob, and the complex was purified as above and dissociated in 1% Igepal buffer containing 1 M NaCl for 15 min at room temperature. The eluate was then normalized to 150 M NaCl and Tob purified by precipitation with anti-Flag agarose (Sigma). Complete dissociation was ensured by Western analysis.</p>

<title>Detection of Phosphoprotein</title>
<p>The protein abundance studies were carried out in 4%â€“12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and run in MES-SDS (50 mM MES, 50 mM Tris Base, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.3) buffer. In these buffer conditions and in the gradient gel, the phosphorylated bands migrate close to each other, which simplifies the quantification of band intensity. Also, in protein abundance studies, the total cell lysates were prepared, unless mentioned, in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, again to ensure quantification of the total protein accurately. The 4%â€“12% gels were also used for the detection oligomeric Orb2 and phospho-tagâ„¢ blotting of Orb2- or Tob immunoprecipitate from the adult fly head.</p>
<p>To measure phosphorylation status via mobility shift, we found that an 8% SDS-PAGE run in conventional Tris-Glycine buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.6) is more effective, and in 8% gel the different phosphorylated forms of Orb2 and Tob proteins were better separated. For detection of the phosphoproteins via phospho-tagâ„¢, both 8% and 4%â€“12% SDS-PAGE were used.</p>

<title>Male Courtship Suppression Assay</title>
<p>Flies were maintained using standard fly husbandry methods. For behavioral analysis, flies were maintained on standard cornmeal food at 25Â°C and 60% relative humidity on a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle. Virgin males and females were collected at eclosion under CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia. Males were isolated and placed in individual food vials. All flies were aged for 5 d before behavioral training and testing. To increase the efficiency of RNAi, flies were shifted to 30Â°C for 3 d before training. The control flies were treated similarly. Canton S females (4 d old) were mated the night before they were used in training. Males were assayed for courtship conditioning using a modified version of the spaced training described by McBride et al. (1999) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001786-McBride1">[63]</xref>. For spaced training, individual males were placed in individual small food tubes (16Ã—100 mm culture tubes, VWR) with a mated female for 2 h. The female was removed, and the male was left alone for 30 min. A different mated female was placed in the tube with the male for another 2 h. The female was removed and the male again rested for another 30 min. A third mated female was introduced in the tube for 2 h and removed at the end of the trial. Control males were treated exactly the same way, except no mated females were introduced into the tube. Memory was tested 5 min, 24 h, and 48 h after training. All tests were performed in a 1 cm courtship chamber. Fresh mated females were used for all time points. All memory tests were recorded (for 10 min) and analyzed using a customized software. The courtship index of each male was obtained by manual and/or automatic analysis of the movies by an experimenter blind to the genotype and experimental conditions.</p>

The distributions of proteins in various groups are color coded for ease of visualization. (B) Pair wise interaction study of Orb2 and candidate proteins. Representative examples of Orb2A (left panel) and Orb2B (right panel) interaction with candidate proteins. The candidate proteins were expressed in S2 cells as FLAG-tagged protein with untagged Orb2 and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Trip1 is a component of translation initiation factor 3 protein complex, and CG32016 is predicted to be an eIF4E regulator. Orb2 interacts with both eIF3 and eIF4E, and therefore the modest binding of Trip1 and CG32016 could be due to their presence in eIF3 or eIF4E protein complexes, respectively. The CG17838 is significantly enriched in Orb2 immunoprecipitate, but does not efficiently form complex with Orb2A. The proteins in the left panel belong to the group of proteins that are enriched in the Orb2 IP, but do not show statistical significance (please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001786.s007">Table S1</xref>).</p>

Flag-tagged Tob was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with HA-tagged Orb1 and Orb2. (C, top panel) In S2 cells Tob is phosphorylated when coexpressed with Orb2A or Orb2B but not the closely related Orb1. Changes in Tob phosphorylation status was assessed as an increase in molecular weight as determined by Western blot analysis of transfected S2 cells.

The Orb2 proteins were coexpressed with HA-tagged Mts, and the Mts-Orb2 complex was immunopurified with anti-HA antibodies. Because PP2A destabilizes Orb2A and Orb2B, both Orb2 proteins are expressed at a low level in the presence of Mts.
