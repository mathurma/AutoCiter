<abstract>
<p>Mature human B cells infected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) become activated, grow, and proliferate. If the cells are infected ex vivo, they are transformed into continuously proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that carry EBV DNA as extra-chromosomal episomes, express 9 latency-associated EBV proteins, and phenotypically resemble antigen-activated B-blasts. In vivo similar B-blasts can differentiate to become memory B cells (MBC), in which EBV persistence is established. Three related latency-associated viral proteins EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C are transcription factors that regulate a multitude of cellular genes. EBNA3B is not necessary to establish LCLs, but EBNA3A and EBNA3C are required to sustain proliferation, in part, by repressing the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Here we show, using EBV-recombinants in which both EBNA3A and EBNA3C can be conditionally inactivated or using virus completely lacking the EBNA3 gene locus, that—after a phase of rapid proliferation—infected primary B cells express elevated levels of factors associated with plasma cell (PC) differentiation. These include the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p18<sup>INK4c</sup>, the master transcriptional regulator of PC differentiation B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (BLIMP-1), and the cell surface antigens CD38 and CD138/Syndecan-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) indicate that in LCLs inhibition of <italic>CDKN2C</italic> (p18<sup>INK4c</sup>) and <italic>PRDM1</italic> (BLIMP-1) transcription results from direct binding of EBNA3A and EBNA3C to regulatory elements at these loci, producing stable reprogramming. Consistent with the binding of EBNA3A and/or EBNA3C leading to irreversible epigenetic changes, cells become committed to a B-blast fate &lt;12 days post-infection and are unable to de-repress p18<sup>INK4c</sup> or BLIMP-1—in either newly infected cells or conditional LCLs—by inactivating EBNA3A and EBNA3C. In vitro, about 20 days after infection with EBV lacking functional EBNA3A and EBNA3C, cells develop a PC-like phenotype. Together, these data suggest that EBNA3A and EBNA3C have evolved to prevent differentiation to PCs after infection by EBV, thus favouring long-term latency in MBC and asymptomatic persistence.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection can cause several types of cancer associated with its major target in humans, the mature B cell. Furthermore, EBV is one of the most potent transforming agents ever identified, producing—in vitro—‘immortal’ B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) with outstanding reliability. However, the near-symbiotic relationship between EBV and its natural host (&gt;95% of human adults are asymptomatically infected) provides a powerful argument that this gamma-herpesvirus did not primarily evolve to be a harmful tumour-causing virus. Consistent with this, we show here that 2 of the potentially oncogenic viral proteins (EBNA3A and EBNA3C) have evolved not to facilitate oncogenic progression but to block plasma cell differentiation in EBV-activated B cells. Specifically, they act to interrupt the gene regulation network that drives activated B cells to become terminally differentiated, quiescent plasma cells, thus allowing for sustained regeneration of virally infected B cells. EBNA3A and EBNA3C achieve this by epigenetically inhibiting expression of cellular genes essential for the differentiation pathway; these include the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and the transcription factor BLIMP-1. This favours the establishment of EBV latency in long-lived memory B cells and therefore helps maintain a ubiquitous, generally asymptomatic infection in human populations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gamma-herpesvirus that infects about 95% of the world’s adult population. Although infection is nearly always benign, on rare occasions it is etiologically associated with various human cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). EBV is also the primary cause of acute infectious mononucleosis, aka glandular fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref003">3</xref>]. Although EBV can be found in epithelial, natural killer (NK), and T cells, it preferentially infects mature B cells. Infection of primary human CD19<sup>+ve</sup> B lymphocytes ex vivo results in their activation, growth, and sustained proliferation so that lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) are established. These cells have a B-blast–like phenotype, carry EBV genomes as extra-chromosomal episomes, and express a limited number of viral latency-associated factors; these include 6 nuclear proteins (EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C, and EBNA-LP), 2 membrane-associated proteins (LMP1 and LMP2), 2 small non-coding RNAs, and several microRNAs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref004">4</xref>]). This pattern of viral gene expression is known as the latency III or growth program. Infection of mature B cells in vivo is thought to initiate a similar program of activation and growth, but only transient proliferation, because under the influence of CD4<sup>+ve</sup> T helper (Th) lymphocytes these B cells differentiate in the lymphoid structures called germinal centres (GC) to form a pool of memory B cells (MBC) carrying latent EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref008">8</xref>]. These EBV genome–containing, long-lived MBC can then enter the peripheral circulation and, expressing no viral proteins, form a major site of lifelong EBV persistence. To complete the life cycle, reactivation of EBV into a program of gene expression that leads to replication and release of virions is thought to occur in a small number of B cells differentiating into antibody-secreting plasma cells (PCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The EBNA3 latency-associated proteins are a family of 3 large (approximately 160kD) EBV nuclear antigens expressed from 3 genes arranged in tandem within a complex transcription unit only functional in B cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref010">10</xref>]). All 3 proteins can act as transcription factors that regulate host gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref011">11</xref>]. They do not bind DNA directly, but, via contacts with cellular cofactors, are largely targeted to chromatin at gene promoters and/or distal regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref015">15</xref>]. Often, regulation of transcription involves long-distance chromatin interactions (chromosome ‘looping’) between promoter and enhancer elements mediated by EBNA3 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>EBNA3A and EBNA3C have been widely reported to reduce expression of various cell cycle regulatory factors found in latently infected B cells. For instance, EBNA3A and EBNA3C together repress expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL2-family member BIM and the senescence-inducing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p16<sup>INK4a</sup>—2 tumour suppressors that would otherwise contribute to an oncogenic stress response resulting from virus infection driving unscheduled DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref020">20</xref>]). In addition, EBNA3A and EBNA3C directly repress transcription of the p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-related CDKI, p15<sup>INK4b</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref021">21</xref>] and—by inducing precursors of oncogenic microRNAs miR-221 and miR-222—inhibit expression of CIP/KIP family CDKIs, p57<sup>KIP2</sup> and p27<sup>KIP1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref019">19</xref>]. Furthermore, EBNA3A- and EBNA3C-mediated repression of transcription of genes encoding the related INK4 CDKIs p16<sup>INK4a</sup> (<italic>CDKN2A</italic>) and p15<sup>INK4b</sup> (<italic>CDKN2B</italic>) is associated with binding of these viral factors to chromatin in and around the gene loci and subsequent deposition of repressive histone marks by polycomb protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref021">21</xref>]. By targeting these various genes, operationally EBNA3A and EBNA3C can behave as oncoproteins, but these same functions facilitate early MYC-driven cell proliferation soon after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref010">10</xref>]. In contrast, EBNA3B is not necessary to establish or maintain LCL proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref010">10</xref>] and can act as a tumour suppressor in a humanized-mouse model and in some human tumours—at least in part—by facilitating immune cell trafficking and T cell surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Of all the mammalian CDKIs, there is one specifically linked to B cell function: the INK4 family member p18<sup>INK4c</sup>, encoded by the <italic>CDKN2C</italic> gene. Although biochemically and structurally p18<sup>INK4c</sup> very closely resembles p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, functionally it appears to be specialized for differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>The requirement for p18<sup>INK4c</sup> in PC differentiation was first indicated by a significant reduction of antibody secretion in p18<sup>INK4c</sup>-deficient mice during primary and secondary immune responses. It was confirmed when ectopic p18<sup>INK4c</sup> expression was shown to rescue PC differentiation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref025">25</xref>]. Consistent with these observations, reduced proliferation and concurrent differentiation towards a PC phenotype correlates with increased p18<sup>INK4c</sup> expression in mitogen-activated CD19<sup>+ve</sup> human B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref026">26</xref>]. Moreover, increased amounts of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> (relative to its preferred target, the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6) are linked to differentiation in other cell lineages, including osteoclasts and myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>There is general agreement that in vivo, differentiation of B cells to PCs can be initiated from various cell populations, including antigen-activated extra-follicular B cells (e.g., marginal B cells and B1 cells), from GC B cells, and from circulating MBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref029">29</xref>]. In each case the genome-wide transcription patterns of the B cells and derived PCs are significantly different, indicating that there is substantial reprogramming of gene expression networks as differentiation proceeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref028">28</xref>]. This is a very complex process involving many factors, but there is an emerging consensus of opinion that at least 3 transcriptional regulators are essential for differentiation to occur efficiently (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref032">32</xref>]). These factors are B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (BLIMP-1), interferon-regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), and a specifically spliced form of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1). Although EBV-transformed LCLs generally express high levels of IRF4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref034">34</xref>], they express little BLIMP-1 or XBP-1 (see below). It is the lack of sufficient BLIMP-1 that probably explains why EBV-activated B cells generally remain self-renewing blasts and fail to undergo default terminal differentiation to antibody-secreting PCs unless additional endogenous or paracrine signals are applied.</p>
<p>Until now, the relationship between EBV and the B cell differentiation specialized CDKI p18<sup>INK4c</sup> has not been reported. Considering EBNA3A and EBNA3C are well-established transcriptional regulators of CDKI, it was therefore of particular interest to investigate whether they also regulate p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and subsequently to determine whether EBNA3A and EBNA3C play a specific role in the regulation of B cell-to-PC differentiation—a role directly attributed to p18<sup>INK4c</sup>.</p>
<p>Here, using novel EBV recombinants encoding conditional versions of both EBNA3A and EBNA3C, we show that when these latent proteins are non-functional, mature human B cells infected ex vivo show elevated expression of 2 key regulators of PC differentiation, p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) data are consistent with EBNA3A and EBNA3C binding to regulatory elements and directly epigenetically repressing the <italic>CDKN2C</italic> (p18<sup>INK4c</sup>) and <italic>PRDM1</italic> (BLIMP-1) genes. Furthermore, cell surface marker analysis indicates a PC–like phenotype when EBNA3A and EBNA3C are inactive. We suggest a major physiological function of EBNA3A and EBNA3C is to block terminal differentiation to PCs, the default pathway in B cells normally activated by antigens without help from T cells.</p>

<title>EBNA3 proteins prevent activation of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> transcription after EBV infection</title>
<p>To assess the involvement of the EBNA3 proteins in regulation of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> we infected CD19<sup>+ve</sup> peripheral B cells with an EBV recombinant from which the whole EBNA3 locus was deleted (EBNA3KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref011">11</xref>]). We saw reproducibly—using B cells from independent donors—that 15–20 days post-infection (pi) there was a substantial increase in the expression of p18<sup>INK4c</sup>, compared to cells infected with the prototypical lab strain (referred to hereafter as ‘WT’ B95.8-BAC), where all EBNA3 proteins are expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Relative expression of the control housekeeping gene ALAS1 was unaffected by the absence of the EBNA3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). With substantial increases in p18<sup>INK4c</sup> expression seen in all donors when the entire EBNA3 locus is deleted, it is likely an EBNA3 protein, or a combination of EBNA3 proteins, is responsible for repression of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> expression.</p>

<title>Construction and validation of the double-conditional EBNA3A-ERT2 and EBNA3C-ERT2 EBV-recombinant (3A3CERT2)</title>
<p>As indicated above, the currently available data suggest that EBNA3B is unlikely to be involved in the regulation of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> or in the B cell transformation/immortalization process, with EBNA3A and EBNA3C widely considered the principle EBV-mediated regulators of CDKI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref022">22</xref>]. Therefore, to focus on the relative contributions of EBNA3A and EBNA3C, and to formally exclude EBNA3B playing a role in the context of the triple EBNA3KO EBV, we constructed a recombinant virus in which EBNA3A and EBNA3C could be co-regulated, while EBNA3B remained constitutively active (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The 3A3CERT2 virus—that expresses functional EBNA3A and EBNA3C only in the presence of the activating ligand (4-hydroxytamoxifen [HT]) of the modified-oestrogen receptor—was constructed using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technology and its genomic structure was confirmed (see Materials and methods). LCLs were established using CD19<sup>+ve</sup> B cells from 2 independent ‘buffy coats’ from anonymous donors (3A3CERT2 LCL D1 and 3A3CERT2 LCL D2) infected with 3A3CERT2 and cultured in the continuous presence of HT. When HT was removed, with the cells washed in fresh medium and re-cultured, the EBNA3 fusions were sequestered in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref037">37</xref>]. Western blot analyses of these cells showed that the stability of the EBNA3A- and EBNA3C-ERT2 fusion proteins was dependent on HT in the growth-medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). EBNA3A- and EBNA3C-ERT2 proteins have an increased molecular weight due to the ERT2-fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Expression of other EBV latency-associated proteins—including EBNA3B—was unaffected by this switch in EBNA3A/EBNA3C functionality. The expression of latency-associated proteins in 3A3CERT2 LCLs is comparable with those in ‘WT’ B95.8 LCLs with the exception of EBNA-LP. However, EBNA-LP levels have been shown to be donor dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref038">38</xref>], and although levels of this protein are lower in ‘WT’ B95.8 LCLs, they are comparable between 3A3CERT2 LCLs grown with or without HT.</p>
<p>Consistent with the results from these established LCLs, examining freshly infected primary B cells 20 days pi, grown either with or without HT, revealed similar patterns of latent protein expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g002">Fig 2C</xref> for example). This confirms our recombinant 3A3CERT2 virus has simultaneous conditional expression of both EBNA3A and EBNA3C, while maintaining expression of other latency-associated proteins.</p>

<title>EBNA3A and EBNA3C are required to prevent activation of <italic>CDKN2C</italic>, the gene encoding p18<sup>INK4c</sup></title>
<p>In order to establish whether EBNA3A and/or EBNA3C regulate the expression of the p18<sup>INK4c</sup>-encoding gene <italic>CDKN2C</italic> in newly infected B cells, an experiment was performed using cells from a single donor infected with EBV recombinants conditional for EBNA3A (3AERT2), EBNA3C (3CERT2), or both proteins (3A3CERT2). Cells were cultured with or without HT, from the day of infection for up to 30 days. Samples of cells were harvested at the time of infection and after 10, 15, 20, and 30 days and mRNA extracted for analysis by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). There was little difference in the level of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> mRNA whether EBNA3A was functional (3AERT2 +HT) or inactive (3AERT2 -HT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Similar analysis of 3CERT2-infected cells suggested that non-functional EBNA3C (-HT) results in a small but sustained increase in p18<sup>INK4c</sup> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, by far the most striking increase in p18<sup>INK4c</sup> mRNA was seen when both EBNA3A and EBNA3C were inactive after infection (3A3CERT2 -HT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). These data were consistent in magnitude and kinetics with experiments using the triple knockout virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The results were consistent and reproducible in infections of B cells derived from 3 independent donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g003">Fig 3D–3F</xref>). We conclude that inactivating EBNA3A alone has very little effect on p18<sup>INK4c</sup> expression, and inactivating EBNA3C alone has a modest but reproducible effect. However, inactivating EBNA3A and EBNA3C simultaneously leads to a very robust activation of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> expression during the first 3 weeks after infection, confirming EBNA3A/EBNA3C-mediated regulation of <italic>CDKN2C</italic>. Analysis of control housekeeping genes (e.g., <italic>ALAS1</italic>) showed no change in the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001992.s001">S1A–S1C Fig</xref>), but similar analysis of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> mRNA confirmed what has been widely reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref040">40</xref>]; that is, inactivating EBNA3C or, to a lesser extent, EBNA3A leads to increased p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression.

By 12 days pi, repression of both p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 can no longer be reversed—that is, cells exposed to active EBNA3A/EBNA3C for 12 days appear to be committed to self-renewal rather than differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g006">Fig 6A–6C</xref>; a second independent donor is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001992.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitations reveal binding of both EBNA3A and EBNA3C to <italic>CDKN2C</italic> and <italic>PRDM1</italic> loci</title>
<p>Interrogating a recent ChIP-seq analysis performed on LCLs established with EBV-recombinants expressing epitope-tagged EBNA3A or EBNA3C revealed multiple binding peaks on chromatin for both EBNA3A and EBNA3C distributed across both the <italic>CDKN2C</italic> (p18<sup>INK4c</sup>) and <italic>PRDM1</italic> (BLIMP-1) loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g008">Fig 8</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref015">15</xref>]). At the <italic>CDKN2C</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) both the raw sequence reads and peaks identified by the high stringency model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (MACS) algorithm revealed 4 substantial EBNA3C binding sites (BS1-4), of which BS1 spans the predicted transcription start site (TSS; -490 to +44) for p18<sup>INK4c</sup> mRNA. EBNA3C appears to bind BS1 and BS2 very efficiently, but considerable EBNA3C is also found at a discrete intronic site, BS3. Overall, the distribution of EBNA3A appears similar, but the binding is probably slightly less efficient—with only 1 MACS peak being called, at BS3. To verify EBNA3A and EBNA3C occupancy there, binding of tagged EBNA3A (EBNA3A-TAP) and tagged EBNA3C (EBNA3C-TAP) at these loci were determined in LCLs by ChIP-qPCR. These data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>) confirm that BS1 and BS2 (both located proximal to the p18<sup>INK4c</sup> TSS) are the predominant binding sites.</p>

<title>Sustained EBV-mediated repression of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 expression involves PRC2 and the repressive histone modification H3K27me3</title>
<p>On the basis of all the data presented above (and previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref041">41</xref>]), we assumed that EBNA3A and EBNA3C, by binding to the chromatin in the <italic>CDKN2C</italic> and <italic>PRDM1</italic> genes, would produce changes in histone modifications on local chromatin. At several EBNA3A/EBNA3C target genes, repression of transcription has been shown to correlate with the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 that is normally catalysed by the Enhancer of Zeste Homologue-2 (EZH2), an essential component of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref042">42</xref>].

Moreover, analysis of an established LCL confirmed a significant steady-state distribution of H3K27me3 when EBNA3A and EBNA3C are active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g009">Fig 9B</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to confirm that the histone mark H3K27me3, and therefore PRC2, is not only present but also involved in p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 repression in LCLs, we made use of the small molecule GSK126, a specific inhibitor of EZH2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref043">43</xref>]. Two independent LCLs (LCL WT D1 and LCL WT D2) were treated with the inhibitor for 20 days and harvested for RNA and protein extraction. The level of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g009">Fig 9C</xref>) and BLIMP-1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g009">Fig 9D</xref>) increased in both LCLs after EZH2 inhibition. Analysis of protein levels by western blot also confirmed the de-repression of BLIMP-1, and to a lesser extent p18<sup>INK4c</sup>, and that the GSK126 treatment effectively abrogated the total level of H3K27me3 in LCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). As expected, proliferation in GSK126-treated cells is reduced, with EBNA3A and EBNA3C protein expression modestly increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001992.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, we conclude that PRC2 and the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 are involved in EBNA3A and EBNA3C mediated repression of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1.</p>

<p>Levels of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> mRNA in 3A3CERT2-infected cells with non-functional EBNA3A and EBNA3C are lower but comparable to U266 levels (depending on the donor) and consistently higher than when EBNA3A and EBNA3C are active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). On the other hand, levels of BLIMP-1 in these cells far exceed that seen in U266 across all donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). Western blotting and quantification by densitometry confirmed these RNA changes in p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 translate to protein, with respective levels consistent between RNA and protein expression in U266 and 3A3CERT2-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g010">Fig 10C and 10D</xref>). BLIMP-1 is a DNA-binding zinc finger transcription factor and many of its target genes have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref047">47</xref>]. To determine whether increasing BLIMP-1 was functional in our cells and transcriptionally activating target gene <italic>XBP-1</italic>, and repressing the target genes <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>SPIB</italic>, we extended our mRNA analysis of 3A3CERT2-infected cells. Consistent with a physiological increase in functional BLIMP-1, and concurrent p18<sup>INK4c</sup> increase, <italic>XBP-1</italic> transcription consistently increases around 4-fold when EBNA3A and EBNA3C are inactivated, exceeding levels seen in U266, which are comparable to EBV-infected cells with functional EBNA3A and EBNA3C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g010">Fig 10E</xref>). Furthermore, transcription of the BLIMP-1–repressed genes <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>SPIB</italic> is substantially reduced when EBN3A and EBNA3C are inactivated, reaching levels as low as U266 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g010">Fig 10F and 10G</xref>), indicating that the activated BLIMP-1 retains its repressive activity. <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>SPIB</italic> transcriptional repression and <italic>XBP-1</italic> activation were followed during the first 30 days after infection of primary CD19<sup>+ve</sup> B cells with the 3A3CERT2 virus +/- HT, and were found to be consistent with BLIMP-1 activation and comparable to the phenotype seen after infection with EBNA3KO virus relative to ‘WT’ (B95.8-BAC) infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001992.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Alongside BLIMP-1, the transcription factor IRF4 is also implicated in the B cell-to-PC differentiation pathway (See Introduction, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref034">34</xref>]). Western blots showed that newly infected B cells and established LCLs express substantial amounts of IRF4—as much, if not more, than in U266. The level of expression is unaffected by EBNA3A/EBNA3C functionality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001992.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, we have found that in cells lacking functional EBNA3A and EBNA3C, factors required for PC differentiation are induced to levels comparable to, or greater than, levels in U266 cells.</p>

<p>Taken together, these results show that in the absence of EBNA3A and EBNA3C, EBV-infected cells express an increasingly PC–like phenotype, with evidence of elevated IgG and IgM production, further indicating that EBNA3A and EBNA3C function to prevent PC differentiation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have provided an unambiguous link between the EBV transcription factors EBNA3A and EBNA3C, and the suppression of a transcription program that normally drives activated B cells towards the phenotype of terminally differentiated PC. Deletion or biochemical inactivation by manipulation of the <italic>EBNA3A</italic> and <italic>EBNA3C</italic> genes in the virus genome produces recombinant EBVs that, when used to infect CD19<sup>+ve</sup> B cells ex vivo, are unable to produce ‘immortalized/transformed’ LCLs. Such viruses appear to have no gross defects that become manifest during the early phase of rapid B cell polyclonal expansion described by Luftig and colleagues ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref053">53</xref>]). However, around 15 days pi, in cells where both EBNA3A and EBNA3C were functionally incapacitated, we saw substantially elevated levels of the CDKI p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and the major PC differentiation transcriptional regulator BLIMP-1—unlike cells expressing functional EBNA3A and/or EBNA3C. Our results suggest that for maximal repression there is cooperation between EBNA3A and EBNA3C, but that each alone might exert repressor activity, in a donor dependent manner. This is consistent with reports of cooperative activity that have been described for other EBNA3A/EBNA3C-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref054">54</xref>]. The observation that these EBNA proteins can also be co-precipitated from cell extracts and the multiple reports that EBNA3A and EBNA3C commonly co-localize across the genome of LCLs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g008">8</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref055">55</xref>]) support this hypothesis. However, a precise biochemical description of the mechanism(s) responsible for cooperation has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>As both p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 induce a post-mitotic state, it is not surprising that they have both been identified as tumour suppressor proteins that are commonly compromised by mutation or silencing in B cell lymphoma—including EBV-negative DLBCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref059">59</xref>]. In EBV-positive DLBCL it is possible that EBNA3A and EBNA3C are responsible for this inactivation and, in this setting, contribute to oncogenic progression.</p>
<p>We cannot rule out the possibility that EBNA3A and EBNA3C directly regulate additional genes required for differentiation. However, finding (by ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR) that both proteins are bound to chromatin at regulatory elements in the vicinity of the <italic>CDKN2C</italic> and <italic>PRDM1</italic> loci has driven our working hypothesis that these cellular regulators are primary targets and that EBNA3A/EBNA3C-binding to local chromatin results in the recruitment of factors that initiate and sustain the chromatin state responsible for reducing transcription. These data, and those described in many other reports, are consistent with EBNA3A and EBNA3C binding to regulatory elements, followed by the removal of activation-associated histone marks (e.g., H3/H4KAc), concomitant chromosomal conformational changes, and finally further covalent histone modifications by polycomb protein complexes (particularly H3K27me3, catalysed by the EZH2 component of PRC2). Polycomb-mediated modifications then fix this state into a stable epigenetic form of repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref060">60</xref>]. This sequence of events, with EBNA3A and EBNA3C initiating polycomb-mediated repression by 12 days pi—but not being required to sustain the state—could explain why repression of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 was not reversed by the inactivation of EBNA3A and EBNA3C, but can be reversed by the inhibitor GSK126 reducing global H3K27me3 (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g009">9</xref>). Once the PRC2 machinery is in place, active EBNA3A and EBNA3C appear to be unnecessary at these specific loci to silence transcription in the infected cells and their progeny. Although it is beyond the scope of this study, it will be of great fundamental interest to determine what specific feature(s) of the <italic>CDKN2C</italic> (p18<sup>INK4c</sup>) and <italic>PRDM1</italic> (BLIMP-1) loci determine why they remain repressed after ablation of EBNA3A and EBNA3C, while simultaneously other EBNA3A/3C targets—including <italic>BCL2L11</italic> (BIM) and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> (p16<sup>INK4a</sup>)—are reactivated. Additionally, it will be of interest to determine whether this reversibility is related to requirements of gene expression during the sustained infection.</p>
<p>We believe that the biological aim of EBNA3A/EBNA3C-mediated epigenetic repression of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 is to suppress PC differentiation following EBV infection. This was confirmed through experiments showing cells with inactive EBNA3A and EBNA3C progress along a PC differentiation–like pathway following infection with EBV. We determined that physiological levels of both p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 in EBNA3A/EBNA3C-null cells are sufficient to drive PC differentiation with expression comparable to, or exceeding, those in 2 PC models: U266 cells and in vitro induced PCs. With differentiation, associated BLIMP-1 target genes responded as predicted to elevated BLIMP-1 transcription levels. Furthermore, phenotypic consequences of increasing levels of differentiation factors were identified by FCA, with elevated levels of markers characteristic of PCs and increased IgG and IgM production in cells with inactive EBNA3A and EBNA3C at 20 days pi.</p>
<p>It is likely complete differentiation of cells with inactive EBNA3A and EBNA3C into terminally differentiated PCs is being prevented by additional consequences of EBV infection, alongside the consequences of inactive EBNA3A and EBNA3C. This likely includes reduced proliferative capacity and rising levels of the CDKI p16<sup>INK4a</sup> leading to cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001992.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref039">39</xref>]). It would therefore be interesting to establish if p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-null cells with non-functional EBNA3A and EBNA3C can terminally differentiate into PCs.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 are the first genes to be identified as epigenetically repressed by EBNA3 proteins, where sustained repression subsequently becomes independent of the EBNA3 proteins. This stable and heritable regulation involving PRC2 does not require continuous expression of EBNA3A and EBNA3C, which we believe relates to establishment of EBV latency in MBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref005">5</xref>]. When EBV infects any type of quiescent, mature human B cell, the consensus of opinion is that it becomes activated, grows, and within a few days begins to proliferate rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref020">20</xref>]. In vivo, if helper T cells or T cell–derived factors are available, these cells can differentiate into GC-like B cells, and as they progress through the GC, viral gene expression is sequentially silenced. Cells exit the GC as MBC which do not express viral proteins, and form the site of viral latency and persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref006">6</xref>]. Usually, in the absence of EBV infection, when antigen-activated B cells have no T cell help, B cells can enter a default differentiation pathway to become plasmablasts, then Ig-secreting PCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref028">28</xref>]; however, it has yet to be established what happens if T cell help is unavailable in the context of EBV infection. We propose EBV has evolved a coordinated mechanism to favour long-term latency in MBC by preventing this PC differentiation pathway, whereby the transcription factors EBNA3A and EBNA3C specifically restrain the transcription of 2 critical regulators of PC differentiation—p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1. It is likely EBV has evolved to ensure transient expression of EBNA3A and EBNA3C during early EBV infection that is sufficient to irreversibly repress these PC differentiation factors as a mechanism to avoid of spontaneous PC differentiation of EBV-infected cells as EBNA3 genes are silenced during progression through the GC. This therefore favours memory B cell differentiation and long-term viral persistence and latency (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001992.g013">Fig 13</xref>).</p>

<title>EBNA3A and EBNA3C inhibit the differentiation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-activated B cells to plasma cells.</title>
<p>Upon EBV infection, mature human B cells become activated, grow and proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref020">20</xref>]. In vivo, in the presence of T cells or T cell–derived factors, infected cells can enter the germinal centre and differentiate into memory B cells—the site of long-term EBV latency and persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref006">6</xref>]. However, it has not been established what happens if T cell help is unavailable (Th<sup>-ve</sup>). Usually in the absence of T cell help, antigen-activated B cells can enter the default plasma cell differentiation pathway, resulting in antibody-producing plasma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref028">28</xref>]. We suggest EBV has evolved to prevent default plasma cell differentiation, thus favouring latency in memory B cells, through specific repression of the plasma cell differentiation factors p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (BLIMP-1), by the viral transcription factors EBNA3A and EBNA3C that act in vitro to support the activated B-blast population in establishing continuously proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Since the repression of the p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 genes utilizes the polycomb system (PRC2) and is stable and heritable, continuous expression of functional EBNA3A and EBNA3C is unnecessary to favour memory cell rather than plasma cell differentiation.</p>

<p>Finally, although the in vitro model system described here should be ideal for investigating how the switch from latency to the EBV lytic cycle and PC differentiation are coupled, we have been unable to shed light on this unifying feature of EBV biology. EBV replication occurs in rare cells undergoing PC differentiation in the tonsils of healthy carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref009">9</xref>] and recently BLIMP-1 was demonstrated to induce EBV reactivation in B cells by activating transcription from the lytic switch promoters, R and Z [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref061">61</xref>], providing a molecular link between the 2 phenomena; however, this was found to occur in only a subset of B cells. A prediction, based on our experiments described above, was that in the conditional EBNA3A/EBNA3C model, expression of the EBV lytic-switch protein BZLF1 (and mRNA) would echo p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 activation, with an inverse correlation between EBNA3A/EBNA3C function and EBV lytic activity. However, we found no consistent correlation between inactivating EBNA3A and EBNA3C, p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1 activation, and BZLF1 mRNA or protein expression. Donor-dependent behaviour, or incomplete terminal differentiation of EBNA3A/EBNA3C-null cells, may be responsible for this. On the other hand, it may result from the rarity in which EBV reactivation occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001992.ref009">9</xref>], of which a contributing factor may be difficulty in overcoming the EBNA3A and EBNA3C mediated stable repression of p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1. Unfortunately, exploring the biochemistry linking activation and differentiation is very challenging and beyond the scope of this current study.</p>
<p>In summary, we have formally established a link between the transcription regulatory activities of EBV and the B cell-to-PC differentiation process, and provided unique insights into the molecular mechanisms involved. We have shown that through epigenetic repression of the differentiation factors p18<sup>INK4c</sup> and BLIMP-1, EBNA3A and EBNA3C suppress the PC differentiation pathway following EBV infection, thus favouring establishment of long-term EBV latency in MBC.</p>
