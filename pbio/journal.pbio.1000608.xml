                <p>Defining the exact mechanisms by which the brain processes visual objects and
                    scenes remains an unresolved challenge. Valuable clues to this process have
                    emerged from the demonstration that clusters of neurons (“modules”)
                    in inferior temporal cortex apparently respond selectively to specific
                    categories of visual stimuli, such as places/scenes. However, the higher-order
                    “category-selective” response could also reflect specific
                    lower-level spatial factors. Here we tested this idea in multiple functional MRI
                    experiments, in humans and macaque monkeys, by systematically manipulating the
                    spatial content of geometrical shapes and natural images. These tests revealed
                    that visual spatial discontinuities (as reflected by an increased response to
                    high spatial frequencies) selectively activate a well-known place-selective
                    region of visual cortex (the “parahippocampal place area”) in
                    humans. In macaques, we demonstrate a homologous cortical area, and show that it
                    also responds selectively to higher spatial frequencies. The parahippocampal
                    place area may use such information for detecting object borders and scene
                    details during spatial perception and navigation.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Many reports suggest that different categories of visual stimuli are processed in
                    correspondingly specific “modules” in the visual cortex. For
                    instance, images of faces are processed in one cortical module (the
                    “fusiform face area”), while images of scenes are processed in an
                    adjacent module (the “parahippocampal place area,” or PPA). How does
                    the PPA encode for such high-level, complex visual scenes? In this study, we
                    show that at least part of the PPA response is due to a lower-level variable,
                    reflected as higher spatial frequencies. These are prominent in the edges and
                    details of scenes, but less prominent in faces and other stimuli. When we
                    altered standard images of faces and places so that they only contained low,
                    medium, or high spatial frequencies, we found that the PPA responded strongly to
                    images containing high spatial frequencies. Importantly, using the same stimuli
                    as for the human studies, we also demonstrated a homolog of human PPA in macaque
                    temporal cortex (“mPPA”). As in humans, mPPA responds selectively to
                    higher spatial frequencies. This demonstration of PPA in macaques paves the way
                    for carrying out further electrophysiological and anatomical studies that may
                    help elucidate the neural mechanisms for place selectivity in the human visual
                    cortex.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>There is lively interest in defining “category-specific” areas in the
                object processing regions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex, in both humans and
                monkeys. In such higher-order areas of the ventral visual pathway, discrete clusters
                of neurons reportedly respond selectively to specific categories of complex images
                such as faces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Kanwisher1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Tsao2">[3]</xref>, places <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Epstein1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Aguirre1">[5]</xref>, body parts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Downing1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Grossman1">[7]</xref>, tools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Martin1">[8]</xref>, animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Chao1">[9]</xref>, word forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Cohen1">[10]</xref>, and perhaps even chairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Ishai1">[11]</xref>. However, in the
                campaign to map the category-specific regions of visual cortex, it is sometimes
                overlooked that stimuli of a common category often also share lower-level visual
                cues. Correspondingly, many cells in IT cortex are selective for specific
                lower-level properties, including surface curvature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Janssen1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Kayaert1">[13]</xref>, Fourier descriptor shapes

                retinotopic location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-DiCarlo1">[20]</xref>. Thus, a hypothetical group of IT cells that responds
                robustly to a specific lower-level visual feature may also be interpreted as having
                a category-selective response—to the extent that these lower-level features
                are common to images from that category. For instance, functional magnetic resonance
                imaging (fMRI) studies have shown large-scale shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Wilkinson1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-OpdeBeeck1">[22]</xref> and eccentricity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Levy1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Hasson1">[24]</xref> maps in human
                and macaque temporal cortex, which coincide with category-selective areas (e.g.,
                face-selective patches). In fact, a recent theory suggests that overlapping
                continuous maps of simple features give rise to discrete modules that are selective
                for complex stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-OpdeBeeck2">[25]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Here we demonstrate such a coincidence between a lower-level feature-selective map
                and category selectivity, in a prominent region of IT cortex known as the
                parahippocampal place area (PPA). Previously it has been reported that PPA responds
                more to images of “places” (or “scenes”) than to images from
                certain other object categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Epstein1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Aguirre1">[5]</xref>. However, place images encompass a virtually infinite
                range of possible visual stimuli: how could such a wide range of stimuli be coded in
                visual cortex? Similarly, how can “placeness” be quantified, to enable
                experimental study? Here we found that a simpler, lower-level feature selectivity
                contributes strongly to the higher-level place-selective response in PPA. This
                feature selectivity enhances the visual borders and edges of surrounding landmarks,
                which is useful in brain processing of places, scenes, and higher-order processes
                such as navigation.</p>

            <p>The first sign of this lower-level selectivity arose serendipitously, when we were
                testing fMRI responses to very simple geometrical shapes including cubes and
                spheres. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the
                cortical response to a cube relative to a sphere, when both stimuli were closely
                matched along lower-level dimensions other than shape. Surprisingly, we found that
                the cube activated PPA robustly and selectively—unlike the response in other
                visual areas (e.g., the adjacent, face-selective fusiform face area
                [FFA]).</p>

                        FFT. The spectral distribution included a complex pattern of high SF
                        components in the cube, but not in the sphere. Here and in the other FFT
                        maps, the SF units are in cycles per pixel. (B) As a control, we produced an
                        fMRI map based on a conventional, blocked-design comparison of naturalistic
                        face versus place images, in five human subjects (using independent
                        localizer scans). The group-averaged activity map is displayed on a ventral
                        view of the averaged inflated cortical surface; the left hemisphere is shown
                        on the right, with anterior towards the top. Faces and places produced
                        relatively higher activity in FFA and PPA, respectively. (C) Relative
                        activation to the cube versus the sphere is based on the averaged data, from
                        the same five subjects shown in (B). The cube activated PPA robustly and
                        selectively, with a topography similar to that produced by place-based
                        activation. The color scale bars in the cortical maps here and in the other

            <p>This result has several implications. First, it revealed a vigorous and selective
                response to one computer-generated shape relative to another in PPA—though
                neither shape was a “place.” Second, this activity distinction occurred
                despite numerous similarities of the cube and the sphere: many other lower-level
                cues (e.g., surface reflectance, light source location, 3-D volume, and the visual
                field position of the shape center) were equated across the two stimuli.</p>
            <p>What could explain this unexpected result? Among the remaining properties that
                distinguished these two shapes, the cube had distinct spatial discontinuities (edges
                and 3-D corners) in the foreground, whereas the sphere did not. These feature
                differences were reflected as a difference in fast Fourier transform (FFT), a
                quantitative global measurement of image properties: a complex pattern of high
                spatial frequency (SF) components was present in the cube, but not in the sphere
                (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). From this, it
                appears that PPA responses are modulated by spatial discontinuities in some form,
                perhaps reflected in the form of higher SFs.</p>
            <p>To further explore the effect of spatial discontinuities, we added either a
                white-noise texture (“textured”) or surface irregularities
                (“bumpy”) to the cube and sphere, and measured the fMRI responses
                independently to these stimuli, in addition to the original “smooth”
                sphere and cube, in common scan sessions. Again, we found that the responses in PPA
                were always higher for cubes than spheres, irrespective of the surface properties of
                these two shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

                    <p>(A) In this experiment, the PPA responses were measured for
                        “smooth,” “bumpy,” and “textured”
                        versions of the sphere and cube (see icons). For each stimulus, the mean SF
                        was estimated by the weighted averaging of SFs in the FFT power spectrum.
                        This mean value was significantly greater in the three cubes, compared to
                        the three spheres (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005; paired

                        and cube shapes in PPA. The PPA region of interest was defined functionally
                        based on an independent place/face localizer (using naturalistic images; see
                            <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). An asterisk

                        one standard error of the mean, based on a within-subjects ANOVA design. PPA
                        showed a consistently higher fMRI response to cubes (which had a higher mean
                        SF) than to spheres, with a significant linear trend of increased activity
                            (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) from the addition of bumpy and textured

            <p>Additional experiments revealed that even simpler, 2-D stimuli (classical flickering
                checkerboards) could selectively activate PPA, when those stimuli included high
                spatial frequencies. Cortical maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s001">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s002">S2</xref>) and region-of-interest analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s003">Figure S3</xref>)
                showed a robust bias for high spatial frequencies in PPA, in response to
                checkerboard patterns—though such stimuli were neither places, nor objects,
                nor even 3-D shapes. The PPA response to high frequency checkerboards was even
                higher than that to normal, unfiltered checkerboards (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s002">Figure
                S2</xref>)—suggesting that the presence of lower spatial frequencies in the
                normal image can effectively reduce the PPA response to high spatial frequencies,
                perhaps due to nonlinear inhibitory interactions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

            <p>These results raise the question of whether at least part of the PPA response to
                “places” in previous reports may reflect the effect of uncontrolled
                spatial factors, including high spatial frequencies. To re-test this idea in the
                originally reported context, we first presented a range of naturalistic place and
                face images, because such place versus face comparisons have been used as a basic
                “localizer” for PPA (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Tong1">[26]</xref>). Intermixed with these normal
                stimuli, we presented the same set of images, after spatially filtering those images
                for low, middle, or high SFs. The initial SF-filtered images were generated based on
                arbitrarily chosen cut-off frequencies of 1 and 5 cycles/degree (c/deg) for low-pass
                and high-pass filtering, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Since normal face and place images had different SF
                distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), the cut-off frequencies were shifted for place images, so
                that the resultant SF-filtered places had the same fraction of total power as the
                SF-filtered faces (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s004">Figure S4</xref> for further details). Outside the
                scanner, the effect of SF filtering on image perception was behaviorally assessed in
                each subject. All subjects could easily distinguish all SF-filtered images as either
                faces or places.</p>

            <p>Again, we found that PPA was especially responsive to “high SF” stimuli,
                compared to “middle SF” and “low SF” stimuli. This
                preferential response to high SFs was present for both face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s005">S5</xref>) and place

                fact, the PPA response to <italic>faces</italic> (“nonoptimal” stimuli
                in PPA) almost doubled relative to that for normal images, when low and middle SF
                components were removed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Maps of this high SF bias even
                reflected the same idiosyncratic topography as classically defined PPA (localized
                using normal, naturalistic images of places versus faces) in each subject (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g005">Figure 5</xref>)—thus emphasizing
                the underlying biological link between PPA and its high SF bias. Interestingly, the
                high SF face images were as effective as the place images in activating PPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>

            <p>In the experiments above, the SF content of the images was manipulated by frequency
                filtering. However, natural scenes can also vary dramatically in their SF
                distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Torralba1">[31]</xref>. Does PPA activity reflect this spectral variation in
                normal (unfiltered) natural scenes? To answer this, we conducted an additional
                experiment comparing the fMRI response to normal scenes that were relatively
                dominated by either high or low SFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s010">S10</xref>). Although both types of images were from the
                same semantic category (scenes), PPA (as defined by a scene/object localizer)
                responded significantly more to the scenes that had more power at high SFs (see

            <p>If this spectral sensitivity reflects a fundamental mechanism for neural scene coding
                in PPA, presumably it should also exist in a region of macaque visual cortex that
                corresponds to human PPA. To our knowledge, no such mechanism of high SF sensitivity
                has been reported previously in monkey. In fact, a monkey homolog of the human
                “place” area (PPA) has not yet been demonstrated. To test for a homolog
                of PPA in monkeys and for high SF sensitivity in this homolog area, we presented the
                same set of normal and SF-filtered stimuli to awake fixating monkeys, using fMRI
                procedures very similar to those used in the human scanning (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
            <p>First, using the original set of normal, naturalistic stimuli, we demonstrated a
                place-selective region in macaque IT cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g008">Figure 8</xref>) that was located in a consistent
                location, immediately ventral to the largest IT face patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g009">Figures 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s011">S11</xref>). Thus,
                this place-selective region in macaques is located exactly where it is predicted to
                lie, based on (1) the maps of face- and place-selective areas (FFA and PPA) in
                humans and (2) the previously reported location of the monkey homolog of FFA (mFFA)
                in macaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Tsao1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Pinsk1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Rajimehr1">[33]</xref>. This monkey homolog of PPA (mPPA) was confirmed in an
                averaged map from three monkeys tested with additional control stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s012">Figure S12</xref>).
                All this evidence demonstrates that macaque monkeys do have a homolog of cortical
                area PPA, as defined originally in humans.</p>

                            <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>), in awake monkeys. The
                        activity map is displayed on a flattened view of macaque visual cortex in
                        two monkeys (four hemispheres). The left panels show right hemispheres. The
                        right panels show left hemispheres, mirror-reversed for ease of comparison.
                        In all hemispheres, a place-selective patch (mPPA) was consistently
                        localized in posterior IT cortex, adjacent/overlapping the posterior middle
                        temporal sulcus, immediately ventral to the posterior temporal face patch
                        (not shown). The topographic location of mPPA was slightly variable across
                        individuals. A similar individual variability has been reported for the
                        location of peak activity in human PPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Aminoff1">[49]</xref> and unpublished data).
                        An additional place-selective patch was also localized in the anterior bank
                        of the lunate sulcus, in occipito-parietal cortex. Presumably this dorsal
                        patch is the monkey homolog of an additional human place-selective area
                        located in the transverse occipital sulcus.</p>

            </fig>
            <p>Importantly, subsequent tests showed that the mPPA was strongly selective for high
                SFs—again like PPA in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g009">Figures 9C–9F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s013">S13</xref>). In fact, the SF bias here was strong enough
                to reveal a striking double dissociation: relative fMRI activation in mPPA/mFFA
                could be effectively reversed by changing <italic>either</italic> object category
                (place versus face) <italic>or</italic> SF (high versus low) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This finding also
                reemphasizes the lower-level nature of the trigger features in this “place
                processing” region of IT cortex: it is unlikely that monkeys have the same
                higher-order place associations as humans, in response to the same naturalistic
                images.</p>

                        termed mFFA, based on its apparent homology with human FFA) in the fundus
                        and the lower bank of superior temporal sulcus, and a smaller
                        “anterior temporal face patch” (ATFP) in the upper bank of
                        anterior middle temporal sulcus. Our maps also revealed a robust
                        place-selective patch, mPPA (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g008">Figure 8</xref>, the upper-right panel), located

                        (especially its dorsal and posterior subdivisions) responded selectively to
                        high SFs, whereas the face-selective mFFA (especially the central “hot
                        spot” area of mFFA, which is most face-selective) responded
                        selectively to lower SFs; a similar selectivity was found in the anterior
                        face-selective area (anterior temporal face patch). That hot spot center of
                        mFFA (delineated with a black/white dotted contour) was selected by
                        increasing the statistical threshold to

            <p>Why would this high SF bias exist in PPA? From a “top-down” perspective
                (e.g., a category-based model), this kind of information might be especially useful
                in defining “places” because high SFs, which are emphasized in edges,
                borders, and small spatial details, are crucial for survival in primate arboreal
                navigation (in reaching and grasping during brachiation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g010">Figure 10</xref>], avoiding obstacles, etc.) or
                when detecting predators in visually complex surroundings. By this idea, a
                sensitivity to spatial discontinuities (as reflected in high SFs) may have been
                enhanced in PPA during evolution, in the service of spatial perception and
                navigation. This view integrates the data here with the
                “place-selective” model of PPA function.</p>

                    <p>The top panel shows an image of two apes (gibbons) navigating through the
                        forest canopy. The middle and bottom panels show the same image, when
                        filtered for high and low SFs, respectively. The high SFs highlight the
                        borders of the branches and vines, but those borders are essentially
                        invisible in the low SF image. In the normal image (top), the borders are
                        arguably less identifiable than in the high SF image, due to competing
                        visual clutter. The ability to exactly localize the borders of these
                        environmental features has obvious survival value. The original image was
                        taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Filler1">[50]</xref> with permission.</p>

            </fig>
            <p>However, our data also raise an alternative, “bottom-up” possibility
                (e.g., a lower-order interpretation). If a sensitivity to spatial discontinuities
                (e.g., a high SF bias) explains <italic>some</italic> of the PPA response, can an
                improved understanding of this lower-level spatial selectivity eventually explain
                    <italic>all</italic> of that response? Our evidence clearly indicates a spatial
                selectivity in PPA, but this initial spatial characterization based on linear SF
                analysis is likely imperfect. Even in primary visual cortex, many cells show
                nonlinear inhibitory interactions in response to two SFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-DeValois1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-DeValois2">[35]</xref>. Most commonly, such
                single-unit interactions consisted of lower SFs inhibiting higher frequencies. Our
                fMRI data showed analogous interactions in PPA (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s002">Figure S2</xref>).
                Thus, a more refined spatial characterization (beyond simple SF filtering) may
                ultimately explain even more of the variance in the PPA response. For instance,
                measurements of SF per se did not capture all of the variation in the PPA response
                in the cubes-and-spheres experiment. Ultimately, it may turn out that PPA responds
                selectively to a specific type of spatial discontinuity (e.g., corners, or
                Y-junctions), but not to others (e.g., linear edges)—though all these features
                add power at higher SFs in the FFTs from the entire image.</p>
            <p>How can the evidence for a high SF bias be reconciled with the previously reported
                response to conventional place/scene images in PPA? In fact, there may be little or
                no discrepancy. As one might suspect, an FFT analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s014">Figure S14</xref>)
                confirms that conventional (unfiltered) place images (e.g., images of buildings)
                have substantially more energy at high SFs than images of faces. Thus, both
                “high SF” and “place” hypotheses predict a robust activation
                in PPA in response to conventional place images.</p>
            <p>According to previous reports (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Epstein2">[36]</xref>), “intact”
                (normal) place images evoke a larger response in PPA than “scrambled”
                object images. In fact, this comparison is sometimes used as a conventional
                localizer for PPA. Intuitively, one might expect that the scrambled images would
                have more high SF power, because additional edges are added to the image during
                scrambling. Does this finding violate our conclusion that PPA responds best to
                higher SFs? To resolve this, we measured the normalized high SF power (the high SF
                power divided by the total power) for place and scrambled images used recently by
                others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Epstein2">[36]</xref>.
                Counterintuitively, we found that the place images had more high SF power than the
                scrambled images (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.00001)—presumably reflecting the
                lower spatial density in the latter.</p>
            <p>Previous human fMRI studies by Malach and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Levy1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Hasson1">[24]</xref> showed that PPA responds better
                to peripheral stimuli than to foveal stimuli, relative to the neighboring FFA. It is
                also known that psychophysical sensitivity to higher SFs decreases at increasing
                eccentricities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Campbell1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Thibos1">[38]</xref>. Thus, our finding of a high SF bias in PPA appears to
                conflict with the peripheral bias in PPA. However, this apparent contradiction does
                not challenge our present results when all details are considered. In the
                experiments here, the full range of SFs was readily visible, at all eccentricities
                stimulated. In the fovea, human observers can resolve SFs up to ∼50 c/deg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Thibos1">[38]</xref>; this is a log
                unit higher than the maximum cut-off frequency used in our experiments (i.e., &gt;5
                c/deg). Even at the peripheral edge of our stimuli (10° eccentricity), human
                observers can resolve SFs more than twice as high as the 5-c/deg cut-off frequency
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Thibos1">[38]</xref>. Thus,
                even the “high” SFs presented here were all “low” enough to
                be clearly visible (and thus accessible to PPA), even in the periphery of our
                stimuli. Nonetheless, given the previous reports of retinotopic biases in PPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Levy1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Schwarzlose1">[39]</xref>, it is
                conceivable that the strength of high SF bias in PPA varies with corresponding
                variations in retinotopic location and size of the SF-filtered stimuli.</p>
            <p>In some (but not all) maps (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g006">6</xref>, and
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g009">9</xref>), there was a partial
                overlap between place selectivity and high SF selectivity in PPA; the high SF effect
                was stronger in the posterior-lateral part of PPA. It is possible that PPA contains
                two functionally distinct sub-regions: (1) a “posterior-lateral”
                sub-region more influenced by low-level features and (2) an
                “anterior-medial” sub-region more influenced by cognitive factors. A
                similar subdivision of parahippocampal cortex has been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Bar1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Arcaro1">[41]</xref>.</p>
            <p>To resolve whether PPA responds to places versus lower-level spatial parameters such
                as SF, it would be ideal to quantitatively measure the relative strength of these
                two parameters in PPA. We did this test in monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g009">Figure 9</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s007">Figure S7</xref>), and
                we obtained the qualitatively expected result. However, ultimately, it is not clear
                how to resolve this question quantitatively. How does one quantify
                “placeness”? What common metric can be used for both dimensions (i.e.,
                what SF distribution equals how much placeness)? How does one deal with the known
                variation in acuity (and SF sensitivity) with retinal eccentricity? Further research
                is required to resolve these issues. Irrespective of the outcome, it should be
                simpler to interpret the functional processing in this intriguing higher-tier visual
                area, now that a robust and quantifiable lower-level stimulus selectivity has been
                identified.</p>
            <p>Following the demonstration of face-selective regions in human visual cortex (e.g.,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Kanwisher1">[1]</xref>), it
                was shown that homologous face-selective regions also exist in visual cortex of
                macaque monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Tsao1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Pinsk1">[32]</xref>. This demonstration of homologous cortical regions across
                ∼50 million years of divergent primate evolution suggested that such neural
                mechanisms are fundamental to face processing, rather than some peculiarity of the
                human brain. More practically, the demonstration of face patches in monkeys made it
                possible to test the neural connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Moeller1">[42]</xref> and single-neuron response
                properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Tsao2">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Freiwald1">[43]</xref> in the face
                patches, in ways that are impossible in human subjects. Here the demonstration of
                homologous “place areas” enables similar experimental opportunities for
                understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this intriguing system.</p>

                <p>All subjects were scanned in a horizontal 3T scanner (Siemens Tim Trio). Gradient
                    echo EPI sequences were used for functional imaging (human: TR
                     = 2,000 ms, TE  = 30 ms, flip angle
                     = 90°, 3.0-mm isotropic voxels, and 33 axial slices;
                    monkey: TR  = 2,000 ms, TE  = 19 ms,
                    flip angle  = 90°, 1.0-mm isotropic voxels, and 50
                    axial slices). To increase functional magnetic resonance sensitivity in the
                    monkey scans (to compensate for smaller voxels), we used a gradient insert coil
                    (Siemens AC88), parallel imaging with a four-channel phased array coil, and an
                    exogenous contrast agent (MION; 8–10 mg/kg IV). Throughout the functional
                    scans, all subjects continuously fixated a small fixation spot at the center of
                    the visual display, and eye position was monitored in monkeys using an infrared
                    pupil tracking system (Iscan). A 3-D MP-RAGE sequence (1.0-mm isotropic voxels
                    in humans; 0.35-mm isotropic voxels in anesthetized monkeys) was also used for
                    high-resolution anatomical imaging from the same subjects. Functional and
                    anatomical data were preprocessed and analyzed using FreeSurfer and FS-FAST
                        (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>For each subject, the inflated cortex and flattened cortical patches were
                    reconstructed from MRI-based anatomical images. All functional images were
                    motion corrected, spatially smoothed (unless otherwise noted) using a 3-D
                    Gaussian kernel (2.5-mm half width at half maximum in humans and 1-mm half width
                    at half maximum in monkeys), and normalized across scans. For intensity
                    normalization, the BOLD image was first skull-stripped using the FSL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/</ext-link>) Brain Extraction Tool to create
                    a mask of brain-only voxels. Within this mask, the mean intensity of all voxels
                    across all time points was computed. The value at each voxel at each time point
                    was then scaled by 1,000 divided by the mean intensity, effectively forcing the
                    mean in the mask to be 1,000.</p>
                <p>The estimated hemodynamic response was defined by a γ function, and then the
                    average signal intensity maps were calculated for each condition. Voxel-wise
                    statistical tests were conducted by computing contrasts, based on a univariate
                    general linear model. To avoid sampling gaps in the (high-resolution) monkey
                    fMRI, we sampled and averaged the functional activity from all voxels located
                    within the gray matter, along the surface normal. Finally, the significance
                    levels were projected onto the inflated/flattened cortex after a rigid
                    co-registration of functional and anatomical volumes. Functional maps were
                    spatially normalized across sessions (in monkeys) and across subjects (in
                    humans) using a spherical transformation, then averaged using a fixed-effects
                    model.</p>

                <title>Visual Stimuli</title>
                <p>Stimuli were generated on a PC (Windows XP) and presented via LCD projector
                    (Sharp XG-P25, 1,024×768 pixels resolution, 60-Hz refresh rate) onto a
                    rear-projection screen. The projector luminance was gamma-corrected using a
                    hardware procedure. The gamma setting of the graphics card was set to the point
                    closest to linearity. Additionally, the projector settings were adjusted to
                    fine-tune the linear luminance transfer. The background luminance was set at 268
                        cd/m<sup>2</sup>. Matlab 7.0 and Psychophysics Toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psychtoolbox.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://psychtoolbox.org/</ext-link>) were used to program the
                    experiments.</p>
                <p>The cube/sphere stimuli (∼12° in size), including “smooth,”
                    “textured,” and “bumpy” versions, were all equated for

                    presented on a random dot background.</p>
                <p>The face/place stimuli (20° in size) were based on 20 grayscale face mosaic
                    (“group photograph”) and place (indoor scene) images, which were
                    qualitatively matched in visual complexity and natural image statistics (e.g.,
                    quantity of objects and degree of clutter) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000608-Oliva1">[46]</xref>. The initial face/place
                    images (and also the black-white checkerboard images, which were 25° in
                    size) were then spatially filtered (using a Hamming-windowed, causal
                    linear-phase FIR filter with symmetric impulse response), and presented on a
                    uniform gray background. The SF-filtered stimulus set included the following:

                <p>The scene stimuli (20° in size, grayscale) were selected from a large scene
                    image database (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s010">Figure S10</xref> for details).</p>
                <p>All stimuli were presented in a blocked design. Within a functional run, the
                    first and last blocks were null (fixation only) epochs, and the remaining
                    stimulus blocks were ordered pseudo-randomly. In the cube/sphere experiments,
                    the stimulus (e.g., a smooth cube) was presented unchanged throughout a given
                    block (“single stimulus imaging”), except for the location of a
                    virtual light source, which was systematically varied every second to refresh
                    the fMRI activity (four source locations, ranging within ±32° in
                    azimuth and ±25° in elevation). In the checkerboard experiments, the
                    stimulus (e.g., high SF checks) was presented in different phases, within a
                    fixed spatial envelope (the phase of the stimulus was systematically varied
                    every 500 ms). In the face/place and scene experiments, multiple examples/images
                    of a particular stimulus condition (e.g., high SF faces) were randomly presented
                    within a given block, with each image presented for 1 s (in the face/place
                    experiment) or 2 s (in the scene experiment).</p>
                <p>To control for variations in attention, we had the human subjects detect/report a
                    briefly presented red dot (0.2°×0.2°), which could appear anywhere
                    on the cube/sphere shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g001">Figures
                        1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g002">2</xref>) and H/L
                    scenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g007">Figure 7</xref>) during
                    scanning at unpredictable times. Thus, to achieve a stable performance, subjects
                    had to covertly attend to the full visuotopic extent of each stimulus. The
                    detectability of the dot converged to 75% correct, based on a staircase
                    modulation of dot luminance relative to the local background luminance (roughly,
                    dot saturation). The subjects' performance was thus equated across
                    different stimulus conditions. In the monkey experiments, attention was
                    controlled by the fixation task, using juice reward.</p>
                <p>Each human scan session consisted of 12 functional runs, with each run containing
                    18 blocks (block duration  = 16 s). Each monkey scan
                    session consisted of 20 functional runs, with each run containing 10 blocks
                    (block duration  = 24 s). In total, we collected 66,223
                    functional volumes (43 sessions) in humans, and 35,840 functional volumes (14

                        database was originally intended for categorization of scenes from tiny (32

                        different scene categories, ten indoor (e.g., living room, office, library)
                        and ten outdoor (e.g., mountain, city, forest) categories. For each image,
                        the high SF (SF &gt; 5 c/deg) power was calculated. In order to compare the
                        power values across images, the high SF power in an image was normalized by
                        the total power in that image. (A) shows the percentage of the normalized

                        responded significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−2</sup>) more
                        to the place category than to the other categories. In both hemispheres,
                        mPPA was topographically located lateral to the occipito-temporal sulcus
                        (OTS), in caudal TE (posterior IT cortex).</p>

                        maps show the pattern of activity produced by high SF versus low SF
                        checkerboards. The activity maps are displayed on a flattened view of
                        macaque visual cortex (left hemisphere [LH] and right hemisphere
                        [RH]). The white arrows indicate the high SF activity in the IT
                        cortex, overlapping the mPPA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000608-g009">Figure 9E and 9F</xref>). The maps also reflect
                        the large-scale central-versus-peripheral bias in SF sensitivity (also shown
                        in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000608.s008">Figure

                            images.</bold> In this analysis, we first computed the power spectra of
                        ten building images and ten single face images (images commonly used in a
                        PPA/FFA localizer). The power spectrum of each image was normalized by the
                        power of the DC component. Then the building-versus-face spectral map was
                        generated by subtracting the averaged power spectrum of buildings from the
                        averaged power spectrum of faces (both in a decibel format). The red/blue
                        color map represents the power (energy) difference in Fourier space
                        (red/yellow: buildings have more energy than faces, particularly along
                        horizontal and vertical orientations; blue/cyan: faces have more energy than
                        buildings). Points near the center of the Fourier image correspond to low
                        SFs. The single face images were selected from the Max Planck Institute for
                        Biological Cybernetics Face Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faces.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/" xlink:type="simple">http://faces.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/</ext-link>), and the building images
                        were selected from the Microsoft Research Cambridge Object Recognition Image
