        <p>Cyclic oscillations in the level of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate in phagosomes, regulated by two phosphoinositide kinases and one phosphatase, are critical for phagosome maturation and degradation of apoptotic cells.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) is a signaling molecule important for many membrane trafficking events, including phagosome maturation. The level of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes oscillates in two waves during phagosome maturation. However, the physiological significance of such oscillation remains unknown. Currently, the Class III PI 3-kinase (PI3K) Vps34 is regarded as the only kinase that produces PtdIns(3)P in phagosomal membranes. We report here that, in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Class II PI3K PIKI-1 plays a novel and crucial role in producing phagosomal PtdIns(3)P. PIKI-1 is recruited to extending pseudopods and nascent phagosomes prior to the appearance of PtdIns(3)P in a manner dependent on the large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1). PIKI-1 and VPS-34 act in sequence to provide overlapping pools of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes. Inactivating both <italic>piki-1</italic> and <italic>vps-34</italic> completely abolishes the production of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P and disables phagosomes from recruiting multiple essential maturation factors, resulting in a complete arrest of apoptotic-cell degradation. We have further identified MTM-1, a PI 3-phosphatase that antagonizes the activities of PIKI-1 and VPS-34 by down-regulating PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes. Remarkably, persistent appearance of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P, as a result of inactivating <italic>mtm-1</italic>, blocks phagosome maturation. Our findings demonstrate that the proper oscillation pattern of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes, programmed by the coordinated activities of two PI3Ks and one PI 3-phosphatase, is critical for phagosome maturation. They further shed light on how the temporally controlled reversible phosphorylation of phosphoinositides regulates the progression of multi-step cellular events.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>During animal development and in adulthood many cells are programmed to die by an active process called apoptosis. These dead or dying apoptotic cells are swiftly taken up by scavenger cells into membrane-bound compartments—phagosomes—where they are subsequently degraded when other intracellular organelles containing digestive enzymes fuse with phagosomes—a process called phagosome maturation. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is important for tissue remodeling in development and to prevent harmful inflammatory and autoimmune responses. In nematode worms—a model organism in which to study apoptosis—phagosome maturation is accompanied by two waves of the signaling molecule phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) in this compartment: one that forms soon after the formation of the phagosome and lasts for 10–15 minutes, and a second, weaker one 10 minutes later that lasts until the apoptotic cell is fully digested. In this study, we investigated the mechanism that regulates the timing and length of these two waves. We found that they are established by the sequential and combined action of three enzymes: two phosphoinositide 3-kinases, which add a phosphate group to the 3′ site of PtdIns, and one phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase, which removes it. We showed that inactivation of both kinases depleted phagosomes of PtdIns(3)P and resulted in the arrest of phagosome maturation and degradation of apoptotic cells. In addition, the timely turnover of PtdIns(3)P catalyzed by the phosphatase was critical for the step-wise progress of phagosome maturation. Our findings suggest that reversible phosphorylation of phophoinositides, catalyzed by distinct sets of kinases and phosphatases, might be a general mechanism to drive multi-step intracellular membrane trafficking events.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>PtdIns(3)P is a phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) species that is embedded in distinct membrane domains and plays important roles in many membrane trafficking events, including endocytic trafficking, retrograde trafficking, autophagy, and phagosome maturation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Falasca1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Backer1">[2]</xref>). PtdIns(3)P activates downstream pathways through recruiting specific PtdIns(3)P-binding proteins, the PtdIns(3)P effectors, to the site of action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-DiPaolo1">[3]</xref>. The production and elimination of PtdIns(3)P on a particular membrane domain, such as the surface of phagosomes, are presumably under tight temporal regulation to allow the occurrence of multiple transient signaling events. However, the molecular mechanisms behind such regulation are not well understood.</p>
      <p>In metazoan, such as the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and mammals, a large number of cells undergo apoptosis during development and adulthood and are subsequently engulfed by phagocytes and degraded inside phagosomes. Like other phagosomal cargos, dying cells are degraded through phagosome maturation, a process that relies heavily on the fusion between phagosomes and various intracellular organelles including endosomes and lysosomes, which leads to the delivery of digestive enzymes into phagosomes and the acidification of the phagosomal lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Vieira1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Kinchen1">[6]</xref>. Immediately after an apoptotic cell is internalized, a high level of PtdIns(3)P appears transiently on the surface of a nascent phagosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Mangahas1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>. This prominent feature was observed on nascent phagosomes containing various kinds of cargos, including zymosan particles, latex beads, and invading pathogens in addition to apoptotic cells and is well conserved in different organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Mangahas1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Kinchen2">[13]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, during the maturation of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells, PtdIns(3)P is dynamically enriched on phagosomes in two consecutive waves: the initial burst, which appears upon the closure of a phagocytic cup and dissipates after 10–15 min, and a subsequent reappearance of a relatively weaker PtdIns(3)P signal approximately 10 min later, which lasts until an apoptotic cell is fully degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Mangahas1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>. Such a PtdIns(3)P oscillation pattern has also been observed on phagosomes containing other kinds of cargos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Chua1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Pattni1">[14]</xref>. However, the physiological significance of this biphasic PtdIns(3)P appearance on phagosomes remains unknown.</p>
      <p>PtdIns(3)P is a 3′-phosphorylated form of PtdIns. Among the three classes of known phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), Vps34, the sole Class III PI3K, is known to specifically produce PtdIns(3)P on intracellular membranes, such as endosomes, phagosomes, and autophagosomes, to regulate diverse membrane trafficking events (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Backer1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Vanhaesebroeck1">[15]</xref>). Specific inactivation of Vps34, through injection of anti-Vps34 antibodies into mammalian cells or RNA interference (RNAi) treatment in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, reduces the efficiency of phagosome maturation, indicating that PtdIns(3)P is important for promoting phagosome maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Vieira2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Kinchen2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Fratti1">[16]</xref>. However, whether Vps34 is the only PI3K that produces PtdIns(3)P on phagosomal surfaces remains unknown. Furthermore, in the absence of a strategy capable of complete depletion of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P, it is impossible to quantitatively determine how fundamental the role of PtdIns(3)P is in initiating phagosome maturation.</p>
      <p>During the development of <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites, 131 somatic cells and approximately 300–500 germ cells undergo programmed cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Metzstein1">[17]</xref>. These cells are easily recognizable within living animals under the Nomarski <underline>D</underline>ifferential <underline>I</underline>nterference <underline>C</underline>ontrast (DIC) optics as highly refractive, button-like objects referred to as “cell corpses” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Sulston1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Sulston2">[19]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, after being rapidly engulfed and contained inside phagosomes, apoptotic cells are degraded via a pathway initiated by the phagocytic receptor CED-1, which is transiently clustered on the surface of extending pseudopods and nascent phagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>. CED-1 triggers the robust production of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomal surfaces through recruiting the large GTPase DYN-1, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of mammalian dynamins, to phagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu2">[20]</xref>. In another study focusing on how PtdIns(3)P triggers phagosome maturation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we identified LST-4/SNX-9, SNX-1, and SNX-6, three PX and BAR domain-containing sorting nexins, as PtdIns(3)P effectors recruited to phagosomal surfaces by PtdIns(3)P and subsequently acting in two parallel pathways to drive the incorporation of endosomes and lysosomes into phagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Lu1">[21]</xref>. These findings revealed a signaling cascade initiated by phagocytic receptor CED-1, mediated by PtdIns(3)P, and executed through these sorting nexins to degrade apoptotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Lu1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the phagosome maturation-delay/arrest phenotype observed from <italic>C. elegans vps-34</italic> mutants was much milder than that from the <italic>ced-1</italic> or <italic>dyn-1</italic> single mutants, or the <italic>lst-4</italic>; <italic>snx-1</italic>; <italic>snx-6</italic> triple mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Kinchen2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Lu1">[21]</xref>, suggesting that inactivating VPS-34 alone might not completely deplete PtdIns(3)P from phagosomes. We examined whether there existed additional PI 3-kinase(s) responsible for producing phagosomal PtdIns(3)P.</p>
      <p>Besides Vps34, Class II PI3Ks are also able to produce PtdIns(3)P from PtdIns, whereas Class I PI3Ks primarily produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Vanhaesebroeck1">[15]</xref>. In vitro, PtdIns is the favorable substrate for Class II PI3Ks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-MacDougall1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Virbasius1">[25]</xref>. Multiple lines of evidence have revealed that Class II PI3Ks produce PtdIns(3)P in vivo in response to certain extracellular and intracellular stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Maffucci1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Velichkova1">[29]</xref>. However, in comparison to Class I and III PI3Ks, relatively little is known about the physiological functions and regulation of Class II PI3Ks (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Vanhaesebroeck1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Falasca2">[30]</xref>). In particular, it is not known whether any Class II PI3K(s) is involved in producing PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes. Here we revealed the function of PIKI-1, the only <italic>C. elegans</italic> Class II PI3K, in phagosome maturation.</p>
      <p>In a closely related aspect, little is known about the factors that down-regulate the initial peak of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P, or the physiological significance of PtdIns(3)P oscillation during phagosome maturation. Promising candidates able to down-regulate PtdIns(3)P level include PtdIns(3)P phosphatases. The myotubularin phosphatases are a family of PI phosphatases that convert PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> into PtdIns or PtdIns(5)P, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Robinson1">[31]</xref>. They act to maintain the homeostasis of PtdIns(3)P on intracellular membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Velichkova1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Robinson1">[31]</xref>. Inactivation of MTM-1, a member of the myotubularin family in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, rescued the endocytosis defect of <italic>vps-34</italic> mutants, suggesting that MTM-1 antagonizes the PI 3-kinase activity of VPS-34 during endosomal trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Xue1">[32]</xref>. However, it was not known whether MTM-1 was involved in the dephosphorylation of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P.</p>
      <p>In this report, we identified a novel role of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Class II PI3K PIKI-1 in the degradation of apoptotic cells. We further revealed the differential and complementary roles of PIKI-1 and VPS-34 in the production and maintenance of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P. Moreover, we have uncovered a novel function of MTM-1 in modulating the dynamic pattern of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes. We found that the prompt down-regulation of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P, like its robust production on nascent phagosomes, is pivotal for driving phagosome maturation. Our work revealed a regulatory system that issues a precise temporal control over the PtdIns(3)P cycling pattern on phagosomes and ensures the efficient degradation of apoptotic cells.</p>

        <p>To evaluate whether inactivating <italic>vps-34</italic> would result in a complete depletion of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P, we monitored the level of PtdIns(3)P on the surface of phagosomes using a previously established PtdIns(3)P reporter, 2xFYVE::GFP, which was expressed in engulfing cells under the control of P<italic><sub>ced-1</sub></italic> and specifically associated with PtdIns(3)P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Lu2">[33]</xref>. We first monitored phagosomal PtdIns(3)P inside gonadal sheath cells, the engulfing cells for apoptotic germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Gumienny1">[34]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In the gonad of wild-type adult hermaphrodites, 86% of germ cell corpses, recognized under the DIC optics, were labeled with bright 2xFYVE::GFP on their surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1A(a, e) and C</xref>), indicating the presence of PtdIns(3)P at high levels on phagosomal surfaces. Knocking down <italic>vps-34</italic> by RNA interference (RNAi) using two non-overlapping RNAi constructs reduced the percentage of gonadal phagosomes labeled with 2xFYVE::GFP to 54% or 58%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1A(b, f) and C</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) animals displayed a mild cell-corpse removal defective (Ced) phenotype resulting from un-removed cell corpses, evident by the modestly increased numbers of germ cell corpses in the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001245.s001">S1A</xref>), as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Kinchen2">[13]</xref>.

        <p>To examine VPS-34's contribution to the production of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P in a more strict manner, we created a strain that produced <italic>vps-34(h510)</italic>(<italic>m</italic><sup>−</sup><italic>z</italic><sup>−</sup>) (m, maternal gene product; z, zygotic gene product) homozygous null mutant embryos that lost both the maternal and the zygotic expression of <italic>vps-34</italic>, which is likely to represent the <italic>vps-34</italic> complete loss-of-function phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001245.s001">Figure S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001245.s011">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In <italic>vps-34(h510)</italic>(<italic>m</italic><sup>−</sup><italic>z</italic><sup>−</sup>) mutant embryos, the number of PtdIns(3)P-labeled cytoplasmic puncta, which represented early endosomal particles, was nearly abolished, consistent with the known function of VPS-34 in the production of PtdIns(3)P on early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1D(e, f, i, j)</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Roggo1">[35]</xref>.

        <p>In the gonad of <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> mutant hermaphrodites, the percentage of phagosomes labeled with 2xFYVE::GFP was reduced to 15% of the wild-type level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1A(c, g), B–C</xref>).

These observations revealed a novel activity of PIKI-1 in producing phagosomal PtdIns(3)P. Moreover, quantitative comparison of the percentage of PtdIns(3)P-labeled phagosomes in <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> and <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) animals indicates that in gonadal sheath cells, PIKI-1 plays a major role in producing PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>Inefficient removal of apoptotic cells might be caused by defects in either the internalization step or the degradation step.

        <title>Phagosomal PtdIns(3)P Is Indispensible for the Degradation of Apoptotic Cells</title>
        <p>Since the inactivation of either VPS-34 or PIKI-1 only partially impaired the PtdIns(3)P production on phagosomes, we further monitored PtdIns(3)P in the gonad of <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic>; <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) hermaphrodites and observed a near complete depletion of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1A(d, h) and 1C</xref>). Similarly, in mid-stage <italic>vps-34(h510)(m<sup>−</sup>z<sup>−</sup>)</italic>; <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> double mutant embryos, PtdIns(3)P was no longer detected on phagosomal surfaces or on any cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1D(d, h, l) and E</xref>). These observations indicate that VPS-34 and PIKI-1 together produce all the PtdIns(3)P molecules on gonadal and somatic phagosomes. They also indicate that <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) is potent in inactivating VPS-34 in the gonadal sheath cells since only a residual PtdIns(3)P-production activity was left on phagosomes in <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic>; <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) double mutant animals.</p>
        <p>Previously, without an effective method to completely block the production of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes, it was impossible to determine whether PtdIns(3)P was absolutely essential for triggering phagosome maturation or merely contributed to phagosome maturation as one of multiple signaling molecules. The <italic>vps-34</italic>; <italic>piki-1</italic> double mutant, in which PtdIns(3)P is no longer detectable on phagosomal surfaces, provides a suitable tool for addressing this question.</p>
        <p>In the adult gonads of <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic>; <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) double mutants, a larger number of persistent germ cell corpses were observed than in any PI3K single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As in <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> single mutants, all cell corpses were engulfed inside phagosomes in <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic>; <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1A(d, h, arrowheads)</xref>, indicating a specific defect in phagosome maturation. Similarly, <italic>vps-34(h510)(m<sup>−</sup>z<sup>−</sup>)</italic>; <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> double mutant embryos displayed a much stronger Ced phenotype than any single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). At 4-fold stage, the number of persistent cell corpses in the double mutant embryos was on average 10-fold larger than that in single mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). These observations strongly indicate that PIKI-1 and VPS-34 act in combination to drive the efficient degradation of cell corpses. The tight quantitative correlations between the depletion of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P and the arrest of cell-corpse degradation demonstrate that PtdIns(3)P is an imperative factor for phagosome maturation.</p>

        <title>PIKI-1 and VPS-34 Act Sequentially to Produce PtdIns(3)P on Phagosomes</title>
        <p>To determine why the activities of two PI3Ks, which produce an identical signaling molecule PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes, are both needed for efficient phagosome maturation, we monitored the pattern of PtdIns(3)P appearance on phagosomes over time in wild-type, each of the single PI3K mutant, and double PI3K mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figures 5</xref>). As reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>, in wild-type embryos, the level of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes oscillated in a two-wave pattern: immediately (2–4 min) after engulfment, a robust PtdIns(3)P signal rapidly appeared on nascent phagosomes and lasted for ∼15 min before it quickly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5A,E</xref>); after a gap period (∼10 min), a PtdIns(3)P signal weaker than the initial one reappeared on the maturing phagosomes, where it lasted until the phagosomal content was completely degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5A and E</xref>). During phagosome maturation, we also frequently observed PtdIns(3)P(+) puncta on phagosomes, which first attached to phagosomal surfaces and later merged into phagosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The dynamic association of PtdIns(3)P puncta with phagosomes likely represents the docking and fusion process of endosomes with phagosomes.</p>

        <p>In <italic>vps-34(h510)</italic>(<italic>m</italic><sup>−</sup><italic>z</italic><sup>−</sup>) single mutant embryos, PtdIns(3)P was robustly produced on nascent phagosomes immediately after engulfment, as in the wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5B, E, and F</xref>). However, PtdIns(3)P disappeared from phagosomal surfaces much more promptly, lasting for only 6 min on average on phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5B, E, and G</xref>). Moreover, PtdIns(3)P failed to reappear on phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5B and E</xref>). In contrast, in most <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> single mutant embryos, an obvious delay of PtdIns(3)P production on nascent phagosomes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5C, E, and F</xref>). Furthermore, the duration of the first PtdIns(3)P wave was significantly shorter than that in wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5A, C, E, and G</xref>). Apart from these aberrations, the disappearance of the initial phagosomal PtdIns(3)P and the subsequent reappearance of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes followed a relatively normal temporal pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5C and E</xref>). These observations indicate that PIKI-1 and VPS-34 play differential roles in the production and maintenance of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P: whereas PIKI-1 is required for the initial production of PtdIns(3)P, VPS-34 is needed for the sustained production of PtdIns(3)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Given that the Ced phenotype displayed by <italic>vps-34</italic> and <italic>piki-1</italic> single mutant embryos is similar in severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), the precise timing of initial PtdIns(3)P production must be as important as the proper time span of PtdIns(3)P appearance on phagosomes for phagosome maturation.</p>

        <p>Previously, whether the down-regulation of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P has any functional significance has not been explored. To address this question, we measured the rate of phagosome maturation in <italic>mtm-1(op309)</italic> embryos, aided by CED-1C (the intracellular domain of CED-1)::GFP expressed in the engulfing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>. CED-1C::GFP, which is evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of host cells, allowed us to detect the GFP(−) phagosomes as dark spheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g007">Figure 7F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>. In <italic>mtm-1(op309)</italic> mutant embryos, phagosome duration was mildly yet significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 2×10<sup>−9</sup>, Student's <italic>t</italic> test) prolonged, with the average duration 38% longer than the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g007">Figure 7E–F</xref>). This result suggests that the magnified and prolonged action of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes does not speed up but rather slows down phagosome maturation.</p>
        <p>The <italic>mtm-1(op309)</italic> mutation is a missense mutation (G106E) that only partially inactivates MTM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Neukomm1">[40]</xref>.

This strong Ced phenotype is unlikely a result of an off-target effect of RNAi, since two non-overlapping RNAi constructs, each of which targeting the N- or C-terminal half of <italic>mtm-1</italic> cDNA, respectively, caused the Ced phenotype to the same severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g007">Figure 7H</xref>).

This phenotype is in direct contrast to that displayed by <italic>ced-5(n1812)</italic> null mutants, which are primarily defective in the engulfment of germ cell corpses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g007">Figure 7I</xref>), and indicates that <italic>mtm-1</italic> is primarily required for phagosome maturation.</p>
        <p><italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi) increased the percentage of PtdIns(3)P-labeled gonadal phagosomes from 86% to 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g007">Figure 7J</xref>), again suggesting that PtdIns(3)P is retained on phagosomes once MTM-1 is inactivated. Together, the above results strongly indicate that the turnover of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P is crucial for phagosome maturation.</p>

        <p>To determine the functional relationship between MTM-1 and the two PI3Ks, we first analyzed <italic>mtm-1(op309)</italic>; <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> double mutant animals carrying the PtdIns(3)P reporter 2xFYVE::GFP. In both embryos and adult hermaphrodite gonads, <italic>mtm-1(op309)</italic>; <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> double mutants had significantly fewer numbers of persistent cell corpses than <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g008">Figure 8B–C</xref>). Furthermore, the percentage of phagosomes labeled with 2xFVYE::GFP was significantly higher in <italic>mtm-1(op309)</italic>; <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> double mutants than in <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g008">Figure 8B–C</xref>). These observations indicate that the partial loss of <italic>mtm-1</italic> function significantly rescued the defects caused by <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> mutation in both PtdIns(3)P production and phagosome maturation. The suppression effect of the Ced phenotype of <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> mutants by the <italic>mtm-1(op309)</italic> mutation became more evident when examined in strains not carrying P<italic><sub>ced-1</sub>2xFYVE::gfp</italic>, which might compete with endogenous PtdIns(3)P effectors for PtdIns(3)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g008">Figures 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001245.s006">S6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001245.s011">Text S1</xref>). More strikingly, in <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic>; <italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi) animals, the number of persistent germ cell corpses was drastically reduced to 15% of that observed in <italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi) animals and 29% of that in <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> single mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Therefore, <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> and <italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi), each of which caused a strong Ced phenotype, efficiently rescued each other's defect in phagosome maturation. These results clearly indicate that MTM-1 and PIKI-1 antagonize each other's activity and underscore the importance of a balanced PtdIns(3)P production on phagosomes.</p>
        <p><italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) resulted in a relative weak Ced phenotype in the adult hermaphrodite gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) modestly reduced the severity of the Ced phenotype of <italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). The suppression effect of <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) is much weaker than that of <italic>piki-1(tm3171)</italic> mutation, suggesting that PIKI-1 is the major PI3K that counteracts the activity of MTM-1.</p>
        <p>Importantly, the strong Ced phenotype caused by the simultaneous inactivation of <italic>piki-1</italic> and <italic>vps-34</italic>, which totally abolished PtdIns(3)P production, was no longer suppressible by <italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g008">Figure 8E</xref>), clearly demonstrating that MTM-1 specifically targets phagosomal PtdIns(3)P, the products of PIKI-1 and VPS-34.</p>

        <title>A Multi-Component Regulatory System that Establishes the Two-Wave Pattern of PtdIns(3)P on Phagosomes</title>
        <p>Among all PtdIns(3)P-mediated cellular events, phagosome maturation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a unique opportunity for studying the molecular mechanisms and the functional significance of the temporal changes of PtdIns(3)P on intracellular membranes because the dynamics of PtdIns(3)P can be readily monitored, using time-lapse microscopy, on a relatively large object (diameter &gt;2 µm) throughout the entire maturation process (∼50 min or longer). In this report, using genetic and live-cell imaging approaches, we identified a temporal regulation mechanism that programs the two-wave cycling pattern of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomal surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This mechanism is executed by PIKI-1 and VPS-34, two PI 3-kinases that sequentially produce PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes, and MTM-1, a PI 3-phosphatase that dephosphorylates phagosomal PtdIns(3)P. Our findings demonstrate that the precisely regulated production and turnover of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P are both essential for phagosome maturation and the consequential degradation of apoptotic cells.</p>

            <p>(A) Schematic diagram summarizing the oscillation pattern of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomal surfaces in wild-type and different mutant backgrounds. Data represent average values obtained from time-lapse recording of multiple C1, C2, and C3 phagosomes. The light and dark green colors reflect weak and strong PtdIns(3)P signals, respectively. Arrowheads indicate that the end point of the second PtdIns(3)P wave varies, depending on the duration of the phagosome. “0 min” represents the time point when engulfment is just complete. (B) A diagram indicating the functional periods of PIKI-1, VPS-34, and MTM-1 in establishing the biphasic oscillation pattern of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes, deduced from the PtdIns(3)P localization pattern summarized in (A) and the phagosomal enrichment periods of PIKI-1 and MTM-1. During the gap period, although MTM-1::GFP was not detected on phagosomes, MTM-1 might still display residual activity on phagosomal membranes. The production and elimination of PtdIns(3)P are both essential for phagosome maturation. The rapid production of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P initiates phagosome maturation via recruiting a number of direct or indirect PtdIns(3)P effectors (represented by oval shapes). The subsequent elimination of PtdIns(3)P might enable phagosomes to release the initial set of PtdIns(3)P-effectors and acquire a new set of effectors that function at a later stage of phagosome maturation. (C) Diagram illustrating the PtdIns(3)P-mediated pathway for the degradation of apoptotic cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The phagocytic receptor CED-1 and its adaptor CED-6 recruit the large GTPase DYN-1 to phagosomal surfaces, which in turn promotes the recruitment of PIKI-1 and VPS-34, resulting in the robust production of PtdIns(3)P on nascent phagosomes. RAB-5 is also proposed to facilitate the association of VPS-34 to phagosomes. MTM-1, which is localized on nascent phagosomes, promotes the rapid turnover of PtdIns(3)P. The phagosomal PtdIns(3)P is required for recruiting multiple phagosome maturation factors, including SNX-1, SNX-6, and LST-4/SNX-9, the direct PtdIns(3)P effectors, and small RAB GTPases, which act together to promote phagosome maturation and the degradation of apoptotic cells. LST-4/SNX-9 also acts to stabilize the association of DYN-1 to phagosomes (dashed line). The question mark indicates that the mechanisms utilized by PtdIns(3)P to recruit RAB GTPases are not clear.</p>

        <title>The Novel Function of a Class II PI3K in Initiating Phagosome Maturation</title>
        <p>The physiological functions of Class II PI3Ks are only starting to be understood. Mammalian Class II PI3Ks are implicated in the production of a dynamic PtdIns(3)P pool on the plasma membrane in response to external stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Maffucci2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Falasca3">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Domin1">[43]</xref>.

However, the function of Class II PI3Ks in phagosome maturation was not known. Previously, Class III PI3K Vps34 was thought to be the primary kinase that generated PtdIns(3)P on the surface of phagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Vieira2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Kinchen2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Fratti1">[16]</xref>. Here we identified the novel function of PIKI-1, the only <italic>C. elegans</italic> Class II PI3K, in producing a dynamic pool of PtdIns(3)P on nascent phagosomes and in initiating the degradation of apoptotic cells inside phagosomes. The combined activities of PIKI-1 and VPS-34 account for most if not all PtdIns(3)P molecules on the surface of phagosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first example that two PI3Ks, which belong to different classes, contribute to overlapping pools of PtdIns(3)P on a particular organelle and coordinately regulate the same cellular event.</p>
        <p>In <italic>piki-1</italic> and <italic>vps-34</italic> single mutants and <italic>vps-34</italic>; <italic>piki-1</italic> double mutants, defects in PtdIns(3)P-production correlate quantitatively with defects in cell-corpse removal, indicating that the lack of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P is the primary cause for the Ced phenotype. Our observations further indicate that the contribution of PIKI-1 and VPS-34 to phagosome maturation depends on the tissue context: in the adult hermaphrodite gonad, PIKI-1 apparently plays a major role in producing phagosomal PtdIns(3)P.</p>
        <p>The accumulation of persistent cell corpses could result from defects in either the engulfment or the degradation of apoptotic cells, two consecutive cellular events executed through different mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Vieira1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Caron1">[45]</xref>. A previous report suggested that <italic>piki-1</italic> mutants were specifically defective in the engulfment of apoptotic cells based on the observation of extra cell corpses in animals, which displayed the unique button-like morphology under DIC microscope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Zou1">[46]</xref>. However, persistent cell corpses, which could result from either inefficient engulfment or defective degradation, all display a similar DIC morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Lu1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Lu3">[37]</xref>. Thus, the DIC phenotype of cell corpses does not allow the defects in engulfment to be distinguished from that in phagosome maturation. In this study, through both fluorescence and electron microscopy, which are capable of distinguishing unengulfed cell corpses from engulfed ones, we found that PIKI-1 and VPS-34 specifically control the degradation but not the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that the defect of <italic>piki-1</italic> mutants that resulted in the accumulation of cell corpses was misinterpreted previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Zou1">[46]</xref>. Our results are also consistent with the observation that PtdIns(3)P, the molecule produced by PIKI-1 and VPS-34, appears on phagosomal surfaces only after engulfment is complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Mangahas1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Mammals have three Class II PI3K isoforms, which display differential expression patterns (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Falasca2">[30]</xref>). We propose that one or more mammalian Class II PI3Ks might act in phagocytes such as macrophages to promote the degradation of apoptotic cells and other kinds of phagosomal contents such as invading pathogens through producing phagosomal PtdIns(3)P.</p>

        <title>The Differential Roles of PIKI-1 and VPS-34 in Regulating Phagosome Maturation and Other Cellular and Developmental Events</title>
        <p>We have found that PIKI-1 and VPS-34 play differential roles in establishing the dynamic PtdIns(3)P pattern on phagosomal surfaces: whereas PIKI-1 initiates the production of PtdIns(3)P on nascent phagosomes, VPS-34 acts to maintain the level of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P for the subsequent period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g009">Figure 9A–B</xref>). The functional period of PIKI-1 on phagosomes corresponds to the first half of the initial PtdIns(3)P wave, whereas VPS-34 function is required afterwards, covering the time periods corresponding to the latter part of the initial PtdIns(3)P wave and the entire second wave of PtdIns(3)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g009">Figure 9A–B</xref>). As inactivating either one of the two kinases perturbs the phagosome maturation, we propose that the proper timing of the initial production and the continuous presence of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomes are both crucial for this event.</p>
        <p>The molecular mechanism behind the sequential activation of PIKI-1 and VPS-34 is currently under investigation. PIKI-1::GFP is recruited to extending pseudopods and nascent phagosome, prior to the first appearance of PtdIns(3)P, consistent with the role of PIKI-1 in initiating PtdIns(3)P production on nascent phagosomes. The phagosome association of PIKI-1 relies on DYN-1, the key organizer of phagosome maturation events, further suggesting that PIKI-1 might be recruited by DYN-1, directly or indirectly, to its site of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). This finding places PIKI-1 under the control of the phagosome maturation pathway initiated by the phagocytic receptor CED-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g009">Figure 9C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>. Mammalian dynamin 2 was reported to directly interact with Vps34, and was proposed to recruit Vps34 to phagosomal surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Kinchen2">[13]</xref>.

In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we and others have found that RAB-5 is required for the production of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001245.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001245.s011">Text S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Kinchen2">[13]</xref>. We have also observed that RAB-5 is recruited to the surfaces of nascent phagosomes prior to the time period when VPS-34's activity is needed for PtdIns(3)P production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001245.s007">S7</xref>). These observations indicate that RAB-5 might also participate in recruiting or activating VPS-34 on phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g009">Figure 9C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Vps34 controls multiple membrane trafficking events, some of which, such as endocytosis, are essential for viability (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Backer1">[2]</xref>).

That MTM-1 function is important for the degradation of apoptotic-cell has also been reported independently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Neukomm1">[40]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The <italic>mtm-1(op309)</italic> mutation slows down phagosome maturation in embryos. Likewise, <italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi) results in a dramatic phagosome maturation arrest in adult gonads. These results demonstrate that despite being a negative regulator of PtdIns(3)P, MTM-1 is an essential positive regulator for phagosome maturation. Furthermore, the <italic>piki-1</italic> deletion mutation and <italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi) mutually suppresses the phagosome maturation defects of each other. In addition, <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) partially suppresses the phagosome maturation defects caused by <italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi). On the contrary, <italic>mtm-1</italic>(RNAi)'<italic>s</italic> suppression effect no longer exists in <italic>piki-1</italic>; <italic>vps-34</italic>(RNAi) double mutant backgrounds. Together, these observations demonstrate that MTM-1 directly antagonizes the function of the two PI3Ks on phagosomes by dephosphorylating their product, PtdIns(3)P. The association of MTM-1 with the extending pseudopods and nascent phagosomes correlates, completely and partially, with the PtdIns(3)P-producing activities of PIKI-1 and VPS-34 on phagosomes, respectively, further supporting the model that MTM-1 antagonizes the activities of PIKI-1 and VPS-34 and results in the gap period between the two PtdIns(3)P waves on phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g009">Figure 9A and B</xref>). During the PtdIns(3)P(−) gap period, a low-level activity of MTM-1 might remain on phagosomal surfaces despite that the enrichment of GFP::MTM-1 on phagosomal surfaces is below the detection capacity of our fluorescence microscope.</p>
        <p>We propose that the prompt dephosphorylation of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P might be critical for the timely dissociation of certain initial phagosome maturation factors from phagosomes as well as the subsequent association of certain other, perhaps yet-to-be identified maturation factors that act at later stages of phagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). The dynamic oscillation of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P thus would enable phagosomes to interact with various signaling modules and intracellular organelles in sequence, and promote the step-wise progression of phagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001245-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). It would be of general interest to identify each of the time-sensitive phagosome maturation factors subject to this regulation.</p>
        <p>Recently, MTM-1 was reported to negatively regulate the engulfment of apoptotic cells, one step prior to the degradation of apoptotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Neukomm1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Zou1">[46]</xref>. Zou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Zou1">[46]</xref> proposed that MTM-1 negatively regulates the level of PtdIns(3)P on the plasma membrane produced by VPS-34 and PIKI-1 during engulfment, based on the observations that inactivating <italic>piki-1</italic> and <italic>vps-34</italic> resulted in the accumulation of persistent cell corpses and that the ability of MTM-1 to suppress the engulfment defect of <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>ced-6</italic> mutants relied on the functions of PIKI-1 and VPS-34. Zou et al.'s work identified the antagonizing genetic interaction between MTM-1 and the two PI3Ks during cell-corpse removal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Zou1">[46]</xref>. However, the dynamic PtdIns(3)P appearance pattern and the timing of PIKI-1 and VPS-34 functions do not support a role of PtdIn(3)P in engulfment. In both mammalian cells and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the production of PtdIns(3)P is initiated on nascent phagosomes after the completion of engulfment, and PtdIns(3)P has not been detected on the extending pseudopods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Mangahas1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Yu1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Chua1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Kinchen2">[13]</xref>. In fact, the experimental results reported here revealed that a precisely regulated system, composed of MTM-1, PIKI-1, and VPS-34, promotes the degradation but not the engulfment of apoptotic cells, through an accurate temporal regulation of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Neukomm et al. (2011), who independently identified the function of MTM-1 as a negative regulator of cell-corpse engulfment, proposed that during engulfment, MTM-1 performs its function through dephosphorylating another substrate, PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Robinson1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Neukomm1">[40]</xref>. <italic>C. elegans</italic> MTM-1 might play opposite roles in engulfment and degradation, two consecutive steps of apoptotic-cell removal, by down-regulating different phosphoinositide species.</p>
        <p>This study, together with a few recent reports, have highlighted the physiological importance of the antagonizing activities of PI kinases and phosphatases in the regulation of PtdIns(3)P dynamics on various intracellular membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Velichkova1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001245-Noda1">[51]</xref>. Like the cycling of small GTPases between GDP- and GTP-bound states and the reversible phosphorylation of key protein factors, the reversible phosphorylation of various phophoinositide species on defined membrane domains is likely to be utilized as a common strategy for driving the progression of multi-step biological events.</p>
