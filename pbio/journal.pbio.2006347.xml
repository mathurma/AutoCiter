<p>Transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) regulates cellular responses to environmental cues. Many stimuli induce NF-κB transiently, making time-dependent transcriptional outputs a fundamental feature of NF-κB activation. Here we show that NF-κB target genes have distinct kinetic patterns in activated B lymphoma cells. By combining RELA binding, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment, and perturbation of NF-κB activation, we demonstrate that kinetic differences amongst early- and late-activated RELA target genes can be understood based on chromatin configuration prior to cell activation and RELA-dependent priming, respectively. We also identified genes that were repressed by RELA activation and others that responded to RELA-activated transcription factors. Cumulatively, our studies define an NF-κB-responsive inducible gene cascade in activated B cells.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) family of transcription factors regulates cellular responses to a wide variety of environmental cues. These could be extracellular stimuli that activate cell surface receptors, such as pathogens, or intracellular stress signals such as DNA damage or oxidative stress. In response to these triggers, NF-κB proteins accumulate in the cell nucleus, bind to specific DNA sequences in the genome, and thereby modulate gene transcription. Because of the diversity of signals that activate NF-κB and the ubiquity of this pathway in most cell types, cellular outcomes via NF-κB activation must be finely tuned to respond to the initiating stimulus. One mechanism by which NF-κB-dependent gene expression is regulated is by varying the duration of nuclear NF-κB; some signals lead to persistent nuclear NF-κB, while others lead to transient nuclear NF-κB. Consequently, time dependency of transcriptional responses is a unique signature of the initiating stimulus. Here we probed mechanisms that generate kinetic patterns of NF-κB-dependent gene expression in B lymphoma cells responding to a transient NF-κB-activating stimulus. By genetically manipulating NF-κB induction, we identified direct targets of RELA, a member of the NF-κB family, and provide evidence that kinetic patterns are established by a combination of factors that include the chromatin state of genes prior to cell activation and cofactors that work with RELA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The family of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factors regulates inducible gene transcription in response to diverse stimuli. Signals from receptors ultimately activate inhibitor of NF-κB kinases (IKKs) that phosphorylate a variety NFKB inhibitors (IκBs), targeting them for degradation and leading to accumulation of NF-κB family members in the nucleus. The “classical” pathway, via IKK2 activation, results in nuclear translocation of RelA- or Rel-containing NF-κB proteins, whereas the nonclassical pathway, via IKK1 activation, results in nuclear accumulation of RelB-containing NF-κB proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref002">2</xref>]. Some signals only activate IKK1 (such as B cell activating factor [BAFF]/BAFF receptor [BAFF-R]), others only activate IKK2 (such as tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα] and interleukin 1 beta [IL-1β]), and yet others activate both IKK1 and IKK2 (such as CD40/CD40L interaction). The cellular response to NF-κB activation therefore depends on the nature of the stimulus and the associated pattern of NF-κB proteins that are driven to the nucleus. Despite identification of a handful of well-accepted NF-κB target genes (such as <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, <italic>TNFAIP3</italic>, and <italic>MYC</italic>), genome-wide transcriptional responses mediated by NF-κB remain poorly defined.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. First, the time course of NF-κB induction varies greatly depending on stimulus. For example, classical NF-κB activation by TNFα or IL-1β is rapid and transient, whereas activation via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is slower and more sustained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref003">3</xref>]. Second, NF-κB proteins consist of several family members. Nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1), RELA, and REL proteins respond primarily by the classical pathway, whereas nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2 (NFKB2) and RELB respond to nonclassical activation. Thus, a comprehensive analysis must include gene targets of each family member. This inherent complexity is compounded by observations that some genes that encode Rel family members, such as <italic>NFKB1</italic>, <italic>NFKB2</italic>, and <italic>RELB</italic>, are themselves targets of NF-κB. Third, NF-κB responses vary depending on the cell type as well as the initiating stimulus. Cell type specificity of NF-κB targets in monocytes/macrophages has been proposed to be conferred by regulated access of induced NF-κB to a subset of genomic sites by tissue-specific transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref006">6</xref>]. Stimulus specificity has been explored largely in the context of TLR signaling and attributed to differences in dynamic patterns of NF-κB induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref009">9</xref>]. Yet, connections between NF-κB dynamics and transcriptional output are not well understood.</p>
<p>For genes to be classified as NF-κB targets, they must change in expression as a consequence of NF-κB binding in cells that have received 1 or more NF-κB-inducing stimuli. This requires integrating at least 3 variables: transcriptional outcomes, NF-κB binding, and the consequences of abolishing NF-κB binding. The first 2 criteria have been explored by microarray or RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to assay transcription factor binding genome-wide. For NF-κB, the majority of ChIP-Seq studies used TNFα as the NF-κB-inducing stimulus in HeLa cells or endothelial cells, with stimulus times ranging from 1 to 6 h. In response to TNFα, RELA bound to approximately 1,200–12,500 sites genome-wide in different studies, with the majority of binding occurring at sites other than gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref019">19</xref>]. One of the earliest RELA ChIP-Seq studies also noted that the factor bound at many genes whose expression was unaffected by TNFα treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref020">20</xref>]. Sites of RELA binding were enriched not only for the κB motif (GGGRNYYYCC) but also for recognition sites of other transcription factors, especially activator protein 1 (AP1). The latter observation corroborated previously reported interactions between NF-κB and AP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref022">22</xref>]. Additionally, E2F and forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) transcription factor motifs have been identified within RELA binding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref023">23</xref>]. The RelA response has also been characterized in murine macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 1–3 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref025">25</xref>]. A substantial proportion of sites to which RelA was recruited in these cells were found to have prebound PU.1, a macrophage-enriched transcription factor. In addition, recognition motifs of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and AP1 were enriched at RelA-bound sites in macrophages. Such differences have been proposed to underlie selectivity of NF-κB responses.</p>
<p>The third criterion, that of establishing that transcriptional outcome is a consequence of NF-κB binding, remains largely underexplored. The most precise way to causally connect binding events to gene expression requires mutating these sites in genomic DNA followed by transcriptional analyses. This is virtually impossible to do on a genome-wide scale. A more feasible, yet meaningful, alternative is to monitor transcriptional consequences of depleting the transcription factor, such as the use of RelA-deficient macrophages to validate the role of RelA in the LPS response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref024">24</xref>]. Additionally, most studies do not account for the impact of dynamic patterns of RELA induction on inducible gene transcription. For this, both NF-κB binding and RNA levels must be interrogated at multiple time points in response to a stimulus. This is especially true for stimuli that activate NF-κB transiently.</p>
<p>Here we probed transcriptional responses to a transient NF-κB-inducing stimulus by combining data from kinetic analyses of RELA binding, RNA polymerase recruitment, transcriptional output, and perturbation of classical NF-κB activation. Using BJAB B lymphoma cells, we demonstrate that NF-κB/RELA is transiently recruited to nearly 3,000 sites genome-wide in response to pharmacological mimics of B cell antigen receptor activation. From these sites, we identified several hundred genes that were direct transcriptional targets of NF-κB. Most of these genes were not found in databases of putative NF-κB target genes. Though the majority of functional NF-κB target genes were up-regulated by RELA, we also identified genes whose expression was suppressed by RELA binding. RELA target genes displayed different transcriptional kinetics, and most recruited RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in response to cell activation. In querying the basis for kinetic differences, we found that late-activated NF-κB target genes required extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activity, whereas rapidly induced NF-κB target genes were marked by Pol II–containing loops in unactivated cells. Despite relatively short activation times used in our experiments, we also identified many “indirect” targets of NF-κB. These genes appeared to be regulated by NF-κB-induced transcription factors and thereby represented downstream effects of NF-κB activation. Consequently, transcriptional responses of such genes were delayed compared to direct NF-κB target genes. Taken together, our studies define the first steps of an NF-κB-responsive inducible gene cascade in activated B cells and highlight mechanisms by which kinetic patterns of NF-κB-dependent gene induction are established.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The availability of well-curated lists of NF-κB responsive genes and their time-dependent expression in response to activating stimuli is an essential prerequisite to elucidate transcriptional consequences of NF-κB activation. Because functional characterization of NF-κB responses in lymphocytes is especially scarce, we initiated studies to understand the kinetics of NF-κB-dependent inducible gene transcription in B lymphoid cells activated via the pharmacological equivalent of B cell antigen receptor signaling.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Inducible transcriptional response in B lymphoid cells</title>
<p>NF-κB inducibility in BJAB human B lymphoma cells closely paralleled that seen in primary B cells activated via the B cell receptor (BCR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref026">26</xref>]. Hallmarks of this response were rapid nuclear translocation of RELA followed by exit from the nucleus within 4–6 h after stimulation. Over a 4 h time course of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (P+I) treatment, approximately 1,000 genes were up-regulated and 1,000 genes were down-regulated more than 2-fold in BJAB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We used <italic>k</italic>-means clustering based on correlation as the distance metric to partition up- and down-regulated genes into 6 distinguishable patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of RNA expression profiles also revealed categories similar to those determined by <italic>k</italic>-means analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). Additionally, Gene Ontology (GO) analyses revealed distinct biological functions of genes in each category of up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). Expression of the largest subset of genes increased over the 4 h time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, patterns 1A, 3A, and 4A). Smaller subsets of genes were rapidly up-regulated at 1 h and then either leveled off at 4 h or were subsequently down-regulated at 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, patterns 2A, 5A, and 6A). Analogously, most genes that were down-regulated by P+I decreased continuously from 0 to 4 h. Examples from these categories are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1C</xref>. Amongst these diverse patterns of altered expression, our goal was to identify genes that were responding directly to NF-κB activation.</p>

<title>Inducible transcription and RELA binding in activated B lymphoma cells.</title>
<p>BJAB human B lymphoma cells were treated with P+I for 1 or 4 h, followed by analyses of inducible transcription and RELA binding by RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq, respectively. (A) Gene expression changes at either 1 or 4 h post activation compared to unactivated cells. Two biological replicate experiments were carried out, and differential gene expression was analyzed using EBSeq. (B) Inducibly up- or down-regulated transcripts were partitioned into 6 patterns (middle panel, top, or bottom, respectively) by <italic>k</italic>-means clustering (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s001">S1B–S1E Fig</xref>). Each graph represents the gene expression pattern at 0, 1, and 4 h. Numbers of genes in each pattern are indicated below in black. The letter “A” after a pattern number indicates genes that are activated by P+I, and the letter “R” indicates genes that are repressed by P+I. Red numbers identify putative RELA target genes according to criteria discussed in the text and summarized in parts D and E below. (C) Representative examples of RNA-Seq profile of genes corresponding to patterns 1A and 5A of up-regulated genes (right panel, top, and middle) and from pattern 1R of down-regulated genes (right panel, bottom). The <italic>y</italic> axis represents normalized reads per million. Chromosomal locations of genes in hg19 are shown above RNA-Seq tracks. (D) Two replicate RELA ChIP-Seq experiments were carried out as described in the Methods section. Peaks were called using MACS2 with input DNA as control at FDR ≤ 0.05. Peaks with peak score ≥ 100 that were common to both biological replicates were used for further analysis. ChIP-Seq experiments were annotated with respect to genomic location using HOMER. Total numbers of RELA peaks are noted above the bars, and activation times are indicated below. (E) Relationship of inducible transcription and RELA binding. Genes were categorized based on the level of inducible activation (top 2 rows) or repression (bottom 2 rows). Genes in each category (second column) that bound RELA (third column) were assigned based on criteria noted in the text. The majority of RELA binding was induced upon cell activation (fourth column). Newly identified RELA-bound up- and down-regulated genes are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s007">S1 Table</xref>.

<title>NF-κB-dependent transcriptional responses</title>
<p>To identify genes that bound inducible NF-κB, we carried out ChIP-Seq using anti-RelA antibodies with unactivated cells or cells activated with P+I for 1 or 4 h. We focused only on those ChIP-Seq peaks that exceeded a threshold peak score of 100 (after peak annotation in HOMER) and were replicated in 2 independent ChIP-Seq experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). We reasoned that these stringent criteria would increase focus on robust RELA interactions genome-wide, despite decreasing the total numbers of peaks being studied. We identified 345 RELA binding sites prior to cell activation. The number of RELA-bound sites increased to nearly 3,000 after 1 h of activation and thereafter fell back to approximately 600 sites at 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), demonstrating that genome-bound RELA closely paralleled total nuclear RELA levels. Sequences related to the κB motif (recognition site of NF-κB) were enriched at sites of RELA binding in all conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s001">S1G Fig</xref>). Most inducible RELA binding at 1 h occurred in parts of the genome annotated as introns and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), a tendency that was noted in previous studies. We identified approximately 500 gene promoters that were newly targeted by RELA in activated cells.</p>
<p>As a first step towards identifying functional targets of RELA, we used HOMER to associate RELA peaks with genes. Peaks that were located outside annotated gene promoters and introns usually fell within 50 kb of the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of assigned genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref020">20</xref>]. Applying these criteria to the approximately 1,000 genes whose RNA levels increased ≥2-fold with activation, we found inducible RELA bound to 354 genes; conversely, RELA was associated with 201 (out of 900) genes whose expression decreased ≥2-fold upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). The majority of RELA-binding up-regulated genes increased in expression between 1 and 4 h of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, indicated in red). Conversely, expression of most RELA-binding down-regulated genes also decreased between 1 and 4 h, the period during which nuclear RELA levels were falling. Within the group of RELA-binding up-regulated genes were recognizable NF-κB target genes (such as <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, <italic>TNFAIP3</italic>, and <italic>RELB)</italic>, as well as others that had not been previously associated with NF-κB (such as <italic>RILPL2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>The 354 up-regulated and 201 down-regulated genes (such as <italic>CYTH4</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) with inducible RELA binding constituted a working list of putative NF-κB target genes in activated B cells. Only 106 out of 354 up-regulated genes and 36 of 201 down-regulated RELA-binding genes identified in our analysis were present in a list of 1,992 putative NF-κB-responsive genes compiled from the “NF-κB Target Genes” list maintained by Thomas Gilmore’s lab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/</ext-link>), NF-κB target gene sets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/8327926/the-nfkb-target-gene-sets-are-listed-below-broad-institute" xlink:type="simple">https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/8327926/the-nfkb-target-gene-sets-are-listed-below-broad-institute</ext-link>), and other recent publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref027">27</xref>].

<p>To directly identify functional targets of inducible RELA (that is, genes whose transcriptional changes depended on RELA binding), we attenuated classical NF-κB activation by expressing a degradation-resistant, mutated dominant negative IκBα (dnIκBα) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref029">29</xref>]. This form of IκBα is expected to quench the release of NF-κB proteins from all cytosolic IκBs via the posttranslational pathway. For this, we generated 2 clones of BJAB cells in which dnIκBα could be induced by tetracycline (Tet) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In these clones, nuclear RELA induction in response to P+I was similar to that of control BJAB cells in the absence of Tet but was abolished in cells that had been pretreated with Tet for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). To determine the effects of dnIκBα expression on inducible gene expression, each clone was either pretreated with Tet for 24 h (to induce dnIκBα) or not, followed by activation with P+I for 0, 1, or 4 h. Replicate experiments were carried out with each clone, and total RNA was prepared for RNA-Seq. Basal gene expression was not affected substantially in the presence or absence of Tet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). We compared inducible gene expression in each clone in the presence or absence of Tet and focused only on those inducible genes whose response to dnIκBα was replicated in both clones.</p>

<title>Attenuation of classical NF-κB-dependent transcription by dnIκBα expression.</title>
<p>Two clones of BJAB cells were generated to perturb canonical NF-κB signaling by Tet-inducible dnIκBα expression. (A) Western blot analysis of parent BJAB cells and 1 clone treated with Tet for the indicated times (h); whole-cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to NC membranes, which were probed with anti-IκBα or anti-β-actin (loading control) antibodies. (B) RELA induction in dnIκBα-expressing BJAB cells. Clone 1 cells were activated with P+I for 1 or 4 h either in the absence of Tet (-Tet) or after Tet pretreatment for 24 h (+Tet). Nuclear extracts were fractionated with SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with anti-RELA or anti-hnRNP antibodies (loading control). Results with 1 representative clone are shown. (C) Relationship of dnIκBα-responsive transcripts to RELA binding. Total RNA isolated from each BJAB clone activated in the presence or absence of Tet was subject to RNA-Seq (2 biological replicates from each clone). Genes that were differentially expressed in each clone because of dnIκBα expression were identified based on FDR ≤ 0.05 in EBSeq. Inducible activation of 806 genes was reduced by dnIκBα expression in both clones; of these, 304 bound RELA (middle panel, green), and 502 (middle panel, gray) did not bind RELA. Time-dependent expression patterns of RELA-binding genes in the absence (blue lines) or presence (green lines) of Tet-induced dnIκBα were determined by <italic>k</italic>-means clustering (right). The letters “Ad” after the pattern number indicate direct target genes that were activated by RELA, and the letters “Ai” indicate indirect target genes that were RELA dependent. Numbers of genes in each category are shown in black below the graphs. Numbers in red identify genes that were changed more than 2-fold in the absence of Tet. Time-dependent expression patterns of genes that were down-regulated by IκBα but did not bind RELA are shown to the left. Numbers and color coding are as described above. (D) Representative RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq tracks for RELA target genes identified in C (green). Two previously known NF-κB target genes (<italic>TNFAIP3</italic> and <italic>STAT5</italic>) with different expression kinetics are shown on the top line, and 2 newly identified RELA target genes (<italic>HERPUD1</italic> and <italic>NR1D1</italic>) are shown on the bottom line.

<p>We identified 806 genes whose inducible expression was significantly reduced (false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.05) by dnIκBα at either 1 or 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, middle) in both Tet-inducible clones. Of these, 304 genes inducibly bound RELA in our ChIP-Seq experiments and were therefore considered to be direct transcriptional targets of RELA. These genes varied in their kinetic responses to cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, right and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s002">S2C Fig</xref>) and were enriched for NF-κB binding motifs at sites of RELA binding as well as in their promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). We found that NF-κB target genes with different kinetic expression patterns enriched for different biological functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). GO analyses showed that transiently activated genes (pattern 3Ad) were associated with processes such as “negative regulation of cellular processes,” “leukocyte activation,” and “inflammatory response.” By contrast, processes that scored high among genes whose expression continued to increase between 1 and 4 h activation (patterns 2Ad and 4Ad) included “ribosome biogenesis,” “immune response,” regulation of “Type 1 interferon production,” and “cellular response to cytokines.” These observations indicate that kinetic patterns were associated with distinct functional categories of NF-κB target genes. Additionally, de novo motif analysis in HOMER revealed distinct transcription factor motifs associated with RELA peaks in different kinetic patterns. RELA peaks in patterns 2Ad and 4Ad genes were enriched for the κB motif as well as the motif for transcription factor AP1, whereas the latter motif was not evident in RELA peaks of pattern 3Ad genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). This list of 304 NF-κB target genes included many that had not been previously identified as being NF-κB responsive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s008">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Features of the NF-κB response</title>
<p>To probe the NF-κB response, we focused on 130 of the 304 direct target genes that were induced more than 2-fold in the absence of Tet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s008">S2 Table</xref>). Out of these 130 genes, 74 have not been previously categorized as NF-κB targets. We found that virtually all transiently induced genes were amongst these 130 most robustly induced, RELA-binding, and dnIκBα-sensitive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, right, red numbers). This category included genes such as <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> and <italic>HERPUD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, left). The prevalence of genes with this expression profile was consistent with reports showing that many NF-κB target genes have short-lived mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref030">30</xref>]. For the majority of these genes, RELA binding occurred close to TSSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). Second, most (95 out of 130) of these genes were contained in the set of 354 putative target genes identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The remaining 259 (out of 354) genes that were not substantially affected by dnIκBα, despite robust inducible RELA binding and altered gene transcription, reaffirmed the idea that inducible RELA binding and inducible transcription are insufficient criteria to identify functional targets of NF-κB. Third, mRNA levels of many genes continued to increase within the time frame of our studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, right, patterns 2Ad and 4Ad). These included genes such as <italic>STAT5A</italic> and <italic>NR1D1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, right). We found that RELA was recruited to these genes at 1 h, but most of it was lost by 4 h. These observations indicated that continued increase in mRNA was RELA-independent, suggesting that RELA was required to initiate but not maintain transcription of these genes.</p>
<p>To further explore the basis for continued transcription of NF-κB target genes after chromatin-bound RELA was depleted, we drew upon the observation that the AP1 motif was enriched in RELA peaks associated with genes whose expression levels continued to increase between 1 and 4 h (patterns 2Ad and 4Ad, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). We tested the possible involvement of this transcription factor family by pharmacologically inhibiting ERK, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) required for activation of AP1-like factors. RNA isolated from BJAB cells treated with P+I in the presence or absence of the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 was assayed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for expression of genes from patterns 2Ad and 4Ad. We found that inducible expression of 3 genes from these categories was suppressed by ERK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, top line). To rule out that PD0325901 affected NF-κB activation by some unanticipated pathway, we also assayed genes whose expression kinetics coincided with RELA induction by P+I (pattern 3Ad in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These genes were not substantially affected by PD0325901 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, lower line). We conclude that ERK-dependent transcription factors confer continued transcriptional activity to a subset of NF-κB target genes after induced nuclear RELA levels dissipate. The kinetically delayed response of these genes is consistent with a “priming” role for RELA, followed by an activator role for AP1-like factors. Such priming may involve recruitment or stabilization of additional transcription factors or coactivators by transiently bound RELA.</p>

<title>Secondary effects of NF-κB activation</title>
<p>RELA did not bind the remaining 502 genes whose expression was reduced by dnIκBα in both clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, middle, gray). Transcriptional responses of these genes in the presence or absence of dnIκBα also clustered into patterns similar to those seen for direct target genes, including 2 in which gene expression was inducibly down-regulated upon cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2C</xref> left, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). A pattern that was prominently missing in this gene set compared to direct RELA targets was one in which RNA levels increased transiently in response to activation. To understand the basis for these genes being affected by dnIκBα in the absence of RELA binding, we looked for shared transcription regulatory features in this set. HOMER analysis of promoter regions of these genes revealed an enrichment for the binding motif of transcription factor MYC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). The MYC motif was found in the promoters of 247 of these 502 genes, including <italic>BRIXI</italic>, <italic>DDX18</italic>, and <italic>AKAP1</italic>, and the majority of these genes (226 out of 247) were previously shown to bind MYC in ChIP-Seq assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref031">31</xref>]. Because <italic>MYC</italic> is a known target of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s003">S3C Fig</xref>), we hypothesized that this set of genes was induced by NF-κB-activated transcription factors. Among 304 direct RELA target genes, we found 37 that encoded DNA-binding transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s003">S3D Fig</xref>, left). These included genes for <italic>KLF10</italic> and <italic>IRF1</italic> that were previously linked to NF-κB. We also found many other genes encoding factors such as <italic>HES1</italic> and <italic>ZNF267</italic> that had not been previously associated with NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We confirmed dnIκBα-sensitive RELA recruitment to promoters of these genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). Thus, many transcription factor genes were induced in activated cells via NF-κB. To further substantiate the hypothesis that NF-κB-induced transcription factors contributed to dnIκBα-sensitive gene expression, we evaluated whether promoters of indirect NF-κB target genes contained recognition motifs for NF-κB-regulated transcription factors.</p>
<p>For the promoter analysis, we focused on 78 (out of 502) genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s009">S3 Table</xref>) that were dnIκBα-sensitive, did not bind RELA, and were changed more than 2-fold by P+I treatment in the absence of Tet. We searched for transcription factor motifs that were present in more than 20% of these promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s003">S3F Fig</xref>). This analysis revealed recognition sites for kruppel-like factor (KLF), zinc finger protein (ZNF), and ETS-domain transcription factors. The correspondence between transcription factor genes induced by NF-κB and motifs enriched in promoters of indirect NF-κB target genes supports the notion that the set of dnIκBα-sensitive genes that did not bind RELA were targets of transcription factors activated by NF-κB. However, in the present study, we did not directly evaluate binding of such NF-κB-induced transcription factors genome-wide. We will refer to such genes as indirect targets of RELA. In keeping with their proposed dependence on NF-κB-induced transcription factors, RNA levels of such indirect targets increased at later times compared to direct targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>GO analyses of the dominant patterns (2Ai and 4Ai) of indirect NF-κB target genes showed that they were enriched for genes involved in RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, and RNA-associated metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s003">S3G Fig</xref>). These processes were largely distinct from those associated with direct NF-κB target genes, thereby identifying a hierarchy of biological consequences associated with NF-κB activation. Because MYC has been implicated in activating ribosomal genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref032">32</xref>], we surmise that many of the identified processes are the consequence of NF-κB-directed MYC expression in activated BJAB cells. Taken together, our kinetic analyses identified gene targets at which inducible RELA binding activated transcription (direct targets) and, additionally, revealed secondary transcriptional consequences of NF-κB activation in B lymphoblastoid cells via NF-κB-induced transcription factors (indirect targets). We also uncovered a mechanism by which RELA induced persistent transcriptional activity despite its transient nuclear induction.</p>

<title>Transcripts up-regulated by dnIκBα</title>
<p>We identified 263 gene transcripts that were up-regulated by dnIκBα expression in both Tet-inducible BJAB clones. Eighty-five of these genes bound RELA in activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, green circle); our interpretation is that RELA binding reduced expression of this subset of genes. Such RELA-repressed genes had diverse expression profiles, including genes that were up- or down-regulated in response to activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">Fig 4A</xref> right, patterns 6Rd and 1Rd, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4A Fig</xref> left). Some examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">Fig 4B</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4B Fig</xref> for complete RNA time courses). Of the 53 (out of 85) RELA-repressed genes whose expression changed more than 2-fold in response to activation in the absence of Tet, 36 were not found in NF-κB-related databases and thus represent novel targets of NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s010">S4 Table</xref>). In contrast to RELA-activated genes that contained canonical κB motifs within RELA peaks, sequence motifs underlying RELA peaks of RELA-repressed genes were enriched for AP1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Additionally, RELA binding was scattered throughout these genes rather than being enriched in promoter regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). Our interpretation is that RELA was recruited to these regions primarily by association with DNA-bound AP1 factors rather than direct DNA binding by RELA itself. Such interactions may attenuate transcriptional activation by AP1, thereby resulting in gene repression.</p>

<p>In total, 178 genes up-regulated by dnIκBα expression did not bind RELA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). We surmised that up-regulation of these genes by dnIκBα was also a secondary consequence of NF-κB activation. That is, such genes were either activated by transcription factors that were up-regulated by dnIκBα expression or attenuated by factors that were direct or indirect RELA targets. We found examples of each category in our RNA-Seq database. Among the 85 RELA-repressed genes, we found 23 that encoded transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s003">S3D Fig</xref>) whose increased expression in the presence of dnIκBa could be responsible for activating a subset of up-regulated genes that did not bind RELA. To further identify factors that indirectly activated gene transcription by dnIκBa, we screened promoter motifs present in 57 (out of 178) genes whose expression changed more than 2-fold in the absence of Tet. Most of these overlapped with motifs present in genes that were indirectly activated by NF-κB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s011">S5 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4E and S4F Fig</xref>). However, a few motifs were selectively associated with dnIκBα-activated genes, such as those for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and SRY-box (SOX) factors, and those for nuclear hormone receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4F Fig</xref>). As shown above, <italic>STAT5</italic> is a direct target of NF-κB in these cells and may negatively regulate a subset of these indirect RELA-repressed genes. We also found <italic>SOX8</italic> and <italic>PPARG</italic> mRNAs to be up-regulated by P+I in dnIκBα-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4G Fig</xref>); however, the associated mechanism(s) have not been further addressed in this study. We conclude that NF-κB activation also initiates a cascade of transcriptional down-regulation, both by directly interacting with a subset of genes and by modulating expression of other transcription factors.</p>
<p>GO analysis of RELA-repressed genes revealed some interesting features. As noted for RELA-activated genes, there was relatively little overlap between the 6 patterns for the top 10 biological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4H Fig</xref>). Among genes that were directly repressed by RELA, we found 1 pattern (6Rd) to enrich for genes involved in transcription termination by Pol II. One interpretation is that NF-κB proteins elevate gene expression by both activating transcription initiation and inhibiting transcription termination. The latter mechanism may apply to genes for which NF-κB has been proposed to push prebound RNA polymerase from abortive initiation state to productive elongation mode. Other pathways that featured in this gene set included modulation of biosynthetic and metabolic processes and negative regulation of cellular processes. Prominent among genes that were indirectly repressed by RELA were those involved in autophagosome organization and assembly and posttranslational protein modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s004">S4I Fig</xref>). By up-regulating essential autophagy genes such as ATG5 and 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref033">33</xref>] and suppressing others involved in autophagosome assembly, NF-κB may fine-tune the autophagic response. The emerging patterns reveal synergistic use of RELA-dependent activation and suppression of gene expression to optimize cellular responses.</p>

<title>RELA recruitment to nonfunctional sites</title>
<p>The preceding analysis started by identifying genes whose inducible expression changed significantly in the presence of dnIκBα. While focusing on functional targets of RELA, this approach did not fully utilize our time-dependent RNA analyses. In particular, we missed out on the broader genomic landscape of NF-κB recruitment in response to B cell activation, especially where RELA binding did not affect mRNA levels after dnIκBα induction. Such sites were of potential interest because they vastly outnumbered those where RELA binding had functional consequences and may therefore contribute to B cell biology in unanticipated ways. We did this in 2 steps. First, we identified genes whose expression did not change in both dnIκBα-inducible clones across all time points of activation with or without Tet. Approximately 600 out of 8,000 such genes inducibly bound RELA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). These binding sites were associated with canonical κB and AP1 motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s005">S5B and S5C Fig</xref>). Second, we used <italic>k</italic>-means clustering with correlation parameter to visualize gene expression patterns of the remaining genes in each clone in the absence or presence of dnIκBα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). Patterns with similar expression characteristics in both clones were combined into 4 patterns of inducible gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s005">S5E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Patterns I and II corresponded to genes whose expression decreased or increased, respectively, in response to dnIκBα expression. Analysis of these gene sets largely recapitulated the conclusions from Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">4</xref>. Patterns III and IV provided insights into patterns of inducible expression that were not identified in the preceding analysis. These groups contained genes that were either up- (Pattern III) or down-regulated (Pattern IV) with activation but whose expression was not affected by dnIκBα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s005">S5E and S5F Fig</xref>). Numerous genes in each set bound RELA (green circles), and NF-κB and AP1 binding sites were again enriched in sequences underlying RELA peaks (middle column). These observations reinforced the idea from Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">2</xref> that inducible binding coupled with transcriptional changes was an insufficient criterion to identify functional targets of transcription factors. Differential regulation of these gene sets was also evident from their promoter architecture. Binding motifs for ETS-domain proteins and the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) were enriched in gene promoters that were up-regulated with activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s005">S5E Fig</xref>, right column), whereas the motif for IRFs was enriched weakly amongst genes that were down-regulated with activation.</p>

<title>Preformed loops at RELA-dependent genes</title>
<p>Rapid gene induction in response to cell stimulation is programmed in different ways. In the classic example of <italic>c-Fos</italic> induction, phosphorylation of a promoter-bound transcription factor in unactivated cells triggers RNA synthesis after cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref035">35</xref>]. In other instances, RNA polymerases bound at promoters in unactivated cells can be pushed into elongation mode by phosphorylation of their C-terminal domain in response to stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref037">37</xref>]. This mode of activation has been implicated at some NF-κB-dependent target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref040">40</xref>]. To gain more insight into inducible gene expression by RELA, we carried out ChIP-Seq with antibodies directed against Pol II. We used a threshold peak score of ≥100 in HOMER and reproducibility in replicate experiments to assign Pol II occupancy with confidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Using these criteria, we found that 50 out of 130 direct NF-κB target genes contained prebound Pol II at their promoters prior to activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s006">S6B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s012">S6A Table</xref>). However, these genes recruited additional Pol II after cell activation, which was evident in the average profile across all direct target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>). Proportionally fewer indirect target genes (13 out of 78 genes) had prebound Pol II prior to P+I treatment, and inducible Pol II recruitment was clearly evident at these promoters in response to activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s006">S6E Fig</xref>). We conclude that Pol II recruitment is a major mechanism of inducible gene transcription by NF-κB.</p>
<p>Presence or absence of Pol II at the basal state did not readily explain kinetic differences in patterns of NF-κB target gene induction. To further probe for a possible mechanism, we performed chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) in cells prior to stimulation. This assay scores for interaction of Pol II–bound sequences with other parts of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref042">42</xref>].

Over the entire dataset, genes that lacked Pol II had the lowest RNA levels at baseline, genes with Pol II–bound promoters with no loops had intermediate RNA levels, and genes whose Pol II–bound promoters engaged in looping interactions had the highest levels of RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s006">S6F Fig</xref>). Similar trends were observed in previous ChIA-PET studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref042">42</xref>]. Additionally, we confirmed several looping interactions that had been identified in earlier studies, indicating that our assay scored for functionally relevant Pol II–associated interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s006">S6G Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>We then examined chromatin interactions in the context of NF-κB target genes. Approximately half of the 130 robustly induced (≥2-fold) direct RELA target genes had Pol II loops in unactivated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s012">S6B Table</xref>). On average, RELA target genes with preformed loops reached close to maximum levels of inducible expression rapidly compared to those without loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, middle), and most of the transiently induced target genes identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2</xref> (22 out of 30) fell in this category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, right, pattern 3Ad). Conversely, RELA target genes that did not have preformed loops were enriched for genes that were induced more slowly and whose expression increased continuously over the time course of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, right, 34 out of 54 genes in pattern 2Ad and 23 out of 43 genes in pattern 4Ad). One example of a prelooped RELA target gene is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5D</xref> (left).</p>
<p>For indirect target genes, the trends were reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Approximately 30% of genes in this category (24 out of 78 robustly induced genes) had preformed Pol II loops (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s012">S6B Table</xref>). Looped genes in this set had higher basal RNA levels but did not show kinetic differences in RNA induction compared to nonlooped genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, middle). Instead, indirect target genes that had preformed loops in unactivated cells achieved higher levels of induced RNA compared to genes with no loops. Many indirect target genes with preexisting loops tended to be induced early in the presence of dnIκBα but crashed thereafter (18 prelooped genes in patterns 3Ai, 4Ai in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, right). One example of a prelooped indirect RELA target gene is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5D</xref> (right). We propose that preformed loops regulate kinetic patterns of direct RELA target genes, whereas they determine the maximal RNA output for indirect target genes.</p>
<p>While RELA target genes were typically involved in single promoter interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, pattern III), we also found approximately 1,000 genes that were involved in multiple promoter interactions (ChIA-PET category 4). These genes yielded GO terms such as “purine triphosphate metabolic process,” “pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic process,” and other comparable metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s006">S6H Fig</xref>). Amongst these, we found interactions involving <italic>PPP4C</italic>, <italic>ALDOA</italic>, and histone genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s006">S6I Fig</xref>). It is likely that linking gene promoters via Pol II interactions provides a mechanism to coregulate genes that are involved in a common biological pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref042">42</xref>]. In contrast, the need for greater flexibility in output of RELA-responsive genes depending on the stimulus and cell type may preclude their connection in a preformed network.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By combining time-dependent transcriptional responses with genome-wide recruitment of RELA and Pol II and perturbation of classical NF-κB activation, we sought to identify mechanisms by which kinetic patterns of NF-κB-dependent gene expression are established. In these studies, a pharmacologic equivalent of antigen receptor signaling was used to activate human B lymphoblastoid BJAB cells over a time course during which nuclear NF-κB was transiently induced. Three interesting features emerged from a consideration of RELA target genes. First, close to 60% of the 130 most robustly induced target genes identified here had not been previously connected with NF-κB responses. Our list also contained well-established NF-κB targets such as <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>TNFAIP3</italic>, and <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, attesting to the validity of our analyses. The incompleteness of current lists of NF-κB target genes was further accentuated when we included the additional 174 targets identified here that were induced less robustly. Of these 174 genes, 80% were not present in NF-κB-related databases, while the remaining 20% included genes such as <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>TNIP1</italic>, and <italic>TAP1</italic> that were previously linked to NF-κB. We surmise that NF-κB target genes identified here that are also present in earlier lists may represent more “universal” targets that respond regardless of cell type or stimulus. In contrast, genes uniquely identified in our study may represent cell type–or stimulus-specific responses. While use of a lymphoma cell line for these studies makes it difficult to draw direct connections to transcriptional responses of primary human B cells, the hundreds of new functionally curated NF-κB target genes identified here constitute a unique pool of possible mediators of NF-κB activity in B lymphoid cells.</p>
<p>We also identified many genes that we refer to as indirect NF-κB targets. Such genes were sensitive to dnIκBa expression but did not bind RELA. We hypothesize that such genes were activated (or repressed) by NF-κB-induced transcriptional regulators. Even within the relatively short time course of our kinetic studies, we identified 37 genes among the 304 direct targets that encoded transcriptional regulators. In addition to previously identified targets such as <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>IRF1</italic>, this list included many new NF-κB-regulated factors such as hes family bHLH transcription factor 1 (HES1) and ZNF267. Additional studies are needed to directly evaluate the contribution of such factors in regulating indirect target gene transcription. It is possible that a subset of genes that we classified as indirect RELA targets are controlled by RELA bound to sites that did not score in the program used to connect binding sites to genes.</p>
<p>From the studies presented here, we cannot specify the subunit composition of RELA-containing homo- or heterodimers that activate transcription of the identified NF-κB target genes. Because most of the RELA genome binding occurred at 1 h after cell activation, our working hypothesis is that functional NF-κB measured in these assays was generated from cytosolic pools by the classical posttranslational pathway. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, this form consists largely of p50/RELA heterodimers; however, sequential ChIP is required to verify this model. Additionally, the contribution of REL to dnIκBa-sensitive gene transcription was not experimentally evaluated by depleting REL in BJAB cells. Studies to address this question are in progress using <italic>Rel</italic>-deficient murine B cells.</p>
<p>Second, 2 dominant kinetic patterns of inducible expression emerged for the 130 genes that were most strongly induced. A small number (30 out of 130) were transiently induced and included genes such as <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> and <italic>NFKBIA</italic>. The expression pattern of such genes can be easily explained by transcriptional activation when bulk RELA is nuclear (at 1 h), followed by transcriptional inactivation when RELA moves back into the cytoplasm (at 4 h), together with rapid degradation of the encoded mRNAs. The short half-life of many of these transcripts has been previously highlighted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref030">30</xref>]. More surprising was the observation that inducible expression of the majority of these genes (97 out of 130) continued to increase between 1 and 4 h of activation. This time period coincided with down-regulation of RELA from the nucleus, and indeed, we found that RELA was lost from gene promoters over this period. For a subset of genes that we tested, ERK activity was required for sustained RNA synthesis after loss of nuclear RELA, pointing to involvement of the AP1 family of transcription factors. Our working hypothesis is that RELA binding “primes” the promoter for subsequent binding and transcriptional activation by ERK-dependent transcription factors. However, continued RELA binding is not required for transcriptional activity, thus distinguishing this mode of gene regulation from synergistic promoter activity by cobound factors.</p>
<p>Our observations also provide a novel perspective on the phenomenon of assisted loading, a term used to describe cooperative recruitment of transcription factors that co-occupy gene regulatory sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref044">44</xref>]. Regarding NF-κB/RelA, it has previously been shown that binding of IRF5 or STAT3 to a subset of genomic sites in activated hepatocytes or macrophages, respectively, requires simultaneous RELA activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref045">45</xref>]. In the examples presented here, we show instead that RELA does a hit-and-run on gene promoters that have a characteristic kinetic transcription profile. Although RELA is lost from these promoters, our experiments do not distinguish whether the κB site remains empty or is occupied by other factors. For example, p50 homodimers associated with IκBξ, which have been previously proposed to confer transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref046">46</xref>], may substitute RELA-containing complexes at such sites. Alternatively, other proteins that recognize κB motifs may provide transcriptional activity in the absence of RELA. Nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) proteins are a distinct possibility because they are induced in P+I-activated B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref047">47</xref>], have been shown to bind to κB elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref048">48</xref>], and function in collaboration with AP1 factors.</p>
<p>Earlier studies have analyzed the connection between AP1/ERK and kinetics of gene induction by NF-κB. Natoli and colleagues showed that a subset of inflammatory gene promoters recruited RELA in response to LPS only after being marked by serine phosphorylated histone H3 (H3S10P) via p38 MAPK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref049">49</xref>]. The 2-step process delayed RELA recruitment and transcriptional induction of these genes compared to other inflammatory genes to which RELA bound without requiring H3S10P. By contrast, RELA recruitment was not delayed even at late-induced genes in the studies described here, thereby invoking a novel mode of intersection between NF-κB and MAPK pathways. We note several differences that may underlie mechanistic variations observed for NF-κB-inducible transcription in the 2 studies. These include the different cell types used (dendritic cells versus B cells) that could differentially mark RELA recruitment sites, different initiating stimuli (LPS versus P+I) that induce distinct cytosolic signaling milieus, and the nature of NF-κB activation (sustained versus transient) that could influence gene expression outcomes. Further studies are needed to understand rules by which NF-κB tunes cellular responses to diverse stimuli.</p>
<p>In a more recent study, Brasier and colleagues identified AP1 and SP1 motifs in regions surrounding RELA peaks in TNFα-induced A549 (human pulmonary epithelial) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref014">14</xref>]. Genes with SP1 motifs reached maximal inducible expression 30 min after activation, whereas those with AP1 motifs reached maximal levels 60 min after activation. Two interesting features emerged from a comparison of our data with those of Yang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref014">14</xref>]. First, de novo motif analysis did not reveal SP1 sites near RELA peaks of our most rapidly induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2</xref>, pattern 3Ad). Thus, rapid gene induction by NF-κB comes in different flavors. One possibility is that SP1 and NF-κB cooperate at promoters where inducibility via NF-κB is coupled with relatively high basal-level expression via SP1. Second, in TNFα-treated A549 cells, RELA levels at a prototypical NF-κB/AP1 promoter continued to rise even when RNA levels were falling. By contrast, we found that at ERK-sensitive genes in activated BJAB cells, RELA levels fell, while RNA levels continued to rise. These distinctions yet again emphasize the variety of ways in which kinetic patterns of NF-κB-dependent transcription are achieved.</p>
<p>Third, half of the strongly induced direct target genes had preformed Pol II–containing loops in unactivated cells. Genes that contained such loops were induced more rapidly on average than genes without loops and reached close to maximal expression levels at 1 h post activation. In contrast, RNA levels of unlooped genes continued to increase in the interval between 1 and 4 h. We propose that kinetic patterns of NF-κB-dependent transcription are determined in part by a poised state reflected in such preformed loops. Interestingly, most of the transiently induced targets (22 out of 30) fell in the looped category, likely reflecting the need for these genes to reach maximum expression as soon as possible while RELA is still in the nucleus. These genes were also more evolutionarily conserved than prelooped genes that were induced more slowly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006347.s006">S6K Fig</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref050">50</xref>]. However, several transiently induced genes (such as <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> and <italic>NFKBIA</italic>) did not have looped configurations in unactivated cells. One possibility is that these genes have “simple” NF-κB-dependent promoters that do not require interactions with distal regulatory sequences to modulate expression levels. Hao and Baltimore recently demonstrated that genes that are rapidly transcriptionally induced undergo rapid splicing to produce cytoplasmic mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref030">30</xref>]. Such mRNAs are also relatively unstable, resulting in transient gene induction. Five out of 7 genes that were shared between our dataset of transiently induced NF-κB target genes and that of Hao and Baltimore were found to have looped configurations in unactivated BJAB cells. Thus, a prelooped configuration may also assist in increasing splicing efficiency of rapidly induced genes. We note the caveat that the transformed state of BJAB cells may affect the distribution of genes with preformed loops.</p>
<p>We also identified many genes whose inducible expression increased in the presence of dnIκBα. A subset of these genes bound RELA in our ChIP-Seq analyses, suggesting that RELA binding attenuated transcription of these genes. Identification of AP1 motif as the prominent sequence at sites of RELA binding leads us to hypothesize that RELA is recruited by protein–protein interactions with transcription factors bound at these sites rather than by DNA binding. In doing so, RELA may reduce transcription activation function of the DNA-bound factor. Interestingly, genes encoding several AP1 motif-binding factors, such as <italic>FOS</italic>, <italic>FOSB</italic>, <italic>MEF2B</italic>, and <italic>MEF2C</italic>, were in this set of RELA-repressed genes, possibly indicating some form of regulatory feedback. Dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), a regulator of ERK activity, was also in this list, again suggesting cross talk between NF-κB and AP1 signaling cascades. At other genes, DNA-bound RELA might interfere with the progression of RNA polymerases, thereby reducing transcriptional output. Though the mechanism and functional importance of RELA-dependent down-regulation of gene expression remain largely speculative at this time, our studies highlight a mode of gene regulation by this transcription factor that has been largely overlooked.</p>

<p>BJAB cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone), Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine (Invitrogen), and 2-mercaptoethanol. For activation, cells were exposed to 50 ng/ml PMA and 2 μM ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 and 4 h. To inhibit ERK signaling, cells were pretreated with 0.33 nM PD0325901 (Selleckchem) for 1 h before P+I stimulation. To generate dnIκBα-inducible clones, BJAB cells were transfected with pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen) to express Tet repressor (TetR), and stable clones were selected in 15 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) for 6 d. Stable single clones with the highest levels of TetR expression were subsequently transfected with full-length dnIκBα (S32A and S36A) cloned into pcDNA4/TO. Stable clones were selected in the presence of both blasticidin and 600 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) for 6 d. dnIκBα expression was induced with 1 μg/ml Tet (Invitrogen) for 24 h before P+I treatment. All cell lines were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2.</p>

Reactions were quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M, and cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Nuclei were isolated and lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1% Triton X-100; 0.1% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS; and protease inhibitors. The crosslinked chromatin was subjected to fragmentation by sonication (Branson Sonicator). ChIP was performed with 2.5 μg anti-RelA antibody (Santa Cruz) and 2 μg anti-Pol II antibody (Covance) prebound to 50 μl Protein A or G Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Sonicated chromatin was added to antibody-bound beads and incubated at 4°C overnight.

We used R package TFBSTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref062">62</xref>] to identify conserved NF-κB binding sites between human and the other species. Four NF-κB family motifs (i.e., NFKB1: MA0105.2, NFKB2: MA0778.1, REL: MA0101.1, and RELA: MA0107.1) obtained from JASPAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref063">63</xref>] were used for the analysis. In accordance with Iwanaszko and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref050">50</xref>], the threshold of the motif mapping score was set to 80%, and the conservation cutoff was set to 40%, based on a window size of 51 bp. To obtain the percentage of conserved NF-κB binding sites for each gene, the total number of NF-κB motif sites in the human genome was obtained based on the 4 NF-κB family motifs. The number of conserved NF-κB motif sites was calculated by comparing human and every other species, respectively. The percentage of conserved NF-κB binding sites is calculated as the ratio between the conserved NF-κB motif sites and the total number of NF-κB motif sites for each gene.</p>

<p>(A) Nuclear extracts from BJAB cells treated with P+I for the indicated times (h) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membrane was probed with anti-RELA or anti-hnRNP (loading control) antibodies. Proteins were detected by HRP-coupled antibody. A representative western blot of 3 experiments is shown.

<title>Gene expression in dnIκBα-expressing BJAB clones and identification of RELA target genes.</title>
<p>Two clones of BJAB cells were generated in which dnIκBα could be induced by Tet treatment. (A) Basal gene expression (in the absence of P+I treatment) in each clone, in the absence or presence of Tet (-Tet or +Tet), was compared to basal gene expression in untransfected BJAB cells using EBSeq with an FDR threshold ≤ 0.05. Numbers of genes in each pattern are shown in the table. The largest numbers of genes were expressed comparably in all these cell lines (pattern 1) or unchanged in the presence or absence of Tet in each clone (pattern 4). We identified approximately 2,700 genes that were changed at baseline in both dnIκBα-inducible clones compared to parental BJAB cells (overlap between pattern 4 genes in clone 1 and 2 with FDR ≤ 0.05 compared to parental BJAB cells). (B) Differentially expressed genes that were common to both clones were further compared to parental BJAB cells after filtering (FDR ≤ 0.05) by fold change. Graphs show down- or up-regulated genes, respectively, sorted by fold change. The majority of differentially expressed genes were changed less than 2-fold.

The letters “Ad” after a pattern number indicate direct target genes that were activated by RELA binding. Each column is the averaged expression from 2 biological replicates. (D) Motif analysis of the promoter region (−400 to +100 bp) of the 304 direct RELA target genes (left) or under the RELA peaks (right) was carried out using HOMER.

The most prominent patterns consisted of genes that were continuously up-regulated with activation (patterns 2Ad and 4Ad) or those that were transiently up-regulated with activation (pattern 3Ad). De novo motif analysis of sequences with RELA peaks was carried out using HOMER for each of these patterns as indicated. Pattern 3Ad revealed only one motif that was identified as not “possibly false positive.” The letters “Ad” after a pattern number indicate direct target genes that were activated by RELA binding.

<title>Promoter motif analysis of indirect RELA target genes.</title>
<p>Genes whose induction was reduced by dnIκBα expression but which did not bind RELA were considered to be indirect targets of RELA (see text).

<title>Characterization of RELA binding and motif analysis of genes whose RNA levels were increased by dnIκBα expression.</title>
<p>Such genes were considered to be repressed by inducible NF-κB in BJAB cells. Analogous to the discussion of inducibly activated genes, repressed genes that bound RELA were likely to be affected directly by RELA, whereas those that did not were considered to be indirectly affected (see text). (A) Heatmap representation of 85 direct RELA-repressed target genes (left) and 178 indirect RELA-repressed target genes (right) identified by combining results of RNA-seq analysis in the presence or absence of dnIκBα with RELA ChIP-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Gene expression patterns were identified using <italic>k</italic>-means clustering. Each column shows the level of expression in the absence of dnIκBα (3 lanes labeled -Tet) or the presence of dnIκBα (3 lanes labeled +Tet). The activation time course is indicated. Numbers to the left of the <italic>k</italic>-means heatmap correspond to patterns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. The letters “Rd” after a pattern number indicate target genes that were repressed by RELA binding, and the letters “Ri” after a pattern number indicate target genes that were repressed by RELA indirectly. Each column is the averaged expression from 2 biological replicate experiments. (B) RNA tracks showing complete time courses for RELA-repressed target genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">Fig 4B</xref>. (C) Motif analysis of DNA sequences under RELA peaks and promoter regions (−400 to +100 bp) of genes whose expression was increased by dnIκBα (FDR ≤ 0.05). AP1 and NF-κB motifs were prominent under RELA peaks; no significantly enriched motifs were identified in the promoters of these genes. (D) ngs.plot demonstrating the distribution of RELA binding near up-regulated target genes (130, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and down-regulated target genes (53, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) whose inducible expression was changed ≥2-fold in the absence of Tet. Most RELA peaks were located at promoter regions of up-regulated target genes, while RELA peaks were distributed throughout the gene of down-regulated target genes. (E) Amongst genes whose inducible expression was increased by dnIκBα expression but did not bind RELA (genes indirectly down-regulated by NF-κB activation), 58 genes were identified whose inducible activity changed ≥2-fold (FDR ≤ 0.05). Promoter regions (−400 to +100 bp) of these genes were scanned for transcription factor binding motifs using HOMER. The table shows motifs that were present in more than 12 (out of 58) promoters. (F) Comparison of promoter motifs in genes that were indirectly up- (78) or down- (57) regulated by RELA. A total of 77 transcription factor motifs were found in ≥20% of indirectly up-regulated genes (blue circle), and 95 motifs were found in ≥20% of indirectly down-regulated genes (pink circle). The majority of the motifs were common to both gene subsets, presumably reflecting context-specific use of the same factors to up- or down-regulate gene expression (left). Motifs unique to genes that are (indirectly) activated by RELA are shown in the middle table, and those unique to genes that are (indirectly) repressed by RELA are shown in the table on the right. Four out of the 5 unique motifs associated with up-regulated genes correspond to the recognition site of bHLH proteins (CANNTG). Several different transcription factor motifs are associated with down-regulated genes (right table).

<title>Alternative analyses of the NF-κB transcriptome.</title>
<p>(A) RNA-Seq data from 2 biological replicates in each Tet-inducible clone were first used to define a set of genes whose expression did not change in response to cell activation and dnIκBα expression in both clones. We identified approximately 8,000 genes whose expression did not change with P+I treatment and dnIκBα expression. Of these, approximately 600 showed inducible RELA binding (green circle). (B) HOMER analysis of sequences underlying RELA peaks of these 600 genes identified authentic κB and AP1 motifs. No motifs were enriched at the promoters of these genes (−400 to +100 bp). (C) Examples of inducible RELA binding to genes that are unaffected by P+I treatment and dnIκBα expression. The top 6 lines show RNA-Seq tracks at different time points of P+I treatment and in the presence (+Tet) or absence (-Tet) of dnIκBα. The bottom 4 lines (including input track) show RELA ChIP-Seq tracks at different activation time points. (D) The remaining genes, whose expression changed in response to activation in both clones, were visualized by <italic>k</italic>-means clustering with correlation parameter in the absence (blue lines) or presence (red lines) of dnIκBα. Patterns were combined based on similar trends to generate 4 groups, which are indicated by colored boxes denoting the following characteristics: I (red boxes) = genes down-regulated by dnIκBα; II (purple boxes) = genes up-regulated by dnIκBα; III (yellow boxes) = genes up-regulated by P+I but unaffected by dnIκBα; and IV (blue boxes) = genes down-regulated by P+I but unaffected by dnIκBα. (E) RELA binding and promoter characteristics of genes in each group. Green circles denote RELA-binding genes identified by ChIP-Seq; gene numbers in each category are indicated. HOMER analysis was used to identify sequence motifs underlying RELA peaks (middle panel) or in the promoters (−400 to +100 bp relative to TSSs) of genes that did not bind RELA (right panel).

<title>Putative RELA target genes based on inducible transcription and RELA binding.</title>
<p>Transcriptional response of BJAB cells to P+I was assessed by RNA-Seq after 1 and 4 h of activation. Differentially expressed genes were identified by EBSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006347.ref055">55</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006347.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). RELA binding over the same time course was assessed by ChIP-Seq. RELA-bound regions with peak score ≥ 100 that were reproduced in biological replicates were used for all analyses. RELA binding was ascribed to a specific gene according to HOMER using the default parameters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/" xlink:type="simple">http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/</ext-link>). For most of these genes, RELA bound at the promoter, within the gene body, or within 50 kb of the transcription start site. RELA-binding genes that were up-regulated ≥2-fold at either 1 or 4 h are shown in A. RELA-binding genes that were down-regulated ≥2-fold at either 1 or 4 h are shown in B.

<p>List of genes whose expression was reduced by dnIκBα but which did not bind RELA. We refer to these genes as “indirect” RELA targets (see text). Genes in the list were changed in expression ≥2-fold in response to P+I treatment in the absence of tetracycline. Genes marked in red contain the bHLH protein binding motif (CANNTG) in their promoters (−400 to +100 bp).
