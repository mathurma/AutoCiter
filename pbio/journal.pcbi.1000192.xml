                <p>Over the last few years, experimental data on the fluctuations in gene activity
                    between individual cells and within the same cell over time have confirmed that
                    gene expression is a “noisy” process. This variation is in
                    part due to the small number of molecules taking part in some of the key
                    reactions that are involved in gene expression. One of the consequences of this
                    is that protein production often occurs in bursts, each due to a single promoter
                    or transcription factor binding event. Recently, the distribution of the number
                    of proteins produced in such bursts has been experimentally measured, offering a
                    unique opportunity to study the relative importance of different sources of
                    noise in gene expression. Here, we provide a derivation of the theoretical
                    probability distribution of these bursts for a wide variety of different models
                    of gene expression. We show that there is a good fit between our theoretical
                    distribution and that obtained from two different published experimental
                    datasets. We then prove that, irrespective of the details of the model, the
                    burst size distribution is always geometric and hence determined by a single
                    parameter. Many different combinations of the biochemical rates for the
                    constituent reactions of both transcription and translation will therefore lead
                    to the same experimentally observed burst size distribution. It is thus
                    impossible to identify different sources of fluctuations purely from protein
                    burst size data or to use such data to estimate all of the model parameters. We
                    explore methods of inferring these values when additional types of experimental
                    data are available.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Recent experimental data showing fluctuations in gene activity between individual
                    cells and within the same cell over time confirm that gene expression is a
                    “noisy” process. This variation is partly due to the small
                    number of molecules involved in gene expression. One consequence is that protein
                    production often occurs in bursts, each due to the binding of a single
                    transcription factor. Recently, the distribution of the number of proteins
                    produced in such bursts has been experimentally measured, offering a unique
                    opportunity to study the relative importance of different sources of noise in
                    gene expression. We derive the theoretical probability distribution of these
                    bursts for a wide variety of gene expression models. We show a good fit between
                    our theoretical distribution and experimental data and prove that, irrespective
                    of the model details, the burst size distribution always has the same shape,
                    determined by a single parameter. As different combinations of the reaction
                    rates lead to the same observed distribution, it is impossible to estimate all
                    kinetic parameters from protein burst size data. When additional data, such as
                    protein equilibrium distributions, are available, these can be used to infer
                    additional parameters. We present one approach to this, demonstrating its
                    application to published data.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The regulation of gene activity is essential for the proper functioning of cells,
                which employ a variety of molecular mechanisms to control gene expression. Despite
                this, there is considerable variation in the precise number and timing of protein
                molecules that are produced for a given gene under any particular set of
                circumstances. This is because gene expression is fundamentally a
                “noisy” process, subject to a number of sources of randomness.
                Some of these are <italic>intrinsic</italic> to the biochemical reactions that
                comprise the transcription and translation of a particular gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Elowitz1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Raser1">[2]</xref>. Several
                of the reactions involve very small numbers of molecules. There are only one or two
                copies of the DNA for the gene, and in its vicinity inside the cell there are likely
                to be only a few copies of the relevant transcription factors and of RNA polymerase.
                Similarly, for each mRNA molecule, the processes of ribosome binding and of mRNA
                degradation are typically highly stochastic.</p>
            <p>Recent advances in experimental technology have shown that such single molecule
                effects can lead to protein production occurring in bursts of varying size, each due
                to a single transcription factor binding event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-McAdams1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Thattai1">[4]</xref>. Other sources of
                variability are <italic>extrinsic</italic> to the specific reactions, and include
                fluctuations in relevant metabolites, polymerases, ribosomes, etc. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Elowitz1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Raser1">[2]</xref>. These
                will not be considered further here.</p>
            <p>It is of considerable interest to determine the various contributions of such
                different sources of variability. Within the last few years, experimental techniques
                for addressing this question have increasingly become available. Elowitz et al.
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Elowitz1">[1]</xref>
                observed fluctuations in the expression level of genes tagged both with cyan and
                yellow fluorescent proteins in monoclonal <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells
                under identical environmental conditions. Similar work was carried out by Raser and
                O'Shea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Raser2">[5]</xref> in the eukaryote <italic>Saccharomyces
                cerevisiae</italic>. Such dual-reporter experiments are able to distinguish between
                intrinsic and extrinsic sources of stochasticity. More recently, single molecule
                data has become available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Yu1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Cai1">[7]</xref>, which monitors the expression of a gene a single
                protein at a time and provides the distribution of the sizes of bursts. It had been
                hoped that data of this kind would answer many of the remaining questions about the
                origin of noise in gene expression and in particular distinguish between the
                different contributions of transcription and translation to intrinsic noise.</p>
            <p>Intuitively, one might expect that randomness due to transcription would play the
                more significant role than translation, since typically there will be more than one
                mRNA molecule, and the fluctuations due to translation from each of these might to
                some extent average out. To test this hypothesis and to put it on a quantitative
                basis, it is necessary to employ mathematical models of gene expression. These also
                provide a valuable tool for the analysis of experimental data, and in particular of
                the burst size distributions reported in the literature, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Yu1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Cai1">[7]</xref>.</p>
            <p>A great deal of work has gone into modelling gene expression in both prokaryotic and
                eukaryotic systems, with some of the earliest papers predicting fluctuations in mRNA
                and protein levels published 30 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Rigney1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Berg1">[9]</xref>. McAdams and Arkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-McAdams1">[3]</xref>
                provided the first model of bursting at the translation level. They showed that the
                number of protein molecules produced by a single mRNA transcript is described well
                by a model which considers whether the next event is the production of a further
                protein, or the degradation of the mRNA molecule. Such competitive binding between
                ribosomes and RNase results in a geometric distribution for the protein number. Such
                an analysis can also be applied to transcription following the binding of a
                transcription factor to a gene and also results in a geometric distribution. The
                joint analysis of these two stochastic processes forms the basis of the present
                paper.</p>
            <p>The integration of simple stochastic (Markov) models of transcription factor, RNA
                polymerase, ribosome and RNase binding leads to what is now widely regarded as the
                standard model of gene expression for prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Thattai1">[4]</xref>. The analysis of this
                model using a master equation allows the determination of the moments of the
                distribution of the number of protein molecules when the system is in steady state.
                Further analysis of this equilibrium distribution was carried out by Paulsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Paulsson1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Paulsson3">[12]</xref> who used the master
                equation and the fluctuation–dissipation theorem to obtain predictions
                about the mean and variances of molecule numbers and lifetimes and the contribution
                made by transcriptional and translational bursting. Other studies have been carried
                out by Höfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Hfer1">[13]</xref> who used a rapid-equilibrium approximation to
                compare mRNA levels for genes with one and two active alleles, and by Friedman et
                al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Friedman1">[14]</xref>. The drawback of these approaches is that the master
                equation that describes the temporal evolution of the probability distribution of
                protein (and mRNA) numbers is too complex to be solved analytically. Furthermore,
                the burst size distribution necessary for comparison with recent experimental data
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Yu1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Cai1">[7]</xref> cannot be
                obtained directly from the master equation. Such difficulties with master equation
                based approaches are exacerbated in the case of more complex models of gene
                expression such as multi-step models that include intermediate stages such as the
                formation of DNA–RNA polymerase complexes, phosphorylation events, and
                mRNA–ribosome binding. Both deterministic and stochastic simulation
                studies of these models have been performed, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Hfer2">[15]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Hayot1">[16]</xref>, but none of these
                approaches have been useful for the analysis of burst size data.</p>
            <p>In the present work we avoid the problems associated with the master equation
                approach, which are at least in part due to the explicit incorporation of time
                evolution. Instead, we ignore time and directly derive an expression for the burst
                size distribution by extending the analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-McAdams1">[3]</xref>. In many ways this
                approach is similar to that used for the analysis of multi-stage queues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Bailey1">[17]</xref>. The
                distribution of the number of mRNA molecules produced in a single burst is geometric
                and the distribution of the number of protein molecules produced by a single mRNA is
                also geometric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-McAdams1">[3]</xref>. The overall burst size distribution is therefore
                given by the compound distribution of two geometric distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Bailey1">[17]</xref>. This
                can be readily computed using generating functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Bailey1">[17]</xref> and is itself
                    <italic>not</italic> geometric. However, experimentally it is not possible to
                detect bursts that produce no protein molecules at all, and therefore the published
                data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Yu1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Cai1">[7]</xref> are in fact
                the relevant conditional distributions, assuming at least one protein molecule is
                produced in a burst. Surprisingly, it turns out that when we condition the compound
                distribution in this way, we again obtain a geometric distribution. This is
                determined by a single parameter, which we can derive in terms of physically
                meaningful constants such as binding and unbinding rates. This shows that different
                combinations of noise levels in the translation and transcription parts of the
                process can give the same overall burst size distribution. Mathematically, this
                means that the standard model of gene expression (described in detail below) is
                    <italic>nonidentifiable</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Timmer1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Sontag1">[19]</xref> from
                burst size data alone. This in turn implies that it is not possible to identify the
                relative contributions of translation and transcription to the burst size
                distribution of protein numbers only using this data.</p>
            <p>We also show that our approach is applicable to a variety of more detailed models
                that incorporate additional steps to provide more realistic descriptions of
                expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Hayot1">[16]</xref>. These still yield a single parameter geometric
                conditional distribution. This shows that within the context of a very large class
                of models, experimental burst size data on its own cannot identify the relative
                contributions of different reactions to the overall noise level. However, by
                simulating the equilibrium distribution of protein numbers for different parameter
                combinations giving the same burst size distribution we demonstrate that a
                combination of burst size distribution and equilibrium distribution can discern
                different sources of noise. The difficulty with such an approach is that the
                determination of the equilibrium distribution requires the knowledge of two
                additional kinetic parameters: the transcription factor binding rate and the protein
                degradation rate. Estimates of these are not easy to obtain independently, so that
                we now have to estimate six unknown parameters from the combined burst size and
                equilibrium distribution data. Initial simulations (not shown here) suggested that
                it is difficult to do this reliably.</p>
            <p>It is possible however, by using independent estimates of one of the parameters to
                reduce the parameter space from six to five dimensions. Using the relationship
                between the remaining parameters determined from the burst size distribution allows
                the elimination of a further parameter, leaving four kinetic parameters to be
                estimated from the equilibrium distribution. We show below that by using the
                Nelder-Mead algorithm to maximize the empirical likelihood, useful estimates of the
                four remaining parameters can be obtained. We carry out this process twice, first
                using independent measurements of the mRNA degradation rate and then of the protein
                half-life. In the first case we obtain unrealistically short estimates of the
                protein half-life, and in the second a considerably faster mRNA degradation. This
                suggests that when in the repressed state, mRNA may be degraded at a faster rate
                than when the gene is active.</p>
            <p>In principle, this method can be applied to any gene where burst size and equilibrium
                distributions are available, providing a new approach to the estimation of
                parameters estimates for the ever more sophisticated models increasingly being used
                in computational biology.</p>

                <p>In the so called “standard model” of gene expression, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000192-g001">Figure 1</xref>, an inactive gene can
                    be activated by a promoter or transcription factor. This allows molecules of RNA
                    polymerase to bind and produce mRNA. This in turn can bind to ribosomes leading
                    to the production of protein molecules. Eventually the transcription factor
                    unbinds, terminating the production of mRNA, and each mRNA molecule is degraded,
                    which stops protein production.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>Each of these processes is modelled as a transition in a continuous time Markov
                    chain with a particular rate. Such a rate is interpreted as the probability of
                    an event occurring in a unit time interval. Thus, if we denote the rate of
                    transcription factor binding by <italic>α</italic><sub>0</sub> then the
                    probability of this occurring in an interval of length
                    <italic>δt</italic>, assuming that the transcription factor is not bound

                        <italic>α</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>δt</italic>.
                    Integrating over time, this means that the probability of the event having

                        1/<italic>α</italic><sub>0</sub>. The same holds for the other
                    transitions in the model, with the rate of transcription factor unbinding
                    denoted by <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>. Whilst the transcription
                    factor is bound, RNA polymerase binds at a rate
                    <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>, and each such binding event is assumed
                    to produce one molecule of mRNA. More detailed models that allow the polymerase
                    to unbind before it has produced mRNA are considered later and will have no
                    effect on our overall conclusions.</p>
                <p>Each mRNA molecule binds to a ribosome at rate
                    <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub> and is degraded at rate
                        <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub>. When the last mRNA has decayed no
                    more protein will be produced. We define the number of proteins produced between
                    the transcription factor binding and the last mRNA decaying as a
                    “burst”. Note that since a burst begins once the
                    transcription factor has bound, we expect the distribution of burst sizes to be
                    independent of the transcription factor binding rate
                        <italic>α</italic><sub>0</sub>. This is confirmed by the rigorous
                    derivation below.</p>
                <p>Mathematically, the Standard Model of Gene Expression is a continuous time Markov
                    chain model. Each particular combination of number of mRNA molecules, number of
                    protein molecules and state of binding of the transcription factor constitutes a
                    single state of the model. It is possible to derive an (infinite) set of coupled
                    ordinary differential equations (called the Kolmogorov forward equations or
                    master equation) that govern the probability at any given time of the system
                    being in any given state. However, the analysis of a such a complex set of
                    equations is difficult. On the other hand, using the same approach as for
                    multi-stage queues, it is relatively easy to derive the distribution of protein
                    burst sizes.</p>

                    between the successive binding and unbinding of the transcription factor. In

                    This is easily computed using probability generating functions (see below), and
                    is not a geometric distribution. However, it is of relatively little interest
                    since it includes the possibility that the transcription factor unbinds before
                    any proteins have been produced (either because no mRNA is produced, or because
                    this mRNA is degraded before binding to a ribosome). Such events cannot be
                    observed in the experimental protocol used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Yu1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Cai1">[7]</xref>, and hence

                    <italic>P</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) to give the probability distribution

                    of protein numbers conditional on at least one protein being produced. An
                    approximate calculation of this distribution was given in the supplementary
                    material of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Cai1">[7]</xref>. This replaced the discrete geometric distribution

                    distribution of the same mean and then used the Laplace transform to obtain the
                    (continuous approximation to the) compound distribution. Here we present an
                    exact derivation for the discrete distribution using generating functions (which
                    are closely related to the Laplace transform). Furthermore we relate the

                <p>It might be hoped that such nonidentifiability is a particular pathology of the
                    Standard Model. We thus next consider a number of generalisations of this model,
                    which provide a more detailed description of the process of gene expression. We
                    find that for a wide range of generalisations we can still derive the burst size
                    distribution in a similar manner the above. It turns out to be geometric in each
                    case and hence all such models are also nonidentifiable.</p>
                <p>One common extension is to include an additional step in the model of the
                    transcription process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Hfer1">[13]</xref>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000192-g002">Figure 2</xref>. This accounts for the fact that
                    after the transcription factor has bound, one still requires the RNA polymerase
                    to bind to the transcription initiation complex, and this may not always happen
                    successfully. A similar modification could be made to the translation loop to
                    describe the binding of the mRNA transcript to the ribosome in more detail. Both
                    of these additions can be considered individually, or in combination.</p>

                    complex combinations of the individual rates. We illustrate this for the
                    transcription loop, where we find that in order to produce exactly
                    <italic>m</italic> mRNA molecules, the system can pass through state

                    polymerase unbinds before an mRNA molecule is produced, returning to
                    <italic>G</italic> with rate <italic>δ</italic><sub>1</sub>, and on the
                    remaining <italic>m</italic> occasions an mRNA molecule is produced, with rate

                    steps can be interspersed in any order amongst the <italic>i</italic> visits,

                    A similar derivation holds for the translation loop. We see that carrying out
                    either or both of these modifications still results in a geometric distribution
                    in the form of Equation 4 for <italic>Pˆ</italic>(<italic>n</italic>),

                    As a consequence the overall conditional protein size distribution,
                        <italic>Pˆ</italic>(<italic>n</italic>), will still be given by
                    Equation 4, with the parameter

                    as before.</p>
                <p>An alternative generalisation is to add additional loops with the same structure
                    as the current transcription and translation loops. We prove in the Supporting
                    Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000192.s001">Text S1</xref>) that if we have <italic>k</italic>−1 such loops,
                    the final conditional protein size distribution <italic>Pˆ</italic><italic>
                        <sub>k</sub>
                    </italic>(<italic>n</italic>) will still be geometric.</p>
                <p>We thus conclude that all of these models yield the same geometric protein burst
                    size conditional distribution, determined by a single parameter. In particular,
                    models which include additional steps to account for DNA–RNAP complex
                    formation and mRNA-ribosome complex formation give distributions that are
                    mathematically indistinguishable from those from the Standard Model. It is thus
                    impossible to differentiate between these models using experimentally observed
                    burst size distributions. Similarly we cannot use such data to differentiate
                    between the contributions to noisy gene expression from transcriptional versus
                    translational bursting.</p>

                        <italic>Pˆ</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) best fits the data. This
                    is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000192-g003">Figure 3</xref>,
                    which shows that it is possible to obtain excellent agreement between the
                    theoretical and experimental distributions. The estimated value of
                        <italic>Â</italic><sub>2</sub> for Tsr-Venus is
                        <italic>Â</italic><sub>2</sub> = 3.57,

                    The difference in magnitude between these two estimates may be partially due to
                    the fact that <italic>β</italic>-gal is only active as a tetramer. Thus,
                    each burst of activation measured experimentally (and thus available for

                    fitting the model in this way is it can only provide an estimate of the single

                        for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000192-g004">Figure 4</xref>.
                        The two steady state distributions shown have different choices of
                            <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>,
                        <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub>,

                        <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> that yield the same value for

                        distribution. However, the two steady state distributions are clearly
                        different. This shows that steady state distribution data should allow us to
                        distinguish between different combinations of parameters with the same
                            <italic>Â</italic><sub>2</sub>, and hence potentially identify
                        some or all of these parameters.</p>

                    <p>The main difficulty with such an approach is the lack of analytic expressions
                        for the steady state distribution, making it impossible to derive an
                        explicit formula for the likelihood. Instead one has to compute an estimate
                        of the equilibrium distribution using simulations of the reaction network
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Gillespie1">[20]</xref> and then use these to derive an empirical
                        likelihood by comparing to the experimental data. This can then be maximized
                        in the usual way.</p>
                    <p>We applied this approach to the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Cai1">[7]</xref>, which presents
                        both burst size and steady state distributions for the same experimental
                        system. In order to fully specify the steady state distribution, we need two
                        additional parameters: the rate of transcription factor binding
                            <italic>α</italic><sub>0</sub> and the rate of protein decay
                            <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub>. These do not enter into the
                        expressions for the burst size distribution, and were assumed to be known
                        (and fixed) for the simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000192-g004">Figure 4</xref>. In the absence of independent
                        estimates of these parameters for the <italic>β</italic>-gal system,
                        we explored the possibility of estimating these from the data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Cai1">[7]</xref>
                        directly by computing an empirical likelihood using simulation of the model
                        (see below). We attempted both to maximize this empirical likelihood
                        directly, and to obtain its distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
                        sampling. Neither of these approaches were successful with the full six
                        parameter model (results not shown).</p>
                    <p>We can however, make use of independent estimates of parameters in the model
                        to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. In effect this
                        constrains the orginal optimization to a lower dimensional sub-space. We
                        applied this approach with two different choices of parameter: the mRNA
                        degradation rate <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> and the protein
                        degradation rate <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub>.</p>

                    <title>Constraining on the mRNA degradation rate</title>
                    <p>We chose first to make use of the wide availability of estimates of the value
                        of <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub>, the rate of mRNA degradation.
                        Since we also have the burst size data, we first estimate
                            <italic>Â</italic><sub>2</sub> and then use Equation 6 to
                        obtain an expression for <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub> in terms of
                            <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>,

                        <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub>. At each point in this space, we
                        simulate the model using the Gillespie algorithm to given an empirical
                        estimate of the probability

                        of observing <italic>n</italic> proteins at equilibrium. This gives the

                    <p>This empirical likelihood function can be maximized using any suitable

                        any particular realization of the function is not smooth, making algoritms

                    <p>One possible explanation of this discrepancy is that the reported mRNA
                        degradation rate
                            <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> = 7.2×10<sup>−3</sup>
                        is always measured in experimental conditions where the gene is active. On
                        the other hand, the burst size and equilibrium distributions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000192-Cai1">[7]</xref> are
                        obtained under conditions where the gene is suppressed. It is possible that
                        the mRNA degradation rates are significantly different in the two cases. To
                        explore this hypothesis, we approached the problem from an alternative
                        direction, fixing the protein degradation rate
                            <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> to correspond to a half-life of 1
                        hour, and estimating the remaining five parameters, including mRNA

                        becoming trapped in a region with physically unrealistic (negative) reaction

                        approximately one third of the previous value, decreasing from 0.0017

                        0.3352 s<sup>−1</sup>. It is intuitively reasonable that such a
                        combination of decreasing transcription and increasing translation leads to
                        the same overall level of protein expression. The parameter

                        approximately 43 seconds) suggests that when expression of the gene is being
                        strongly repressed as in this situation, there may well be active
                        degradation of the mRNA. It would be interesting to experimentally
                        investigate this biologically significant prediction.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>We have shown that it is possible to use results from queuing theory to derive the
                burst size distribution of protein molecules produced by a single transcription
                factor binding event in terms of physically measurable kinetic rate constants for
                both the simplest model of gene expression, the so-called Standard Model, and for a
                number of natural extensions.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we have shown that the mathematical form of these models is
                nonidentifiable, and all such burst size distributions are actually determined by a
                single parameter. This implies that it is impossible to use burst size data alone to
                determine the relative contributions of transcription and translation to the
                variability in gene expression.</p>
            <p>One possible way of overcoming this limitation is to use a combination of burst size
                data and steady-state data. However, this requires estimates of a further two
                parameters (which are not needed when using burst-size data alone). We were unable
                to estimate all six parameters directly from the combined data. However, using
                independent estimates of either the mRNA lifetime or the protein lifetime reduces
                the number of parameters by one, and enables successfully estimation of the
                remaining five parameters by maximizing an empirical likelihood using the
                Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. Although this suffers from the common problem of
                occasional convergence to a local maximum, by using computing repeated estimates it
                was possible to identify and exclude such cases and hence obtain good estimates of
                the desired five kinetic parameters under the different constraints.</p>
