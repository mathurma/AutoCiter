      <p>“<italic>So far, we have been able to study only one evolving system […] If we want to discover generalizations about evolving systems, we will have to look at artificial ones</italic>” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Smith1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In nature, species do not evolve in isolation but in large networks of interacting species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002928-g001">Figure 1</xref>). One of the main goals in evolutionary ecology is to disentangle the evolutionary mechanisms that shape and are shaped by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biological_interaction" xlink:type="simple">patterns of interaction</ext-link> between species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Fussmann1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Schoener1">[5]</xref>. A particularly important question concerns how <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=coevolution" xlink:type="simple">coevolution</ext-link>, the reciprocal evolutionary change in local populations of interacting species driven by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=natural_selection" xlink:type="simple">natural selection</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Thompson2">[6]</xref>, is shaped by the architecture of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=food_web" xlink:type="simple">food webs</ext-link>, plant–animal <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=mutualistic_network" xlink:type="simple">mutualistic networks</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=host-parasite_interaction" xlink:type="simple">hostparasite communities</ext-link>. The concept of diffuse coevolution, where adaptation is in response to a suite of biotic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Janzen1">[7]</xref>, was the first step towards a framework unifying relevant theories in community ecology and coevolution. Understanding how individual interactions within networks influence coevolution, and conversely how coevolution influences the overall structure of networks, requires an appreciation for how pairwise interactions change due to their broader community contexts as well as how this community context shapes selective pressures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Fox1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Thompson3">[9]</xref>. Accordingly, research is now focusing on how reciprocal selection influences and is embedded within the structure of multispecies interactive webs, not only on particular species in isolation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Thompson1">[4]</xref>.</p>

          <p>When <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Darwin" xlink:type="simple">Darwin</ext-link> received an orchid (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angraecum_sesquipedale" xlink:type="simple">Angraecum sesquipedale</ext-link>) from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Madagascar" xlink:type="simple">Madagascar</ext-link> whose <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=nectary" xlink:type="simple">nectary</ext-link> was one and a half feet long, he surmised that there must be a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=pollinator" xlink:type="simple">pollinator</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=moth" xlink:type="simple">moth</ext-link> with a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=proboscis" xlink:type="simple">proboscis</ext-link> long enough to reach the nectar at the end of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spur_(botany)" xlink:type="simple">spur</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Kritsky1">[32]</xref>. In its attempt to get the nectar, the moth would have <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=pollen" xlink:type="simple">pollen</ext-link> rubbed onto its head, and the next orchid visited would then be pollinated.

This was a remarkable example of an evolutionary <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=prediction" xlink:type="simple">prediction</ext-link>. However, because species coevolve within large networks of multispecies ecological interactions, this example of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=pairwise_coevolution" xlink:type="simple">pairwise coevolution</ext-link> is more the exception than the rule.</p>

In spite of the long time scales involved and the substantial effort that is necessary to isolate and quantify samples, the latter approach of testing biological evolution in the lab has been successful over the last two decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Lenski1">[15]</xref>. However, studying the evolution of interspecific interactions, which involves dealing with more complex webs of multiple interacting species, has proven to be a much more difficult challenge. A meta-analysis of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=bacteriophage" xlink:type="simple">hostphage</ext-link> interaction networks, carried out by Weitz and his team <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Flores1">[16]</xref>, found a striking statistical structure to the patterns of infection and resistance across a wide variety of environments and methods from which the hosts and phage were obtained. However, the ecological mechanisms and evolutionary processes responsible have yet to be unraveled.</p>
      <p>Digital ecological networks enable the direct, comprehensive, and real time observation of evolving ecological interactions between antagonistic and/or mutualistic digital organisms that are difficult to study in nature. Research using self-replicating computer programs can help us understand how coevolution shapes the emergence and diversification of coevolving species interaction networks and, in turn, how changes in the overall structure of the web (e.g., through extinction of taxa or the introduction of invasive species) affect the evolution of a given species. Studying the evolution of species interaction networks in these artificial evolving systems also contributes to the development of the field, while overcoming limitations evolutionary biologists may face. For example, laboratory studies have shown that historical contingency can enable or impede the outcome of the interactions between bacteria and phage, depending on the order in which mutations occur: the phage often, but not always, evolves the ability to infect a novel host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Meyer1">[17]</xref>. Therefore, in order to obtain <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=statistical_power" xlink:type="simple">statistical power</ext-link> for predicting such outcomes of the coevolutionary process, experiments require a high level of replication. This <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=stochastic" xlink:type="simple">stochastic</ext-link> nature of the evolutionary process was exemplified by Stephen Jay Gould's inquiry (“What would happen if the tape of the history of life were rewound and replayed?”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Gould1">[18]</xref>. Because of their ease in scalability and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Replication_(statistics)" xlink:type="simple">replication</ext-link>, evolving digital ecological networks open the door to experiments that incorporate this approach of <italic>replaying the tape of life</italic>. Such experiments allow researchers to quantify the role of historical contingency and repeatability in network evolution, enabling predictions about the architecture and dynamics of large networks of interacting species.</p>
      <p>The inclusion of ecological interactions in digital systems enables new research avenues: investigations using self-replicating computer programs complement laboratory efforts by broadening the breadth of viable experiments focused on the emergence and diversification of coevolving interactions in complex communities. This cross-disciplinary research program provides fertile grounds for new collaborations between computer scientists and evolutionary biologists.</p>

        <p>The field of digital life was inspired by the rampant <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=computer_virus" xlink:type="simple">computer viruses</ext-link> of the 1980s. These viruses were self-replicating computer programs that spread from one computer to another, but they did not evolve. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steen_Rasmussen" xlink:type="simple">Steen Rasmussen</ext-link> was the first to include the possibility of mutation in self-replicating computer programs by extending the once-popular <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Core_War" xlink:type="simple">Core War</ext-link> game, where programs competed in a digital battle ground for the computer's resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Rasmussen1">[19]</xref>. Although Rasmussen observed some interesting evolution, mutations in this early <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=genetic_programming" xlink:type="simple">genetic programing</ext-link> language produced many unstable organisms, thus prohibiting scientific experiments. Just one year later, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_S._Ray" xlink:type="simple">Thomas S. Ray</ext-link> developed an alternative system, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tierra_(computer_simulation)" xlink:type="simple">Tierra</ext-link>, and performed the first successful experiments with evolving populations of self-replicating computer programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Ray1">[20]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Thomas S. Ray created a genetic language similar to earlier digital systems, but added several key features that made it more suitable for evolution in his <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Artificial_life" xlink:type="simple">artificial life</ext-link> system, Tierra. Primarily, he prevented instructions from writing beyond the <italic>privately</italic> allocated <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=computer_memory" xlink:type="simple">memory space</ext-link>, thus limiting the potential for organisms writing over others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Ray1">[20]</xref>.

            <p>The circular genome of a digital organism, on the left, consists of a set of instructions (represented here as letters). Some of these instructions are involved in the copy process and others in completing computational tasks. The experimenter determines the probability of mutations. Copy mutations occur when an instruction is copied incorrectly, and is instead replaced by a random instruction in the forming offspring's genome (as can be seen in the offspring, on the right).

          <p>In <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=parasitism" xlink:type="simple">hostparasite interactions</ext-link>, the parasite organisms benefits at the expense of the host organisms. Parasites in Avida are implemented just like other self-replicating digital organisms, but they live inside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=host_(biology)" xlink:type="simple">hosts</ext-link> and execute parasitic <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=thread_(computing)" xlink:type="simple">threads</ext-link> using CPU cycles stolen from their hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Zaman1">[23]</xref>. Because parasites impose a cost (lost CPU cycles) on hosts, there is selection for resistance, and when resistance starts to spread in a population, there is selective pressure for parasites to infect those new resistant hosts. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=infectious_disease" xlink:type="simple">Infection</ext-link> occurs when both the parasite and host perform at least one overlapping task. Thus a host is resistant to a particular parasite if they do not share any tasks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002928-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This mechanism of infection mimics the inverse-gene-for-gene model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Fenton1">[24]</xref>, in which infection only occurs if a host susceptibility gene (the presence of a logic task) is matched by a parasite virulence gene (a parasite performing the same task). Additional infection mechanisms, such as the matching allele and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gene-for-gene_relationship" xlink:type="simple">gene-for-gene</ext-link> models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Agrawal1">[25]</xref>, can also be implemented.</p>
          <p>In traditional infection genetic models, host resistance and pathogen infectivity have associated costs. These costs are an important part of theory about why defense genes do not always fix rapidly within populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Bohannan2">[26]</xref>. Costs are also present in digital host–parasite interactions: performing more or more complex tasks implies larger genomes and hence slower reproduction. Tasks may also allow organisms access to resources present in the abiotic environment, and the environment can be carefully manipulated to control the relative costs or benefits of resistance.</p>
          <p>By keeping track of task-based phenotypes as well as tracking information about successful infections in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=community_(ecology)" xlink:type="simple">community</ext-link>, researchers are able to perfectly reconstruct the interaction networks of digital coevolving hosts and parasites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002928-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The structure of these networks is a result of the interplay between ecological processes, mainly host abundance, and coevolutionary dynamics, which lead to changes in host specificity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Poulin1">[27]</xref></p>

              <p>Starting from a host phenotype (green node) and a parasite phenotype (red node), a complex network of interactions (arrows) between hosts and parasites emerges out of the coevolutionary process. Nodes representing new host and parasite phenotypes appear and disappear over evolutionary time. The abundance of individuals expressing each phenotype changes continuously (indicated by node size) altering interaction patterns, and thus influencing subsequent coevolutionary dynamics. Interactions between a host phenotype and a parasite phenotype are depicted as arrows pointing in opposite directions: the thickness of red arrows indicates the fraction of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=infectious_disease" xlink:type="simple">infections</ext-link> that a particular parasite is responsible for inflicting on the indicated host phenotype, while the thickness of the green arrows indicates the fraction of all of the hosts a particular parasite phenotype infects that is accounted for by the indicated host phenotype. Often asymmetry between the thicknesses of arrow-pairs leads to red arrows dominating the picture. At these times, most parasite phenotypes are infecting only a small fraction of hosts expressing a given phenotype. Instead, the majority of those hosts are being infected by parasites with other phenotypes.

          <title>Mutualistic interactions</title>
          <p>Interactions in which both species obtain mutual benefit, such as those between flowering plants and pollinators, and birds and fleshy fruits, can be implemented in evolving digital experiments by following the same task matching approach used for host–parasite interactions, but using free-living organisms instead of parasitic threads. For example, one way to set up a plant-pollinator type of interaction is to use an environment containing two mutually exclusive resources: one designated for “plant” organisms and one for “pollinator” organisms. Similar to parasites attempting infection, if tasks overlap between a pollinator and a plant it visits, pollination is successful and both organisms obtain extra CPU cycles. Thus, these digital organisms obtain mutual benefit when they perform at least one common task, and more common tasks lead to larger mutual benefits. While this is one specific way to enable mutualistic interactions, many others are possible in Avida. Interactions that begin as parasitic may even evolve to be mutualistic under the right conditions. In most cases, coevolution will result in concurrent interactions between multiple phenotypes. Thus, observed networks of mutualistic interactions can inform our understanding about the outcomes and processes of coevolution in complex communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Guimar1">[28]</xref>.</p>

Predators are digital organisms that have evolved from ancestral prey phenotypes to locate, attack, and consume organisms. When a predator executes an attack instruction (acquired through mutation), it kills a neighboring organism. When predators kill prey, they gain resources required for reproduction (e.g., CPU cycles) proportional to the level accumulated by the consumed prey. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=natural_selection" xlink:type="simple">Selection</ext-link> favors behavioral strategies in prey that enable them to avoid being eaten. At the same time, selection favors predators with behavioral strategies that improve their food finding and prey attacking abilities. The resulting diversity in the continuously evolving behavioral phenotypes creates dynamic predator–prey interaction networks in which selective forces are constantly changing as a consequence of the emergence of new, and loss of old, behaviors. Because predators and prey move around in and use information about their environment, these experiments are typically carried out using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=spatial_ecology" xlink:type="simple">spatially structured populations</ext-link>.

      <p>Understanding how <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=biodiversity" xlink:type="simple">biodiversity</ext-link> is organized in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ecosystem" xlink:type="simple">natural ecosystems</ext-link> requires going beyond the study of pairs of interacting species. Using digital organisms, one can find generalities about the evolutionary and ecological processes shaping the web of interactions among species, as well as the coevolutionary processes embedded within these networks. By tracing the evolution of digital communities and their ecological networks, researchers obtain perfect <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=fossil" xlink:type="simple">fossil records</ext-link> of how the number and patterns of links among interacting phenotypes evolved.</p>
      <p>The stability–diversity debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-McCann1">[29]</xref> is a long-standing debate about whether more diverse ecological networks are also more stable. Until recently, this debate has focused on one component of biodiversity: species diversity. However, newer research has begun dealing with another component of biodiversity: diversity in species interactions. Mathematical models show that a mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics and that the loss of one interaction type may critically destabilize ecosystems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Mougi1">[30]</xref>. Studies with digital organisms can shed light on this debate from an empirical perspective because the types of interactions included can be manipulated and the stability of the resulting evolving digital ecological network can be measured.</p>
      <p>Equally addressable using evolving digital ecological networks are many of the open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities. For example, do <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=coevolution" xlink:type="simple">coevolutionary dynamics</ext-link> change as communities become richer? Is there any limit to their richness? Is the evolution of interactions between multispecies networks <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=contingency_(philosophy)?" xlink:type="simple">historically contingent</ext-link> Why do some ecological scenarios lead to predictable network structures and others do not? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002928-Thbault1">[31]</xref> Do <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=adaptationism" xlink:type="simple">genetic constraints</ext-link> play a large role in the evolution of ecological networks? These are only a few of many open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities.</p>
      <p>These and many related questions require researchers to look across the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=evolutionary_history_of_life" xlink:type="simple">evolutionary history</ext-link> of ecological network formation. For natural systems, those data are very difficult to collect. With digital organisms, watching both the coevolutionary process and ecological network formation is possible in real time. Data on the abundance of interacting phenotypes are recorded without error; hence, the evolutionary implications of ecological processes can be explored in-depth.</p>
      <p>The study of self-replicating and evolving computer programs offers a tantalizing glimpse into the evolution of interactions among organisms that do not share any ancestry with the biochemical life of Earth. This comes with potential caveats in translating predictions of evolving digital networks to biological ones because mechanistic details differ substantially between interacting digital organisms and interacting biological organisms. Nevertheless, these digital networks contain the necessary components for ongoing coevolutionary dynamics in large webs of interacting organisms. In spite of the differences between biological and digital evolution, the study of evolving digital ecological networks can lead to a more predictive understanding of natural dynamics. Because the general operational processes (e.g., Darwinian evolution, mutualism, parasitism, etc.) do not differ, studies utilizing digital networks can uncover rules operating on and within ecological networks. Together with microbial experiments, they create opportunities for furthering the understanding of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes among interacting species.</p>

          <p>Self-replication of a digital organism. The circular genome of a digital organism, on the left, consists of a set of instructions (represented here as letters). Some of these instructions are involved in the copy process and others in completing computational tasks. The experimenter determines the probability of mutations. Copy mutations occur when an instruction is copied incorrectly, and is instead replaced by a random instruction in the forming offspring's genome (as can be seen in the offspring, on the right). Other types of mutations, such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=insertion_(genetics)" xlink:type="simple">insertions</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=deletion_(genetics)" xlink:type="simple">deletions</ext-link>, are also implemented. Initially, all three of the parent's hardware <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=pointer_(computer_programming)" xlink:type="simple">pointers</ext-link> are in the same location, at the instruction represented here by <italic>r</italic>. As execution begins, the instruction pointer (indicated by an <italic>i</italic>) advances. The first few instructions allocate space for the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=offspring" xlink:type="simple">offspring</ext-link>, and then move the write-head pointer (indicated by a <italic>w</italic>) into that space. The flow pointer (indicated by an <italic>f</italic>) is used to move the other pointers to genetically specified locations. The remainder of the process of self replication is carried out by a set of instructions at the end of the genome, commonly referred to as the copy-loop. When execution reaches the copy-loop, the flow pointer is used to keep the flow of execution inside of a loop that advances the read and write heads and copies instructions from the parent genome (read-head) to the offspring genome (write-head). Arcs inside the circular genome represent the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=control_flow" xlink:type="simple">execution flow</ext-link>, showing most of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=instruction_cycle" xlink:type="simple">CPU cycles</ext-link> being used during the copying process. After genome replication is complete, the parent organism divides off its offspring, which must now fend for itself within the Avida world.

          <p>Evolving host–parasite webs. Starting from a host phenotype (green node) and a parasite phenotype (red node), a complex network of interactions (arrows) between hosts and parasites emerges out of the coevolutionary process. Nodes representing new host and parasite phenotypes appear and disappear over evolutionary time. The abundance of individuals expressing each phenotype changes continuously (indicated by node size) altering interaction patterns, and thus influencing subsequent coevolutionary dynamics. Interactions between a host phenotype and a parasite phenotype are depicted as arrows pointing in opposite directions: the thickness of red arrows indicates the fraction of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=infectious_disease" xlink:type="simple">infections</ext-link> that a particular parasite is responsible for inflicting on the indicated host phenotype, while the thickness of the green arrows indicates the fraction of all of the hosts a particular parasite phenotype infects that is accounted for by the indicated host phenotype. Often asymmetry between the thicknesses of arrow-pairs leads to red arrows dominating the picture. At these times, most parasite phenotypes are infecting only a small fraction of hosts expressing a given phenotype. Instead, the majority of those hosts are being infected by parasites with other phenotypes.
