Over 90% of CF patients carry at least one mutant allele with deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 located in the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD1). Biochemical and cell biological studies show that the ΔF508 mutant exhibits inefficient biosynthetic maturation and susceptibility to degradation probably due to misfolding of NBD1 and the resultant misassembly of other domains. However, little is known about the direct effect of the Phe508 deletion on the NBD1 folding, which is essential for rational design strategies of cystic fibrosis treatment. Here we show that the deletion of Phe508 alters the folding dynamics and kinetics of NBD1, thus possibly affecting the assembly of the complete CFTR. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we find that meta-stable intermediate states appearing on wild type and mutant folding pathways are populated differently and that their kinetic accessibilities are distinct. The structural basis of the increased misfolding propensity of the ΔF508 NBD1 mutant is the perturbation of interactions in residue pairs Q493/P574 and F575/F578 found in loop S7-H6. As a proof-of-principle that the S7-H6 loop conformation can modulate the folding kinetics of NBD1, we virtually design rescue mutations in the identified critical interactions to force the S7-H6 loop into the wild type conformation. Two redesigned NBD1-ΔF508 variants exhibited significantly higher folding probabilities than the original NBD1-ΔF508, thereby partially rescuing folding ability of the NBD1-ΔF508 mutant. We propose that these observed defects in folding kinetics of mutant NBD1 may also be modulated by structures separate from the 508 site. The identified structural determinants of increased misfolding propensity of NBD1-ΔF508 are essential information in correcting this pathogenic mutant.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Deletion of a single residue, phenylalanine at position 508, in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) is present in approximately 90% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Experiments show that this mutant protein exhibits inefficient biosynthetic maturation and susceptibility to degradation probably due to misfolding of NBD1 and the resultant incorrect interactions of other domains. However, little is known about the direct effect of the Phe508 deletion on NBD1 folding. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of NBD1-WT, NBD1-F508A, and NBD1-ΔF508, we show that the deletion of Phe508 indeed alters the kinetics of NBD1 folding. We also find that the intermediate states appearing on wild type and mutant folding pathways are populated differently and that their kinetic accessibilities are distinct. Moreover, we identified critical interactions not necessarily localized near position 508, such as Q493/P574 and F575/F587, to be significant structural elements influencing the kinetic difference between wild type and mutant NBD1. We propose that these observed alterations in folding kinetics of mutant NBD1 result in misassembly of the whole multi-domain protein, thereby causing its premature degradation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is partially supported by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation grant DOKHOL07I0 (to NVD) and by the NIH grant DK051870 (to JRR).

Experimental studies suggest that the CFTR<sup>ΔF508</sup> may be arrested at two stages during its biogenesis. First, the loss of the Phe508 backbone may shift a fraction of the NBD1s of nascent CFTR<sup>ΔF508</sup> off the wild type folding pathway, causing misfolding and eventual rapid degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Qu1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Thibodeau1">[9]</xref>. Interestingly, recent studies show no significant structural difference between the wild type and mutant NBD1 structures nor in their thermodynamic stabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Lewis1">[10]</xref>. Second, the absence of the Phe508 side-chain prevents the correct post-translational assembly of all CFTR domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Du1">[11]</xref>. The detailed structural origin of the perturbed kinetics of NBD1 leading to its co-translational arrest is unknown.</p><p>Nucleotide-binding domains of ABC proteins are highly conserved in sequence and structure.

Smaller single-domain proteins correct and prevent formation of improper contacts through a sequence of partial folding-unfolding events en route to the native state. This sequence of partial folding-unfolding events reflects the ability of single-domain proteins to self-chaperone their folding. In NBD1, the attenuated refolding of the recombinant ΔF508 mutant is consistent with the notion that Phe508 reduces the activation energy of NBD1 folding <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Du1">[11]</xref>. Lowering of the activation energy increases the folding rate, which in turn reduces the folding time for NBD1. Reduction of the folding lessens the propensity of NBD1 to correct the malformed contacts in the intermediate states. Here we propose that Phe508 deletion decreases NBD1's self-chaperoning capability.</p><p>To investigate the effect of the Phe508 deletion on the stability, dynamics and kinetics of NBD1, we performed equilibrium dynamics simulations and folding simulations of NBD1-WT and NBD1-ΔF508.

We also perform simulations of another mutant NBD1-F508A to serve as control. These simulations allow the comparison of the mutant and wild type folding probabilities, their intermediate states, the structures of these intermediate states, and their folding pathways.

The ratio of NBD1-WT and NBD1-ΔF508 correlates with the ratio of their folding yields derived from folding experiments.

Additionally, residue pairs that have similar interactions (i.e., attractive or repulsive) in the wild type and mutant crystal structures still exhibit different contacts in the folding intermediate states.

In the case of the Q493/P574 pair, the residues are in close proximity in NBD1-WT but not in NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup>, thus we changed the interaction between Q493 and P574 in NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup> from repulsive to attractive to mimic a possible rescuing mutation. Folding simulations of “rescued” NBD1-ΔF508 yield a folding probability of 19±2%.

Proteins with ΔF508 mutation in the first nucleotide binding domain NBD1 can not mature resulting in absence of functional CFTR from the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanism leading to this pathological situation is unknown. No significant difference in thermodynamic stabilities was experimentally observed between wild type and mutant NBD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Qu1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Lewis1">[10]</xref>.

Using computational tools, we find that indeed Phe508 deletion causes the mutant to follow a different folding pathway from that of the wild type. We also investigate the molecular origin of NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup> aberrant folding.</p><p>Our model agrees with the experimental studies where wild type and mutant NBD1 did not exhibit significant thermodynamic difference. Thermal denaturation curves of both wild type and mutant were calculated from long equilibrium dynamics simulations (∼0.5 millisecond) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000008-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We find that there is no significant difference in the stabilities of wild type and mutant NBD1, which agrees with experimental observations showing unaltered thermodynamic stability upon Phe508 deletion from NBD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Thibodeau1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Lewis1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Lewis2">[12]</xref>.

While the stability of NBD1 may be minimally perturbed upon Phe508 deletion, the impaired interaction of NBD1 with the rest of CFTR could still destabilize the whole CFTR. Misfolding of NBD1 may prevent its proper interaction with other CFTR domains.</p><p>Interestingly, even a simplified protein model (4-bead representation for non-aromatic residues and 5-bead for aromatic residues) and a simplified potential (Go̅-type interaction) show a significant difference in NBD1-WT and NBD1<sup>ΔF08</sup> kinetics. Indeed the multiple folding simulations of NBD1 models show significantly higher folding efficiency for the wild type than the ΔF508 mutant, which correlate with some experimental studies that found higher folding yield for wild type NBD1 than its ΔF508 mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Qu2">[8]</xref>. A relevant control of our simulation protocol and modeling assumptions is the folding simulation of the NBD1-F508A that yields a folding probability of 26±4%, which is higher than that of NBD1<sup>ΔF08</sup> but lower than that of NBD1-WT. This observation again correlates with the measured folding efficiencies of isolated NBD1 and maturation levels of whole CFTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Thibodeau1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Du1">[11]</xref>.</p><p>We also find that the folding time of NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup> mutant is smaller than that of wild type, suggesting an increase in the effective folding rate upon Phe508 deletion.

The reduction in folding time diminishes the propensity of NBD1 to correct and prevent malformed contacts in the intermediate states. Thus, mutant NBD1 has a diminished self-chaperoning activity.</p><p>What is the origin of this loss in self-chaperoning capacity by the Phe508 mutant? To answer this question, we identify and compare the folding intermediates accessed by wild type and mutant <italic>en route</italic> to the native state. Calculation of transition frequencies from one state to another reveal differences in the accessibilities of intermediate states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000008-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Some intermediate states are only accessible in either wild type or mutant. These observations suggest that the progression of contact formation is different in the two structures. We also determine the primary differences in the progression of contact formation by calculating the most frequent contacts formed within the intermediate states. Between wild type and mutant NBD1 intermediates, the most notable differences are in the interaction between amino acid pairs F575/F587 and Q493/P574. Contact between Q493 and P574 is consistently formed in the intermediate states of the wild type but not of the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000008-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, the P574S mutation has been observed in a CF family also possessing the ΔF508 mutation but without significant pulmonary or pancreatic disease. The solubilizing F494N mutation, which is adjacent to Q493, has also been shown to partially correct the folding defect of CFTR-ΔF508 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-RoxoRosa1">[23]</xref>. The mutations P574S and F594N may promote contact formation between Q493 and P574 during NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup> folding, thus rescuing NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup> from the misfolding defect. Interestingly, Thibodeau <italic>et al.</italic> found that NBD1<sup>F508W</sup>, the only F508X mutant with a lower folding efficiency than NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup>, can be rescued by introducing the compensating mutation W496F, which is exactly in the same loop that contains Q493 and F594 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Thibodeau1">[9]</xref>.</p><p>A drawback that may arise from using Go̅ is that the properties of a protein are determined solely by its geometry, an assumption that apparently deviates from the observation that sequence is also a key determinant of folding properties. However, this potential drawback is not limiting in our study of the folding kinetics of wild type NBD1 and its mutants. The nuanced effect of a mutation or deletion at position 508 is already reflected in the S7-H6 loop conformation of NBD1-WT, NBD1-F508A, and NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup> crystal structures.</p><p>Changes in NBD1 folding kinetics have been shown earlier experimentally. Qu <italic>et al.</italic> observed dramatic changes in the temperature sensitivity of the folding process in the absence of Phe508 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Qu2">[8]</xref>. In the temperature and protein concentration range used in the refolding experiments, mutant NBD1 reached the native state less efficiently compared to wild type. The mutant NBD1 aggregated faster and to a larger extent, as observed by light scattering of the samples. In contrast, Lewis <italic>et al.</italic> observed no difference in folding of wild type and ΔF508 NBD1 monitored by CD spectroscopy or intrinsic Trp fluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Lewis1">[10]</xref>. This apparent disparity may be due to a substantial difference in experimental conditions of these two refolding experiments. While the former laboratory performed these experiments at different temperatures incubating the samples overnight, the latter made measurements immediately after dilution of the denaturant over a timescale of minutes. In the experiments of Qu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Qu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Qu2">[8]</xref>, there is a possibility that the two constructs have different solubilities. On the other hand, Lewis and coworkers' studies of folding kinetics were carried out only at room temperature, where the differences between the refolding of the two different domains are already attenuated compared to lower temperature (10°C–16°C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000008-Lewis1">[10]</xref>.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results reveal the intrinsic property of NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup> to fold improperly and raise the possibility of redesigning NBD1<sup>ΔF508</sup> to rescue it from misfolding. In case of the contact that is found in wild type but not in the ΔF508 mutant (e.g., Q493/P574), one can find amino acid substitutions that promote interaction between this pair of residues (Q493/P574). On the other hand, for the contact found only in the ΔF508 mutant but not in wild type (e.g., F475/F587), candidate rescue mutants are those that destabilize the interaction between this residue pair (F475/F587). Knowing the molecular details of the altered folding in the case of the mutant domain also provides a basis for design of small molecules to correct the most prevalent and pathogenic mutation in CFTR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Protein Model</title><p>To access time scales of NBD1 folding, we use a simplified protein model but still maintain important features of the protein such as side-chain packing.
