Studying natural biocombinatorics may aid in the development of concepts for experimental design of genes for the biosynthesis of new bioactive compounds. Here we address the question of how the modularity of biosynthetic enzymes and the prevalence of multiple gene clusters in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> drive the evolution of metabolic diversity. The phylogeny of ketosynthase (KS) domains of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> PKSs revealed that the majority of modules involved in the biosynthesis of a single compound evolved by duplication of a single ancestor module. Using <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Streptomyces avermitilis</named-content> as a model organism, we have reconstructed the evolutionary relationships of different domain types. This analysis suggests that 65% of the modules were altered by recombinational replacements that occurred within and between biosynthetic gene clusters. The natural reprogramming of the biosynthetic pathways was unambiguously confined to domains that account for the structural diversity of the polyketide products and never observed for the KS domains. We provide examples for natural acyltransferase (AT), ketoreductase (KR), and dehydratase (DH)–KR domain replacements. Potential sites of homologous recombination could be identified in interdomain regions and within domains. Our results indicate that homologous recombination facilitated by the modularity of PKS architecture is the most important mechanism underlying polyketide diversity in bacteria.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) of bacteria are multifunctional enzymes providing a molecular construction plan for the stepwise generation of polyketides of high structural complexity.

One major class of natural products are the polyketides, which include a wide range of pharmaceutically important compounds with antibacterial (e.g., erythromycin), immunosuppressive (e.g., rapamycin), and anticancer (e.g., epothilone) activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b001">1</xref>]. Polyketides are produced by different types of synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b001">1</xref>]. Modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) of bacteria are multifunctional enzymes providing an impressive construction plan for the assembly of complex structures from simple carbon building blocks. The chemical steps of chain extension and correspondingly the enzymatic activities are strikingly similar to those of fatty acid synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b002">2</xref>]. The active sites of type I PKSs are organized linearly into modules, such that each module catalyzes one cycle of elongation. A minimal module contains a ketosynthase (KS), an acyltransferase (AT), and an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. The specificity of AT for malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, or other α-alkylmalonyl-CoAs determines which carbon extender is used. Since the latter two substrate types have a chiral center, their incorporation gives different stereoisomers of the prolonged polyketide chain. After condensation, the oxidation state of the β-carbon is either kept as a keto group or modified to a hydroxyl, methine, or methylene group by the optional activity of ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoylreductase (ER) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Further variability comes from the existence of two types of KR domains that create different stereoisomers regarding the chiral β-carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b003">3</xref>]. Although there are only four different module architectures, which are classified here as type A, B, C, and D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the possibility of combining the different variants in a permutational manner gives an enormous diversity of polyketide structures. Theoretically, a PKS system comprising six elongation modules could produce more than 100,000 possible structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b004">4</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0020132-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020132.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The Different Module Types of Modular PKSs and Their Influence on the Structure of the Polyketide Backbone</title><p>The numbers written between domains give the typical length of the respective interdomain region in terms of amino acid residues.</p><p>ER, enoylreductase.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020132.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Ever since the modular principle of the PKS biosynthesis machinery was dissected, scientists were attracted by its obvious combinatorial potential. Different strategies were tested for the generation of “unnatural” product libraries. Novel polyketides were generated by adding, deleting, or exchanging domains within modules, or new products were obtained by recombination of entire modules from different pathways and host strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b001">1</xref>]. These biotechnological approaches can be taken as an attempt to reproduce the events that have shaped PKS clusters during evolution. It has been suggested that the evolution of the multimodular structure of PKSs can be attributed to repeated rounds of gene duplication, resulting in the addition of modules either as gene fusions or in the form of new separate proteins integrated into the assembly line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b005">5</xref>]. The diversity of differently programmed PKSs could have been achieved by subsequent exchange of modules. However, it has not been shown yet which kinds of replacements really happen in naturally occurring systems, particularly which components, modules, single domains, or fixed domain groups are actually exchanged to build up new assembly lines thereby creating differently programmed PKSs.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to obtain insights into the evolution of metabolic diversity by investigating to what extent the modular architecture of PKS genes allows for natural biocombinatorics. A better understanding of how bacteria benefit from the modularity of multi-enzyme systems may also provide new lessons for experimental biocombinatorial approaches. As the model organism we used the actinobacterium <italic>Streptomyces avermitilis,</italic> taking advantage of three factors that allow for an extensive analysis. First, the complete sequence of the genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> has been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b006">6</xref>]. Second, this genome encodes the largest number of PKSs of all bacterial genomes that are currently available in databases, and third, the majority of modules can be assigned to the biosynthesis of three characterized polyketide compounds, avermectin (<italic>ave</italic>), oligomycin (<italic>olm</italic>), and a polyene macrolide (<italic>pte</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b006">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PKS Clusters of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> and Their Phylogenetic Position in the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> Context</title><p>The genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> contains eight type I PKS gene clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b006">6</xref>]. The clusters involved in avermectin, oligomycin<italic>,</italic> and polyene macrolide biosynthesis each span between 80 kb and 100 kb and represent 86% of the 51 PKS modules encoded by the strain.

The tree reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g003">Figure 3</xref>) shows that the majority of domains are grouped in cluster-specific clades under a reliable node. The detailed tree with sequence names and clade probability values is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020132-sg001">Figure S1</xref>. The KS domains of the <italic>ave</italic> and the <italic>pte</italic> cluster each form a homogenous group with only one exception for the latter cluster, indicating that the vast majority of KS domains are the outcome of repeated gene duplications. In addition, gene conversion events within a given cluster may have contributed to the observed pattern by homogenizing the sequences. A common clustering of KS domains was also seen for the majority of the other <italic>Streptomyces</italic> pathways investigated. Most of the <italic>olm</italic> sequences are likewise located in a separate cluster, but there are six domains that seem to be phylogenetically more closely related to PKS clusters of other streptomycetes. Part of this topology can be explained as the result of horizontal gene transfer, as it was proposed for the amphotericin, nystatin, and pimaricin synthases based on the striking conformity of the cluster configurations and conspicuous GC content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b007">7</xref>]. In general, however, there is no necessity to imply horizontal gene transfer events to explain imperfect clustering patterns, which appear as mixed clusters or relatively separated branches, such as in the case of the <italic>olm</italic> KS domains. Instead, the possibility should be taken into account that the PKS multigene family existed before the speciation processes, resulting in the recent diversity of the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species. The imperfect clustering pattern may arise from “birth-and-death evolution,” which was detected in a considerable number of multigene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b008">8</xref>]. This model assumes that genes are created by gene duplications and that only some of them are maintained for a long time, whereas others are inactivated and deleted eventually. The involvement of “birth-and-death evolution” is supported by the existence of PKS-like genes in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> genome that are probably nonfunctional due to deleterious mutations and appear to be fragmented remnants of once functional clusters (unpublished data).</p><fig id="pcbi-0020132-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020132.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Phylogeny of the KS Domains of Selected PKS Clusters from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> Strains</title><p>The tree was inferred by Bayesian estimation using amino acid sequences.

We have observed similar relationships of KS domains for selected pathways of myxobacteria and cyanobacteria in a previous phylogenomic study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b009">9</xref>]. We may therefore conclude that duplication is a common evolutionary scenario that has led to modularization of biosynthetic pathways and that the evolutionary principle assessed in this study is not limited to <italic>Streptomycetes</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Phylogenetic Analysis of Domains and Global Replacement Patterns</title><p>We performed a phylogenetic reconstruction of the different domain types in the three large clusters and the <italic>pks5</italic> genes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows an integrated scheme, which projects the trees of KS, AT, DH, and KR domains as reconstructed by Bayesian inference (BI) on to the module structure. The parsimony analysis resulted in very similar tree topologies and can be found for comparison together with the Bayesian trees in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020132-sg002">Figure S2</xref>. It was not possible to obtain a reliable phylogeny of ACP domains due to their shortness and high similarity to each other. For all subsequent analyses we used only sequences of clades that were reproducible by both methods to avoid potential problems of a single reconstruction method. The trees in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g004">Figure 4</xref> display characteristic relationships depending on the domain type. The tree of AT domains consists of two main clades, the malonyl-CoA–using domains and those using methylmalonyl-CoA. This substrate-specific clustering is always found for AT domains and reflects the early evolutionary separation of the two domain types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b009">9</xref>]. The tree of KR domains is also built up from two main groups, which correspond to the functionally distinguishable KR subtypes that were originally found by sequence comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b003">3</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0020132-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020132.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Phylogenies of the Different PKS Domain Types from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> Projected onto the Cluster Structure</title><p>Modules that show complete congruity in all their domains are marked by asterisks on the left.

These modules can be interpreted as the direct result of gene duplications after which no further changes have happened. On the other hand, 65% of the modules show phylogenetic incongruities. Interestingly, the nonfitting “foreign” stretches are not equally distributed over the domain types. As seen in the overall tree of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> KS domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g003">Figure 3</xref>), we found that virtually all KS domains of the same cluster can be interpreted as one single clade that was formed from a common ancestor without any mixing between clusters. In contrast to KS, some of the AT domains of one cluster have near common ancestors with ATs of other clusters. The same phenomenon can be seen for DH and KR domains, albeit a cluster-specific ancestor connects the majority of domains. In conclusion, the global exchange patterns indicate recombination events between different PKS clusters encoded by a single strain. Strikingly, the evidence for sequence replacement is confined to domain types that exist in enzymatically different variants and whose absence or presence leads to a change in the chemical structure of the product. In the following sections we dissect examples of recombination for the different domain types.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Replacement of AT Domains</title><p>Changing the type of the carboxylic acid monomer to be incorporated into the polyketide chain is an important means to create product versatility. The successive modules PteA1–3, PteA1–4, PteA1–5, PteA2–1, and PteA2–2 all are of type C, thus having the optional DH and KR domains. KS, DH, and KR domains of each module belong to the same phylogenetic group, whereas there is an incongruity regarding the AT domains. PteA2–2 is the only module in the set using methylmalonyl-CoA, all the other ones show substrate specificity for malonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As malonyl-CoA–activating and methylmalonyl-CoA–activating domains were separated early in evolution and form distinct clades in phylogenetic trees (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b009">9</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020132-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020132-sg002">S2</xref>D), an alteration of the substrate specificity by point mutations is very unlikely.

The comparison of the AT–ACP and AT–KR interdomain regions, respectively, showed a nearly identical sequence segment of about 150 bp, which is exclusively found in modules of the <italic>ave</italic> cluster. A second homologous sequence stretch was found in the posterior part of the KR–ACP interdomain region of AveA2–2 and the AT–ACP interdomain region of AveA2–1. This constellation can thus be interpreted as the result of the loss of a large sequence section, which was situated between AT and ACP and contained a KR domain. Alternatively, a type A module could have been changed to type B by integrating a KR domain together with the characteristically long interdomain region in front of it. For both these scenarios, the recombination breakpoints were probably located in the respective interdomain regions, which surrounded the replaced sequence element.</p><p>Recombinational transfer of complete DH–KR units can be deduced from comparing a set of four modules of the <italic>ave</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), two of type B and two of type C. Whereas they show complete congruity with regard to their KS and AT domains, the KR domains belong to different phylogenetic groups. This sequence ensemble likely resulted from an exchange of a DH–KR unit with a single KR domain or vice versa<italic>.</italic> This type of conversion is supported by the distinct homology of AT–DH interdomain regions and the first approximately 200 bp of the region between AT and KR. Similarly, the second module of PteA1 likely has lost the DH domain by recombination with a module of PteA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). This suggestion is strongly supported by the fact that the KR domain of PteA1–2 does not belong to the same type as the KR of the other PteA1 modules, which are exclusively of the B type. Instead, it shares very high amino acid similarity with the KR domain type of the PteA4 modules, namely 92% within the first 80 positions and 91% in the last 50 positions. The sequence in between, however, seems to stem from a different KR type as it shows 87% similarity with the other KRs of PteA1. Like these domains, it has the LDD amino acid motif being typical for the D configuration–producing KR domains. Probably the original DH–KR unit was at first replaced by a KR unit concomitantly changing the KR type. A second recombination transformed the domain's center part back into the original type. This exemplifies that the borders of the underlying recombination events are not restricted to interdomain regions, but may be also located in homologous stretches of the domains themselves. We have found hybrid KR domains in each of the three major PKS pathways of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020132-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, at least one of these domains, namely the KR of the module AveA4–1, was shown to be nonfunctional in the biosynthesis of avermectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b010">10</xref>]. This exemplifies that recombination events do not always lead to the diversification of modules, but may also lead to the loss of domain functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Natural versus Laboratory Biocombinatorics</title><p>Our analysis demonstrates that the majority of PKS modules in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> were formed by recombination processes that affected regions that are responsible for substrate selection and for the reductive reactions that shape the polyketide backbone. Regarding the types of replacement processes, this truly natural biocombinatorics matches diverse efforts aimed at the production of new compounds in the laboratory. Exchange of AT domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b014">14</xref>], substitution of an AT–KR–ACP unit against AT–ACP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b015">15</xref>], and replacement of a KR domain by an intact DH–KR unit from another module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b015">15</xref>] have been reported, although they seem not to be suited for high-throughput production of novel compounds. Every single step may turn out to be laborious and prone to failures caused by nonfunctional new combinations of domains and modules.</p><p>A new method has been introduced recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b016">16</xref>] that might approach natural biocombinatorics principles much more than any earlier trial. This method allows for an adaptation of the codon usage to a suitable expression host like <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> and the introduction of unique restriction sites flanking domains, linkers, and modules. Thus, it is possible to create easily exchangeable building units. So far the experimental evaluation of this new method has been restricted to create new combinations of complete modules. It would be highly interesting to utilize the method to interchange single domains or certain domain units between different modules, because this procedure would correspond to the kinds of domain replacements that we have detected in the PKS genes of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content>. In this context it may be interesting to note that we found no evidence for a KS domain exchange between individual PKS pathways of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content>. This could indicate that congeneric KS domains cooperate better than evolutionarily distinct KS domains within an enzyme complex.</p><p>The fundamental difference between natural and experimental biocombinatorics is that the bacterium uses recombination, whereas the experimental method is based on restriction and re-ligation.</p><p>In principle, it should be possible to design an experimental approach that is based on recombination. Previous studies describing experimental recombination have frequently used undamaged homologous gene copies for the repair of mutated genes (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b018">18</xref>]). But even without the need for repair and the underlying selective pressure, gene conversion events leading to the diversification of surface antigens in pathogenic bacteria have been verified experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b018">18</xref>]. The frequency of the proposed recombination events in PKS genes can be estimated to be much lower than antigenic variations on the surfaces of pathogenic bacteria. To verify the impact of PKS recombination in a limited number of generations, therefore, selection pressure is needed. An experimental approach would be most promising when a polyketide product provides a specific advantage to the producing bacterium under certain conditions and allows for an easy selection. The corresponding PKS multi-enzyme could be mutated, leading to the loss of functionality for individual domains. If the strain contains multiple PKSs, it should be able to repair the damaged gene fragments. To increase the frequency of recombination, it would be reasonable to use mutant strains lacking functional mismatch repair genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b019">19</xref>]. This type of experiment could not only show the possibilities and limits of PKS recombination but could also answer the question whether the exchange of gene fragments occurs reciprocally or nonreciprocally.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Recombination as the Basis of PKS Variability</title><p>Uncovering the mechanisms of protein evolution and explaining the wealth of enzymatic and metabolite diversity in general is still a great challenge. The idea that promiscuous activity in a protein can provide a selective advantage, thereby enabling the organism to survive and to further evolve, was formalized 30 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b020">20</xref>]. Since then, many examples for such processes have been described. The task to unravel the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the evolution of secondary metabolism is equally challenging because of the vast diversity of natural products. Firn and Jones proposed a simple evolution-based model in order to create a framework that can explain the existence of this chemical diversity and how it is generated, the so-called Screening Hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b022">22</xref>]. This model acknowledges the fundamental fact that a biomolecular activity, i.e., the capability to interact with a protein target with high affinity in a specific and noncovalent way, is a very rare property. It should be advantageous for an organism to possess a synthesis system that favors the production of multiple products. Based on these considerations, it has been predicted that enzymes of secondary metabolism typically have broad substrate specificity and are organized in branched and matrix pathways. Both the evolution of broad substrate specificity and of altered substrate specificity operates on the active centers of enzymes and originates from point mutations. A typical example of this kind of process is the evolution of stilbene synthases, which developed several times independently from chalcone synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b023">23</xref>]. However, reliance on changes in the active centers means that these systems face the same evolutionary restriction as other proteins, namely the limitation of sequence diversity.</p><p>Modular PKSs demonstrate that there is a second very efficient way to create extreme versatility. Though the KS component of modular PKSs somehow fulfills the expected broad substrate specificity, the main invention of enzymatic assembly line processes is the possibility of combinatorial plethora by using homologous recombination. The importance of recombination processes for providing product versatility has already been described for other systems. Phylogenetic analysis of the microcystin biosynthesis cluster in cyanobacterial strains of the species <italic>Microcystis</italic> revealed that recombination was involved in their evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b024">24</xref>]. The important role of homologous recombination for generating antigenic diversity in pathogenic bacteria was already emphasized. All the proteins analyzed in this context are structural components of the outer membrane of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b018">18</xref>]. Modular PKSs are the first example of an enzyme system whose flexibility is apparently governed by extensive recombinational processes, leading to duplication and domain transfer.</p><p>We have determined selection within the PKSs of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> in terms of the ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions (d<sub>N</sub>) and synonymous substitutions (d<sub>S</sub>) per site. For all domain types, d<sub>N</sub> was significantly lower than d<sub>S</sub>, indicating purifying selection (unpublished data). Furthermore, we carried out sliding-window analyses for the complete sequence sets of each module type in order to detect regions of potential positive selection. However, no such regions could be identified in any module type (unpublished data). Thus, their developmental potential is not based on point mutations followed by positive selection of a new enzyme function. Rather, there was only purifying selection, which secures the functionality of the components. The bacterium equipped with its recombination machinery is capable of rebuilding existing PKS clusters by many different kinds of rearrangements and additionally by duplications and insertions. In this process, many unfavorable and unproductive changes may happen, but in some phases of cluster evolution positive selective pressure will set in to stabilize and fix a certain configuration within the population due to the usefulness of the respective compound.</p><p>This concept also fits well with the observations that strains of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> often produce two chemically different metabolites that act synergistically against a common target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b025">25</xref>] and that they possess contingently acting metabolites, i.e., natural products that have similar biological activity, but are independently used by the producers. The existence of two pathways for the production of siderophores in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Streptomyces coelicolor</named-content> is an example of the latter phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b026">26</xref>]. Based on a growing number of examples, it has been proposed recently that such synergy and contingency effects are driving forces in natural product evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b027">27</xref>]. Oligomycin and the polyene macrolide compound of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> both have antifungal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b027">27</xref>]. The selective pressure acts on whole synthases as a unit and deter the organism from further changes of the cluster structure. The modular architecture together with the efficiency of the underlying (re)combinatorial principle can be interpreted as a very useful evolutionary invention because of its inherent evolvability, allowing for permanent change beyond the limitations of sequence diversity. This explains the seeming paradox why an organism uses such giant synthesis systems encoded by large regions of the genome to produce rather small natural products. In the recently completed genome of the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum,</italic> genes encoding 43 putative PKSs were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b028">28</xref>]. It would be interesting to analyze the evolution of these eukaryotic PKS clusters and to figure out whether the same sort of evolutionary strategy is followed in this organism.</p><p>In the context of cluster evolution by recombination, it will be also interesting to analyze nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), the other synthesis system of secondary metabolism being organized in modules, with regard to the impact of recombination on their evolution. NRPSs show intriguing analogies with modular PKSs in their architecture and functional principles, and, moreover, hybrid systems comprising NRPS and PKS components are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020132-b029">29</xref>]. It can be anticipated that the wealth of nonribosomal peptides is also founded in the recombination-based evolutionary plasticity of the underlying biosynthetic machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Data retrieval.</title><p>The amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the PKS clusters of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> were retrieved from the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. avermitilis</named-content> genome website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://avermitilis.ls.kitasato-u.ac.jp" xlink:type="simple">http://avermitilis.ls.kitasato-u.ac.jp</ext-link>).

Site rate heterogeneity was modeled using a gamma distribution with four categories (JTT+γ). Two parallel Metropolis-coupled Markov chain analyses were performed with 10 million generations and four independent chains. The Markov chains were sampled every 100 generations. Clade probability values were calculated from trees retained after a burn-in phase of 6 million generations.
