<p>Upregulation of PERK-Nrf2 signaling is a key mechanism by which de-differentiated cancer cells gain multi-drug resistance.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Malignant carcinomas that recur following therapy are typically de-differentiated and multidrug resistant (MDR). De-differentiated cancer cells acquire MDR by up-regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS)–scavenging enzymes and drug efflux pumps, but how these genes are up-regulated in response to de-differentiation is not known. Here, we examine this question by using global transcriptional profiling to identify ROS-induced genes that are already up-regulated in de-differentiated cells, even in the absence of oxidative damage. Using this approach, we found that the Nrf2 transcription factor, which is the master regulator of cellular responses to oxidative stress, is preactivated in de-differentiated cells. In de-differentiated cells, Nrf2 is not activated by oxidation but rather through a noncanonical mechanism involving its phosphorylation by the ER membrane kinase PERK. In contrast, differentiated cells require oxidative damage to activate Nrf2. Constitutive PERK-Nrf2 signaling protects de-differentiated cells from chemotherapy by reducing ROS levels and increasing drug efflux. These findings are validated in therapy-resistant basal breast cancer cell lines and animal models, where inhibition of the PERK-Nrf2 signaling axis reversed the MDR of de-differentiated cancer cells. Additionally, analysis of patient tumor datasets showed that a PERK pathway signature correlates strongly with chemotherapy resistance, tumor grade, and overall survival. Collectively, these results indicate that de-differentiated cells up-regulate MDR genes via PERK-Nrf2 signaling and suggest that targeting this pathway could sensitize drug-resistant cells to chemotherapy.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The development of multidrug resistance is the primary obstacle to treating cancers. High-grade tumors that are less differentiated typically respond poorly to therapy and carry a much worse prognosis than well-differentiated low-grade tumors. Therapy-resistant cancer cells often overexpress antioxidants or efflux proteins that pump drugs out of the cell, but how the differentiation state of cancer cells influences these resistance mechanisms is not well understood. Here we used genome-scale approaches and found that the PERK kinase and its downstream target, Nrf2—a master transcriptional regulator of the cellular antioxidant response—are key mediators of therapy resistance in poorly differentiated breast cancer cells. We show that Nrf2 is activated when cancer cells de-differentiate and that this activation requires PERK. We further show that blocking PERK-Nrf2 signaling with a small-molecule inhibitor sensitizes drug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy. Our results identify a novel role for PERK-Nrf2 signaling in multidrug resistance and suggest that targeting this pathway could improve the responsiveness of otherwise resistant tumors to chemotherapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the primary obstacle to treating malignant tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Gottesman1">[1]</xref>. Cancer cells develop MDR by overexpressing antioxidant enzymes that neutralize the reactive oxygen species (ROS) required for chemotherapy toxicity or by up-regulating drug efflux pumps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Simon1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Choi1">[3]</xref>. In many cancers, these MDR mechanisms are up-regulated by mutation or amplification of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes or drug efflux pumps. Many other cancers, however, up-regulate these genes through nonmutational mechanisms that remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>One nonmutational mechanism by which cancer cells acquire MDR is de-differentiation. De-differentiation is a well-established marker of poor prognosis tumors and can occur when differentiated cells are induced into a more primitive stem-cell–like state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Lobo1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Stingl1">[6]</xref>. One mechanism by which both cancerous and noncancerous cells can be de-differentiated is through induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Thiery1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Schwitalla1">[14]</xref>. De-differentiated cancer cells generated by EMT and cancer stem-like cells are both resistant to a wide range of chemotherapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Saxena1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Dean1">[19]</xref>. Conversely, cells experimentally induced to differentiate are more sensitive to chemotherapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Azzi1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Ohno1">[23]</xref>. Although de-differentiation is known to up-regulate MDR mechanisms as described above, how this occurs is poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine this question by employing a global transcriptional profiling approach to identify ROS-induced genes that are preactivated in de-differentiated cells. Many of these genes—which are activated in de-differentiated cells even in the absence of oxidative damage—are regulated by a single signaling pathway. We further show that this pathway is critical for de-differentiated cells to resist chemotherapies.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To study the effects of differentiation state on MDR, we used isogenic pairs of human breast epithelial cells (HMLE) that were either differentiated and expressed a control vector, or de-differentiated through induction of an EMT—achieved by expressing the Twist transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Elenbaas1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Yang1">[25]</xref>. These de-differentiated HMLE-Twist cells were more resistant to the chemotherapy drugs Paclitaxel (Tax) and Doxorubicin (Dox) than differentiated HMLE-shGFP cells, consistent with prior reports (1.5× and 2.5×, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Arumugam1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Li1">[27]</xref>. To determine how Twist-induced de-differentiation caused MDR, we assessed whether known mechanisms were up-regulated in these cells. Twist overexpression significantly increased efflux pump activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) and lowered ROS levels—both basal and induced by the oxidizer menadione or Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1c,d</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Loor1">[28]</xref>. Additionally, HMLE-Twist cells displayed significantly lower amounts of lipid peroxidation compared to HMLE-shGFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1e</xref>). As a measure of overall reducing capacity of the cells, we also show that HMLE-Twist cells had a greater pool of reduced glutathione, which could be maintained even in the presence of menadione (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1f</xref>). Finally, Twist overexpression led to a significant increase in expression of enzymes involved in ROS metabolism: superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and catalase (CAT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1g</xref>).</p>

<p>We suspected that these MDR mechanisms were up-regulated through a normal regulator of the cellular antioxidant response. To identify putative regulators, we transcriptionally profiled HMLE-shGFP and HMLE-Twist cells treated with vehicle or menadione (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001945.s001">Table S1</xref>). In the absence of oxidative stress, 1,694 genes were differentially expressed between the two cell types, several of which were ROS and efflux-related genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001945.s002">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001945.s003">S3</xref>). Treatment with menadione induced the expression of 181 and 170 genes in HMLE-shGFP and HMLE-Twist cells, respectively, with 44 genes being commonly induced in both cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001945.s004">Table S4</xref>; hypergeometric test, <italic>p</italic> value&lt;1.0×10<sup>−10</sup>). Of the 181 genes induced by menadione in HMLE-shGFP cells, 54 were already up-regulated in HMLE-Twist cells in the absence of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001945.s005">Table S5</xref>; hypergeometric test, <italic>p</italic> value&lt;1.0×10<sup>−10</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1h</xref>). Of these 54 genes, 38 were uniquely induced in HMLE-shGFP but not HMLE-Twist cells treated with menadione. This suggests that some oxidative stress response genes are “preactivated” in de-differentiated HMLE-Twist cells.</p>
<p>The most significantly preactivated gene in HMLE-Twist cells was heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1)—expressed at 8-fold higher levels in HMLE-Twist cells compared to HMLE-shGFP cells and induced 22-fold in differentiated cells treated with menadione. HMOX-1 is a well-characterized enzyme involved in the metabolism of heme, but is also a major target of master antioxidant regulator Nrf2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Alam1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Maines1">[31]</xref>. The Nrf2 transcription factor activates an arsenal of antioxidant genes and ABC transporters, and its up-regulation is associated with acquired MDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Itoh1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-McMahon1">[35]</xref>. To test whether Nrf2 might be basally active in HMLE-Twist cells, but not HMLE-shGFP cells, we examined Nrf2 target gene expression. Of 1,013 Nrf2 direct-target genes, a significant number—142 genes—were up-regulated in HMLE-Twist cells compared to HMLE-shGFP cells in the absence of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001945.s006">Table S6</xref>; hypergeometric test, <italic>p</italic> value&lt;1.0×10<sup>−10</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Malhotra1">[36]</xref>. Further, 7 of the 54 oxidative stress response genes “preactivated” in HMLE-Twist cells were Nrf2 direct-target genes, representing a significant enrichment over the number predicted by random chance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001945.s005">Table S5</xref>; hypergeometric test, <italic>p</italic> value = 4.9×10<sup>−5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1h</xref>). To confirm Nrf2 activation in HMLE-Twist cells, we assessed its subcellular localization by immunofluorescence. In HMLE-shGFP cells, Nrf2 was sequestered in the cytoplasm and translocated to the nucleus when cells were treated with menadione (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1i</xref>). In HMLE-Twist cells, however, Nrf2 was constitutively in the nucleus, and treatment with menadione only modestly increased its nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g001">Figure 1i</xref>). These findings demonstrate that Nrf2 is constitutively active in de-differentiated HMLE-Twist cells—even in the absence of exogenous stress.</p>
<p>We next examined why Nrf2 was constitutively active in HMLE-Twist cells, even though basal ROS levels are low. Although ROS activate Nrf2 by oxidation, it can also be activated in the absence of oxidative stress by several kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Ichimura1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Lee1">[39]</xref>. In particular, Nrf2 is directly phosphorylated and activated by the ER-membrane kinase PERK, which is canonically activated under conditions of ER stress as part of the unfolded protein response (UPR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Shi1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Cullinan1">[42]</xref>. In this context, PERK relieves ER stress by slowing protein translation through phosphorylation of eiF2α. We have recently shown that PERK is also activated upon EMT-induced de-differentiation—even in the absence of overt ER stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Feng1">[43]</xref>. Consistent with this, we found that PERK is constitutively phosphorylated in HMLE-Twist cells, but not in HMLE-shGFP cells, and inhibition of PERK with a small-molecule inhibitor blocked its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Axten1">[44]</xref>. To understand if PERK controls constitutive Nrf2 activation in HMLE-Twist cells, we assessed Nrf2 localization following PERK inhibition. We found that inhibition of PERK fully reversed the nuclear localization of Nrf2 in HMLE-Twist cells, but did not prevent oxidative stress-induced nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in either HMLE-shGFP or HMLE-Twist cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). As a complementary approach to PERK inhibition and to rule out off-target effects of the small-molecule PERK inhibitor, we also generated cell lines in which PERK expression was stably inhibited by two different shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). Inhibition of PERK by shRNA significantly decreased Nrf2 nuclear localization in HMLE-Twist cells, mirroring the results obtained with the small-molecule PERK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g002">Figure 2d</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Nrf2 nuclear localization is controlled by PERK in de-differentiated HMLE-Twist cells.</p>

<p>To confirm that Nrf2 nuclear localization correlated with its activation, we assessed Nrf2 target gene expression following PERK inhibition. We found that PERK inhibition significantly decreased HMOX-1 expression in HMLE-Twist cells, but did not prevent induction of HMOX-1 in response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g002">Figure 2e</xref>). Moreover, using microarray gene expression analyses, we found that PERK inhibition decreased the expression of 58 of the 142 Nrf2-target genes (41%) activated in HMLE-Twist cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001945.s006">Table S6</xref>). Amongst these PERK-Nrf2-target genes were ABC transporters, enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism and ROS buffering, and several proteins with known roles in drug resistance. These findings confirm that the exit of Nrf2 from the nucleus correlates with down-regulation of its target genes.</p>
<p>PERK has previously been shown to bind to, directly phosphorylate, and activate Nrf2, though the exact phosphorylation sites have not yet been determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Cullinan1">[42]</xref>. To show that PERK directly regulates Nrf2 in our system, we performed PERK immunoprecipitation followed by western blot with a Nrf2-specific antibody—which confirmed that PERK and Nrf2 directly interact in HMLE-Twist cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g002">Figure 2f</xref>). We also immunoprecipitated Nrf2 in either the presence or absence of the PERK inhibitor, which demonstrated that Nrf2 phosphorylation was markedly reduced by PERK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g002">Figure 2g</xref>). These data, combined with our finding that inhibiting PERK decreases nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, suggest that PERK directly interacts with Nrf2 to mediate its nuclear translocation and activation.</p>
<p>We next tested whether inhibition of PERK would eliminate MDR phenotypes associated with HMLE-Twist cells. PERK inhibition caused a 45% increase in mitochondrial ROS levels in HMLE-Twist cells, but did not affect HMLE-shGFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). PERK inhibition also significantly increased lipid peroxidation in HMLE-Twist cells, but not in HMLE-shGFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). PERK inhibition compromised ROS buffering—cells pretreated with the PERK inhibitor produced 25%–55% more ROS than vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). Additionally, PERK inhibition led to a significant decrease in the expression of ROS metabolizing enzymes SOD1 and CAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g003">Figure 3d</xref>). Lastly, inhibition of PERK signaling reduced the percentage of high-effluxing HMLE-Twist cells by 50% and did not affect efflux in HMLE-shGFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g003">Figure 3e</xref>). Together these results demonstrate that a simple change in differentiation state confers MDR phenotypes, and these are mediated by constitutive PERK signaling.</p>

<p>To understand how this applies in the context of cancer, we expanded our analyses to include several luminal and basal-like breast cancer cell lines, which represent epithelial-like/differentiated and mesenchymal-like/de-differentiated cells, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Blick1">[45]</xref>. Previous work has shown that PERK is preferentially activated in basal compared to luminal cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Feng1">[43]</xref>. Consistent with our results in the HMLE system, basal breast cancer cells had lower overall ROS than luminal cells, and addition of the PERK inhibitor caused a dramatic increase in ROS levels in basal cells but not luminal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g003">Figure 3f</xref>). Likewise, inhibition of PERK caused a 25% reduction in the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione in only the basal cell lines, indicative of decreased ROS buffering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g003">Figure 3g</xref>). This indicates that PERK contributes to the enhanced oxidative stress buffering ability of both noncancerous and cancerous de-differentiated cells.</p>
<p>In order to affect chemotherapy resistance, we rationalized that PERK inhibition would need to occur prior to chemotherapy exposure to allow time for reversal of MDR phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g004">Figure 4a</xref>). Pretreatment with the PERK inhibitor greatly sensitized both HMLE-Twist and HMLE-shGFP cells to subsequent treatment with Tax and Dox—the number of surviving cells was reduced significantly in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). Treatment with a ROS-scavenging agent n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) was able to rescue this decreased survival, indicating that PERK pathway activation contributes to chemotherapy resistance in significant part via ROS buffering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g004">Figure 4c,d</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Zafarullah1">[46]</xref>. We also utilized a small molecule—oltipraz—capable of inducing Nrf2 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g004">Figure 4e,f</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-RamosGomez1">[47]</xref>. Activation of Nrf2 significantly rescued PERK-dependent decreases in cell survival. To rule out the possibility that off-target effects of oltipraz were responsible for this effect, we performed the same rescue experiment in cells with stable Nrf2 knockdown achieved by two independent shRNAs. When Nrf2 was inhibited, oltipraz was no longer able to rescue the effects of PERK inhibition, confirming that these effects were mediated by Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g004">Figure 4g–i</xref>). These results indicate that PERK signaling through Nrf2 is responsible for the acquisition of MDR.</p>

<p>These results prompted us to test the effect of PERK inhibition in vivo, utilizing xenografted tumors derived from therapy-resistant basal breast cancer cells. We utilized a treatment plan involving cycles of pretreatment with the PERK inhibitor, followed immediately by treatment with Dox. The combined treatment resulted in significantly smaller tumors compared to single or mock treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). To test if PERK inhibition affected ROS buffering in vivo, we harvested tumors from each of the four treatment groups and measured the expression of the ROS-metabolizing enzyme SOD1. We found that the Dox, PERK inhibitor, and combined treatment groups all had significantly reduced expression of SOD1 compared to control tumors, with the dual-treated tumors having the lowest expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). Additionally, the combined treatment group had the most necrotic cells compared to the other treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>

<p>We next adjusted the dosage schedule to highlight the synergistic interactions between PERK inhibition and Dox treatment and found that reducing the total dosage and frequency of treatments further emphasized the sensitization effect—dual-treated tumors were 4 times smaller than Dox-treated tumors and &gt;5 times smaller than PERK inhibitor or mock-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5d</xref>). Although prior research has shown that PERK is critical for tumor growth and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Blais1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Atkins1">[50]</xref>, we found that low-dose inhibition only minimally impacted tumor growth in the absence of chemotherapy. To assess the in vivo effects on ROS buffering, we measured the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in tumors harvested from each treatment group. Dox, PERK inhibitor, and combined treatment groups all had decreased levels of GSH compared to the control group, with the dual-treated tumors having the lowest amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5e</xref>).</p>
<p>As an important control to demonstrate that the observed in vivo results were not due to off-target effects of the PERK inhibitor, we utilized xenografted tumors derived from luminal breast cancer cells. Although treatment with Dox led to a reduction in tumor size, inhibition of PERK did not provide any additive benefit in the luminal tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5f</xref>). This confirms that the effects observed in the basal breast cancer xenografts are not due to off-target effects of the PERK inhibitor, as luminal cells—unlike basal cells—do not constitutively activate PERK and do not significantly respond to PERK inhibition. Together our results suggest that combining Dox treatment with PERK inhibition compromises the ROS-buffering capacity of basal-like breast cancer cells and sensitizes them to chemotherapy-induced cell death.</p>
<p>To assess the clinical relevance of our findings, we analyzed primary human breast tumor datasets. Utilizing two independent datasets (comprised of 413 patient tumors), we first tested for correlations between the expression of PERK pathway genes and genes associated with the basal subtype of breast cancer. We found that a PERK gene expression signature correlated positively with a basal breast cancer gene signature, suggesting that the PERK signaling pathway is active in basal breast tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5g</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-CharafeJauffret1">[51]</xref>. As a negative control, an IRE1 gene expression signature did not show a significant correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5g</xref>). Additionally, we found that PERK pathway activity could stratify patient response to therapy—85% of PERK-low tumors displayed complete or partial response to therapy, compared to only 38% of PERK-high tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5h</xref>). Finally, PERK pathway expression also correlated to differentiation state and overall survival in invasive high-grade glioma—tumors stratified into a PERK-high group were almost exclusively poorly differentiated grade 4 GBM and had significantly worse overall survival than the PERK-low group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001945-g005">Figure 5i,j</xref>). These results highlight the relevance of our work in primary tumors, and suggest that targeting PERK signaling may be beneficial in highly aggressive and malignant tumor types.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These findings identify PERK-Nrf2 signaling as one mechanism by which de-differentiated cells gain MDR. Because they constitutively activate Nrf2, these de-differentiated cells constitutively express antioxidant enzymes and drug efflux pumps. Remarkably, in this setting, Nrf2 is not activated by oxidation, but rather through a previously reported mechanism involving its phosphorylation by PERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Cullinan1">[42]</xref>. This finding is of particular interest given Nrf2's known role in promoting chemotherapy survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Wang1">[34]</xref> and its constitutive activation by mutation in a subset of tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Kim1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Singh2">[54]</xref>. Our findings indicate that a change in cellular state, in the absence of mutation or oxidative stress, can also lead to constitutive Nrf2 activation. This enables de-differentiated cells to survive chemotherapy by preventing cellular damage before it occurs. In contrast, differentiated cells activate Nrf2 only after proteins and DNA have been oxidized. Although this defensive response may succeed in neutralizing toxins, the damage to cellular components would have already occurred.</p>
<p>Our findings also highlight the importance of stress signaling in cancer. Cancer cells activate stress response pathways to protect themselves from harsh environments encountered during tumor growth and metastasis—for example, hypoxia and nutrient deprivation—and also during the course of chemotherapy. We show that de-differentiated tumor cells preactivate PERK-Nrf2 signaling in the absence of stress and that inhibition of PERK sensitizes these cells to chemotherapy. These observations complement prior studies establishing a role for the UPR and its downstream targets in chemosensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Mann1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001945-Shen1">[67]</xref>. Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic insights into how cellular de-differentiation promotes MDR and suggest that inhibiting PERK-Nrf2 signaling may reverse the MDR of cancer cells that are otherwise drug resistant.</p>
