                <p>An important question in the literature focusing on motor control is to determine
                    which laws drive biological limb movements. This question has prompted numerous
                    investigations analyzing arm movements in both humans and monkeys. Many theories
                    assume that among all possible movements the one actually performed satisfies an
                    optimality criterion. In the framework of optimal control theory, a first
                    approach is to choose a cost function and test whether the proposed model fits
                    with experimental data. A second approach (generally considered as the more
                    difficult) is to infer the cost function from behavioral data. The cost proposed
                    here includes a term called the absolute work of forces, reflecting the
                    mechanical energy expenditure. Contrary to most investigations studying
                    optimality principles of arm movements, this model has the particularity of
                    using a cost function that is not smooth. First, a mathematical theory related
                    to both direct and inverse optimal control approaches is presented. The first
                    theoretical result is the Inactivation Principle, according to which minimizing
                    a term similar to the absolute work implies simultaneous inactivation of
                    agonistic and antagonistic muscles acting on a single joint, near the time of
                    peak velocity. The second theoretical result is that, conversely, the presence
                    of non-smoothness in the cost function is a necessary condition for the
                    existence of such inactivation. Second, during an experimental study,
                    participants were asked to perform fast vertical arm movements with one, two,
                    and three degrees of freedom. Observed trajectories, velocity profiles, and
                    final postures were accurately simulated by the model. In accordance,
                    electromyographic signals showed brief simultaneous inactivation of opposing
                    muscles during movements. Thus, assuming that human movements are optimal with
                    respect to a certain integral cost, the minimization of an absolute-work-like
                    cost is supported by experimental observations. Such types of optimality
                    criteria may be applied to a large range of biological movements.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>When performing reaching and grasping movements, the brain has to choose one
                    trajectory among an infinite set of possibilities. Nevertheless, because human
                    and animal movements provide highly stereotyped features, motor strategies used
                    by the brain were assumed to be optimal according to certain optimality
                    criteria. In this study, we propose a theoretical model for motor planning of
                    arm movements that minimizes a compromise between the absolute work exerted by
                    the muscles and the integral of the squared acceleration. We demonstrate that
                    under these assumptions agonistic and antagonistic muscles are inactivated
                    during overlapping periods of time for quick enough movements. Moreover, it is
                    shown that only this type of criterion can predict these inactivation periods.
                    Finally, experimental evidence is in agreement with the predictions of the
                    model. Indeed, we report the existence of simultaneous inactivation of opposing
                    muscles during fast vertical arm movements. Therefore, this study suggests that
                    biological movements partly optimize the energy expenditure, integrating both
                    inertial and gravitational forces during the motor planning process.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>In order to perform accurate goal-directed movements, the Central Nervous System
                (CNS) has to compute neural commands according to the initial state of the body, the
                location of the target, and the external forces acting on the limbs. Arm movement
                planning requires solving redundancy problems related to angular displacements,
                joint torques, muscular patterns, and neural inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Bernstein1">[1]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Experimental studies reported stereotypical kinematic features during pointing and
                reaching arm movements (e.g., quasi-straight finger paths, bell-shaped finger
                velocity profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Morasso1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Abend1">[4]</xref>). These features were
                found to be robust despite changes in mass, initial/final positions, amplitudes, and
                speeds of displacements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Hollerbach1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Hermens1">[9]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Therefore, many studies have attempted to identify the principles of motion planning
                and control, hypothesizing that movements were optimal with respect to some
                criteria. The present article addresses the question whether motor planning is
                optimal according to an identifiable criterion.</p>
            <p>A promising approach to answer this question, called <italic>inverse</italic> optimal
                control, is to record experimental data and try to infer a cost function with regard
                to which the observed behavior is optimal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Todorov1">[10]</xref>. In the theory of
                linear-quadratic control, the question of which quadratic cost is minimized in order
                to control a linear system along certain trajectories was already raised by R.
                Kalman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Kalman1">[11]</xref>. Some methods allowed deducing cost functions from
                optimal behavior in system and control theory (linear matrix inequalities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Boyd1">[12]</xref>) and in
                Markov decision processes (inverse reinforcement learning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Ng1">[13]</xref>). In the field of
                sensorimotor control and learning, some authors suggested that motor learning
                results from the optimization of some “loss function” related to
                the task (e.g., pointing accuracy) providing, therefore, a technique allowing to
                measure such function from experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Krding1">[14]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, in most optimal control studies focusing on arm movements, a cost
                function is chosen and used in a mathematical model to check its validity <italic>a
                    posteriori</italic> by comparing the theoretical predictions to the experimental
                observations.</p>
            <p>Kinematic models include minimum hand acceleration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-BenItzhak1">[15]</xref> and minimum hand
                jerk criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Flash1">[16]</xref>. These models produce horizontal arm movements that
                globally fit well with experimental data, providing smooth symmetric velocity
                profiles and straight trajectories in space. Dynamic models include minimum
                torque-change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Uno1">[17]</xref> and minimum commanded torque-change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Nakano1">[18]</xref>
                criteria. They also accurately reproduce certain types of movements (point-to-point
                and via-point movements performed in the horizontal plane) but in several cases
                provide non-realistic double-peaked speed profiles (see for instance <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g011">Figure 11</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Biess1">[19]</xref>). In the Riemannian
                geometry framework, a model used geodesics to separately determine the geometrical
                and temporal movement features, allowing therefore a unification of previous
                computational models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Biess1">[19]</xref>. Specifically, the geodesic model accurately
                predicts the spatiotemporal features of three dimensional arm movements. However it
                results in hand paths that are excessively curved for planar movements. Additional
                criteria have also been considered, such as energy-like criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Nelson1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Kang1">[25]</xref> and effort related
                criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Guigon1">[26]</xref>, which minimize the peak value of the work, the
                metabolic energy expenditure, or the amount of neural control signals necessary to
                drive the arm. These models quantitatively reproduce some specific features of
                reaching and grasping, such as trajectories, velocity profiles, or final postures.
                Stochastic models, which are grounded on the hypothesis that noise in the nervous
                system corrupts command signals, have also been proposed. The minimum variance model
                was aimed at minimizing endpoint errors and provides not only accurate simulated
                trajectories of both eye saccades and arm pointing movements in the horizontal
                plane, but also the speed-accuracy trade-off described by Fitt's law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Harris1">[27]</xref>. In the
                optimal feedback control theory, noise is assumed to induce movement inaccuracy. If
                errors interfere with task goals, then the controller corrects deviations from the
                average trajectory. Otherwise the errors are ignored and, thus, variability in
                task-irrelevant dimensions is allowed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Todorov2">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Scott1">[30]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Despite extensive literature concerning <italic>direct</italic> optimal control of
                arm movements, the hypotheses seem too restrictive in some models. For instance, in
                several models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Biess1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Guigon1">[26]</xref>, the static (gravity-related) and dynamic
                (speed-related) torques are calculated separately; therefore their predictions are
                independent from the gravity field. This assumption partly relies on the
                physiological observations that muscle activity patterns show two components: a
                tonic one (gravity-related) and a phasic one (speed-related) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Flanders1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Buneo1">[32]</xref>. Nevertheless, some
                authors reported difficulties in solving optimal control problems while taking into
                account gravitational forces in the optimization process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Soechting3">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Thoroughman1">[34]</xref>.
                Thus, this assumption was also aimed at simplifying computations. Furthermore, the
                models previously cited are generally not consistent with the observation that the
                kinematics of arm movements performed in the sagittal plane depends on the direction
                with respect to gravity (i.e., upward versus downward movements) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Papaxanthis1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Seach1">[38]</xref> whereas such a
                directional difference is significantly attenuated in microgravity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Papaxanthis3">[39]</xref>.</p>
            <p>A possible explanation of these findings would be that the CNS uses the gravity to
                move the limbs efficiently, rather than simply offset it at each instant. This idea
                guided the development of the theoretical model presented here. During a movement,
                the energetic consumption is related to the work of muscular forces. However, work
                is a signed physical quantity that may cancel itself out, even though both active
                and resistive forces consume energy in muscles. Therefore, work has to be always
                counted positive in order to express the energy expenditure of a movement: this is
                the <italic>absolute work</italic> of forces. The problem of minimizing this
                absolute work was never solved previously, despite its apparent simplicity and its
                potential interest for neurophysiologists. A reason might be the mathematical
                difficulty due to the non-differentiability of the cost function (induced by the
                absolute value function). Thus, while most existing models deal with smooth cost
                functions (i.e., functions that have continuous derivatives up to some desired
                order), this study relies on this non-smoothness property. The cost chosen here
                includes two terms: the first represents the absolute work and the second is
                proportional to the integral of the squared acceleration.</p>
            <p>In this article, two theoretical results are reported. Firstly, an
                “Inactivation Principle” states that minimizing a cost similar
                to the absolute work implies the presence of simultaneous inactivation of both
                agonistic and antagonistic muscles acting on a joint during fast movements.
                Secondly, a reciprocal result is that the presence of such inactivation along
                optimal trajectories implies the non-smoothness of the cost function. Therefore, by
                using transversality arguments from Thom's Differential Topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Hirsch1">[40]</xref>,
                Pontryagin's Maximum Principle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Pontryagin1">[41]</xref>, and Non-smooth
                Analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Clarke1">[42]</xref>, an equivalence between the non-smoothness of the
                cost function and the presence of simultaneous inactivation of both agonistic and
                antagonistic muscles is established. The proposed model permits to simulate
                accurately the kinematics of fast vertical arm movements with one, two, and three
                degrees of freedom. Moreover, experimental observations actually show simultaneous
                silent periods on the electromyographic (EMG) signals of opposing muscles during
                fast arm movements.</p>

                        is sometimes referred to as the <italic>optimality criterion</italic>.</p>
                    <p>The aim is to find the control <italic>u</italic> (e.g., the torques) and the
                        corresponding admissible trajectory <italic>X</italic> that minimizes the
                        above integral cost. An efficient way to solve this kind of problem is to
                        use Pontryagin's Maximum Principle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Pontryagin1">[41]</xref>. A
                        statement of this principle is provided in the mathematical part of the
                            <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> Section.</p>
                    <p><italic>Remark 1.</italic> (1) A simplifying assumption is that the duration
                            <italic>T</italic> of the motion is fixed. This is not essential, since:
                        (i) Pontryagin's Maximum Principle also allows to deal with free
                        movement durations: the time <italic>T</italic> is then determined by a
                        supplementary condition of optimality, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Pontryagin1">[41]</xref>; (ii) as in
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Guigon1">[26]</xref>, one could search for the time
                        <italic>T</italic> that leads to a given amount of the integral cost. Here,
                        the latter approach is better suited because the optimal cost will be a
                        strictly decreasing function of <italic>T</italic> (see Theorem 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Berret1">[43]</xref>). (2) Movements are driven in the
                        configuration space, and positions of targets are defined in practice by
                        their coordinates in the Cartesian space. There is a one-to-one relationship
                        between target coordinates and limb configuration for 1-dof and 2-dof planar
                        movements, but not for 3-dof planar movements. In this case, an infinity of
                        final postures is compatible within the reach of a target in task-space.
                        Nevertheless a solution can be found once again by mean of
                        Pontryagin's Maximum Principle using <italic>transversality
                            conditions</italic>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Pontryagin1">[41]</xref>. (3) Since this study focuses on the command
                        of transient movements, the questions of transition between posture and
                        movement and stability of the final posture are not addressed. Nevertheless,
                        it will happen that we consider the dynamics of muscles in the Mathematical
                        Theory Subsection. In this case, the controls become motor orders sent by
                        the motoneurons to each muscle. Thus, the initial and final torques
                        necessary to maintain the arm at equilibrium are specified in this optimal
                        control problem.</p>
                    <p>In order to study the control of movements by means of optimal control
                        theory, various functions <italic>f</italic> were proposed previously in the
                        literature. These functions, such as the famous minimum jerk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Flash1">[16]</xref>
                        and minimum torque change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Uno1">[17]</xref>, were generally smooth functions.
                        Nevertheless in our case a non-smooth cost function appeared more suitable.</p>
                    <p>For actuated mechanical systems, the physical quantity that measures energy
                        is the work of forces. However, the work of a force pulling in the direction
                        arbitrarily defined as positive may cancel with the work of the force
                        pulling in the opposite direction. Thus, the <italic>absolute work</italic>
                        measures the energy expenditure of a movement. Indeed, the work of both the
                        agonistic and antagonistic muscles requires a consumption of energy,
                        provided by the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, a physiological process taking
                        place in muscle cells. The Mathematical Theory Subsection gives a precise
                        definition of the absolute work <italic>Aw</italic>, which can be expressed as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>but the function <italic>φ</italic> is <italic>not
                            smooth</italic>: it contains some “absolute values”
                        that are Lipschitz-continuous, but non-differentiable at
                        <italic>u</italic> = 0. For instance in the
                        1-dof case,
                            <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic>,<italic>u</italic>) = |<italic>yu</italic>|
                        where <italic>y</italic> is the angular velocity and <italic>u</italic> is
                        the net torque. The absolute work term counts the mechanical energy actually
                        spent to control the system (Σ).</p>
                    <p>Such a similar non-smooth cost function has been proposed by other authors
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Nishii1">[23]</xref> and thus it appears that the non-smoothness
                        of the cost function arises naturally in motion planning problems. It is
                        worthy to note that this is not an artificial mathematical construction.</p>
                    <p><italic>Remark 2.</italic> An intuitive (but different) reason for
                        considering non-smooth (or even discontinuous) cost functions in optimal
                        control studies of arm movements could be that the forces acting on a joint
                        result from distinct muscles.</p>
                    <p>In this study, the integral cost is assumed to have the general form:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>This expression represents a compromise between the absolute work
                        <italic>Aw</italic> and some other <italic>comfort term</italic> defined by
                        the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The terminology comfort term is purposely left vague. For
                        instance (non-exhaustive list), one may choose the acceleration squared (as
                        in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-BenItzhak1">[15]</xref>) or the torque squared (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Nishii1">[23]</xref>) for the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
                    <p>This additional term is not crucial. One could assume that the CNS only
                        minimizes the absolute work, but it seems to also minimize some integral
                        costs accounting for the smoothness or precision of the movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-BenItzhak1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Uno1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Harris1">[27]</xref>. While the definition of the mechanical
                        energy spent is well established, what should be the comfort term is more
                        subjective. It may suggest that the motor system would avoid large
                        accelerations, so as not to expose tendons and articulations to large jerks.</p>
                    <p>Here, in all examples and simulations, we will assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is proportional to the acceleration squared. For instance
                        in the 1-dof case, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <italic>α</italic> is a strictly positive
                        constant. In that case, the term <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is just the <italic>acceleration energy</italic> in the

                        simply <italic>inactivation</italic>) is an occurrence during a certain
                        strictly positive time-interval of an optimal trajectory corresponding to
                                <italic>u<sub>i</sub></italic> = 0
                        for some <italic>i</italic>, i.e., the <italic>i</italic>th control is zero
                        during this time-interval. A <italic>total inactivation</italic> is a
                        simultaneous inactivation of all controls.</p>
                    <p>Here, the controls (<italic>u<sub>i</sub></italic>)<italic>
                            <sub>i</sub>

                        are just the net torques applied at each joint.</p>
                    <p>An important theoretical result is what we call the <italic>Inactivation
                            Principle</italic>. In mathematics, a principle is more than just a
                        theorem. It is a statement of a general result that can be made true in
                        different contexts, or more precisely transformed into a theorem under
                        rather different types of technical assumptions.</p>

                        <italic>Equation 4</italic>
                        <italic> implies the presence of stable partial inactivation in all

                            (i.e., there is a time threshold for partial inactivation to occur).
                            Moreover, there are stable optimal trajectories that contain total
                            inactivation.</italic>
                    </p>
                    <p>This principle can be made very general and requires rather weak assumptions
                        (see Remark 3 in the Mathematical Theory Subsection). The proof relies on
                        arguments from non-smooth analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Clarke1">[42]</xref>, and is in the
                        spirit of singularity theory (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Golubitsky1">[44]</xref>).
                        Non-smoothness of the cost function implies the presence of inactivation
                        along optimal trajectories. This principle becomes a regular theorem under
                        the two following hypotheses: (1) the strict convexity of the cost function;
                        and (2) the change of sign of the optimal control. Although technical, the
                        convexity hypothesis is reasonable since: (a) most of the cost functions
                        considered in the literature are actually strictly convex; (b) the set of
                        strictly convex cost functions is very large; and (c) it ensures that what
                        is minimized has a unique minimum. The change of sign assumption is clearly
                        necessary (and actually observed), during fast point-to-point movements:
                        indeed, after the agonistic muscles have been activated to accelerate the
                        limb toward the target, they have to be deactivated in mid-flight and the
                        antagonistic muscles activated in turn, to brake the movement.</p>
                    <p>Notably, this theoretical result is also valid for much more detailed models,
                        which take into account viscoelastic properties of the muscular system and
                        which specify the terminal equilibrium signals (e.g., muscle forces that
                        compensate for elastic and gravitational forces, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Dornay1">[45]</xref>).</p>
                    <p>In particular, the Inactivation Principle applies in two important cases.
                        Firstly, it holds when considering that the net torque actually comes from
                        agonistic and antagonistic torques. The result is that both torques are zero
                        during the inactivation period. Secondly, this principle also holds when
                        assuming that the torques are produced by muscles with non-zero response
                        times, i.e., when the torques cannot immediately reach their maximum value.
                        For instance, when the control is the derivative of torques (called gradient
                        constraints case) or when the dynamics of muscles is modeled, the
                        inactivation period is still present for fast movements minimizing the cost
                        given in Equation 4.</p>
                    <p>These results are crucial for interpreting the inactivation on net torques as
                        simultaneous inactivation of both agonistic and antagonistic muscles in
                        practice.</p>
                    <p>A reciprocal question is whether partial or total inactivation could be
                        predicted by other kinds of cost functions, notably by the smooth cost
                        functions of the minimum jerk or torque change models.</p>
                    <p>Thus, does the presence of such periods of inactivation along optimal
                        trajectories determine specific properties of the cost function?</p>
                    <p>In answer to this question, the following proposition is demonstrated:</p>
                    <p><bold>
                            <italic>Necessity of non-smoothness.</italic>
                        </bold><italic> If some optimal trajectories contain inactivation, then the
                            term f in </italic><italic>Equation 3</italic><italic> cannot be smooth
                            w.r.t. u at u</italic> = 0.</p>
                    <p>This necessity of non-smoothness is stated in mathematical terms in the
                        Mathematical Theory Subsection and the proof is given in Supporting
                        Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000194.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
                    <p>More precisely, it can be shown without any special assumption on the system
                        (Σ), that the occurrence of total inactivation implies the generic
                        non-smoothness of cost functions given in Equation 3. For partial
                        inactivation, the set of terms <italic>f</italic> must be restricted to an
                        open set of cost functions, strictly convex with respect to
                        <italic>u</italic>. However, the set of strictly convex functions is very
                        large and contains most of the cost functions from the literature.</p>

                    <p>Notably, two important results hold in all instances of the model.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, in accordance with the Inactivation Principle, an
                            <italic>inactivation</italic> period is observed slightly after the time
                        of peak velocity during an upward movement (emphasized by a rectangular
                        frame in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g001">Figure 1</xref>).
                        During inactivation, the net torque acting at the shoulder is zero.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, speed profile is <italic>asymmetric</italic>, i.e., for an upward
                        movement, the acceleration duration is shorter than the deceleration
                        duration.</p>
                    <p>Although not illustrated, similar features appear during downward movements:
                        the inactivation occurs slightly before the time of peak velocity, and more
                        time is spent to accelerate the movement than to brake it.</p>
                    <p>Simulated 2-dof vertical arm movements are also depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Partial
                        inactivation, illustrating the Inactivation Principle, occurs at each joint
                        separately (elbow and shoulder). Moreover, fingertip velocity profiles are
                        asymmetric during upward and downward movements, as for the 1-dof case.
                        Since the response time of muscles was not modeled in this case, jumps on
                        the joint torques occur at the initial and final times, leading to non-zero
                        accelerations on the corresponding velocity profiles.</p>

                        movement direction (U versus D) upon final arm posture. Indeed, in a

                        posture of the arm among an infinite number of possibilities. The MD

                        both. Indeed, according to some authors, the difference in initial arm
                        configurations between upward and downward movements would determine
                        different inertial interactions between the upper arm and the forearm, which
                        would in turn cause the observed asymmetries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Biess1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Guigon1">[26]</xref>.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, similar directional asymmetries were observed during 1-dof

                    <p>In this 1-dof case, arm kinematic features in the sagittal plane were well
                        explained by the model. The MD recorded in this condition was on average
                        0.36±0.04 s. Since the fingertip path was necessarily a circular
                        arc, the TPV was the only significant measure. The experimental results
                        confirmed those of previous studies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The TPV parameter was
                        significantly smaller for upward than downward movements

                        vertical arm movements performed at slow speeds (movement durations longer
                        than 0.7 s), only flexor muscles were active: mainly the anterior deltoid,
                        which initiated the action during upward movements or braked the action
                        during downward movements. However, at fast speeds (movement durations
                        shorter than 0.7 s), extensor muscles were also active, since gravity alone
                        was not sufficient to accelerate downward and decelerate upward movements.</p>
                    <p>Here, simultaneous inactivity of muscles during rapid arm movements, near the
                        time of peak velocity of the fingertip, was specially examined, to check the
                        Inactivation Principle. From an experimental point of view, silent phases
                        should simultaneously appear on the EMG signals of opposing muscles, if the
                        proposed cost function is relevant at the muscular level (this is related to
                        the direct optimal control approach). Conversely, if such an inactivation is
                        checked, then, under the assumption that motor planning minimizes a certain
                        integral cost, one can conclude that this cost contains a term similar to
                        the absolute work. Thus, the presence of inactivation will imply certain
                        properties of the cost function (this is related to the inverse optimal
                        control approach).</p>
                    <p>Before considering new results, it is worthy to note that, in accordance with
                        the theoretical predictions, simultaneous inactivation may not appear in
                        practice if movements are too slow, too small, or involve muscles with large
                        response times. However, the appearance of inactivation is a phenomenon
                        theoretically independent of the following factors: gravity and number of
                        degrees of freedom of the motion.</p>
                    <p>The presence of inactivation periods was first investigated by measuring EMG
                        signals of different muscles during rapid pointing movements performed with
                        the arm fully extended (1-dof case). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows typical experimental
                        results.</p>
                    <p>The first and second columns show upward and downward movements,
                        respectively. Muscle silent phases are noticeable in this figure (emphasized
                        by a rectangular frame), in agreement with the theory. The main flexor and
                        extensor muscles acting on the shoulder joint are simultaneously inactive,
                        so that the net torque resulting from their actions is almost zero during
                        this short period.</p>
                    <p>For upward movements, simultaneous inactivation of all muscles appeared
                        clearly during a short time interval in the second half of the motion. In
                        some trials, the triceps remained slightly contracted, thus actively
                        maintaining the arm fully extended. For downward movements, an inactivation
                        also appeared, although less clearly, during the first half of the movement.
                        This simultaneous inactivation of all muscles lasted on average for
                        approximately 30 ms and was clearly observed in 85% of trials,
                        for upward movements. During this period the arm was almost in free fall, an
                        energetically costless movement. Notably, the activities of all muscles
                        stopped at the same instant. This synchronization suggests that muscle
                        inactivation results from an active optimal motor strategy. Taking into
                        account the electromechanical delay which elapses between the muscle bundle
                        depolarization and the actual force production, this period of inactivation
                        appeared as was expected from the theory (i.e., slightly before and after
                        the maximum velocity for upward and downward movements, respectively).</p>
                    <p>A typical muscular pattern for the vertical 2-dof case is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Here also,
                        simultaneous inactivation of pairs of muscles acting on each joint occurred.
                        Notice the lag between the inactivation at the elbow joint and at the
                        shoulder joint, illustrating that in the 2-dof case the inactivation
                        occurred at each joint separately. This is in agreement with the
                        corresponding numerical simulations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and the theoretical results
                        concerning partial inactivation.</p>
                    <p>The appearance of simultaneous inactivation was also checked in movements
                        starting from different initial arm configurations (i.e., starting from
                        various initial arm postures; targets T1-T3′ and targets
                        T1′-T3).</p>
                    <p>For both upward and downward movements, this inactivation phenomenon is shown
                        in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g005">Figure 5</xref>, where
                        muscular activities and simulated net torques can be compared.</p>
                    <p>To summarize, for the set of movements and conditions tested, both movement
                        kinematics and muscles activities confirm the relevancy of the theoretical
                        model.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>Limb movement planning theory, presented in this study, focuses on fast, open-loop,
                vertical arm movements, and is based upon the assumption that such movements are
                optimal with respect to a certain integral cost. Within this framework, the question
                was to characterize possible cost functions.</p>
            <sec id="s3a">
                <title>Direct Optimal Control</title>
                <p>A model that minimizes a cost based upon the absolute work (i.e., an energetic
                    optimality criterion) has been shown to allow simulating plausible arm movements
                    in the sagittal plane. This was checked by means of three relevant kinematic
                    features: fingertip path curvature, asymmetry of fingertip velocity profiles,
                    and final arm posture.</p>
                <p>Since this cost function is non-smooth, the Inactivation Principle can be stated:
                    for a large class of non-smooth cost functions, the net torque acting on a joint
                    is zero during a short period occurring around the mid-path movements that are
                    sufficiently rapid. This principle is also valid if a pair of
                    agonistic-antagonistic actuators is considered, exerting opposite torques. Each
                    of the torques is zero during an inactivation period which still appears if the
                    biomechanics of the muscles is considered, when response times are brief (a few
                    tens of milliseconds). For longer response times, complete inactivation is
                    progressively replaced by low-levels of muscular activities.</p>
                <p>Such quiet periods in the EMGs of opposing muscles were observed during fast arm
                    movements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g004">Figures 4</xref>,
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g006">6</xref>), which suggests that this
                    optimality criterion is suitable.</p>
                <p>The suitability of a similar non-smooth cost function was also found for animals
                    in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Nishii2">[46]</xref>. The author concludes that the locomotor
                    pattern of legged animals is optimized with respect to an energetic cost based
                    upon the “positive work” of forces.</p>
                <p>However, the direct optimal control approach does not prove that the motor
                    planning process actually minimizes energy expenditure. It just shows that such
                    a criterion is plausible because it provides realistic behavior. Indeed, several
                    other cost functions or theories may lead to similar results.</p>
                <p>For instance, muscle inactivation was also interpreted as a consequence of the
                    Equilibrium Point hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Feldman1">[47]</xref>. According to this interpretation, the
                    threshold position control and the principle of minimal interaction would,
                    together, determine the “Global EMG minima” which appear
                    simultaneously in all muscles during rhythmic movements, near the point of
                    direction reversals. Nevertheless, in the theory proposed here, inactivation is
                    somewhat different: it appears near the time of peak velocity, and the precise
                    interval of inactivity may be different at different joints. Moreover,
                    inactivation is still predicted even if biomechanics of muscles, inertia and
                    external forces are taken into account, which is not the case in Equilibrium
                    Point theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Feldman1">[47]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, it could be also considered that the CNS simply activates and
                    deactivates the muscles, explicitly determining inactivation phases. However,
                    this would be an argument against our main assumption that the brain tries to
                    minimize some costs. Here, under this assumption, inactivation provides
                    information on the cost function.</p>

                <title>Inverse Optimal Control</title>
                <p>The theoretical results also allow us to characterize the non-smoothness of the
                    cost function once the simultaneous inactivation of opposing muscles is measured
                    in practice, during movements presumed as optimal.</p>
                <p>Using mathematical transversality arguments from differential topology we proved
                    that the minimization of an absolute-work-like cost during arm movements is a
                    necessary condition to obtain inactivation phases along optimal trajectories. In
                    other words, assuming that human movements are optimal with respect to a certain
                    integral cost, the simultaneous inactivation of muscles that we observed
                    provides evidence for an absolute-work-like cost.</p>
                <p>Notably, this simultaneous inactivation of opposing muscles, which is a singular
                    phenomenon, cannot be predicted by models using smooth cost functions, such as
                    the minimum endpoint variance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Harris1">[27]</xref>, the minimum jerk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Flash1">[16]</xref>, or the minimum
                    torque-change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Uno1">[17]</xref>. Those models would predict deviations from
                    “zero torque”, whereas singularity analysis proves the
                    existence of an exact inactivation period.</p>
                <p>Simultaneous inactivation periods also appeared on intra-muscular EMG traces
                    recorded from monkeys when performing horizontal arm movements (see Figure 5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Flament1">[48]</xref>).
                    These findings suggest that the minimization of the energy expenditure may be a
                    basic motor principle for both humans and animals.</p>
                <p>It should be emphasized that such an equivalence between specific movement
                    features and well-identified properties of the cost function is not common in
                    studies using optimal control approach for movement planning.</p>

                <title>Validity of the Model</title>
                <p>The simulated movements replicated the experimental records accurately, except,
                    obviously, for the bang-bang command signals which provide non-zero
                    accelerations at the beginning and end of the movement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The patterns of motor command are
                    actually smoothed by the biomechanical characteristics (low-pass filters) of the
                    muscles. As pointed out by several authors some models have been rejected
                    hastily due to the lack of biological validity of their optimal solutions
                    (bang-bang behaviors) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-BenItzhak1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Engelbrecht1">[49]</xref>. This problem
                    was also discussed in a study where the authors used a similar non-smooth cost
                    function based upon the “positive work” of forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Nishii1">[23]</xref>.
                    They noticed that the abrupt velocity profiles predicted by their model were
                    non-realistic but might actually be smoothed by modeling muscles dynamics. In
                    fact, depending on the precision of modeling, different conclusions may be
                    drawn. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g001">Figure 1</xref> where gradient constraints on the torques lead to smoother
                    motor patterns whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g010">Figure
                    10</xref> shows solutions in a simpler case of torque control. In the first case
                    the acceleration is continuous while in the second case the acceleration jumps
                    at the initial and final times (to make the transition between posture and
                    movement). Nevertheless, in both cases, inactivation is present and fingertip
                    velocity profiles reproduce the experimental directional asymmetries. Thus,
                    these relevant features of movements are not affected by such changes in
                    modeling. The reason for not systematically considering more precise levels of
                    modeling is twofold. Firstly, it causes important additional computational
                    difficulties, and secondly, many more parameters, which are not always
                    well-known, appear in the model.</p>
                <p>Here, the model depends on a few parameters. Firstly, the maximum torque that can
                    be developed by each muscle is finite. In particular, this determines the
                    shortest possible movement duration in order to complete the pointing task.
                    Nevertheless these maximum torques did not seem to be reached in practice (at
                    least during the movements tested here) so that their precise values were not
                    important for the present study. Secondly, the weighting parameters that appear
                    in the cost could depend on the individual and the task goal. However, they are
                    not critical with respect to the qualitative behavior of the optimal solutions
                    and, although their values could be discussed, the simulations obtained using
                    this model were accurate for a large range of these parameters. Importantly, the
                    whole theory holds without precise constraints on these parameters. A first
                    example is given by the strongly consistent kinematic difference in the 1-dof
                    case for movements performed in the upward versus the downward direction. For
                    instance, for an upward movement (1-dof, 45° and 400 ms), the relative
                    time to peak velocity (TPV) ranged between 0.43 and 0.5 for weighting parameters
                    ranging between 0 and 10. For the corresponding downward movement, TPV ranged
                    between 0.57 and 0.5. The classical models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Flash1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Nakano1">[18]</xref>
                    were not able to reproduce this directional difference in the speed profiles
                    observed in vertical arm movement executed with 1-dof <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Gentili1">[37]</xref>. Moreover, it has
                    been found that this difference disappeared for movements performed in the
                    horizontal plane, either in upright or reclined postures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Gentili1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Seach1">[38]</xref>.
                    This behavior is experimentally well established and can be easily verified with
                    simulations. Interestingly, it is predicted by our optimality criterion,
                    whatever the choice of the tuning parameters. A second example concerns the
                    final posture selected by the model. The exact terminal limb configuration
                    depends on these weighting parameters. However, we tested several instances of
                    the model, for weighting parameters ranging between 0.05 and 1. In all
                    instances, the simulated terminal postures were in the range of those measured
                    in practice.</p>
                <p>In order to check the validity of the present model, its predictions were also
                    compared with well-known experimental findings, without trying to fit the data.
                    The tuning parameters used are defined in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> Section.</p>
                <p>Movement curvature is known to depend on movement duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Papaxanthis2">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Pellegrini1">[50]</xref>. Here, the 2-dof model predicts a change in the
                    fingertip path curvature (FPC) when movement duration varies. For the movements
                    tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the FPC
                    ranged between 0.18 and 0.23 for movement durations of between 0.2 s and 1 s.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the final postures have been found to be invariant with respect to the
                    speed of the movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Nishikawa1">[8]</xref> and to the addition of a mass of 600 g on the
                    forearm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Hermens1">[9]</xref>. Here, in the 3-dof case, the final posture does
                    not significantly vary with movement duration. For instance, the final postures
                    changed by less than 3° (maximum change at each joint) while the
                    movement duration ranged between 0.2 s and 1 s (tested for U and D movements
                    that appeared in the left column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Also, adding a mass of 600 g to the forearm did not
                    change the simulated final limb configuration: the model predicted less than
                    0.5° of variation at each joint.</p>
                <p>In the proposed model, the final posture is selected as the final limb
                    configuration that minimizes the amount of the compromise
                        <italic>Aw</italic>/<italic>Ae</italic> necessary to bring the finger to the
                    target. Movements directed toward a single target were tested for various
                    starting configurations of the arm. It resulted in changes in the final posture
                    (about 1°, 10°, and 15° of variability at the shoulder,
                    the elbow, and the wrist levels, respectively). Thus, the final posture depends
                    on the initial configuration of the arm, in agreement with experimental results
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Soechting2">[21]</xref>.</p>
                <p>It must be noted that the minimum torque-change and the minimum force-change
                    models failed to predict the curvature of movements when antigravity torques
                    were implied in the optimization process, according to Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Soechting3">[33]</xref>. In contrast,
                    the finger trajectory for a 2-dof arm predicted by our model (for the same
                    movements of duration equal to 400 ms) was quite realistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This was also in agreement with
                    the experimental finger paths observed in Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Atkeson1">[6]</xref> for other movements

                    to be well-suited for a large set of movements and may, thus, motivate future
                    extensions of the model to 3-dimensional movements.</p>

                <title>Integration of Gravity</title>
                <p>Several investigators have proposed that the CNS optimizes inertial forces and
                    compensates gravitational forces at each instant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Biess1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Guigon1">[26]</xref>.
                    Static and dynamic forces were assumed to be controlled separately. Although
                    plausible, this idea is hardly compatible with several experimental results. For
                    instance, when considering an upward movement in the sagittal plane performed
                    with the arm fully-extended (1-dof case), according to such a viewpoint,
                    agonistic (anti-gravitational) muscles should be active throughout the movement
                    (corresponding to a tonic component of EMGs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Flanders1">[31]</xref>. In this case, a
                    muscular activity counteracting the gravity would be necessary to continuously
                    maintain the arm, as if it were at equilibrium at each instant, and would be
                    noticeable in EMGs. However, EMG recordings showed that the activities of the
                    agonistic muscles were quasi-null near the time of peak velocity suggesting,
                    thus, that no muscle was acting against gravity at this instant. Moreover, it
                    may explain why, after subtracting the tonic activity from rectified EMG data,
                    some authors obtained negative phasic activities of some muscles (e.g., see
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-dAvella1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Flanders2">[52]</xref>). Rather than
                    resulting from errors in the evaluation of the tonic component of muscles
                    activity, the gravitational and inertial forces could just be integrated into
                    the same motor plan, within the minimization of energy expenditure. In that
                    case, an explicit separation between tonic and phasic activities of muscles
                    could be impossible, at least for fast movements.</p>
                <p>It must be noted that separating static and dynamic forces is not the same as
                    separating posture and movement. Indeed, static and dynamic forces are present
                    during posture maintaining. Neuro-anatomical and experimental evidences for
                    distinct controls of posture and movement were reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Kurtzer1">[53]</xref>. Thus, the present
                    results concerning inactivation do not contradict the hypothesis that, while
                    maintaining posture, anti-gravity control seems to be tightly related to the
                    muscular system's viscoelastic properties (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Loram1">[54]</xref> for a study of
                    equilibrium control during quiet standing). This problem was not addressed here
                    since we focused on the control of the transient phase of fast movements.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>In conclusion, from a methodological point of view, the novelty of the present
                    work is to introduce a hypothetical-deductive approach in studies focusing on
                    motor planning of arm movements. The possible existence of the inactivation
                    phenomenon was deduced from a mathematical analysis which aimed to reproduce
                    directional asymmetries in arm movements performed in the sagittal plane. Then,
                    the presence of these inactivation periods produced by the model was confirmed
                    by the EMG signals obtained from experimental data. The mathematical analysis
                    showed that this inactivation was a necessary and sufficient condition for the
                    minimization of an absolute-work-like cost. As far as we know, this is the first
                    time that such a condition has been proved in studies investigating optimality
                    principles in human movement. These results suggest that, considering that
                    inactivation is a short and quite singular phenomenon, more attention should be
                    paid to this specific movement feature in future studies.</p>

                        apparatus and the pointing movements are illustrated in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g003">Figure 3</xref>. In all
                        experimental conditions, participants were instructed to execute
                        visually-guided, fast arm movements towards the targets without final

                        consisted of a small sphere of 5 mm in diameter). The duration of these
                        movements was about 0.4 s. In order to familiarize themselves with the motor
                        tasks and the experimental apparatus, they were trained (5 movements in each
                        experimental condition) by means of a metronome set at 0.4 s. During the
                        experiments, a single data acquisition file consisted of an upward-downward
                        sequence of pointing movements between paired targets. A significant pause
                        (&gt;1 second) was requested between two pointing movements.
                        Participants performed 10 trials in each condition (i.e., a total of 60
                        pointing movements per participant). After data analysis, all pointing
                        movement durations were found to range between 0.3 s and 0.5 s and the final
                        precision was similar (error less than 3 cm) between conditions. Thus, all

                    <p>The system used to capture arm movements was an optoelectronic device
                        (SMART-BTS, Milan, Italy). Nine cameras were used to capture the movement of
                        four retro reflective markers (15 mm in diameter), placed at well-defined
                        anatomical locations on the right side of the body (acromial process,
                        humeral lateral condyle, ulnar styloid process, and the apex of the index
                        finger). Surface electrodes which captured muscular activity were placed on
                        the following muscles: the biceps, the triceps, the anterior deltoid, and
                        the posterior deltoid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g003">Figure 3</xref> for an illustration of the placement of electrodes and
                        markers). Two silver-chloride surface electrodes of 10-mm diameter were
                        positioned on the belly of the muscle (with the skin previously shaved and
                        cleaned) with an inter-electrode distance (center to center) of 2 cm. The
                        reference electrode was placed on the left ankle. The placement of surface
                        electrodes was then checked by asking subjects to produce isometric
                        contractions at each joint and in various directions. Sampling frequencies
                        were 120 Hz and 960 Hz for kinematics and EMGs, respectively.</p>

                        (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Recorded kinematic signals were low-pass filtered
                        using a digital fifth-order Butterworth filter at a cut-off frequency of 10
                        Hz. Finger movement onset was defined as the moment at which linear
                        tangential velocity of the index fingertip exceeded 5% of its
                        peak and the end of movement as the point at which the same velocity dropped
                        below the 5% threshold. Movement duration (MD) was defined as the
                        time-interval between the onset and the offset times.</p>
                    <p>The following kinematic parameters were then calculated: the relative time to
                        peak velocity (TPV), defined as the ratio of acceleration duration to total
                        movement duration, and the fingertip path curvature (FPC), defined as the
                        ratio of maximum path deviation from a straight line connecting the initial
                        and the final points of the trajectory. Both FPC and TPV parameters were

                    <p>EMG data were band-pass filtered (20–400 Hz). The root mean square
                        (RMS) of EMG data was computed over 5 ms intervals. The electromechanical
                        delay was evaluated by synchronizing the first agonistic onset time with the
                        onset time of the fingertip. The onset time of an EMG burst was defined as
                        the moment at which the smoothed RMS signal (low-pass filtered at 5 Hz)
                        exceeded 10% of its peak. A muscle was considered as inactive
                        when the corresponding RMS was below 10% of its maximum value.
                        Individual, rather than averaging, EMG inspections were performed because of

                    <p>We consider mechanical systems with generalized coordinates <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and Lagrangian:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>M</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is the inertia
                        matrix (which we assume to be symmetric and invertible) and
                            <italic>V</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is the potential energy (here due
                        to gravity).</p>
                    <p>We divide the external generalized forces acting on the system into two
                        components: the first one, denoted by
                            <italic>τ</italic> = <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>)<italic>u</italic>,
                        resulting from the input <italic>u</italic> and the second one, denoted by
                            <italic>N</italic>(<italic>x</italic>, <italic>x</italic> ˙)
                        representing any other forces acting on the system, mainly friction forces.</p>
                    <p>We assume that the control acts on every degree of freedom, that is, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is invertible.
                        Moreover, in the exactly-fully-actuated case that we consider first, we
                        assume to directly control each degree of freedom, that is
                            <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) = <italic>Id</italic>.
                        This is assumption is always verified up to some feedback. Indeed, we can
                        always add a “feedback pre-compensator” of the type
                            <italic>τ</italic> = <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>)<italic>u</italic>.
                        From a theoretical point of view it is just a change of variable. From a
                        practical point of view, it requires the knowledge of the state
                        <italic>x</italic> of the system, or some estimation of it.</p>
                    <p>The equations of motion are given by substituting the value of
                        <italic>L</italic> into Lagrange's equation,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>They are exactly of the form given by Equation 1, with<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e024" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where the Coriolis matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is defined as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>Then, in order to get the control system, we set

                            <italic>y</italic>) = (<italic>x</italic>,

                    <p>We can also write the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian formalism.</p>
                    <p>We define the Legendre transform: (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>x</italic>
                            ˙)↦(<italic>x</italic>, <italic>p</italic>), by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and we introduce the Hamiltonian
                            <italic>h</italic>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>p</italic>) of the problem:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Then, we get the equations of the motion via the
                        characteristic field of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>As a consequence, the work <italic>w</italic> of external
                        forces,
                            <italic>w</italic> = ∫(<italic>τ</italic>+<italic>N</italic>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>p</italic>))<italic>dx</italic>
                        is identically equal to the variation of the Hamiltonian:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>In particular, if there is no friction
                        (<italic>N</italic> = 0), the variation of
                        the Hamiltonian is equal to the work of controlled forces
                        <italic>τ</italic> during the motion.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the work of controlled forces is:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Here, the work of controlled forces is counted algebraically:
                        a motion in one direction followed by a motion in the opposite direction may
                        give zero work.</p>
                    <p>In the following, we will consider the absolute work <italic>Aw</italic> of
                        controlled forces, which corresponds to the energy spent to control the system:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e033" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>In coordinates

                            <italic>A</italic> ˙<italic>w</italic> is the function:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>The cost we will minimize is a compromise of the form:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e035" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>in which
                        <italic>M</italic>(<italic>X</italic>,<italic>u</italic>) is a comfort term
                        that for technical reasons we will assume to be smooth and strictly convex
                        w.r.t. the control <italic>u</italic> (<bold>assumption A</bold>).</p>
                    <p><italic>Remark 3.</italic> (1) More generally we could consider an integral
                        cost of the form:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e036" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e037" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>φ</italic> is smooth and
                            <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>A</italic>
                            ˙<italic>w</italic>(<italic>u</italic>), <italic>X</italic>,
                            <italic>u</italic>) is strictly convex w.r.t. <italic>u</italic> (2) The
                        assumption of strict convexity, although technical, is natural: it implies
                        that the function <italic>φ</italic> has a unique minimum with
                        respect to <italic>u</italic>. The weakest possible hypothesis to obtain the
                        Inactivation Principle (see Theorem 2) is precisely that
                        <italic>φ</italic> has a unique minimum w.r.t. <italic>u</italic>.
                        In that case, existence of a minimizing trajectory will not be guaranteed
                        (it has to be assumed). Assuming strict convexity is a way to assume both a
                        unique minimum w.r.t. <italic>u</italic> and the existence of a minimizing
                        trajectory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Berret1">[43]</xref> for a precise proof of this last fact).
                        (3) Due to the absolute work term, the proposed cost function is non-smooth
                        (non-differentiable) w.r.t. <italic>u</italic> at
                        <italic>u</italic> = 0. However it is
                        Lipschitz-continuous at
                        <italic>u</italic> = 0. This slight
                        difference is important in our study. (4) In fact the typical non-smoothness
                        (Lipschitz) is that of the absolute value function. But it can be easily
                        taken into account the fact that “negative work” costs
                        less than “positive work” (this last fact was stressed
                        by a referee): in place of the function |<italic>u</italic>|, one has to
                        consider the Lipschitz function
                        <italic>λ</italic>|<italic>u</italic>| for
                        <italic>u</italic>&gt;0 and
                        <italic>μ</italic>|<italic>u</italic>| for
                        <italic>u</italic>≤0. We decided here to limit ourselves to the
                        “non-weighted” absolute work, for the sake of simplicity
                        in exposition.</p>
                    <p>We now define our optimal control problem. We consider the following
                        controlled system (Σ):<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

                    <p>Then, the optimal control problem is:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>The following theorem proves that this problem is well-posed.</p>

                        <italic>u</italic> of both the cost function and the system (Σ). The
                        idea is that a minimizing sequence of trajectories converges for some
                        compactness reason of Ascoli type, and the limit is a trajectory of the
                        system by convexity. General results of this type may be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Lee1">[56]</xref>.</p>

                        sensorimotor system penalizes large accelerations (thanks to learning) in
                        order to protect articulations and tendons. Such an optimality criterion was

                    <p>In the 1-dof case, this weighting parameter was set to 0.25. We set

                    <p>For both Examples 1 and 2 it will be interesting to consider the
                        “small angles assumption”, i.e., the linearization of
                        the system around some reference angles and zero velocity.</p>
                    <p>Since in the paper we only consider pointing movements, i.e., going (in short
                        time <italic>T</italic>) from some initial condition (<italic>x</italic>,
                            <italic>x</italic>
                                ˙) = (<italic>x<sub>s</sub></italic>,
                        0) to some terminal condition (<italic>x<sub>t</sub></italic>,0) (both
                        equilibria of the system), this assumption corresponds to the fact that
                                <italic>x<sub>t</sub></italic> is close to
                        <italic>x<sub>s</sub></italic>.</p>
                    <p>With this assumption, both examples become much simpler, as expressed by
                        Equations 14 and 15 below, and calculations can be done explicitly. Without
                        it, some numerical steps remain. Nevertheless in these numerical steps it is
                        of great interest to know a priori the qualitative scenario for the optimal
                        controls, which is of course the same as with the small angles assumption.
                        Thus, although the small angles assumption may be irrelevant from an
                        experimental point of view, it is useful for finding the optimal solution of
                        the complete systems given in Examples 1 and 2.</p>

                        and the linearized system around (<italic>x<sub>s</sub></italic>,0) is the
                        following standard linear control system:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e055" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(14)</label></disp-formula></p>

                        <italic>x</italic>

                        our Hamiltonian <italic>h</italic>, with
                        <italic>λ</italic> = 0, can be

                    <p>Note also that, for our mechanical systems, <italic>φ</italic> is
                        linear with respect to <italic>u</italic>, and <italic>u</italic> enters via

                    <p>Therefore the condition of maximum of the Hamiltonian for an abnormal

                    <p>A rough statement of the Inactivation Principle is as follows: provided that

                        (compared to the minimum time <italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>), then there
                        is partial inactivation along an optimal trajectory minimizing a compromise
                            <italic>J</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) between the absolute work and a
                        comfort term (<italic>J</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) of the form given by
                        Equation 7, or more generally Equation 8). Moreover, simultaneous periods of
                        inactivation of all controls may appear in a stable way (stable w.r.t small
                        smooth perturbations of the cost, or of the system).</p>

                                <italic>I</italic>(<italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic>), since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <italic>λ</italic> are both different from
                        zero. Hence, since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> changes sign at <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic>, it takes a
                        certain strictly positive amount of time to cross
                                <italic>I</italic>(<italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic>). Then <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> remains exactly equal to zero during some nontrivial time
                        interval. This is partial inactivation. Continuing, we take an arbitrary
                            <italic>X</italic> = (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>),
                        with <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic>≠0 for all
                            <italic>i</italic> = 1,…,<italic>n</italic>
                        and
                        <italic>λ</italic> = −1.
                        We denote by (<italic>M</italic>(<italic>x</italic>)<sup>−1</sup>)<italic>
                            <sub>i</sub>
                        </italic> the <italic>i</italic>th column of the invertible matrix
                            <italic>M</italic>(<italic>x</italic>)<sup>−1</sup>. Then, for
                            <italic>u</italic> = 0, we compute the
                        set <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If we set
                            <italic>P</italic> = (<italic>p</italic>,<italic>q</italic>),
                        then due to the fact that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we can choose <italic>q</italic> in order that 0 be

                        by construction that the extremals starting from this point
                            (<italic>X</italic>,<italic>P</italic>,0), if continuous, have total

                        </bold> The lemma 11 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Gauthier2">[61]</xref> states the following. Consider a function
                            <italic>f</italic>: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>X</italic> is a manifold and
                        <italic>f</italic> is continuous, with the additional property that for each
                        compact <italic>K</italic> ⊂ <italic>X</italic>, the restriction <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is proper. Then, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a well defined mapping, continuous over
                        <italic>X</italic>. Examination of the proof of this result shows that it
                        holds also for <italic>f</italic>: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We apply this lemma to our Hamiltonian
                        <italic>h</italic>. Due to assumption A and to the fact that
                            <italic>λ</italic>&lt;0,
                            <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>,<italic>u</italic>) = <italic>h</italic>(<italic>X</italic>(<italic>t</italic>),<italic>P</italic>(<italic>t</italic>),<italic>u</italic>)
                        is a strictly concave function of <italic>u</italic>. Moreover, it is
                        continuous since <italic>X</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and
                            <italic>P</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) are continuous functions of
                            <italic>t</italic>. Let
                        <italic>u</italic>(<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>) be a discontinuity value
                        of the optimal control <italic>u</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). It means that
                        we can find a sequence
                            <italic>t<sub>n</sub></italic>→<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>
                        such that
                            <italic>u</italic>(<italic>t<sub>n</sub></italic>)→<italic>u</italic>
                            ˆ≠<italic>u</italic>(<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>).
                        Applying the above-mentioned lemma to
                            −<italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>,<italic>u</italic>),
                        where <italic>u</italic> here is the variable <italic>ν</italic> in
                        the lemma, we get that
                            <italic>t</italic>→−<italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>,<italic>u</italic>(<italic>t</italic>))
                        is a continuous map. But the minimum being unique, this contradicts the
                        assumption
                            <italic>u</italic>(<italic>t<sub>n</sub></italic>)→<italic>u</italic>
                            ˆ≠<italic>u</italic>(<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>).</p>
                    <p>Note that in general, optimal control may not be continuous: consider Example
                        1 with
                            <italic>T</italic> = <italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>
                        (the minimum time). Since there is no abnormal trajectory, the optimal
                        control (which is also the minimum-time control) jumps between the bounds
                            <italic>u</italic><sup>−</sup> and
                            <italic>u</italic><sup>+</sup>.</p>
                    <p>This means that assumption (<italic>H</italic><sub>1</sub>) holds provided
                        that the optimal trajectory is regular, which is the case in general when
                            <italic>T</italic>&gt;<italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>. This is
                        verifiable for instance for a cost of type compromise
                            <italic>Aw</italic>/<italic>Ae</italic>.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, consider a singular extremal with
                            <italic>T</italic>&gt;<italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>. Then this
                        extremal corresponds to an extremal of the minimum-time problem. Thus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the cost of the singular extremal and the optimal cost
                        of the minimum-time problem, respectively. Since the value of minimum cost
                        is a strictly decreasing function of <italic>T</italic> on the time interval
                            [<italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>,+∞[
                        (see Theorem 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Berret1">[43]</xref>), there is a contradiction.</p>
                    <p>Assumption (<italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>) (the change of sign of the
                        optimal control) is also true in general. This can be proved in the
                        following way.</p>
                    <p>The input-state mapping<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>is continuous for the *-weak topology over <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Gauthier1">[59]</xref>. When
                            <italic>T</italic>→<italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub> from above,
                        we consider the restriction <italic>u<sub>T</sub></italic> of the optimal
                        control to the interval
                        [0,<italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>]. This defines a
                        sequence of controls that (by boundedness) we can assume to be
                        *-weak convergent to some control
                            <italic>u</italic>*(<italic>t</italic>). By construction, this
                            <italic>u</italic>*(<italic>t</italic>) is a minimum time
                        control. Since <italic>u<sub>T</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is
                        continuous, if <italic>T</italic> is close enough to
                            <italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>,
                            <italic>u<sub>T</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) has sign changes
                        close to the sign changes of the minimum-time control
                            <italic>u</italic>*(<italic>t</italic>).</p>
                    <p>The fact that the minimum time control
                        <italic>u</italic>*(<italic>t</italic>) has changes of sign can be
                        checked directly.</p>
                    <p>For instance, in Example 1, minimum time control can only commute between the
                        values
                            <italic>u</italic><sup>−</sup>,<italic>u</italic><sup>+</sup>.
                        These values are large enough. Hence if there is no commutation, the control
                        is constant and large. Therefore <italic>y</italic>
                        ˙(<italic>t</italic>) has constant sign and
                            <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) cannot go from zero to zero.</p>
                    <p><italic>Remark 4.</italic> The previous reasoning shows that in general
                        inactivation is located around instants that are close to the instants where
                        the minimum time-control changes sign (commutes). This reasoning also shows
                        that inactivation occurs automatically for a duration <italic>T</italic> of
                        the motion sufficiently close to the minimum time
                        <italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>. This is coherent with practical
                        observations showing that for larger <italic>T</italic>, simultaneous
                        inactivation of agonistic and antagonistic muscles disappear.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of this section is to show that, for the occurrence of
                        inactivation in optimal trajectories, it is necessary that the minimized

                        It is the usual topology in this setting. If we restrict to a fixed compact
                        set, it is equivalent to consider the usual topology of
                            <italic>C</italic><sup>∞</sup> convergence over this compact
                        set. (2) The fact that the bad set (the set of exceptional cost functions
                        for which inactivation can be optimal) has codimension infinity (i.e.,
                        codimension larger than <italic>m</italic>, for all <italic>m</italic>)
                        means that the good set is extremely large.</p>
                    <p>The proof of this theorem is given in Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000194.s001">Text
                        S1</xref>).</p>
                    <p>The gist of the proof is the following: we assume that the cost function is
                        smooth, and we show that (up to exceptional and unstable cases for the
                        cost), the only optimal trajectories that are constant can be either
                        equilibria trajectories or bang trajectories (i.e., trajectories lying in
                        the boundary of the control set). This is done by using transversality
                        arguments: Thom's transversality theorem simply states in precise
                        mathematical terms that, “generically”, mathematical
                        objects are in “general position”. For instance (see
                        Page 67 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000194-Hirsch1">[40]</xref>), consider the following statement: if
                            <italic>f</italic> is a continuously differentiable function,
                        “almost all” horizontal lines are nowhere tangent to the
                        graph of <italic>f</italic>. This statement illustrates a type of reasoning
                        that is common in differential topology. Transversality gives the necessary
                        framework to justify such kinds of properties.</p>
                    <p>Roughly speaking, for inactivation to be optimal in a stable way (i.e.,
                        remain optimal while not overly perturbing the cost to be minimized) then it
                        is necessary that the cost function <italic>f</italic> is non-smooth at
                            <italic>u</italic> = 0.</p>
                    <p>A similar theorem holds also for partial inactivation (inactivation of one
                        control at least, on some nontrivial time-interval). But in that case, for
                        technical reasons, we have to restrict to the open set <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of <italic>C</italic><sup>∞</sup>-smooth
                        functions all <italic>f</italic> that are moreover strictly convex with
                        respect to <italic>u</italic>. Here and only here, by strictly convex, we
                        mean the assumption that the Hessian of <italic>f</italic> w.r.t.
                        <italic>u</italic> is everywhere positive-definite. This assumption clearly
                        defines an open subset <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the Whitney topology.</p>

                    <p>Now the cost function is not differentiable anymore with respect to the state
                        (in place of the control in previous sections). Therefore, Clarke's

                    <p>Also, for similar reasons as in a previous subsection, the abnormal extremals
                        may be excluded: maximality of the Hamiltonian for non-bang trajectories
                        implies that <italic>r</italic> is identically zero, which implies, with two

                        respectively are also identically zero. Total adjoint vector is zero, which
                        contradicts the maximum principle. Hence we may assume
                        <italic>λ</italic> = 1.</p>
                    <p>We assume that the gradient constraints
                            <italic>ν</italic><sup>−</sup> and
                            <italic>ν</italic><sup>+</sup> are large enough for the
                        optimal control to be of the following type: gradient constraints which are
                        active only at the beginning and at the end of the motion. If we refer to
                        the scenario occurring in 1-dof case, this should be what happens: without
                        the gradient constraints, the gradient is never large. Then, there will be
                        saturation of the gradient constraints only because of the jumps at the
                        beginning and at the end of the motion. Numerical computations confirm this
                        scenario, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000194-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
                    <p>For instance, consider that
                                <italic>x<sub>t</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>x<sub>s</sub></italic>,
                        i.e., an upward movement. Then, to connect (in optimal way) the source

                        the strategy must be as follows:
                            <italic>ν</italic> = <italic>ν</italic><sup>+</sup>,

                            <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>&lt;<italic>t</italic>≤<italic>T</italic>.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, inside the interval

                        the Hamiltonian is maximum w.r.t. <italic>ν</italic> and we must

                        <italic>r</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = 0.
                        Therefore <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

                    <p>Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we conclude:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>This equation was exactly the cause of the presence of

                        considering that two opposing torques act at each joint (one agonistic and

                        of the Theoretical Analysis Subsection.</p>
                    <p>For this analysis, we consider that

                    <p>For the case of net torque <italic>u</italic>, the cost that we consider is
                        the compromise given by Equation 4, i.e.,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>with:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>It means that, for agonistic-antagonistic torques, we shall minimize:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>Aw</italic>′ is the total absolute

                    <p>Firstly, let us assume that <italic>u</italic><sub>1</sub>,
                            <italic>u</italic><sub>2</sub> minimize <italic>J</italic>′,
                        with optimal value <italic>J</italic>′*. Consider
                            <italic>u</italic> = <italic>u</italic><sub>1</sub>−<italic>u</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p>
                    <p>Clearly, <italic>u</italic> applied to the system:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e156" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(22)</label></disp-formula>and, <italic>u</italic><sub>1</sub>,
                        <italic>u</italic><sub>2</sub> applied to the system:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e157" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(23)</label></disp-formula>produce identical <italic>x</italic>-trajectories.</p>
                    <p>Therefore,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>This shows that the minimum

                    <p>Conversely, assume that <italic>u</italic> attains the minimum
                        <italic>J</italic>* of <italic>J</italic>(<italic>u</italic>). We
                        define <italic>u</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>u</italic><sub>2</sub> from
                            <italic>u</italic> as follows (for

                    <p>Again
                            <italic>u</italic><sub>1</sub>−<italic>u</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>u</italic>.
                        Hence applying <italic>u</italic> to Equation 22 produces the same
                        <italic>x</italic>-trajectory as applying
                            <italic>u</italic><sub>1</sub>−<italic>u</italic><sub>2</sub>
                        to Equation 23. Therefore, by definition of <italic>u</italic><sub>1</sub>,
                            <italic>u</italic><sub>2</sub>, we have:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>It means that:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e161" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(25)</label></disp-formula>which implies that
                            <italic>J</italic>′*≤<italic>J</italic>*.
                        It is now clear that
                            <italic>J</italic>′* = <italic>J</italic>*,
                        and also by Equation 25 the minimum is reached by in Equation 24.</p>
                    <p>Notably, by construction, the torques
                            <italic>u</italic><sub>1<italic>i</italic></sub>,
                                <italic>u</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub> have simultaneous

                        assume some dynamics on each muscle. For the sake of simplicity, we assume a
                        first order dynamics on the muscles, but this restriction is not crucial.
                        Also, we present the results in the 1-dof case
                        (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and we make the

                    <p>For this, we use the a priori fact (which is checked numerically) that, as in

                    <p>Due to the first order linear dynamics on the muscles, and the constraints

                        asymptotically. Therefore, the terminal condition <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000194.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is impossible, i.e., the antagonistic torque cannot go
