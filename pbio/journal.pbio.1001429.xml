        <p>The prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC is inhibited by divalent cations, which occupy a specific extracellular site and interfere with channel gating.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The modulation of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) by divalent cations is believed to play an important role in their regulation in a physiological context. Ions such as calcium or zinc influence the activity of pLGIC neurotransmitter receptors by binding to their extracellular domain and either potentiate or inhibit channel activation. Here we have investigated by electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography the effect of divalent ions on ELIC, a close prokaryotic pLGIC homologue of known structure. We found that divalent cations inhibit the activation of ELIC by the agonist cysteamine, reducing both its potency and, at higher concentrations, its maximum response. Crystal structures of the channel in complex with barium reveal the presence of several distinct binding sites. By mutagenesis we confirmed that the site responsible for divalent inhibition is located at the outer rim of the extracellular domain, at the interface between adjacent subunits but at some distance from the agonist binding region. Here, divalent cations interact with the protein via carboxylate side-chains, and the site is similar in structure to calcium binding sites described in other proteins. There is evidence that other pLGICs may be regulated by divalent ions binding to a similar region, even though the interacting residues are not conserved within the family. Our study provides structural and functional insight into the allosteric regulation of ELIC and is of potential relevance for the entire family.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors that mediate electrical signaling at chemical synapses. The pLGIC family includes receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA and glycine, which share a similar structural organization and activation mechanism: the channels are closed in the absence of ligands and open when neurotransmitters bind to a conserved site in the extracellular domain. In many family members, activation by the neurotransmitter can be affected by modulators (including several drugs in therapeutic use), which bind to different sites on the channel. Channel function can be modulated also by divalent cations, which either potentiate or inhibit pLGICs at physiological concentrations. Here, we analyze this mechanism in the pLGIC ELIC, a prokaryotic family member of known structure. We show that divalent cations such as calcium or zinc inhibit ELIC by occupying an extracellular site remote from the ligand-binding region thereby interfering with gating. Although the site of interaction is not conserved between different family members, we present evidence that regulation of other pLGICs involves the same region. Our study has thus provided insights into a regulatory process that appears to be general for the pLGIC family in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors, which are activated by the binding of ligands to specific sites of the protein. The family includes both cation-selective channels, such as nicotinic Acetylcholine- (nAChRs) and Serotonin receptors (5HT<sub>3</sub>Rs), and anion-selective channels, such as GABA- (GABARs) and Glycine receptors (GlyRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Hille1">[1]</xref>. Despite these differences in ion selectivity, the overall molecular architecture and the mechanism by which ligands open the ion conduction path are conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Karlin1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Yakel1">[8]</xref>. pLGIC subunits form either homo- or hetero-pentamers that consist of at least two functional units, an extracellular ligand-binding region and a transmembrane pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Unwin1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Hilf1">[10]</xref>. Agonists open the channel by binding to a conserved site in the extracellular domain, at the interface between two subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Celie1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Sabey1">[12]</xref>. A homomeric receptor contains five equivalent agonist binding sites, several of which need to be occupied for maximum channel activation and this makes the process highly cooperative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Sivilotti1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Burzomato1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Beato1">[16]</xref>. Agonist binding is accompanied by conformational rearrangements that are transmitted over a distance of tens of angstroms from the extracellular domain, via the domain interface to the pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Grosman1">[17]</xref>. These receptors have thus become important model systems for the study of allosteric mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Taly1">[18]</xref>. Many pLGICs are important drug targets and all aspects of their function can be influenced by pharmacological agents. These are a diverse set of molecules that include agonists and competitive antagonists (which act on the agonist binding site itself), pore blockers that inhibit ion conduction, and allosteric modulators that interact with regions distinct from the agonist-binding site. Modulators such as benzodiazepines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Mohler1">[19]</xref>, general anesthetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Yamakura1">[20]</xref>, alcohol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Lobo1">[21]</xref>, and the antiparasite ivermectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Hibbs1">[22]</xref> can either enhance or inhibit pLGIC activation. pLGIC function is affected also by divalent cations (such as calcium and zinc) in two distinct ways. Cation-selective pLGICs are somewhat permeable to divalents, but the strong interaction between these ions and the pore decreases or blocks conduction in a voltage-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Dani1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Adams1">[24]</xref>. In addition to that, divalent cations can also modulate channel gating. For instance, calcium potentiates the agonist responses of nAChRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Sine2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Vernino1">[27]</xref> and inhibits those of 5HT<sub>3</sub>Rs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Peters1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Niemeyer1">[29]</xref>, and zinc can either potentiate or inhibit channel activation, depending on the type of pLGIC and the ion concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Palma1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Moroni1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we show that both the modulatory and the channel block effects of divalent cations are present also in ELIC, a prokaryotic pLGIC channel whose structure was determined in a nonconducting conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Hilf2">[36]</xref>. Agonists of ELIC include primary amines such as cysteamine, propylamine, and the vertebrate neurotransmitter GABA. In ELIC, these agonists occupy the canonical ligand-binding site of the family and open a cation-selective pore with permeation properties similar to those of eukaryotic channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Zimmermann1">[37]</xref>. Here we describe how divalent cations permeate and block the ELIC pore, and how they also inhibit ELIC gating, by binding in the extracellular domain, to a site remote from the ligand-binding region.</p>

        <title>Modulation of ELIC Function by Divalent Ions</title>
        <p>We have investigated the effects of divalent cations on ELIC by electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography. Divalent cations can influence ELIC function in several different ways depending on concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1A</xref> show that low mM concentrations of the alkaline earth metal ion Ca<sup>2+</sup> decrease the single channel conductance of ELIC when added to the extracellular medium at negative holding potentials. ELIC single channel currents are progressively reduced by increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and decrease by approximately 25% of their control amplitude at 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and by a maximum of about 50% at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Zimmermann1">[37]</xref>. This effect is due to tight interactions of divalent ions with the channel pore and has been thoroughly characterized for different pLGIC family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Dani1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Adams1">[24]</xref> including the homologous channel GLIC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Hilf3">[38]</xref>, whose structure was determined by X-ray crystallography in a conducting conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Hilf4">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Bocquet1">[40]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Low extracellular calcium (greater than 100 µM) produces also a voltage-independent decrease in agonist potency. This effect is detectable at Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations too low to decrease channel conductance and is manifested as a parallel rightward shift in the agonist dose–response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s007">Table S1</xref>). A similar effect on agonist binding in the presence of calcium is observed in isothermal titration calorimetry experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Up to 1 mM calcium, the shift in the agonist dose–response curves is truly parallel, as the maximum agonist current does not decrease more than the single channel conductance does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). This pattern appears to reproduce the effects of competitive antagonists, which bind to the ligand-binding site and reduce its occupancy by the agonist in a surmountable way (e.g., their effect can be overcome by increasing agonist concentration). This resemblance is obvious if the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are compared with those of the competitive antagonist acetylcholine, which is known to bind to the agonist-binding site of ELIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Pan1">[41]</xref>.

        <p>The similarity between the effect of calcium and that of a competitive antagonist disappears as Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations are increased above 1 mM. The current traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1B</xref> show that the reduction in agonist potency is now associated with a decrease in the maximum agonist response. This decrease is too big to be explained by the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on conductance: at 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> the single channel conductance is reduced by 25% and the maximum agonist response by 55% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). At progressively higher concentrations of the divalent cation, the maximum current response continues to decline and this decrease can be described by a fit to a Langmuir equation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 6 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). Despite the strong reduction in the maximum currents, the shift in EC<sub>50</sub> remains linear over a wide concentration range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The pronounced drop in maximum current strongly suggests that at higher concentrations calcium impairs the opening of the channel and reduces agonist efficacy.</p>
        <p>Next, we tried to establish whether calcium impairs the maximum rate of ELIC gating (e.g., when the channel is fully bound to the agonist) by measuring the on-relaxation of currents elicited by rapid propylamine applications to outside-out patches from HEK293 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1I</xref> shows that increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from 50 to 200 µM does slow the onset of the current elicited by a saturating agonist concentration (20 mM propylamine, red trace) but that this effect is overcome by increasing agonist concentration to 50 mM (green trace). Only minor changes in the time course of deactivation were detected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001429-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus the maximum rate with which the agonist-bound channel opens is unchanged, which is unexpected given the observed change in agonist efficacy. This could be because we could test only low calcium (in high calcium the concentrations of agonist required to saturate channel gating are too high to be experimentally feasible). Alternatively, calcium impairs gating by affecting a step in the channel activation that controls the size of the maximum agonist response, but not the speed of overall gating (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

        <p>Finally, we found that divalent cations other than Ca<sup>2+</sup> also affect ELIC responses. In particular, other alkaline earth metal ions, such as Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup>, and Ba<sup>2+</sup>, are slightly weaker than Ca<sup>2+</sup> in inhibiting ELIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g002">Figure 2A–C and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001429-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s007">Table S1</xref>), whereas the transition metal ion Zn<sup>2+</sup> is considerably more potent (i.e., Schild plot x-intercept 8 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g002">Figure 2D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001429-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s007">Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Structural Characterization of Divalent Ion Binding</title>
        <p>In order to understand the structural basis of the effects of divalent ions we aimed at identifying the region of interaction by X-ray crystallography. Since the crystal form that was used for the structure determination of ELIC contains high concentrations of sulfate, which forms insoluble salts in the presence of most alkaline earth metal ions, we had to identify novel crystallization conditions compatible with divalent ions. In a broad screen we observed crystals growing in Ba<sup>2+</sup>-acetate. Ba<sup>2+</sup> can be readily located in the electron density by its strong anomalous scattering properties, and since it has comparable effects on channel function as Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), it is reasonable to assume that it will occupy the same sites in the protein. Crystals of the ELIC/Ba<sup>2+</sup> complex belong to two different, yet related crystal forms, one similar to the original barium-free form of ELIC that was used for structure determination (space group P2<sub>1</sub>) and another growing in a higher symmetry space group (P4<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001429-t003">Table 3</xref>). Datasets for both crystal forms were collected to 3.8 Å (P2<sub>1</sub>) and 3.3 Å (P4<sub>3</sub>) resolution and provide equivalent views of the channel and its interaction with divalent cations.</p>

        <p>Firstly, a single Ba<sup>2+</sup> ion per channel is located on the 5-fold axis of symmetry at the extracellular end of the pore and is coordinated by the side-chains of Asn251 (position 20′ of the second transmembrane domain in the numbering system developed for the nAChR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Throughout the article we will refer to this site as S<sub>pore</sub>.</p>
        <p>There are two additional sets of binding sites for Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. Both are found at the interface between subunits in the extracellular domain in five symmetry-related locations. One set of sites faces the channel vestibule and will be referred to as S<sub>in</sub>. The barium ion in S<sub>in</sub> is coordinated by Ser84 of the principal subunit and Asp86 of the complementary subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Barium ions are bound also to a set of five equivalent sites on the outer rim of the extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g003">Figure 3B and E</xref>). These sites, which we will call S<sub>out</sub>, are about 15 Å below the ligand-binding pocket, towards the membrane plane and are formed by the side-chains of acidic amino acids contributed by both subunits. These residues include Asp113 at the end of β6 on the principal side and Glu150 and Asp158 on the loop connecting β8 and β9 on the complementary side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g003">Figure 3A and E</xref>). The refined 2F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> electron density map of this region indicates a direct interaction of the respective carboxylate groups with the bound ions resembling Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites observed in other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s002">Figure S2B and C</xref>).

        <title>Investigation of the Binding Sites of Divalent Ions by Mutagenesis</title>
        <p>The structure of ELIC in complex with Ba<sup>2+</sup> has revealed the location of three distinct sites for the interaction with divalent cations. If binding to any of these sites is relevant for the inhibition of the channel, we would expect that mutating the interacting residues should affect the functional modulation by divalent ions. Thus we mutated the residues that contact Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the structure and measured again the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001429-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Given that the effects of low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations resemble those of competitive antagonists, we tested also whether the agonist binding site can play a role (even though we have no structural evidence that divalents bind there). Our functional data show that the agonist binding site is unlikely to be involved, because Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition is not changed by a mutation here (R91A) that increases agonist potency by 3–4-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Zimmermann1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g004">Figure 4A and F</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then proceeded to investigate whether the inhibitory effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are produced via binding to the S<sub>pore</sub> site by truncating the side-chain of the Asn residue in contact with the divalent ion. Our X-ray crystallography data show that the structure of this N251A mutant is on the whole similar to WT but lacks the anomalous difference density in S<sub>pore</sub>. The structure of this mutant still shows strong density of ions bound to S<sub>out</sub> (and weaker density for S<sub>in</sub>), thus suggesting that effects of the mutation are local (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Electrophysiological recording shows that agonists activate WT and mutant N251A channels with similar potency and that the inhibition by Ca<sup>2+</sup> of these responses is only modestly decreased in N251A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and Schild plots in 4F). This suggests that S<sub>pore</sub> is not the major site responsible for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g004">Figure 4F</xref> shows also that mutating the binding residues in another set of divalent ion sites, S<sub>in</sub> (which face the extracellular vestibule), has little effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition. Mutation S84A (on the principal side) changes neither the potency of the agonist nor the inhibition by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Similarly, in the mutant D86A there is only a modest decrease in agonist potency, and the inhibitory effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is virtually unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g004">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Thus we have shown that neither S<sub>pore</sub> nor S<sub>in</sub> mediate the functional effects of calcium on channel activation.</p>
        <p>In contrast to that, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> modulation is greatly decreased when we change any of the residues that coordinate divalent cations in S<sub>out</sub>. This is seen both when the residues with acidic side chains (Asp 113, Glu150, and Asp158) are individually replaced with their uncharged isosteric counterparts (Asn or Gln) and when the acidic side-chains are truncated to Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s003">Figure S3</xref>). All of these mutations cause a variable but strong decrease in the potency of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which suggests that they weaken the interaction with the ion and thus its inhibitory effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">Figure 5E and F</xref>). The strongest effect among single mutants is observed for residues Asp113 and Asp158 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">Figure 5A, B, and E</xref>). Combining these two mutations in the double mutant D113A/D158A virtually abolishes the effects of both calcium and barium on the agonist dose–response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s003">Figure S3E and S3F</xref>). Remarkably, and in contrast to our observations in WT, in this double mutant the decrease in I<sub>max</sub> at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration appears entirely due to the reduction in single channel conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to S<sub>out</sub> is thus responsible for both functional effects on the shift of the EC<sub>50</sub> and the decrease of I<sub>max</sub>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">Figure 5</xref> also shows that mutations in S<sub>out</sub> shift the EC<sub>50</sub> towards higher agonist concentrations, an effect that is not surprising given that this region is thought to be important in transducing agonist binding into channel activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">Figure 5A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s007">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The X-ray structure of the double mutant D113A/D158A in complex with Ba<sup>2+</sup> is on the whole unperturbed. The double mutation has removed the density of ions bound to S<sub>out</sub>, while leaving the strong anomalous difference density in S<sub>pore</sub> unchanged. This confirms that in this mutant divalents fail to modulate channel activation because they cannot bind to the S<sub>out</sub> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">Figure 5H</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given that the same mutations abolish also the modulation by Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g005">Figure 5I</xref>), it is very likely that Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibits ELIC by binding to the same site. This finding is somewhat unexpected as Zn<sup>2+</sup> usually interacts with histidine or cysteine residues. However, since the ligand binding domain of ELIC does not contain any cysteines and since mutations of the two histidines, which are both located on β10, did not affect the inhibition by Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s004">Figure S4</xref>), it is likely that the interaction of this transition metal ion with ELIC occurs at this site and therefore deviates from common binding modes.</p>

        <title>Independence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Acetylcholine Inhibition</title>
        <p>The results of our mutational analysis strongly suggest that the observed inhibition of ELIC by divalent cations is mediated by the specific interaction with a site that is located at the outer rim of the extracellular domain, at the interface between neighboring subunits. Since this site is distant from the agonist-binding region, we wanted to explore whether there is any direct competition between the effect of divalent ions and that of competitive antagonists binding to the ligand-binding site. Such competitive antagonists include quaternary ammonium compounds such as tetramethylammonium, a weak antagonist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s005">Figure S5</xref>), or acetylcholine, which inhibits the channel with higher affinity. The X-ray structure of ELIC in complex with the heavy atom analogue tetramethylarsonium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) and the recently determined structure of ELIC in complex with acetylcholine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Pan1">[41]</xref> show that both antagonists bind to the ligand-binding pocket and prevent the binding of the agonist to the same site. The overlap of agonist- and antagonist-binding sites is also reflected in the 10-fold increase in the Schild affinity of acetylcholine in the mutant R91A. This is similar to the increase in agonist potency in the same mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g006">Figure 6B and D</xref>). In contrast to the mutation in the binding site, the S<sub>out</sub> double mutant D113A/D158A abolishes the modulatory effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> but does not alter the affinity of acetylcholine (WT 1.6 mM, D113A/D158A 2.1 mM), confirming that calcium and acetylcholine act via distinct sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g006">Figure 6C and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001429-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Divalent Ions Inhibit ELIC Gating by Binding to S<sub>out</sub></title>
        <p>X-ray structures of ELIC crystals grown in the presence of barium have allowed us to identify five structurally equivalent binding sites (S<sub>out</sub>) located at subunit interfaces on the extracellular domain about 15 Å from the agonist-binding region. These are likely to be responsible for the observed inhibition, as mutations at this site have a strong effect on the potency of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The sites resemble regulatory calcium-binding pockets found in other ion channel proteins, where the divalent ions interact with the side chains of acidic residues that are often organized in clusters on the protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Yuan1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Schumacher1">[46]</xref>.

        <p>While the residues that interact with divalent cations in ELIC are not conserved across pLGICs, there is evidence that equivalent modulatory effects in other pLGICs involve the same (S<sub>out</sub>) region. In the α7-nAChR, the residue Glu 172, which has been identified as a key residue in the interaction with calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Galzi1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Lyford1">[52]</xref>, resides on the same loop as Glu 150 and Asp 158 (loop 8) in ELIC. Similarly, histidine and glutamate residues contributing to the interaction with Zn<sup>2+</sup> in GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were mapped to the same location, at the interface between two subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Hosie1">[53]</xref>, thus indicating that the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inhibition of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs may follow a similar mechanism. Residues in the same loop of 5HT<sub>3</sub>Rs have also been proposed to participate to calcium regulation of this receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Thompson2">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, a study on the 5HT<sub>3</sub>R has identified an aspartate residue in the pore domain as an important determinant for calcium-dependent inhibition. The equivalent Asn residue in ELIC coordinates the barium ion in the site S<sub>pore</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Hu1">[55]</xref>. We investigated this site by mutagenesis but did not find any indication for a similar role in the calcium regulation of ELIC. The phenotypic difference may be due to a stronger interaction with a divalent ion in the 5HT<sub>3</sub>R where the respective residue is an aspartate and thus carries a negative charge (cf., an uncharged asparagine in ELIC).</p>

        <title>The Mechanism of Action of Divalent Ions</title>
        <p>The effect of calcium and other divalent cations on gating of ELIC results in a complex functional phenotype. At low extracellular calcium concentrations, we see a reduction in agonist potency that resembles competitive inhibition (with a linear Schild plot with a slope near unity). Despite this resemblance, the agonist binding site is not involved in this process and the presence of the antagonist acetylcholine (which binds in the canonical agonist site) has no effect on the action of calcium. Finally, higher calcium concentrations reduce the maximum agonist response (to a greater extent than can be accounted for by a conductance decrease). At first sight, these effects appear to be too complex to be explained by a single microscopic action of divalents (i.e., the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the site S<sub>out</sub>). However, they can all be accounted for, if calcium impairs a single step of ELIC activation, for example channel opening, provided gating is efficient in wild-type ELIC (i.e., the agonist efficacy <italic>E</italic> is high to start with, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This is a plausible hypothesis, given the high open probability of the single channel activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g001">Figure 1A</xref>.</p>
        <p>In first approximation, the relation between maximum open probability <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> and efficacy <italic>E</italic> is:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001429.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001429.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and our observations of an ELIC <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> greater than 95% are compatible with values of <italic>E</italic> that are greater than 20 (as reported for other pLGIC such as nicotinic and glycine receptors). If the value of <italic>E</italic> is high to start with, the reduction in efficacy produced by divalents must be substantial before a decrease in maximum response becomes apparent. That is why it is seen only at high calcium concentrations. More modest decreases in efficacy, at low calcium concentrations, will cause only a decrease in agonist potency. This is because agonist <italic>EC</italic><sub>50</sub> is directly affected by the value of <italic>E</italic>. In the simplest del Castillo-Katz model, <italic>EC</italic><sub>50</sub> is given by:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001429.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001429.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> is the microscopic dissociation constant of the agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Colquhoun2">[56]</xref>.</p>
        <p>It can also be shown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s008">Text S1</xref>) that the effects of calcium and those of a competitive antagonist are expected to be independent, if we model equilibrium channel activation with a simple scheme, where calcium binding impairs gating (by affecting <italic>E</italic>) and the antagonist binds to the resting form of the channel. This model not only predicts Schild-like behavior for the effect of calcium but suggests also that the Schild intercept is a reasonable estimate for the microscopic affinity of divalents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s008">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>These conclusions are unchanged if we model channel activation by a more detailed and realistic activation scheme, incorporating an intermediate state between agonist binding and channel opening. The existence of one or more gating intermediate states for channels in the nicotinic superfamily is supported by several lines of evidence. For instance, φ analysis in muscle nicotinic AChRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Auerbach1">[57]</xref> indicates that blocks of residues move asynchronously in the gating conformational change. In addition to that, mechanisms with reaction intermediates (referred to as flip, primed, or catch-and-hold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Burzomato1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Mukhtasimova1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Jadey1">[61]</xref>) are needed to explain several aspects of the function of the GlyR and the muscle nicotinic AChR, such as agonist efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In our experiments, the presence of an additional intermediate step that limits the maximum rate of current onset in agonist-bound ELIC channels is required to explain the results of our agonist concentration jumps. This is because we observed that low calcium increased the agonist concentration needed to achieve the maximum rate of current onset, but did not change the limiting rate of channel gating. If activation went through a single conformational step as the channel gates (as in a simple del Castillo-Katz mechanism), this single step would control both the rate of current onset for the agonist-bound channel and the maximum response, and any changes in this would be experimentally detectable (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001429.s008">Text S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>In our study we have shown how the binding of calcium to a single site remote from the ligand binding pocket modulates the activation of the pLGIC ELIC. Given that divalent ions impair ELIC gating, they are expected to bind more tightly to the resting state of the channel and stabilize it. The location of the divalent binding site at the interface between adjacent subunits is an intriguing mechanism to stabilize distinct states in an allosteric protein, given that these regions are involved in conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001429-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, occupancy by divalent ions of sites at a similar location in the different pLGICs will result in potentiation or inhibition, depending on whether the equilibrium is shifted towards conducting or nonconducting conformations. Allosteric modulation is important for the pharmacology of pLGICs, as many of pLGIC drugs in therapeutic use act by this mechanism, although by binding to sites distinct from those of divalent ions.</p>
        <p>Modulation by divalent ions of pLGICs occurs at concentrations that are physiologically relevant in vertebrates and may regulate the activity of channels in their natural environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Smart1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001429-Amador1">[62]</xref>. It is not known whether such regulation is important for ELIC activity in its natural host <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic>, but it is remarkable that the observed mechanism has been conserved during evolution.</p>

In case of solutions containing Zn<sup>2+</sup>, cysteamine was replaced by propylamine. The membrane potential in all dose–response measurements was set to −40 mV. As ELIC is permeable to divalent cations, we tested if endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels affected our measurements.

        <p>Cells were bathed in an extracellular solution containing (mM): 150 KCl, 0.05 or 0.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH (osmolarity 310 mOsm). Patch pipettes were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass (GC150F; Harvard Apparatus) and fire polished to a resistance of 8–12 MΩ. Intracellular solution contained (mM): 150 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH.

Patches were stepped to this holding voltage 0.2 s before the agonist was applied and otherwise held at −40 mV. No correction for junction potential was applied (calculated value 0.2 mV).
