      <title/>
      <p>A very Happy New Year to all our authors, readers, editors, and reviewers from
                everyone at the Public Library of Science! 2008 was a remarkable year for
                    <italic>PLoS Computational Biology</italic>; which saw 50% more
                submissions than in 2007 (900 full articles and 175 presubmission inquiries), more
                than 260 high-quality research articles published, and regular contributions of
                Editorials, Reviews and Perspectives, and Education and Society pages. This growth
                and maturity of content leaves no doubt that our Journal has become a leading
                reference for the field of computational biology and a trusted place to publish.</p>
      <p>Such success has come through the hard work of our Editors, not only from our
                Editorial Board but also from the anonymous reviewers and Guest Editors who expend
                so much time and energy in the assessment of submitted manuscripts (each averaging
                2.8 reviews and 1 to 2 rounds of revisions), and from the attention to detail and
                care taken over the content.</p>
      <p>Peer review by external experts is essential to ensuring that the work published in
                    <italic>PLoS Computational Biology</italic> is of the very highest quality, and
                we are grateful to all of our reviewers for their thoughtful and informed comments.
                Guest Editors are those who step in to edit one particular paper that describes work
                in an area of research that falls outside the expertise of the more than 50
                volunteer Editors on our Board. The flexibility and availability of these Guest
                Editors is invaluable in our being able to provide a high level of review, as well
                as playing an important role in maintaining the broad appeal and vibrancy of the
                Journal. Their names can be found together in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000275.s001">Table S1</xref> as an
                acknowledgment of the good work they do and the time they donate to improve the body
                of scientific literature and knowledge.</p>
      <p>In 2008, our pool of reviewers included approximately 1,300 scientists in 36
                countries, including Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, and Afghanistan, as well as in
                countries such as Israel, Germany, and Japan, where the Journal is better-known.
                This impressive geographical spread indicates that we are reaching the best of the
                best across the scientific world, something only a well-respected journal of quality
                is able to accomplish.</p>
      <p>Organic growth requires that we constantly assess both the kinds of papers we accept
                and the standards of research they represent. We have revised our scope statement to
                reflect slight changes in our focus (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/information.action" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/information.action</ext-link>), and we
                constantly refine our Editorial Board (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/edboard.action" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/edboard.action</ext-link>) to handle the
                number and types of papers we are encouraging. Experiencing solid growth can come at
                a price to the speed of our Editorial processes, however, and while we aim to
                provide a decision to our authors within 35 days, some papers defy this time limit.
                We are confident, however, that with your continued help and support, we will reach
                our targets more consistently this year. As authors, you appreciate a swift response
                time, and as reviewers you can help us achieve this by making a commitment in 2009
                to return reviews within two weeks.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead in 2009, you can expect to see not only more great research, but also
                greater connectivity between content found in different PLoS journals and among
                members of your community. As an example of the former, <italic>PLoS Computational
                    Biology</italic> will be working with <italic>PLoS ONE</italic> to feature
                developments in software important to our discipline. For the latter, the community
                can read and participate in discussions that start when readers post a comment or
                rating on a published article.</p>
      <p>As we have done since our launch, we welcome your feedback on how we're
                doing and what we should be doing going forward. This is your Journal, and our open
                philosophy encourages your engagement in it. By working together, we can further
                establish the importance of our science to our understanding of living systems and
                make a positive contribution to moving it forward even in these uncertain times.</p>
      <p>Once again, many thanks to all of you for your support and commitment to making 2008
                a successful year for <italic>PLoS Computational Biology</italic> and to ensuring
                that we are able to achieve even more in the upcoming year.</p>
