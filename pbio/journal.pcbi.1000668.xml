<p>Protein–protein interactions are challenging targets for modulation by small molecules. Here, we propose an approach that harnesses the increasing structural coverage of protein complexes to identify small molecules that may target protein interactions. Specifically, we identify ligand and protein binding sites that overlap upon alignment of homologous proteins. Of the 2,619 protein structure families observed to bind proteins, 1,028 also bind small molecules (250–1000 Da), and 197 exhibit a statistically significant (p&lt;0.01) overlap between ligand and protein binding positions. These “bi-functional positions”, which bind both ligands and proteins, are particularly enriched in tyrosine and tryptophan residues, similar to “energetic hotspots” described previously, and are significantly less conserved than mono-functional and solvent exposed positions. Homology transfer identifies ligands whose binding sites overlap at least 20% of the protein interface for 35% of domain–domain and 45% of domain–peptide mediated interactions. The analysis recovered known small-molecule modulators of protein interactions as well as predicted new interaction targets based on the sequence similarity of ligand binding sites. We illustrate the predictive utility of the method by suggesting structural mechanisms for the effects of sanglifehrin A on HIV virion production, bepridil on the cellular entry of anthrax edema factor, and fusicoccin on vertebrate developmental pathways. The results, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pibase.janelia.org" xlink:type="simple">http://pibase.janelia.org</ext-link>, represent a comprehensive collection of structurally characterized modulators of protein interactions, and suggest that homologous structures are a useful resource for the rational design of interaction modulators.</p>

<p>Proteins function through their interactions with other biological molecules, including other proteins. Often times, these interactions underlie cellular processes that go awry in disease. Therefore, modulating these interactions with small molecules is an active area of research for new drugs to treat diseases and new chemical tools to dissect cellular interaction networks. However, targeting protein–protein interactions has proven to be more challenging than the typical drug targets found on individual proteins. Here, we present a computational approach that aims to help in this challenge by identifying regions of protein–protein interfaces that may be amenable to targeting by small molecules. Through a comprehensive analysis of all known protein structures, we identify closely related proteins that in one case bind a protein and in another case bind a small molecule. We find that a significant number of protein–protein interactions occur through surface regions that bind small molecules in related proteins. These “bi-functional” positions, which can bind both proteins and ligands, will serve as an additional piece of structural information that can aid experimentalists in developing small molecules that modulate protein interactions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein–protein interactions are a broad class of therapeutic and chemical biology targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Berg1">[1]</xref>. Traditionally these targets were thought to be refractory to small molecule modulation. However, recent efforts have led to interaction modulators that are valuable tools in mapping signalling networks and are entering clinical trials for therapeutic use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Wells1">[2]</xref>. Although natural substrates often serve as guides for rational drug design, such information is rarely available for protein–protein interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Arkin1">[3]</xref>. Here we attempt to provide such a starting point through a structural analysis of known protein and ligand binding sites. We posit that although ligands that are known to bind to specific protein–protein interfaces are rare, examples of ligands that bind to corresponding positions in homologous proteins may be available. These homologous sites, and the ligands they bind, may serve as starting points for rationally designing small molecule modulators of protein interactions.</p>
<p>The physicochemical, geometric, and evolutionary properties of ligand and protein binding sites have been extensively studied by analyzing three-dimensional protein structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Jones1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Caffrey1">[6]</xref>. On average, protein interfaces are relatively planar, more physically adaptable, and much larger than the small, rigid, pockets that bind small molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Conte1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Laskowski1">[7]</xref>. Despite the large total surface area of protein interfaces, a small subset of these residues, termed ‘hotspots’, contribute disproportionately to the affinity of protein–protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Clackson1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Keskin1">[10]</xref>. Small molecules that target these hotspots have been found to effectively compete against proteins in binding events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Thanos1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>The computational methods developed for traditional rational drug design, such as pocket detection and virtual screening, have also been applied to identify small molecules modulators of protein interactions. The methods are frequently adapted to the unique properties of protein interfaces, such as their adaptivity in forming small transient cavities that can bind small molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Arkin2">[12]</xref>. This property led to the use of molecular dynamics simulations to search protein interfaces for transient pockets that are subsequently targeted by virtual screening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Eyrisch1">[13]</xref>. In this study, we take a conceptually related approach that harnesses the conformational (and chemical) space sampled by homologous members of a protein family. The magnitude and direction of this evolutionary sampling has been found to correlate with the conformational space sampled physically by an individual member of a protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Elber1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-LeoMacias1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we perform a systematic analysis of structurally characterized ligand and protein binding sites, with a central goal of comprehensively identifying, enumerating, and describing those positions in protein structure families where both ligands and proteins have been observed to bind. We first analyze the overlap of these binding sites within protein families, characterizing the composition and conservation of these ‘bi-functional’ positions, and identifying the families in which they are more or less prevalent than expected by chance. Next, we describe protein–protein and protein–peptide interactions for which small molecules were observed to bind at corresponding or homologous positions in other protein structures. Finally, we describe known interaction modulators recovered by the analysis, and illustrate its predictive utility by suggesting structural mechanisms for the observed effects of three small molecules.</p>

<title>Ligand and protein binding sites</title>
<p>We began by assembling a comprehensive list of protein and ligand binding sites. Protein–protein (inter-molecular domain–domain, intra-molecular domain–domain, and domain–peptide) binding sites were obtained from PIBASE (v200808) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Davis1">[17]</xref>, based on domain boundaries and classifications from SCOP (v1.73) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Murzin1">[18]</xref> (details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Peptide binding sites were included in the analysis because the structures of protein complexes are often solved with only the peptides that mediate the interaction, rather than the full-length protein. Ligand binding sites were obtained from LIGBASE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Stuart1">[19]</xref>, and mapped onto SCOP domains using family alignments from the ASTRAL compendium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Chandonia1">[20]</xref>. Binding sites that shared more than 90% of their corresponding alignment positions were grouped together and a representative was chosen randomly, yielding a final dataset of 35,168 ligand binding sites, 2,332 peptide binding sites, 12,015 inter-molecular domain interfaces, and 4,290 intra-molecular domain interfaces, for all of which the structure is known (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s003">Table S3</xref>). This redundancy removal procedure (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) partially corrects the human bias in structural coverage of proteins, protein complexes, and protein-ligand complexes. Other aspects of bias can not be corrected and therefore affect our observations; For example, the analysis is limited to those proteins, ligands, and complexes that have been structurally characterized.</p>

<title>Protein families with overlapping ligand and protein binding sites</title>
<p>We first quantified the extent and significance of overlap between all ligand and protein binding sites observed in each protein family. The binding sites were mapped onto alignments of domain families obtained from the ASTRAL compendium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Chandonia1">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s008">Fig. S1B</xref>). This mapping procedure implicitly accounts for redundant structures, as multiple structures of the same binding site do not contribute any additional positions beyond those protein-binding or ligand-binding positions identified by the first structure. Of the 2,619 families that bind proteins, 1,028 also bind small molecules, and 736 of these have at least 5 bi-functional positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s001">Table S1</xref>). The overlap of ligand and protein binding sites within each family was quantified using the numbers of alignment positions at which ligands (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), proteins (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), or both ligands and proteins (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) were bound, as well as the number of solvent-exposed positions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>An alignment position was considered solvent-exposed if at least one of the domains in the family had a residue with side-chain solvent exposure of greater than 7% at that position (MODELLER v9.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Sali1">[21]</xref>). The statistical significance (Fisher's exact one-tailed p-value) of the observed overlap for each family was assessed against a null model in which the ligand and protein binding site positions are randomly and independently placed at solvent-exposed positions (R v2.5.1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://r-project.org" xlink:type="simple">http://r-project.org</ext-link>). We identified 197 families with significantly more (right-tail p-val<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.01), and 113 families with significantly fewer (left-tail p-val<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.01), bi-functional positions than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s002">Table S2</xref>). These two sets of families exhibit differences in the distribution of functions as defined by SUPERFAMILY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Wilson1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s008">Fig. S1D</xref>). The significance of the function propensity values were estimated by a non-parametric bootstrap sampling procedure to compute 95% confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s004">Table S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Families with significantly less overlap (p-val<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) than expected by chance were enriched in Metabolism and depleted in Regulation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In contrast, families with significantly more overlap (p-val<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) than expected by chance were depleted in Metabolism and enriched in Intracellular processes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). For example, ten of the overlapping families are involved in signal transduction compared to none of the non-overlapping families.</p>

<p>(A) The distribution of overlap scores (Eqn 1) is shown for all families that bind both ligands and proteins (grey; n = 1,028), and the subsets of families with a statistically significant overlap (p<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.01; solid; n = 197) or non-overlap (p<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.01; dashed; n = 113).

<title>Composition and conservation of bi-functional positions</title>
<p>We next asked whether the chemical or evolutionary properties of bi-functional positions were different from other positions that were part of only ligand or protein binding sites (mono-functional) or solvent-exposed. The propensities of each amino acid residue at mono-functional and bi-functional positions were calculated relative to all exposed residues, and their significance estimated by a bootstrap resampling procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s005">Table S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The magnitudes of these propensities are within the range reported in previous binding site analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Jones1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Ellis1">[23]</xref>. The propensity of residue types that exist at the bi-functional positions are generally intermediate between those of ligand-only and protein-only positions, although they are more similar to the ligand-only positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In particular, bi-functional positions have a higher propensity of tryptophan, histidine, and phenylalanine residues relative to both protein-binding positions and solvent exposed residues. In addition, bi-functional positions have a higher propensity for tyrosine, and slightly lower propensities for alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine, than either mono-functional or solvent-exposed positions.</p>
<p>Bi-functional positions are also significantly less conserved than mono-functional or solvent exposed positions, as measured by an entropy-based conservation score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) as well as a simple count of residue types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s008">Fig. S1E</xref>). This lower conservation was considered statistically significant (p-val<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) by both Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Mann-Whitney tests (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Although it is difficult to precisely identify the reason for the lower conservation of bi-functional positions, one possible explanation is related to the definition of these positions. We identified bi-functional positions because they participate in different functions – ligand binding and protein binding – in different family members. These different functions might require different residue type compositions, resulting in a lower conservation score for these positions. We also observed minimal, although statistically significant (p-val<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), differences in conservation between mono-functional and solvent-exposed residues: ligand-only positions were more conserved than all exposed residues, which in turn were more conserved than protein-only positions. The small magnitude of the difference in conservation between mono-functional and all exposed residues is in agreement with previous findings that conservation alone is of minimal predictive use for the identification of binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Caffrey1">[6]</xref>.</p>

<title>Protein–protein interactions with overlapping ligand binding sites</title>
<p>Having established that ligand and protein binding sites often overlap within protein families, we aimed to determine the utility of known ligand binding sites for targeting particular protein–protein interactions. The ligand binding sites were mapped onto individual domain–domain and domain–peptide interfaces, using ASTRAL alignments as described earlier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s008">Fig. S1C</xref>). The overlap between each ligand binding site and protein interface was characterized by the fraction of interface residues aligned to ligand binding site residues.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e016" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>When the ligand binding site aligned to both sides of a domain–domain interface, the larger of the two overlap fractions was used as the overlap score.</p>
<p>The ligand binding site coverage of each protein–protein interface was summarized using two scores. First, a maximal overlap score was used to quantify the maximum overlap observed by any ligand for the protein–protein interface. Second, a cumulative overlap score was computed by simultaneously aligning all homologous ligand binding sites onto each protein–protein interface and calculating the fraction coverage. This procedure is conceptually related to fragment-based drug discovery techniques, such as tethering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Erlanson1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>The behavior of these overlap scores was examined as a function of the sequence identity between the ligand binding site and the corresponding positions in the interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s009">S2</xref>). As expected, the coverage of interfaces was reduced at higher thresholds of sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g002">Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>), and the distributions of cumulative overlap scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s009">Fig. S2G, S2H, S2I</xref>) exhibit a higher interface coverage than the corresponding distributions of maximum overlap scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s009">Fig. S2A, S2B, S2C</xref>). In addition, the domain–peptide interfaces have higher binding site overlaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), on average, than domain–domain interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). This observation is likely due to the smaller sizes of domain–peptide interfaces, which are thus more readily covered by small molecule binding sites.</p>

<p>Although the analysis suggests that most interfaces do not have a homologous ligand binding site, as seen by the main peak over an interface overlap of 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), there are a significant number of interfaces for which overlapping homologous ligand binding sites do exist. In particular, a significant number of protein interfaces overlap with homologous ligand binding sites of greater than 30% sequence identity, previously determined to be a reliable threshold for homology transfer of ligand binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-MartiRenom1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>The systematic alignment of ligand binding sites onto protein interfaces generates a dataset useful for two primary purposes. First, it serves as a comprehensive collection of structurally characterized interaction modulators, in the cases where the ligand binding domain is identical to the sequence involved in the protein interaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000668-t001">Table 1</xref>). Second, it serves as a set of predicted interaction modulators, where the ligand binding site itself is highly similar to the corresponding region in the target interaction, but the overall domain is only homologous, rather than identical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s006">Table S6</xref>).</p>

<title>Recovery of known interaction modulators</title>
<p>To validate the accuracy of the mapping method, we checked whether known protein interaction modulators were recovered by the method. Indeed, all but one of the modulators discussed in a recent review article <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Wells1">[2]</xref> were identified by the method: Interleukin-2 – Interleukin-2 receptor (PDB 2ERJ:A,D; 1PY2:FRH), MDM2–p53 (1T4F:M,P; 1T4E:DIZ), HPV E2–E1 helicase (1TUE:A,B; 1R6N:434), ZipA–FtsZ (1F47:A,B; 1Y2F:WAI), and TNF-<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> homotrimer (2TNF; 2AZ5:307). The interaction between Bcl-X–BAD (PDB 2BZW) was missed by our analysis because the ligand bound structure (2YXJ:N3C) was published too recently to be classified in the current SCOP domain database. The nearly complete recovery of known modulators suggests that the binding site data used in the analysis and the procedure used to map them operated correctly. We present additional examples of ligand binding sites that overlap interfaces to demonstrate the diversity of interactions for which ligand binding has been observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000668-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Predicted interaction modulators</title>
<p>Having established the accuracy of the binding site mapping, we next examined the results for their predictive utility in identifying small molecule modulators of protein interactions. Those ligand binding sites that mapped with a high sequence identity, in the context of different protein sequences, represent high confidence predictions where ligand binding may occur (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s006">Table S6</xref>). This kind of prediction is an extension of the widely used homology-transfer concept in protein function annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-MartiRenom1">[25]</xref>.</p>

<title>Ligand binding sites that overlap protein interfaces</title>
<p>The ligands identified in the analysis fell into four broad categories based on the kinds of protein–protein interactions that they overlapped (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000668-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s006">S6</xref>). The most frequently observed category were synthetic enzyme inhibitors that overlapped with the interfaces between enzymes and their protein or peptide inhibitors. These interactions include carboxypeptidase, ribonuclease, trypsins, coagulation factors, and their protein inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The high number of ligands identified in this class is not surprising, as enzyme–inhibitor complexes are among the most extensively structurally characterized and targeted by synthetic inhibitors.</p>

<p>A related group of ligands overlapped with the interface of an enzyme and its natural protein or peptide substrate. This class includes ligands that bound at signaling complexes such as MDM2–p53, farnesyltransfrease–h-ras, and histone acetyltransferase–p53. An example that is used therapeutically are HIV protease inhibitors bound at the protease dimer in place of its peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). We also include enzyme homodimers in this group, such as the transketolase and the ornithine decarboxylase homodimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s006">Table S6</xref>).</p>
<p>A third class of ligands overlapped with the interface of structural or regulatory protein–protein interactions. These ligands include natural toxins, such as kabiramide C bound at the actin–gelsolin interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) and fusicoccin bound at the interface of 14-3-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This class also includes synthetic compounds such as ajulemic acid that bound at the interface of peroxisome proliferator activated recpetor gamma (PPARG) and the LXXLL coactivator (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000668-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Troponin C aligns to both EF-hand motifs in calmodulin: The binding site aligned with EF-motif 2 (cyan) exhibits greater overlap with the anthrax edema factor interface than EF-motif 1 (blue).</p>

<p>The fourth group of ligands were transferred from structures where they were present at domain interfaces. Although it is difficult to predict the effect of these ligands on the target interface, this group of ligands may be more likely to sterically complement protein interfaces than ligands in the other groups, which more likely sterically hinder protein interactions. This group includes elaidoylamide bound at the homodimeric interface of agkistrodotoxin Phospholipase A2 (PDB 1RGB), and bepridil bound at the interface of Troponins C and I (1LXF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Ligands in this class may be of potential use for designing chemically induced dimerization systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Crabtree1">[26]</xref>. This technique relies on the ability of particular small molecules, such as Rapamycin and FK506, to simultaneously bind two proteins, and has been extensively used to study and control cell signaling processes. This group of ligands also slightly overlaps with the second group, as HIV protease inhibitors bind at the homodimeric protease interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Natural ligands such as ATP, GTP, GNP also often bind at domain interfaces.</p>
<p>Another class of protein complexes with overlapping homologous ligand binding sites are antibody–antigen complexes. These overlaps are an expected result of the diversity of the complementary-determining regions of immunoglobulins that enable binding to virtually all proteins and small molecules.</p>
<p>The ligands that mapped to intra-molecular domain interfaces included natural ligands such as ATP, GTP, and Heme groups, as well as synthetic and natural toxins such as the Pulvomycin and Kirromycin antibiotics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s007">Table S7</xref>). Since we focus on direct modulators of protein–protein interactions, we will not discuss these ligands. However, ligands that bind at intra-molecular domain interfaces may serve as logical switches in cellular signaling networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Bhattacharyya1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although we observed overlaps that occur in a variety of functional classes, they can all contribute towards a structural understanding of bi-functional positions. Irrespective of the natural or synthetic source of the small molecule, or the particular functional class of protein interaction, the resulting overlaps are structurally informative for understanding what makes particular interface regions amenable to targeting by small molecules. This point can be further clarified by considering the known modulators of protein interactions that we used to test the fidelity of our mapping procedure. Although these examples involve synthetic small molecules, they have been extensively characterized structurally to understand what makes their particular binding sites amenable to targeting by small molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Wells1">[2]</xref>. Ignoring these examples because of their synthetic source would discard useful structural information.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2h">
<title>Predicting structural mechanisms for the observed effects of small molecules</title>
<p>The results also suggest possible structural mechanisms for the observed effects of small molecules. We will describe three such examples, each from a different ligand class: sanglifehrin A, bepridil, and fusicoccin. Sanglifehrin A is an immuno-suppressant, synthesized by an <italic>Actinomycetes</italic> species, that has been observed to reduce HIV-1 virion production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Sokolskaja1">[28]</xref>. Our structural analysis found that its binding site on cyclophilin A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Sedrani1">[29]</xref> overlapped completely with the complex formed by cyclophilin A and the HIV capsid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Howard1">[30]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). This overlap suggests that sanglifehrin A competes with the HIV protein for interaction with cyclophilin A. This prediction is in agreement with biochemical evidence that describes a reduction in virion production by sanglifehrin A through a cyclophilin-dependent mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Sokolskaja1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Fusicoccin is a toxin, synthesized by the fungus <italic>Fusicoccum amygdali</italic>, that disrupts protein interactions mediated by plant 14-3-3 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Wurtele1">[31]</xref>. Here we observed that its ligand binding site is nearly conserved in mammalian 14-3-3 proteins and overlaps with the 14-3-3-<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>–Seretonin N-acetyltransferase and 14-3-3-<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>–R18 peptide interfaces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s006">Table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This high level of binding site similarity suggests that fusicoccin also modulates animal 14-3-3 interactions. In fact, this modulation has been observed experimentally, with fusicoccin used as a tool to disrupt 14-3-3 interactions involved in early left-right developmental patterning in <italic>Xenopus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Bunney1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Bepridil is an FDA-approved calcium channel blocker that was until recently used to treat refractory angina. Recently it was found to inhibit the cellular entry of two anthrax toxin components: the edema and lethal factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Sanchez1">[33]</xref>. Here we observed that the troponin C binding site for bepridil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Wang1">[34]</xref> transfers with high sequence identity to the calmodulin–anthrax edema factor interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Drum1">[35]</xref>. The ASTRAL family alignment transferred the binding site to the first calmodulin EF-hand that is not directly in contact with the edema factor. In this alignment, the binding site overlap is minimal (1 of 46 protein interface residues; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s006">Table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) and occurs at the periphery of the interaction. However, upon visualization, it was found that the second EF-hand also aligns well with troponin C, and in this alignment the bepridil binding site directly overlaps with the edema factor interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). This alignment suggests that bepridil may disrupt the calmodulin–edema factor interaction by binding to calmodulin. This hypothesis, based on structural data alone, is in agreement with experimental findings that describe reduction in the lethality of edema factor by bepridil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Sanchez1">[33]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We presented a systematic analysis of protein structure families that identified bi-functional positions that bind both small molecules and proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s008">S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s001">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s003">S3</xref>). These positions were found to be less evolutionary conserved, and exhibit a different amino acid propensity, than mono-functional or other solvent exposed residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s008">S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s004">Table S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s005">S5</xref>). Families with significantly more bi-functional positions than expected by chance were functionally enriched in intracellular processes and depleted in metabolism; families with fewer bi-functional positions were functionally enriched in metabolism and depleted in regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s004">Table S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s008">Fig. S1D</xref>). Mapping ligands onto protein interactions by homology transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s009">S2</xref>) identified known (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000668-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) and predicted modulators of interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s006">Table S6</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s007">S7</xref>), that fell into four broad categories. We illustrated the utility of the results by suggesting structural mechanisms for the observed effects of three small molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). We will now discuss future extensions to the method and its utility for modulating protein interactions by small molecules.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that structural data might be harnessed in a comparative fashion to characterize small molecules that target protein-protein interactions. This approach is complementary to recent computational studies that characterize known modulators of protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Higueruelo1">[36]</xref> and predict small molecule mimics of interacting peptide motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Parthasarathi1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>This preliminary analysis can be extended in several ways to overcome limitations inherent to the current implementation. First, the comparative basis of the method relies on the availability of homologous ligand-bound structures. Although the structural coverage of protein–ligand and protein–protein complexes continues to increase, homologous ligand binding sites are not available for the majority of protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000668.s003">Table S3</xref>). This coverage can be improved by transferring ligand binding sites based solely on local structural similarity, rather than full-length domain similarity, as was done here. Several tools have been developed to identify local structure similarities and can be directly applied to the mapping of ligand binding sites onto protein interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Kleywegt1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-ShulmanPeleg1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>Second, comparing the bi-functional positions to hotspot residues, that disproportionately contribute to the free energy of protein interactions, will illuminate their biophysical role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Bogan1">[9]</xref>. Previous analysis found that hotspots are enriched in tryptophan, arginine, and tyrosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Bogan1">[9]</xref>. The bi-functional positions we characterize here also exhibit a strong enrichment of tyrosine and tryptophan, although arginine abundance is similar to the background of all solvent exposed positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The bi-functional positions also exhibited significantly lower conservation than mono-functional or exposed residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000668-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). This is in contrast to hotspot residues where previous analysis has shown equivalent or slightly higher conservation than the rest of the protein surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Ofran1">[41]</xref>. In addition to collections of alanine scanning mutagenesis results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Thorn1">[42]</xref>, several computational techniques have been developed to predict hotspots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Ofran1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Kortemme1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Ma1">[44]</xref>. Direct comparison of these datasets to bi-functional positions will help characterize their biophysical role.</p>
<p>Finally, although we have focused on ligands that may directly modulate, by complementing or sterically competing with, protein–protein interactions, another relevant class of interactions is allosteric regulation. Allosteric control refers to signal propagation between two distal binding sites through a network of residues that traverses a protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Kuriyan1">[45]</xref>. A portion of the ligand binding sites we found to directly overlap protein interactions may reflect allosteric sites, binding at which regulates a distal site. For example, a ligand designed to bind to the homodimeric interface of caspase-1 was found to exert allosteric control over the distal catalytic site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Datta1">[46]</xref>. A second potential source of allosteric interactions in our analysis is the set of 113 families that exhibited significantly less overlap than expected between ligand and protein binding sites. Further analysis should illuminate whether this observed separation between ligand and protein binding sites reflects the distal action of allosteric signaling.</p>

<title>Designing small molecule modulators of protein–protein interactions</title>
<p>We observed that several small molecule compounds, originally designed for traditional medicinal chemistry targets such as enzyme active sites, in fact target protein interfaces. These include several FDA-approved drugs, such as bepridil that binds at the interface between Troponins C and I, and HIV protease inhibitors that bind at the dimer interface. Although these examples involve fairly small protein interfaces, this observation suggests that protein–protein interactions are not completely novel targets for medicinal chemistry, and that the chemical, biophysical, and computational experience that has been developed in traditional rational drug design may also be applicable to interaction targets.</p>
<p>As protein interaction networks are resolved with greater accuracy and coverage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Collins1">[47]</xref>, small molecules become important perturbation tools to examine their functional significance. In addition, a therapeutic application that is becoming increasingly relevant is the targeting of host–pathogen protein interactions, which have been the subject of recent investigations using high-throughput experimental <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Brass1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-deChassey1">[49]</xref> and computational <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Davis2">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Dyer1">[51]</xref> methods.

We expect our results, available in PIBASE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pibase.janelia.org" xlink:type="simple">http://pibase.janelia.org</ext-link>), to serve as a structural resource to aid in the rational design of small molecule modulators of protein–protein interactions.</p>

<title>Obtaining protein and ligand binding sites</title>
<p>Residues in domain–domain and domain–peptide binding sites were obtained from PIBASE v200808 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Davis1">[17]</xref> based on domain boundaries and classifications from SCOP v1.73 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Murzin1">[18]</xref>. Peptides were defined as those chains at least 5 amino acid residues long that were not classified by SCOP or were classified in the “peptide or fragment” SCOP class. Binding sites were defined as residues containing at least one non-hydrogen atom within 5 Å of the interacting domain or peptide. Domain–domain interfaces were filtered using a threshold of at least 500 inter-atomic contacts at a distance threshold of 5Å (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>500 Å<sup>2</sup> buried surface area), to remove small interfaces that are often crystallographic artifacts. A minimum domain participation of 5 residues was also imposed on domain–peptide interactions to remove small interfaces. This procedure identified 24,717 inter-molecular domain–domain, 13,228 intra-molecular domain–domain, and 6,911 domain–peptide interactions involving 2540, 1485, and 534 domain families, respectively.</p>
<p>Ligand binding sites were obtained from LIGBASE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Stuart1">[19]</xref>, defined as residues with at least one non-hydrogen atom within 5Å of the ligand. The analysis was restricted to PDB HETERO groups with molecular weights between 250–1000 Daltons, as this range removes crystallographic buffers and small ions present in many PDB entries, and also encompasses most orally administered drugs. MDL and CIF formatted descriptions of the ligand structures were obtained from the MSD Ligand Chemistry dictionary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Dimitropoulos1">[54]</xref>. This procedure identified 39,085 binding sites on domains from 1,131 families.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>Removing redundant binding sites</title>
<p>Redundant binding sites were identified by single-linkage clustering of binding sites that shared more than 90% of their residues as measured by: (alignment positions shared by the two binding sites)/(positions in either binding site). This reduced the number of ligand binding sites from 39,085 to 35,168; peptide binding sites from 4,937 to 2,332; inter-molecular domain interfaces from 40,791 to 12,015, and intra-molecular domain interfaces from 17,863 to 4,290. The redundancy removal was performed with respect to the alignment positions, rather than amino acid sequence identity, because the binding site projection procedure relied on the alignment positions. This redundancy removal procedure aimed to reduce the effect of PDB bias in structural coverage of proteins, protein complexes, and protein-ligand complexes.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4c">
<title>Computing alignment position properties</title>
<p>The propensity of residue types in each class of position (ligand-only binding, protein-only binding, or bi-functional) was computed relative to all solvent exposed positions by counting the frequency of the 20 standard amino acid residue types:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e023" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>Residue types that occur more frequently at a particular binding site type than in all solvent exposed positions receive a propensity score of greater than 1, while less frequently occurring types receive a score of less than 1. The statistical significance of the propensity values was estimated by a bootstrap resampling procedure to compute 95% confidence intervals, implemented in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://R-project.org" xlink:type="simple">http://R-project.org</ext-link>). Propensity values were considered significant (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) if the corresponding 95% confidence interval did not include the value of 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000668-Ellis1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>The conservation of each alignment position was quantified using two scores. The first was simply the number of residue types that occurred at the position. The second was a Shannon entropy-like score that captured how non-uniform the distribution of residue type frequencies was at the position.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000668.e025" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>Alignment positions that contain only one kind of amino acid residue receive a conservation score of 1, while those with a uniform distribution of residue types receive a score of 0. The distributions of conservation scores for each kind of alignment position (bi-functional, ligand-only, protein-only, or all exposed residues) were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Mann-Whitney tests, as implemented in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://R-project.org" xlink:type="simple">http://R-project.org</ext-link>).</p>
