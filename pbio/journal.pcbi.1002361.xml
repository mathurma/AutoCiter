        <p>Quorum-sensing systems mediate chemical communication between bacterial cells, coordinating cell-density-dependent processes like biofilm formation and virulence-factor expression. In the proteobacterial LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing paradigm, a signaling molecule generated by an enzyme (LuxI) diffuses between cells and allosterically stimulates a transcriptional regulator (LuxR) to activate its cognate promoter (pR). By expressing either LuxI or LuxR in positive feedback from pR, these versatile systems can generate smooth (monostable) or abrupt (bistable) density-dependent responses to suit the ecological context. Here we combine theory and experiment to demonstrate that the promoter logic of pR – its measured activity as a function of LuxI and LuxR levels – contains all the biochemical information required to quantitatively predict the responses of such feedback loops. The interplay of promoter logic with feedback topology underlies the versatility of the LuxI/LuxR paradigm: LuxR and LuxI positive-feedback systems show dramatically different responses, while a dual positive/negative-feedback system displays synchronized oscillations. These results highlight the dual utility of promoter logic: to probe microscopic parameters and predict macroscopic phenotype.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Bacterial cells constantly communicate with one another by exchanging chemical signals, which constitute a rich source of information about the proximity of friends or foes in the environment. These signals can be used to coordinate the actions of cells across a population. For example, pathogenic bacteria infecting a host can remain quiescent, only becoming virulent once they attain a sufficient cell density. Such coordination, regulated by so-called quorum-sensing systems, works on the following principle: every cell in the population secretes a specific chemical signal; the more cells there are, the more signal is generated; when individual cells sense that the signal has crossed some threshold, they launch a response. The nature of the response depends on the detailed molecular wiring of the secretion and sensing system, which can vary from species to species. It is often impossible to determine all these molecular details for any given system. Borrowing ideas from control theory, we show that this internal wiring can be largely ignored, and these systems can be considered as ‘black boxes’. Our experiments demonstrate that the measured input-output logic of the black box, which we term ‘promoter logic’, is sufficient to predict the diverse responses of different quorum-sensing systems.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Free-living bacteria use quorum-sensing systems – dedicated chemical communication channels – to coordinate population-wide behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Waters1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Wingreen1">[2]</xref>. These systems regulate the cell-density-dependence of several bacterial activities, including bioluminescence, competence and sporulation, biofilm formation, and virulence factor expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-deKievit1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Fuqua1">[4]</xref>. In many gram-negative bacteria, quorum sensing is mediated by two key proteins termed LuxI and LuxR, and a class of signaling molecules known as acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Waters1">[1]</xref>. LuxI is the enzyme that synthesizes AHL, with the LuxI homologs of different species generating distinct AHL side-chain variants; LuxR, when bound to its cognate AHL, functions as a transcriptional activator. The AHL generated within each cell freely diffuses into the extracellular medium, so its concentration is a readout of cell density.</p>
      <p>The molecular roles of LuxI and LuxR were first elucidated in the marine bacterium <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic>, where they regulate expression of the <italic>lux</italic> genes responsible for bioluminescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The <italic>V. fischeri lux</italic> regulatory region consists of two divergent promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Shadel1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Egland1">[6]</xref>. At low cell densities, <italic>luxR</italic> is transcribed efficiently from the leftward pL promoter, while <italic>luxI</italic> and bioluminescence genes are transcribed at a basal level from the rightward pR promoter. At high cell densities, AHL-bound LuxR activates transcription at the pR promoter; this initiates a positive-feedback loop via LuxI synthesis. Similar LuxI/LuxR quorum-sensing systems have been identified through sequence homology in over 50 species of gram-negative proteobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Gray1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Lerat1">[9]</xref>. Like <italic>V. fischeri</italic>, many species place LuxI within a positive-feedback loop at the LuxR-regulated promoter (henceforth pR), while LuxR is the target of external regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Fuqua1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Shadel1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Whitehead1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Latifi1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002361-t001">Table 1</xref>). Positive feedback can generate an abrupt switch-like activation of gene expression at some threshold cell density, which can be advantageous in several biological contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Ingolia1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Ferrell1">[24]</xref>; however, the mere presence of feedback does not guarantee such a response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Ingolia1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Maeda1">[27]</xref>. Recent experiments on re-wired <italic>V. fischeri</italic> LuxI/LuxR systems have shown that the nature of the response can depend on which protein – LuxI or LuxR – is placed in feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Sayut1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Williams1">[30]</xref>. Evidently, a system's actual density-dependent behavior arises from the complex interplay of feedback architecture with microscopic biochemical parameters. However, in order to understand this interplay it seems we must first comprehensively characterize a vast number of relevant parameters – species concentrations, reaction rates, binding constants, and so on. This expanse of biochemical detail presents a fundamental barrier to developing a predictive, experimentally falsifiable description of these systems.</p>

      <p>Here we show how to cross this biochemical expanse, with the aid of a few carefully chosen measurements. Specifically, we demonstrate that the promoter logic of pR – its transformation of multiple inputs into a single transcriptional output – encapsulates all the biochemical information required to predict the responses of LuxI/LuxR quorum-sensing systems. The idea of summarizing the characteristics of a promoter by its input-output relationship has been a fruitful one in the study of transcriptional networks: gene regulation functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Rosenfeld1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Rosenfeld2">[32]</xref>, cis-regulatory input functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Setty1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Kaplan1">[34]</xref>, and genetic logic gates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Tamsir1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Cox1">[36]</xref> are all variations on this theme. Here we use the term ‘promoter logic function’ to emphasize the fact that the pR promoter integrates multiple regulatory inputs. In contrast to prior usage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Cox1">[36]</xref>, we do not restrict ourselves to cis-acting inputs alone, but rather take a black-box approach in which the ‘inputs’ can include any upstream elements that influence the output transcription rate. Using a combination of theory and experiment, we show how the promoter logic function of pR is defined and measured; we describe how to predict density-dependent responses from this measurement alone; and we successfully predict the responses of several distinct feedback systems built from <italic>V. fischeri</italic> LuxI/LuxR components. Thus we give concrete meaning to the abstract idea of the promoter as a computational entity, the central processor at the heart of this ubiquitous cell-to-cell communication paradigm.</p>

LuxR-AHL binding is in rapid equilibrium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Kaplan2">[37]</xref>, so the rate of transcription at the pR promoter will essentially depend on the instantaneous concentrations of LuxR and AHL:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>Since we never measure transcription directly, it is convenient define the maximal value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the unit transcription rate.</p>
        <p>The function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be interpreted in two distinct but related ways. First, we can consider LuxI and LuxR as its two free inputs, keeping <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fixed. This is the <italic>promoter logic function</italic> (PLF) of pR, and is valid for feedforward systems in which LuxI and LuxR levels can be set independent of cell density. We can visualize it as the two-dimensional surface generated by varying LuxI and LuxR in the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> directions, while plotting the transcriptional output as the height along the <italic>z</italic> direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Setty1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Cox1">[36]</xref>. To go from the PLF at density <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the PLF at a higher density <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we squeeze the former by the factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> along the LuxI axis; this is equivalent to multiplying the AHL-to-density proportionality constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by the same factor.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, we can regard <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> principally as a function of cell density. This interpretation is valid both for feedforward systems with LuxI and LuxR levels held fixed, as well as for feedback systems in which these levels might have density-dependent steady-states <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The rate of transcription at pR is then given by:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e017" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>This is the system's <italic>density-dependent response</italic> (DDR); it is visualized as a curve that specifies the transcriptional output at each cell density. Although defined in growth-clamped conditions, the DDR has a clear operational interpretation for growing populations: it is the moving target towards which the transcription rate converges as cell density increases. The more rapidly intracellular components equilibrate relative to cell growth, the closer the actual rate of transcription will be to this target.</p>
        <p>We can classify the DDRs of different systems according to their behavior over the relevant cell density range, from zero upto some terminal value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>; Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s013">Text S1</xref>: Bifurcation analysis of feedback loops). For monostable DDRs (type M; mnemonic sMooth) transcription is a smoothly increasing, typically sigmoidal function of cell density. For bistable DDRs (type B; mnemonic aBrupt) the sigmoidal curve folds back on itself, so there is a range of cell densities over which two stable transcription levels co-exist. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> falls beyond the bistable range (type B+), cells that are initially un-induced will abruptly switch to the induced state once their density crosses the threshold at which the lower branch of the curve vanishes. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> falls within the bistable range (type B±), the system will be hysteretic (history-dependent): cells that are initially un-induced will tend to remain so; cells that are initially induced can sustain induction at the terminal cell density; and noise-driven transitions between these states can generate a heterogeneous population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Ingolia1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Ferrell1">[24]</xref>. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> falls below the bistable range (type B−), cells will always remain un-induced; we do not expect this behavior to be relevant in natural contexts. The DDR of a given LuxI/LuxR system will depend on the values of various biochemical parameters, and on the feedback topology; both LuxR and LuxI positive-feedback systems can display all four DDR types, under different parametric conditions.</p>

            <p>(A) The response of a quorum-sensing system is encapsulated by its transcriptional output, from the moment of inoculation upto its terminal density <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Four different types of density-dependent responses can arise: (M) monostable, where transcription smoothly increases with cell density; (B+) bistable, with a threshold density at which transcription abruptly increases; (B±) bistable and hysteretic at the terminal density, where high and low transcription states co-exist; (B−) bistable but un-induced even at the terminal density, since the potentially bistable region is never reached. Solid lines are stable fixed points, dotted lines are unstable fixed points, and grey boxes indicate bistable density ranges. In our experiments we infer DDRs from the measured terminal responses. These figures were generated for the autonomous LuxI-feedback system using Eq. S18 and parameters from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s011">Table S3</xref>.

In feedforward receiver cells (Rec-FF), LuxR is expressed from the IPTG-inducible pLac promoter, and CFP is expressed from the pR promoter. (C) In the feedback receiver cells (Rec-RFB), LuxR is expressed in feedback from the pR promoter. (D,E) In autonomous feedback systems (Aut-RFB and Aut-IFB) either LuxR or LuxI is expressed in feedback from the pR promoter, while the other protein is expressed from the pLac promoter.

        <title>Predicting density-dependent responses from promoter logic</title>
        <p>Because the PLF and the DDR are essentially different slices of the same function, it should be possible to obtain one from the other as long as they are measured under the same conditions. Here we make a stronger claim: that knowledge of the PLF for a <italic>feedforward</italic> system allows us to predict the entire DDR of <italic>feedback</italic> systems constructed using the same promoter. A feedforward system is one in which both LuxI and LuxR are expressed constitutively while some output protein <italic>Z</italic> (with concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is expressed from pR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In a positive-feedback system, either LuxI or LuxR is expressed from pR forming a transcriptional loop, while the other is expressed constitutively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g001">Fig. 1C–E</xref>). These possibilities are represented by the following differential equations:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e026" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>Here, intracellular protein concentrations (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are the dynamical variables; symbols with overbars (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) represent the fixed concentrations of constitutively expressed proteins; and the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are protein production rates per transcript, scaled by the protein decay rates <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The microscopic biochemical details (hidden inside the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are separable from feedback topology (which determines the structure of the differential equations) – consistent with our intuition that the same genetic components may be re-wired in many ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Haseltine1">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Formally, the density-dependent response in the growth-clamped thought experiment can be found by measuring production and decay rates in Eq. 4; the steady-states <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are those protein levels at which these rates become equal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Rosenfeld2">[32]</xref>. In practice, protein concentrations can be more accurately determined than production and decay rates. A robust, model-independent technique proposed by Angeli <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Angeli1">[26]</xref> allows us to predict feedback responses using concentration measurements alone, absent any rate data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Consider a LuxR-feedback system, where the LuxI concentration is held fixed at a level <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the <italic>regulator</italic>) and the LuxR concentration is allowed to reach its density-dependent steady-state level <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the quantity we wish to predict). Imagine breaking the feedback loop by expressing LuxR exogenously at its original steady-state level from a constitutive promoter (the <italic>input</italic>), and substituting some passive reporter <italic>Z</italic> in place of LuxR, downstream of pR (the <italic>output</italic>). The concentration of the reporter will be different from that of LuxR because it has a different translation rate: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This concentration can also be calculated from Eq. 4, as the system is now identical to the feedforward case: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Setting these equal to one another, we see that the steady-state level of LuxR in feedback satisfies a consistency condition:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e037" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>Both the left-hand and right-hand terms can be measured and graphed on a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> versus <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The left-hand term is a slice of the PLF; it will generally be a monotonically increasing nonlinear curve called the <italic>input-output characteristic</italic>. The right-hand term will be a straight line called the <italic>line of equivalence</italic> whose slope encodes the input-to-output scale factor. The point <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where they intersect satisfies the desired steady-state condition of Eq. 4: it is level LuxR would reach in feedback when the regulator LuxI is held at the given level. A different level <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the regulator corresponds to a different slice of the PLF, and results in a different steady state response <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g002">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). The converse of this strategy applies for the LuxI-feedback case: here, the steady-state LuxI response (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) can be predicted as a function of the LuxR regulator level (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Thus we can predict the response of LuxR or LuxI feedback loops directly from measured PLF at density <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; responses at other densities can be predicted using stretched or squeezed versions of the PLF, via the proportionality constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

        <title>From thought experiment to practical measurement</title>
        <p>To implement this predictive approach, we must measure the promoter logic in conditions that mimic the idealized thought experiment. Specifically, we must clamp cell growth and AHL accumulation so the AHL-to-density proportionality shown in Eq. 1 is achieved. A continuous-flow chemostat setup clamps cell density rather than cell growth, and is difficult to multiplex. A more feasible strategy relies on the observation that the required AHL-to-density proportionality condition can arise in two very different situations. First: under the static conditions of the thought experiment where cell growth is clamped at a nominal density <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Second: in an exponentially growing culture where LuxI is held constant, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the cell density <italic>at the time of measurement</italic>. (The only caveat is that the proportionality constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will be different for the two protocols; see Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s013">Text S1</xref>: Density dependence of AHL.) Under exponential growth conditions, the PLF can be determined by splitting the measurement over two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>): AHL-producing sender cells (Sen) which express LuxI at a pre-determined level; and AHL-responsive receiver cells (Rec-FF) which express LuxR at a pre-determined level, as well as a reporter protein downstream of pR in the feedforward configuration. We first let sender cells grow exponentially from a very low initial density. Once the culture reaches the desired density <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we filter these cells out to clamp AHL levels (which, crucially, now obey the AHL-to-density proportionality condition). Finally, we measure the response of the receiver cells in the filtrate medium. By repeating this measurement at a standard cell density <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> but many different combinations of LuxI and LuxR levels, we can map out the complete PLF.</p>

We inoculated receiver cells into this broth at low density, and grew them for 12 h to a final density of OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.1.

        <p>In order to detect hysteresis in these experiments, we initialized cells in either un-induced (OFF history) or fully induced (ON history) states before growing them to the terminal density (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>: Cell growth and imaging). If the system is hysteretic, the terminal responses of the OFF-history and ON-history cell populations will be different; conversely, if these two populations have similar terminal responses, the system is non-hysteretic. We can infer the DDR type for each feedback construct and regulator level from the measured terminal response alone. If the terminal response is hysteretic, with high and low states, we can immediately conclude that the entire DDR is bistable type B±. If the terminal response is either high or low, but small changes in the regulator level lead to hysteretic behavior, we can infer that the entire DDR is bistable type B+ or B− respectively. If the terminal response is non-hysteretic and ranges over intermediate transcription levels as the regulator level is varied, we can infer that the entire DDR is monostable type M. Ambiguous cases (for example a high terminal response, insensitive to the regulator, is consistent with both types M as well as B+) can be resolved by direct measurement of the DDR over the full density range.</p>
        <p>Briefly, we find that the Rec-RFB system generates monotonic type M DDRs with no evidence of hysteresis, for all six values of aTc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g004">Figs. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g005">5C</xref>). Similarly, the Aut-RFB system generates non-hysteretic, monotonic type M DDRs for all seven values of IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g004">Figs. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g005">5B</xref>). In stark contrast, the Aut-IFB system generates hysteretic type B± DDRs for a range of intermediate IPTG levels, with un-induced type B− or fully-induced type B+ responses below or above this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g004">Figs. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g005">5E</xref>).

            <p>Each stack of histograms relates to predictions and terminal response measurements of a different feedback loop shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g001">Fig. 1C–E</xref>. In all stacks, grey histograms show model-independent predictions over 1000 trials. Note that the predictions are of deterministic steady-states, while the measurements include the effects of cell-to-cell variability; measured histograms are thus broader than predicted ones. (A) Rec-RFB. Orange histograms show observed LuxR::YFP levels. Numbers on the right indicate aTc levels in ng/ml. Our predictions match the observed fluorescence intensities as well as the threshold aTc level within a factor of two, even though both the input and output are varied by over an order of magnitude. (B) Aut-RFB. Orange histograms show observed LuxR::YFP levels for ON-history cells, white histograms show observed LuxR::YFP levels for OFF-history cells; the intersection is hatched. Numbers on the right indicate IPTG levels in µM. LuxR::YFP levels are predicted to be low independent of IPTG, but are observed to be induced starting from IPTG∼50 µM. There is no evidence of hysteresis. (C) Aut-IFB. Blue histograms show observed LuxI::CFP levels for ON-history cells, white histograms show observed LuxI::CFP levels for OFF-history cells; the intersection is hatched. Numbers on the right indicate IPTG levels in µM. For the Aut-IFB case, we sometimes detect three intersections of the input-output characteristic with the line of equivalence, an indication of multistability and hysteresis; the low and high intersections are predicted stable values, the middle intersection is an unstable threshold (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Percent values show the fraction of trials that generate such multistable predictions. The actual terminal response is indeed observed to be hysteretic: histograms from OFF-history cells and ON-history cells are non-overlapping for IPTG = 10 µM and 50 µM.</p>

Since the promoters driving the regulators have lower maximal transcription rates than pR, datapoints lie in a low band of regulator values. Fitted IOCs appear to have the same maximal value because the half-saturation concentration for LuxR-DNA binding is ∼1 LuxR molecule per cell, far below available total LuxR (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s013">Text S1</xref>: AHL and LuxR biochemistry). (B,C,E) Predicted (curves) and measured (datapoints) terminal responses for the three feedback loops. Each datapoint gives the mean fluorescence of a cell population; error bars represent standard deviations over replicates. (A) For predicting LuxR-feedback response, the IOC is a vertical slice of the PLF (keeping aTc and LuxI fixed, while varying IPTG and LuxR); for example, we show IOCs corresponding to aTc = 0 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). (B) Feedback response of Aut-RFB. White datapoints show the terminal response of OFF-history cells; orange datapoints show the terminal response of ON-history cells. There is no evidence of hysteresis; we infer that all DDRs are monostable, type M. (C) Feedback response of Rec-RFB. Orange datapoints show measured terminal responses. We infer that all DDRs are monostable, type M. (D) For predicting LuxI-feedback response, the IOC is a horizontal slice of the PLF (keeping IPTG and LuxR fixed, while varying aTc and LuxI); for example, we show IOCs corresponding to IPTG = 10 µM and 100 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). (E) Feedback response of Aut-IFB. White datapoints show the terminal response of OFF-history cells; blue datapoints show the terminal response of ON-history cells; the grey box highlights the hysteretic region. We infer that DDRs in the hysteretic IPTG range are bistable, type B±, while those below and above this range are type B− and B+ respectively. (F) Quantifying hysteresis for autonomous feedback loops Aut-RFB (orange) and Aut-IFB (blue). We show p-values from a T-test quantifying the differences between the terminal responses of ON-history and OFF-history cells over replicates; the dotted line shows p = 0.05.

        <title>Model-independent predictions</title>
        <p>In principle, the prediction procedure is straightforward: holding the regulator fixed, we must extract the appropriate input-output characteristic from the PLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), and find its points of intersection with the appropriate line of equivalence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). In practice, there are two complications. First, because the PLF is determined only for a discrete set of input values, some type of interpolation procedure is required before we can detect intersections. Second, two experiments performed with the same construct under different growth conditions will be characterized by different values of the AHL-to-density proportionality constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so their DDRs will be relatively stretched or squeezed along the density axis.</p>
        <p>As a first pass we opted for a predictive procedure that required no underlying mechanistic model or adjustable parameters: we used power-law interpolation, corresponding to linear interpolation in log-log space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Savageau1">[40]</xref>, and did not allow for any variation in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The PLF measurements showed slight deviations between replicates; we incorporated this uncertainty into our prediction procedure using a Monte Carlo approach. Essentially, we added log-normal noise to the measured datapoints and generated an ensemble of predicted intersections over 1000 trials (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>: Model-independent predictions). For the Rec-RFB system our model-independent predictions correctly captured, within a factor of two, both the terminal magnitude of LuxR::YFP levels in feedback, as well as the threshold aTc concentration at which the system becomes activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). For the Aut-RFB system, although we predicted a consistently low terminal level of LuxR::YFP independent of IPTG concentration, the system was observed to be induced by an order of magnitude starting around IPTG = 50 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The Aut-IFB case was the most interesting: in this case, we detected multiple intersections of the input-output characteristic with the line of equivalence, implying that the feedback system should be bistable and hysteretic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Angeli1">[26]</xref>. Indeed, the terminal feedback response showed a strong hysteresis of LuxI::CFP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), and our predictions correctly captured the magnitude of the low and high states. However, we only predicted hysteresis for IPTG≥50 µM, whereas it was observed even at IPTG = 10 µM. Surprisingly, both the autonomous systems were induced <italic>below</italic> the predicted threshold IPTG level, even though they were grown to a lower final density than the receiver cells. We attribute this to the increased accumulation of AHL in the autonomous case, compared with the sender-receiver experiments in which AHL levels decay once sender cells are removed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>: AHL calibration; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s004">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>

        <p>The variations in the terminal density and AHL levels between different experimental modalities can be captured via the proportionality constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Incorporating this free parameter into the model-independent strategy is cumbersome. To proceed, we employed a more sophisticated interpolation strategy in which we fit the observed PLF to a parameterized functional form. Any function that reasonably described the PLF data would suit our purpose; for example, rational polynomial approximations are frequently used for non-linear systems identification in control theory. A biochemically-motivated form is particularly useful because it can be applied both to predict the macroscopic response of feedback loops, as well as to estimate the values of meaningful microscopic parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Setty1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Swem1">[41]</xref>.

By adjusting this single parameter we were able to predict full set of terminal responses for both the Aut-RFB as well as the Aut-IFB systems, for all seven values of IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g005">Fig. 5B,E</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our predictions have two substantive components. First, there is the <italic>qualitative</italic> prediction that the Rec-RFB and Aut-RFB systems should be non-hysteretic, and show smooth monotonic DDRs; while the Aut-IFB system should be hysteretic for some regulator levels, and show bistable DDRs. This prediction is robust and model-independent: it relies directly on the measured PLF, with no room for adjustment. That our observations precisely match these qualitative predictions is our strongest result. Second, there is the <italic>quantitative</italic> prediction of the precise induction thresholds and expression magnitudes for each system. These quantitative predictions substantially match the very different observed terminal responses of the Rec-RFB, Aut-RFB and Aut-IFB systems: in all cases we correctly capture the threshold inducer levels and saturating output levels over the full set of regulator values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g005">Fig. 5B,C,E</xref>). In two instances, however, the observed response is more gradual than predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g005">Fig. 5B,C</xref>). This could be due to ‘critical slowing down’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Tredicce1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Chisholm1">[44]</xref>, a phenomenon that causes dynamical systems close to a sharp threshold to display slowed kinetics. To explore this further, we used our fitted parameter to predict the <italic>dynamic</italic> responses of the autonomous feedback systems as functions of cell density, under rapid growth conditions. As expected, the observed expression levels lagged behind the dynamic predictions, particularly near sharp thresholds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>

        <title>The interplay of external regulation, promoter logic, and feedback topology</title>
        <p>The response of a natural LuxI/LuxR feedback system can be modified in three distinct ways: first, the expression level of the regulator could vary, perhaps in response to an external signal; second, the promoter logic function could be perturbed, for example by mutations that influence protein-DNA binding; third, the feedback topology itself could be switched, by large-scale DNA re-arrangements. In our experiments the autonomous LuxR-feedback and LuxI-feedback systems are composed of the same genetic components in permutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s010">Table S2</xref>); this change to the feedback topology, leaving promoter logic untouched, results in systems with completely different qualitative response types. We can use our biochemical model to explore more generally how regulation, promoter logic, and feedback interact to determine system response; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g006">Fig. 6</xref> shows our essential findings (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s013">Text S1</xref>: Bifurcation analysis of feedback loops; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). The two panels, corresponding to the two different feedback topologies, show identical slices of parameter space: the Hill coefficient of LuxR-DNA binding, and therefore the promoter logic function, is varied along the <italic>x</italic>-axis; the expression level of the regulator is varied along the <italic>y</italic>-axis. We see that both feedback topologies can achieve any of the possible response types if parameter values are carefully selected. However, given a set of LuxI/LuxR homologs whose biochemical parameters are randomly assigned, one is much more likely to achieve an abrupt bistable response using a LuxI-feedback topology. Moreover, once biochemical parameters (such as the Hill coefficient) have been fixed, our model predicts that the LuxR-feedback topology is hardwired into a single response type, whereas the LuxI-feedback topology can be tuned between smooth and abrupt responses by varying the LuxR regulator level. This non-trivial prediction is corroborated by the fact that the same LuxI-feedback topology that shows a abrupt bistable response in our experiments generates a smooth monostable response when the LuxR regulator is expressed from a different constitutive promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Haseltine1">[29]</xref>.</p>

The boundaries between the four DDR types are computed numerically; any differences in these DDR boundaries between the two panels can be attributed to topology alone. Both LuxR-feedback and LuxI-feedback topologies can generate all four types of density-dependent responses; however, given the same microscopic parameters the two topologies can show distinct behaviors. The observed LuxR-feedback responses happens to fall near the monostable type M boundary, while the observed LuxI-feedback responses are solidly within the bistable type B region. Generically, for a given ‘hard-wired’ value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the LuxR-feedback response will be either type M (smooth) or type B (abrupt).

        <title>Dual feedback systems and oscillations</title>
        <p>The model-independent strategy we have described here is powerful and broadly applicable: the steady-state response of a feedback system, <italic>if it exists</italic>, will be at one of the self-consistent points where the input-output characteristic intersects the line of equivalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). However the converse is not true: not all these self-consistent intersections represent feedback steady-states. For example, the LuxI-feedback system has three intersection points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>), but only the low and high intersections represent stable steady-states. It is theoretically possible to predict stability properties if the system under consideration is monotone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Angeli1">[26]</xref>, a subtle technical requirement related to the internal structure of the black box; however, there is no direct method to determine if a given black box is monotone. A feedforward system in which an increase in any input leads to an increase in the output is monotone. From molecular data, we know that the pR promoter with LuxI and LuxR considered as its inputs satisfies this condition. A system with only internal positive feedback loops is also monotone. For example, consider the dual positive feedback case in which LuxI as well as LuxR are expressed downstream of pR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s007">Fig. S7A</xref>). One way to decompose this system is to cut the LuxI-feedback loop, and think of the monotone black box as the entire LuxR-feedback system we have already studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). The analysis proceeds precisely as before; there is no external regulator, but we can still predict density-dependent responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s007">Fig. S7B</xref>,C; Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s013">Text S1</xref>: The dual positive-feedback system). However, a black box that contains internal <italic>negative</italic> feedback loops might fail to be monotone. In this situation the model-independent theory is much more difficult to apply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Angeli2">[45]</xref>, but the model-based PLF parameters still prove useful.</p>
        <p>As a proof-of-principle, we constructed a system involving a dual positive/negative feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>); for positive feedback, we used the Aut-RFB system in which LuxR was expressed downstream of pR, while LuxI was expressed downstream of the pLac promoter; for negative feedback, we expressed the repressor LacI downstream of an additional copy of pR, and placed the entire construct in a LacI-deleted <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>: Dual-feedback experiments). On a LuxR vs. LuxI plot, the self-consistent solution is determined by the intersection of two curves: first, the positive-feedback curve in which the output LuxR is shown as a function of LuxI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g007">Fig. 7B,C:</xref> orange curve); second, the negative-feedback curve in which the output LuxI is shown as a function of LuxR, via LacI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g007">Fig. 7B,C:</xref> blue curve). The self-consistent solution does exist; however, the PLF parameters on their own cannot be used to determine its stability. To go further, we employed a differential equation formulation containing an extra dynamical parameter: the response rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of LuxI (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s013">Text S1</xref>: The dual positive/negative-feedback system). For certain values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002361.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the self-consistent solution is unstable, and the system is predicted to oscillate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g007">Fig. 7C,E</xref>). Indeed we observed such oscillations in density-clamped chemostat experiments, synchronized over the entire cell population, with a period of several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002361-g007">Fig. 7H</xref>). Synchronized oscillations in a LuxI/LuxR-based positive/negative-feedback system have already been reported, and comprehensively analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Danino1">[46]</xref>. Our goal here is only to show that, while the PLF on its own does not contain sufficient information to predict oscillations, it nevertheless does restrict the number of additional parameters that need to be considered. Taken together, the success of our predictions demonstrates our central claim: that the promoter logic function of pR contains sufficient biochemical information to determine the feedback responses of diverse quorum-sensing systems.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Any predictive mechanistic description of quorum sensing must be able to connect microscopic rules to macroscopic phenotype. There are essentially three strategies for doing this, distinguished by the level at which measurements must be made. First, we could directly measure all the relevant microscopic biochemical parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Urbanowski1">[12]</xref>. This approach, while truly predictive, quickly becomes infeasible as the complexity of the system increases and the number of unknown parameters explodes. Second, we could measure the macroscopic response itself, and use these to fit the parameters of a mechanistic model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Haseltine1">[29]</xref>. This approach provides molecular insight and explanatory power, and can be used to rule out models inconsistent with the observed behavior. However, explaining the macroscopic response is not equivalent to predicting it <italic>a priori</italic>. Third, we could make measurements at an intermediate mesoscopic scale, far removed from molecular detail but still below the level of the phenotype of interest. For gene-regulatory networks, this amounts in practice to characterizing the behavior of isolated components of larger feedback systems. Such measurements can be used to estimate ‘lower level’ molecular parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Setty1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Swem1">[41]</xref>; but they can also be directly applied to predict ‘higher level’ phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Rosenfeld2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Guido1">[47]</xref>. This mesoscopic approach is the one we have taken here. Our central finding is that promoter logic acts as a biochemical focal point: many types of microscopic rules might result in the same promoter logic function, but it is this function alone that determines the macroscopic density-dependent response. This assertion is demonstrated by our ability to predict the density dependent responses of three distinct feedback loops based only on the measured promoter logic, using no free parameters except the density scale. We expect our approach to be broadly applicable, though it will tend to fail if measured promoter logic is perturbed when the system is embedded within a larger network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Anand1">[48]</xref>, or if the system is influenced by network-host interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Tan1">[49]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have seen that the versatility of LuxI/LuxR quorum-sensing systems arises from the interplay between promoter logic and feedback topology. It is interesting that many transcriptionally characterized LuxI/LuxR systems use a LuxI-feedback configuration, whereas LuxR is typically placed downstream of a promoter that responds to environmental inputs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002361-t001">Table 1</xref>). The natural preference for LuxI feedback is unlikely to be the result of a frozen accident, because quorum sensing genes have been repeatedly shuffled over evolutionary timescales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Gray1">[7]</xref>. Moreover, this preference cannot be driven by selection for a particular response type, because both topologies can achieve any desired response given the right promoter logic parameter values. We suggest instead that the LuxI-feedback configuration has been selected for its capacity to generate different response types via modulation of the regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Voigt2">[50]</xref>. Feedback topology and promoter logic are ‘hard wired’ (they can only be changed by mutations or re-arrangements at the DNA level), whereas regulator expression can respond dynamically to external cues. This tunability becomes relevant when cells must cope with uncertain or time-varying conditions: the choice between a smooth density-dependent response, abrupt activation, or noise-driven heterogeneity will be dictated by the ecological context. To test this conjecture we would need to observe the quorum-sensing capacities of bacterial species in their natural environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Manefield1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Keller1">[51]</xref>, determine whether cell populations do indeed tune their responses, and gauge the extent to which this flexibility has any impact on fitness. As new bacterial genomes are sequenced, the number of putative LuxI/LuxR systems will rise exponentially, and we will be limited only by the rate at which we can experimentally characterize their behavior. The predictive framework we have developed provides a reliable and scalable way to explore the design, function, and diversity of these versatile cell-to-cell communication systems.</p>

For the Aut-IFB system, at high cell densities (OD<sub>600</sub>&gt;0.5 after 8+ hours of growth) we found that a sub-population of cells consistently lost fluorescence (possibly due to to plasmid loss, as the media are antibiotic-free; see below). These cells were removed by thresholding on LuxI::CFP levels when calculating population averages. To investigate the cause of fluorescence loss, Aut-IFB cells were imaged at the 0 h and 12 h timepoints; they were then diluted by a factor of 100, and 35 µl of this culture was transferred into 3 ml glucose-M9 medium containing 1 µM AHL. These cells were grown for a subsequent 12 h, then imaged. If bistability were the cause of the low fluorescence population, we would expect fluorescence to recover in the presence of AHL; instead, we see a total fluorescence loss at the 24 h timepoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s008">Fig. S8A</xref>). Colony forming units (CFU) were measured at the 0 h and 12 h timepoints: 50 µl of diluted culture (at dilution factors of 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup>) was spread and grown for 12 h at 37°C on LB agar plates containing spectinomycin (25 µg/ml) and ampicillin (50 µg/ml), or spectinomycin alone. Cells were observed to be predominantly ampicillin-resistant at the 0 h timepoint but not at the 12 h timepoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s008">Fig. S8B</xref>), suggesting plasmid loss as the cause of fluorescence loss.</p>

        <p>Cells from 1 ml of culture were pelleted by centrifugation at 13.2 k rpm for 10 minutes at 37°C, then re-suspended in 10 µl of 1% glucose-M9 medium. 4 µl of this suspension was placed on a microscope slides (Thomas Scientific), and pressed gently under a coverslip. Samples were imaged on a fully automated Zeiss Axiovert M200 epifluorescence microscope with a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments Pixis). Phase contrast images as well as fluorescence images using CFP and YFP filter sets (Chroma) were acquired for each field of view. 8–15 fields were imaged from a given sample, depending on the cell density. (A small proportion of the imaging was performed on an Olympus IX81 microscope in DIC and fluorescence modes; standard calibration curves were used to match CFP and YFP values between the Olympus and Zeiss instruments. Dual-feedback oscillation experiments were conducted on the Zeiss system with an altered camera gain for improved signal.) Images were analyzed using the MATLAB image processing toolbox (Mathworks). Phase contrast or DIC images were used to generate a binary cell mask, with morphological constraints used to filter out non-cell objects. The mask was then applied to fluorescence images to calculate the average CFP and YFP intensity per pixel of single cells, for a population of ∼500 cells in each sample. Single-cell fluorescence values were approximately log-normally distributed; population-averaged fluorescence signals were calculated as the geometric mean of single-cell values, and error bars were determined as standard deviations between means over replicates.</p>

Aut-RFB: Here, IPTG is used to modulate the regulator LuxI::CFP, which takes on values distinct from those used to determine the PLF. To account for this, we first generated predicted intersections for each aTc-induced LuxI::CFP level of the PLF, as with Rec-RFB. We then used power-law interpolation to find predicted values at the desired IPTG-induced LuxI::CFP level. Aut-IFB: On a log-log plot of CFP vs. LuxI::CFP (determined from the PLF holding IPTG, therefore LuxR::YFP, fixed), we connected datapoints by straight lines and enumerated all the intersections with the line of equivalence.

        <p>Rec-FF cells were grown in LB for 10 h, transferred to 3 ml glucose-M9 minimal medium prepared with 20 µM of synthetic AHL (Sigma-Aldrich), then grown for varying periods (0, 4, 8, and 12 h) to a target density OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.1. The culture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. AHL from the supernatant was extracted twice using an equal volume of ethyl acetate. Extracted samples were dried using a centrifugal evaporator (Labconco) at 35°C for 30 min. Pellets were resuspeneded in 1 ml solution of MilliQ water (60%) and methanol (40%). Samples were analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu) using an RP-18e column (Purospher STAR, 250×4.6 mm, 0.5 µM). Components were isocratically eluted with 60∶40 water/methanol (v/v) at a total flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the absorption at 253 nm was recorded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s004">Fig. S4A</xref>, inset). All solvents and samples in this protocol were acidified with 0.1 ml/l acetic acid, as AHL is unstable at alkaline pH. The same protocol was then repeated omitting the introduction of Rec-FF cells at the first step. We obtained a linear calibration between AHL concentration and peak area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s004">Fig. S4A</xref>), and found that the measurement was sensitive down to an AHL concentration of ∼1 µM. Rec-FF cells did not appreciably affect AHL degradation, which occurs with a half-life of 4.3±0.2 h in the absence of cells, and 4.0±0.1 h in their presence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s004">Fig. S4B</xref>). Terminal AHL levels in our feedforward and feedback experiments were below the detection limit of the HPLC protocol, and could not be directly measured. We therefore titrated synthetic AHL against the response of Rec-FF cells, with LuxR induced using 500 µM IPTG. Cells were grown in glucose-M9 medium with varying AHL concentrations for 12 h, upto a target density OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.1, and their CFP expression was determined by imaging. The response curve is best fit with a Hill coefficient of 1.9±0.5, and a half-saturation value of 825 nM AHL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s004">Fig. S4C</xref>). This half-saturation value is an over-estimate as AHL decays over the 12 h duration of the experiment; biochemical measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Urbanowski1">[12]</xref> suggest a value closer to 85 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002361.s004">Fig. S4D</xref>).</p>

        <p>The construction of the dual positive/negative-feedback system has been described in Anand et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002361-Anand1">[48]</xref>. Briefly, the Aut-RFB construct was extended by placing LacI downstream of an additional copy of the pR promoter, while LuxI was expressed downstream of a CRP-dependent pLac promoter. This ampicillin-resistant plasmid construct was transformed into the <italic>lacI</italic> deleted kanamycin-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strain JW0336-1 (CGSC, Yale University). Cells from fresh colonies were first grown in 3 ml LB for 5 h; a 1 ml aliquot was then diluted to a final volume of 100 ml using 1% succinate-M9 medium containing 1 µM AHL, and grown for 5 h to a density of OD<sub>600</sub>∼0.15. Cells were extracted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 4 minutes at 25°C, and re-suspended in 2 ml warm nitrogen-limited (1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) succinate-M9; 1 ml portions were transferred into two replicate flasks and diluted upto 50 ml with nitrogen-limited succinate-M9 medium containing 1 µM AHL. A nitrogen-limited chemostat culture was established at 37°C at a dilution rate of 0.15/h, operating at a steady-state OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.185. During first 12 h, the source flask was replenished every 4 h with fresh medium containing 1 µM AHL; this was done to ‘prime’ the system into a high LuxR state. At this 12 h timepoint in the oscillation experiment, AHL-absent medium was provided in the source flask, causing AHL in the growth flask to dilute out. In control experiments, the source flask continued to be replenished every 4 h with AHL-containing medium. All growth media in these experiments contained 100 µg/ml ampicillin. OD<sub>600</sub> was measured every 3 h, and cells were imaged every 45 min as described above.</p>

          <p><bold>LuxI/LuxR quorum-sensing systems.</bold> LuxI (blue circle) is an enzyme that synthesizes acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL; white square). LuxR (orange circle) is a transcriptional activator. (A) At low cell densities, LuxR is expressed at high levels from the pL promoter, while LuxI is expressed at a basal level from the pR promoter. AHL is synthesized at low levels, and diffuses freely across the cell membrane. LuxR remains in an inactive form. (B) At high cell densities, the aggregate synthesis of AHL from many cells drives up its extracellular and intracellular concentration, promoting LuxR-AHL binding. AHL-bound LuxR activates transcription of LuxI at the pR promoter, driving a positive feedback loop.</p>
