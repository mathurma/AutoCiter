<p>An actin regulatory protein unexpectedly also controls microtubule polymerization during the formation and maintenance of cellular outgrowths in neurons.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Capping protein (CP) is a heterodimer that regulates actin assembly by binding to the barbed end of F-actin. In cultured nonneuronal cells, each CP subunit plays a critical role in the organization and dynamics of lamellipodia and filopodia. Mutations in either α or β CP subunit result in retinal degeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, the function of CP subunits in mammalian neurons remains unclear. Here, we investigate the role of the β CP subunit expressed in the brain, Capzb2, in growth cone morphology and neurite outgrowth. We found that silencing Capzb2 in hippocampal neurons resulted in short neurites and misshapen growth cones in which microtubules overgrew into the periphery and completely overlapped with F-actin. In searching for the mechanisms underlying these cytoskeletal abnormalities, we identified β-tubulin as a novel binding partner of Capzb2 and demonstrated that Capzb2 decreases the rate and the extent of tubulin polymerization in vitro. We mapped the region of Capzb2 that was required for the subunit to interact with β-tubulin and inhibit microtubule polymerization. A mutant Capzb2 lacking this region was able to bind F-actin and form a CP heterodimer with α2-subunit. However, this mutant was unable to rescue the growth cone and neurite outgrowth phenotypes caused by Capzb2 knockdown. Together, these data suggest that Capzb2 plays an important role in growth cone formation and neurite outgrowth and that the underlying mechanism may involve direct interaction between Capzb2 and microtubules.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Neuronal growth, migration, and survival depend on the regulated formation of cellular outgrowths called neurites. Extension of normal neurites requires coordinated interactions between cytoskeletal networks made up of microfilaments (composed of F-actin) and microtubules (formed by tubulin) in structures called growth cones that form at the tips of growing neurites. Capping protein (CP) is a heterodimer that regulates F-actin assembly in a variety of cell types. Surprisingly, the neuronal CP β subunit, Capzb2, not only regulates F-actin assembly, but also inhibits microtubule polymerization by direct interaction with tubulin. We further show that this function of Capzb2 is required for establishment of the normal shape of growth cones and the appropriate length of neurites. Our data thus reveal an unexpected, dual role for CP in the regulation of both microfilaments and microtubules in neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Growth cone morphology and neurite outgrowth are controlled by temporally and spatially coordinated interactions between two major cytoskeletal networks, F-actin and microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dehmelt1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Zhou1">[3]</xref>.

A recent study using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of tauopathy suggests that abnormalities in the actin cyoskeleton play a causative role in neurotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Fulga1">[15]</xref>. In support of this, a mutagenesis screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> revealed that homozygous mutations in either of the two subunits of F-actin capping protein (CP) resulted in the accumulation of F-actin and degeneration of photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Delalle1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>CP is an F-actin binding protein that functions as an α/β heterodimer. The heterodimer binds the barbed end of F-actin, thereby blocking the access of actin monomers to the fast growing end of F-actin. This binding is mediated by the two extreme C-terminal regions of the α- and β-subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Casella1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Wear1">[18]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, each CP unit is encoded by a single gene. In mammals, the α-subunit is encoded by three separate genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Hart1">[19]</xref>, whereas the β-subunit is encoded by one gene that gives rise to three isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Schafer1">[20]</xref>. One of these isoforms, Capzb2, is predominantly expressed in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Schafer1">[20]</xref>. Both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian CP subunits have been shown to play a critical role in the organization and dynamics of lamellipodia and filopodia in nonneuronal cells by regulating the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Mejillano1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Iwasa1">[22]</xref>. However, the role of the CP subunits in mammalian neurons is currently unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate the function of Capzb2 in growth cone formation and neurite outgrowth, processes that are relevant to the regenerative response of injured neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Peeva1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Haas1">[6]</xref>. We provide evidence that Capzb2 plays an essential role in these processes and that, surprisingly, the underlying mechanism may involve direct interaction between Capzb2 and microtubules.</p>

<title>Capzb2 RNA Interference Causes Shorter Neurites in Hippocampal Neurons</title>
<p>To investigate the neuronal function of Capzb2, we generated a small hairpin RNA construct (Capzb2 shRNA). Capzb2 shRNA effectively knocked down the expression of Capzb2 in mouse neuroblastoma CAD cells and embryonic rat hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g001">Figure 1A–1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000208.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Capzb2 shRNA efficiently knocks down the expression of Capzb2 in CAD cells and primary hippocampal neurons.</title>
<p>CAD (mouse neuroblastoma) cells (A and B) and embryonic rat hippocampal neurons (E17) (C and D) were transfected with either control shRNA (A and C) or Capzb2 shRNA (B and D) and fixed 72 h posttransfection. In all, green represents cells transfected with either control or Capzb2 shRNA/pEGFP. Capzb2 signal (blue) is detected in CAD cells and hippocampal neurons transfected with control shRNA/pEGFP and in nontransfected cells (A and C), whereas it is greatly reduced in cells transfected with Capzb2 shRNA/pEGFP (arrows in [B and D]). Actin labeling (red) (B) and the DIC image (B and D) highlight the absence of processes in Capzb2 shRNA/pEGFP-transfected cell. Scale bars indicate 10 µm.</p>

<p>We next compared the levels of expression of Capzb2 protein in the embryonic and adult mouse hippocampus and cortex. Capzb2 was detected in both the cortex and hippocampus of embryonic and adult mice. However, the signal was much stronger in the adult hippocampus than in the adult cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000208.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Compared to the embryonic stage, the expression of Capzb2 in the adult was significantly reduced in the cortex, but not in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000208.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Because Capzb2 RNA interference (RNAi) seemed to reduce the length of processes in CAD cells and primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we decided to quantify the effect of Capzb2 shRNA on mouse hippocampal neurites. We measured the lengths of all of the neurites of GFP-immunoreactive neurons that were transfected with one the following combination of constructs: control shRNA/pEGFP, Capzb2 shRNA/pEGFP, or Capzb2 shRNA+RNAi-resistant Capzb2-EGFP. The measurement of GFP-positive neurites was performed on the images of these neurons obtained with bright-field settings and the appropriate differential interference contrast (DIC) to ensure the complete outline of all of the neuronal processes. The analysis showed that Capzb2 shRNA significantly reduced the length of both primary and secondary neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This effect of Capzb2 shRNA was abolished by the expression of RNAi-resistant Capzb2-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These data suggest that Capzb2 plays a critical role in neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons.</p>

<title>Capzb2 RNAi causes shorter neurites and alters morphology of growth cones/actin-rich neuritic endings in hippocampal neurons.</title>
<p>(A) Mean length of primary and secondary neurites of neurons transfected with control shRNA/pEGFP, Capzb2 shRNA/pEGFP, or Capzb2 shRNA/RNAi resistant (Res) Capzb2-EGFP (ratio 4∶1) were analyzed 72 h posttransfection and 4% paraformaldehyde fixation. Capzb2 shRNA transfection results in reduced length of both primary and secondary neurites; concomitant transfection of RNAi Res Capzb2-EGFP reverses the effect of Capzb2 RNAi. Mean values ±s.e.m. (<italic>n</italic> = 100 neurons in each category) are depicted; *** = <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001. (B and C) Representative shRNA/pEGFP transfected neurons: (B) control shRNA/pEGFP and (C) Capzb2 shRNA/pEGFP; GFP (green), F-actin (red), and βIII-tubulin (purple); scale bar indicates 10 µm.

(E) Higher magnification of a growth cone delineated by the white box in (C) in which there is overlap of F-actin (red) and βIII-tubulin (purple) signal; scale bar indicates 5 µm. Note the altered morphology as characterized by the absence of lamellipodia, resulting in a fork-like appearance. (F) Representative images of βIII-tubulin (purple) and F-actin (red) in normal, fork-like, and unclassified growth cones/actin-rich neuritic endings (scale bar indicates 5 µm), and quantification of each of these categories in neurons transfected with control shRNA/pEGFP, Capzb2 shRNA/pEGFP, and Capzb2 shRNA+RNAi Res Capzb2-EGFP (rescue transfection). The neurons were fixed in PHEM buffer 48 h posttransfection. The neuritic ending morphology classified as fork-like lacked lamellipodia, and the βIII-tubulin signal (purple) extended into the periphery and overlapped with F-actin (red) rather than being confined centrally as in normal growth cones. Fork-like “growth cones” dominated in neurons transfected with Capzb2 shRNA, whereas normal growth cones were significantly more common in control and rescue conditions. The third category, unclassified, represents neuritic endings that could not be classified as either normal or fork-like. These neuritic endings had uniform appearance and were found in similar frequencies across the experimental conditions. more than 230 growth cones/actin-rich neuritic endings from neurons belonging to each category were analyzed; mean values ±s.e.m. are depicted; *** = <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001.

<title>Capzb2 RNAi Alters Growth Cone Morphology in Hippocampal Neurons</title>
<p>The morphology of growth cones is mainly dependent on two cytoskeletal proteins, F-actin and tubulin. To investigate whether Capzb2 might regulate the cytoskeleton in growth cones of cultured hippocampal neurons, we examined the effect of Capzb2 shRNA on the distribution of F-actin and tubulin in growth cones of transfected hippocampal neurons. In control neurons, the majority of growth cones exhibited normal morphology, comprised of a central tubulin-rich zone and a peripheral F-actin–rich zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figure 2B, 2D, and 2F</xref>). However, in Capzb2 shRNA-transfected neurons, growth cones more often exhibited an abnormal “fork-like” morphology, characterized by the absence of lamellipodia and the extension of microtubules into the peripheral F-actin–rich zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figure 2C, 2E, and 2F</xref>). We quantified the number of normal growth cones and abnormal fork-like ones in neurons transfected with control shRNA, Capzb2 shRNA, or both Capzb2 shRNA and RNAi-resistant EGFP-Capzb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Normal growth cones were the dominant form of neuritic endings in both control shRNA-transfected neurons and neurons cotransfected with Capzb2 shRNA and RNAi-resistant EGFP-Capzb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figure 2G</xref>), whereas fork-like structures were mostly associated with neurons transfected with Capzb2 shRNA only. Neuritic endings that could not be clearly classified as either normal growth cones or fork-like structures were designated as “unclassified.” The percentage of neuritic endings that belonged to the unclassified category was the same among all of the groups.</p>
<p>These results suggest that Capzb2 influences microtubule extension into the peripheral domain of a growth cone, raising the question whether Capzb2 may act directly on microtubules or indirectly via actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Zhou2">[23]</xref>. To address this question, we assessed the effect of Capzb2 on microtubules in neurons treated with cytochalasin D (CytD), which removes the actin meshwork and thus prevents inhibitory action of actin retrograde flow on microtubules in growth cones. In a blinded image analysis, we quantified the area of the growth cone not invaded by microtubules in neurons transfected with control shRNA or Capzb2 shRNA and treated with CytD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To visualize microtubules in the growth cones, we used tyrosinated α-tubulin antibody because the tyrosinated form of microtubules is the dominant one in the growth cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Robson1">[24]</xref>. The average percentage of growth cone area not invaded by microtubules (percentage of region of interest, ROI%) was significantly lower in neurons transfected with Capzb2 shRNA than in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that Capzb2 may directly influence microtubule extension into the peripheral domain of a growth cone.</p>

<p>(A and B) Visualization of microtubules in the growth cones was obtained with tyrosinated α-tubulin antibody signal (Tyr-tubulin, yellow); F-actin (red) upon CytD treatment. The percentage of growth cone area not invaded by microtubules (ROI%, white area) was obtained upon subtraction of Tyr-tubulin signal from the total growth cone area visualized on DIC image.

<title>Capzb2 Associates with βIII-Tubulin and Decreases Tubulin Polymerization In Vitro in a Concentration-Dependent Manner</title>
<p>It has previously been hypothesized that proteins that interact with both F-actin and microtubules may play a role in growth cone dynamics, such as regulating the invasion of microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dehmelt1">[1]</xref>. Interestingly, in addition to actin, β-tubulin was among the few proteins that were pulled down from mouse brain lysates by GST-Capzb2 (unpublished data). The microtubule invasion phenotype caused by Capzb2 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figures 2E, 2F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g003">3B</xref>) further raised the possibility that Capzb2 might interact with neuronal microtubules. In support of this possibility, we found that Capzb2 and βIII-tubulin coimmunoprecipitate from brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref>).</p>
<fig id="pbio-1000208-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000208.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption>
<title>Capzb2 coimmunoprecipitates with βIII-tubulin in brain lysates and decreases tubulin polymerization in vitro.</title>
<p>(A) In order to avoid overlap of the heavy chain signal (∼50 kDa) with the βIII-tubulin signal (∼55 kDa) in the immunoprecipitation using the Capzb2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the antibody was coupled to the protein G/A beads through cross-linking. βIII-tubulin and Capzb2 signals were each detected following immunoprecipitation from brain lysate with both βIII-tubulin rabbit antibody (rAb)-coupled beads and Capzb2 mAb-coupled beads. The expected molecular weight of Capzb2 (28–32 kDa) and βIII-tubulin (∼55 kDa) is confirmed in brain lysate (3 µg). (B) Similarly, βIII-tubulin signal was detected specifically both in immunoprecipitations with Capzb2 mAb-coupled beads and with βIII-tubulin rAb-coupled beads, as confirmed in the brain lysate lane. (C) Capzb2 was also specifically precipitated also by βIII-tubulin rAb that was not cross-linked to the protein G/A beads; the expected molecular weight of Capzb2 was detected in the brain lysate lane. (D) Tubulin monomers were incubated in the presence of 0.05 mg/ml tau only or together with 10 µM of GST-Capzb2 or 10 µM of GST-tag. GST-tag alone did not alter tubulin polymerization. GST-Capzb2 decreased the maximal level of microtubule assembly by approximately 40%. Curves represent mean change in optical density (OD) at 30-s intervals.

The darkly shaded region indicates the interval in which the final extent of tubulin polymerization is achieved. (F) To determine the concentration of Capzb2 required for 50% reduction in the rate of tubulin polymerization (Capzb2 EC<sub>50</sub>-<italic>RATE</italic>), a nonlinear sigmoidal curve was fitted to the average OD during the exponential phase of tubulin polymerization (interval 180–750 s; lightly shaded in [E]) versus Capzb2 concentration.

(G) In the presence of increasing of Capzb2 concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 10 µM, the extent of tubulin polymerization is reduced by 8%, 16%, and 35%, respectively. The average of 25 OD readings obtained for each of the Capzb2 concentrations examined was normalized against the average OD reading in the absence of Capzb2 during 750–1,500-s interval (darkly shaded in [E]) in which the final extent of tubulin polymerization is achieved for a given reaction. Capzb2 concentration is displayed on a log of 10 scale, so the first depicted point (tubulin polymerization in the absence of Capzb2; OD value = 100%) on the obtained nonlinear sigmoidal curve (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99) corresponds to 0.01 on the Log Capzb2 (µM). The concentration of 0.1 µM Capzb2 (the second depicted point on the curve) does not reduce the extent of tubulin polymerization although it does affect the rate (as seen in [F]).</p>

<title>Identification of the Capzb2 region necessary for binding tubulin and for the effect on tubulin polymerization.</title>
<p>(A–D) Specific GST-tagged Capzb2 protein segments show differential ability to pull down βIII-tubulin from mouse brain lysates (A and B) or to bind β-tubulin in vitro (C and D). The average ratio (<italic>n</italic> = 3) between the signal for the GST-tagged Capzb2 full-length/protein segment and the βIII-tubulin signal obtained in pull-down assays from brain lysates (C) or the β-tubulin signal in in vitro binding assays (D) is shown. Note that GST-tagged full-length Capzb2 and GST-tagged Capzb2 N-terminus 1–140 show a strong affinity for β-tubulin, whereas smaller GST-Capzb2 fragments (N-terminus 1–105 and N-terminus 1–69) showed progressively weaker affinities for β-tubulin in vitro; GST-tag alone serves as a negative control. (E) Tubulin polymerization assay was performed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, in the presence of 10 µM GST-Capzb2, or one of three progressively shorter GST-Capzb2 N-terminus segments. Similar to GST-Capzb2, GST-Capzb2 N-terminus 1–140 decreased the rate and extent of polymerization. However, GST-Capzb2 N-terminus 1–105 and GST-Capzb2 N-terminus 1–69 did not have a negative effect on tubulin polymerization. (F) Tubulin polymerization assay was performed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g004">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g005">5E</xref>, in the presence of 10 µM GST-Capzb2, 10 µM GST-Capzb2Δ106–140, 10 µM GST-Capzb2 C-terminus 141–271, or 10 µM GST-Capza2. Capzb2 deletion mutant lacking region Δ106–140 did not have a negative effect on tubulin polymerization. In addition, neither Capzb2 C-terminus 141–271 nor the other CP unit, Capza2, affected tubulin polymerization, whereas Capzb2 decreased both the rate and the extent of polymerization. (G and H) When compared with GST-Capzb2, GST-Capzb2Δ106–140 could not specifically precipitate βIII-tubulin from brain lysate (G) and was not able to bind β-tubulin in vitro (H); GST tag alone served as a negative control (G and H). (I) Capzb2 or Capzb2Δ106–140 were incubated alone or in the presence of F-actin. Upon centrifugation, both the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) of each reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. A representative experiment of four performed is displayed. In the presence of F-actin, both Capzb2Δ106–140 and Capzb2 are comparably cosedimented with F-actin. Densitometry indicates that the percentage of Capzb2Δ106–140 (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and the percentage of Capzb2 (<italic>n</italic> = 8) bound to F-actin do not differ significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.69). (J) GST-Capzb2+GST-Capza2 and GST-Capzb2Δ106–140 (1 µM)+GST-Capza2 (1 µM) were incubated for 10 min at 4°C and subjected to native PAGE. Gels were analyzed with Denville Blue stain. Following destaining, the bands were excised and their content was extracted under alkaline conditions and subjected to Western blot analysis. Note that the GST-Capzb2Δ106–140 signal is weak due to the relatively lower affinity of this mutant for the Denville Blue stain in comparison to GST-Capza2. Thus, the GST-Capzb2Δ106–140 lane is overexposed. Western blot analysis indicates the identity of GST-Capzb2, GST-Capza2, and GST-Capzb2Δ106–140. When incubated with GST-Capza2, both GST-Capzb2 and GST-Capzb2Δ106–140 give rise to a similar profile of heterodimer complexes.</p>

<p>On the basis of these data, we concluded that Capzb2 residues 106–140 might be important for Capzb2 interaction with microtubules. We also tested Capzb2 C-terminus 141–271 and Capza2, the other CP subunit with secondary and tertiary structures resembling those of Capzb2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Wear2">[26]</xref>. Neither of these proteins had an effect on tubulin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g005">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000208.s003">Figure S3</xref>). As predicted, the deletion mutant Capzb2Δ106–140 did not affect microtubule polymerization in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g005">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000208.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Furthermore, Capzb2Δ106–140 was unable to either precipitate or bind β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g005">Figure 5G and 5H</xref>), although it was able to bind F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g005">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000208.s005">Figure S5</xref>) and form a CP heterodimer with α2-subunit (Capza2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g005">Figure 5J</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined whether Capzb2Δ106–140 could rescue the neurite outgrowth and growth cone phenotypes caused by Capzb2 shRNA. To this end, we created EGFP-tagged Capzb2Δ106–140, which was well expressed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000208.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Nevertheless, the frequency of neurons transfected with Capzb2 shRNA+EGFP-Capzb2Δ106–140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g006">Figure 6</xref>) was lower than that in neurons transfected with Capzb2 shRNA/pEGFP or Capzb2 shRNA+RNAi-resistant Capzb2-EGFP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). We found that neuritic lengths of primary and secondary neurites transfected with Capzb2 shRNA+EGFP-Capzb2Δ106–140 (representative neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) were similar to those in neurons transfected with Capzb2 shRNA/pEGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Few normal growth cones were found in either group examined, whereas fork-like neuritic endings were common in both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These data suggest that the ability of Capzb2 to regulate growth cone formation and neurite outgrowth is dependent on its microtubule-interacting region.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CP is an F-actin binding protein that plays a key role in actin assembly. Previous studies have shown that CP regulates the organization and dynamics of lamellipodia and filopodia in nonneuronal cells and supports the survival of <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors. In this study, we investigated the function of Capzb2, the CP β-subunit isoform expressed in the brain. We have shown that Capzb2 is essential for neurite outgrowth and growth cone morphology in cultured mammalian neurons. In addition, we have uncovered a new role for Capzb2 in cytoskeletal regulation: inhibiting microtubule polymerization by direct interaction with tubulin.</p>
<p>The organization and dynamics of F-actin and microtubules play a central role in neurite initiation and extension. Thus, as an important regulator of F-actin assembly, Capzb2 is likely critical for neurite outgrowth. Consistent with this, silencing of Capzb2 in these neurons by shRNA results in short neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This defect was rescued by an RNAi-resistant vector for the expression of Capzb2-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Capzb2 is essential for neurite outgrowth.</p>
<p>The length of individual neurites is largely dependent on a functional growth cone with well-described dynamic morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dehmelt1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dent1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Tanaka1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dent2">[28]</xref>. The temporal and spatial changes in the organization of the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton in a growth cone have been extensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dehmelt1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dent1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dent2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Schaefer1">[29]</xref>. In general, two well-defined zones have been observed: a tubulin-rich central zone (C-zone) and an F-actin–rich peripheral zone (P-zone). The latter is composed of filopodial spikes separated by the lamellipodia, relatively splayed structures supported by a branched F-actin network. Central and peripheral zones are separated by the transitional zone (T-zone), which in addition to being rich in F-actin, also contains a few microtubules on their route to the P-zone. Within the P-zone, these microtubules preferentially grow along the filopodia, and not within lamellipodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dehmelt1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Schaefer1">[29]</xref>. The growth cones displaying characteristic zonal organization were rare in Capzb2 shRNA-transfected neurons in comparison to controls. Instead, the predominantly observed structure associated with neuritic endings in Capzb2 shRNA transfected neurons did not contain lamellipodia, supporting the notion that CP β-subunit is a necessary component for CP function in the formation of lamellipodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Mejillano1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Iwasa1">[22]</xref>. Additionally, the βIII-tubulin signal, rather than being confined to a central tubulin-rich zone characteristic of a normal growth cone, colocalized with F-actin signal in the periphery of a fork-like neuritic ending. These data suggest that Capzb2 plays a critical role in the functional morphology of a growth cone, thereby promoting neurite outgrowth.</p>
<p>Based on previous studies in nonneuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Mejillano1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Iwasa1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Wear2">[26]</xref>, the regulation of F-actin may underlie the function of Capzb2 in growth cone formation. Our data, however, suggest that a direct interaction between Capzb2 and microtubules may also be involved. We demonstrated the association between Capzb2 and β-tubulin by coimmunoprecipitation, GST pull-down, and in vitro binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g004">Figures 4A–4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g005">5A–5H</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that a mutant Capzb2 lacking the microtubule-interacting region, although capable of binding F-actin and forming a CP heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g005">Figure 5I and 5J</xref>), failed to rescue the defects in neurite outgrowth and growth cone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Finally, in the absence of branched F-actin filament meshwork, microtubule distribution in the growth cone is dependent on the presence of Capzb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Together, our data suggest that the interaction between Capzb2 and microtubules may contribute to the function of Capzb2 in growth cone formation and neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the interaction between CapZ and β-tubulin has been uncovered in mass spectrometry screen for the alterations in protein-target binding in vivo in response to spatial learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Nelson1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the context of the established cytoskeletal organization in the growth cone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dehmelt1">[1]</xref> and our data, we propose the following model for the function of Capzb2 effect in the neuronal growth cone: Capzb2 decreases the rate and the extent of tubulin polymerization within the T-zone and lamellipodia, thereby restricting the majority of microtubules to the C-zone and allowing only a few microtubules to enter the filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Without the interaction with Capzb2, the growth of microtubules into the periphery of the growth cone is unrestrained. Consequently, microtubules invade all of the filopodia, reaching their distal tips. This results in a complete overlap of microtubules and F-actin in the periphery and the disappearance of the lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, the normal growth cone structure characterized by the distinct C-, T-, and P-zones is replaced by fork-like neuritic endings in which the tubulin and F-actin signals completely overlap. The premature disappearance of the growth cone results in the premature termination of neurite growth and thus diminished neurite length.</p>

Note that microtubules are concentrated in the C-zone; only occasionally do microtubules traverse into the T-zone to grow along the filopodia in the P-zone. (B) In the absence of an interaction with Capzb2, growth of microtubules is unrestrained, resulting in the complete overlap between microtubules and the F-actin–rich periphery.

<p>Our study, together with the known function of CP in actin assembly, suggests that Capzb2 may act as a key coordinator of the assembly of F-actin and microtubules, the two major cytoskeletal networks that determine the morphology and dynamics of growth cones. The importance of Capzb2 for neurite outgrowth is particularly interesting in light of the recently established role of Ena/VASP in neuritogenesis in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Kwiatkowski1">[31]</xref>. In contrast to the role that CP plays in supporting the formation of lamellipodia, Ena/VASP are F-actin barbed-end capping proteins that promote the formation of filopodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Kwiatkowski1">[31]</xref>. Thus, it is likely that coordinated assembly of lamellipodia and filopodia, controlled by proteins with opposing activity, is essential for growth cone formation and neurite outgrowth.</p>

Primary neurites were measured from the soma of the neuron to the terminal end of the primary process. Secondary neurites were measured from the junction of the primary and secondary neurite to the terminal end of the secondary process. For the analysis of growth cone morphology, images of the F-actin and tubulin signals were also obtained, overlaid, and the actin-rich neuritic endings were classified as discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>. For the analysis of growth cone area free of microtubule invasion after CytD treatment, an IPLab program was used to delineate a growth cone area on a DIC image (ROI). Following the subtraction of the area occupied by tyrosinated tubulin signal, the percentage of ROI (ROI%) free of tyrosinated tubulin signal was obtained.</p>

<title>Tubulin In Vitro Polymerization Assay</title>
<p>Absorbance-based tubulin polymerization assays were performed to evaluate the effect of Capzb2 on the assembly of microtubules. Polymerization of bovine tubulin monomers (cytoskeleton, 60 µM) in general tubulin buffer (PEM: 80 mM PIPES, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM EGTA [pH 6.9]) supplemented with 1 mM GTP and 10% v/v glycerol was initiated by incubation at 37°C, and changes in turbidity were measured by absorbance at 30-s intervals at 340 nm in a Powerwave x-1 microplate reader (BioTek). Duplicate samples were examined in each assay, and results shown are mean values for each condition. Tubulin was incubated in the presence of tau (0.8 µM) only or with added Capzb2 using the following concentrations: 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 10 µM. At the end of a polymerization assay, microtubules were negatively stained with 3% uranyl acetate and placed on grids for transmission electron microscopy to verify microtubule formation.</p>
