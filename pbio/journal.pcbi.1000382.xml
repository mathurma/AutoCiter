                <p>Transcription factor (TF) regulation is often post-translational. TF
                    modifications such as reversible phosphorylation and missense mutations, which
                    can act independent of TF expression level, are overlooked by differential
                    expression analysis. Using bovine Piedmontese myostatin mutants as
                    proof-of-concept, we propose a new algorithm that correctly identifies the gene
                    containing the causal mutation from microarray data alone. The myostatin
                    mutation releases the brakes on Piedmontese muscle growth by translating a
                    dysfunctional protein. Compared to a less muscular non-mutant breed we find that
                    myostatin is not differentially expressed at any of ten developmental time
                    points. Despite this challenge, the algorithm identifies the myostatin
                    ‘smoking gun’ through a coordinated, simultaneous, weighted
                    integration of three sources of microarray information: transcript abundance,
                    differential expression, and differential wiring. By asking the novel question
                    “which regulator is cumulatively most differentially wired to the
                    abundant most differentially expressed genes?” it yields the correct
                    answer, “myostatin”. Our new approach identifies causal
                    regulatory changes by globally contrasting co-expression network dynamics. The
                    entirely data-driven ‘weighting’ procedure emphasises
                    regulatory movement relative to the phenotypically relevant part of the network.
                    In contrast to other published methods that compare co-expression networks,
                    significance testing is not used to eliminate connections.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Evolution, development, and cancer are governed by regulatory circuits where the
                    central nodes are transcription factors. Consequently, there is great interest
                    in methods that can identify the causal mutation/perturbation responsible for
                    any circuit rewiring. The most widely available high-throughput technology, the
                    microarray, assays the transcriptome. However, many regulatory perturbations are
                    post-transcriptional. This means that they are overlooked by traditional
                    differential gene expression analysis. We hypothesised that by viewing
                    biological systems as networks one could identify causal mutations and
                    perturbations by examining those regulators whose position in the network
                    changes the most. Using muscular myostatin mutant cattle as a proof-of-concept,
                    we propose an analysis that succeeds based solely on microarray expression data
                    from just 27 animals. Our analysis differs from competing network approaches in
                    that we do not use significance testing to eliminate connections. All
                    connections are contrasted, no matter how weak. Further, the identity of target
                    genes is maintained throughout the analysis. Finally, the analysis is
                    ‘weighted’ such that movement relative to the phenotypically
                    most relevant part of the network is emphasised. By identifying the question to
                    which myostatin is the answer, we present a comparison of network connectivity
                    that is potentially generalisable.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Evolution, normal development, immune responses and aberrant processes such as
                diseases and cancer all involve at least some rewiring of regulatory circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Isalan1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Wiedemeyer1">[3]</xref>. Indeed it is the
                subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) differences in circuit wiring that makes each
                individual unique. The key nodes in regulatory circuits are frequently transcription
                factors (TF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Hobert1">[4]</xref>. Thus, there is a great deal of interest in developing
                methods for decoding TF changes. Regulator-target interactions can be assessed by
                ChIP-on-chip but this requires large amounts of homogenous starting material and
                TF-specific reagents. Furthermore, the recruitment of a TF to a promoter does not
                necessarily correlate with transcriptional status, so biological interpretation can
                be complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Blais1">[5]</xref>. Likely sites of key regulatory mutations can be
                revealed by Whole Genome Scans (WGS) but this approach requires large numbers of
                individuals and very dense SNP panels. Even so, the exact causal gene may remain
                ambiguous if there are several genes near the marker. In any case, little insight is
                gained into the underlying regulatory mechanisms. In order to gain further insights
                into the regulatory apparatus, computational approaches are continuously being
                proposed. To date, they all operate by integrating information from multiple levels
                of biological organisation particularly eQTL, protein-protein interaction and TF
                binding site data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Lee1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Zhu1">[9]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Identifying regulatory change solely through contrasts in gene expression data has
                been elusive because TF tend to be stably expressed at baseline levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Zampieri1">[10]</xref> close
                to the sensitivity of standard high-throughput expression profiling platforms.
                Further, TF activation is often regulated post-translationally and thereby can act
                somewhat independently of expression level. Biologically important common TF
                activation processes (localisation to the nucleus, phosphorylation, ligand binding,
                formation of transcriptionally ‘open’ euchromatin, and presence
                of cofactors, all in addition to mutations in the protein coding region of the
                regulator) are poorly detected by conventional differential expression (DE)
                analysis.</p>
            <p>We hypothesised that a system-wide network approach might have utility, on the
                grounds that while a differentially-regulated TF might not be DE between two
                systems, its new position in the network of the perturbed system might allow
                detection of the ‘smoking gun.’ To allow reliable evaluation of
                such a hypothesis a well-defined experimental model system is required. Piedmontese
                cattle are double-muscled because they possess a genomic DNA mutation in the
                myostatin (GDF8) mRNA transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Berry1">[11]</xref>. The resulting dysfunctional myostatin protein is
                a transcriptional regulator that releases the brakes on muscle growth reflecting the
                importance of TGF-β signalling pathways in the determination of final muscle
                mass and fibre composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Lee2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-McPherron1">[13]</xref>. A preliminary
                analysis of the expression of myostatin in Piedmontese×Hereford versus
                Wagyu×Hereford animals found that DE of myostatin was not detectable using
                cDNA-based expression microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Lehnert1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Wang1">[15]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Thus we have a system in which we know the identity of the gene containing the causal
                mutation, myostatin (MSTN), but we cannot identify it by DE of the mRNA in muscle
                samples. By contrasting the muscle transcriptomes of the Piedmontese and Wagyu
                crosses across 10 developmental time points, our aim was to establish the question
                to which myostatin is the answer. In other words, what question do we need to ask of
                the gene expression data for it to reveal the identity of the transcriptional
                regulator containing the causal mutation?</p>

                <p>We found that 11,057 genes gave valid expression signal: noise data across the 10
                    developmental time points for the 2 crosses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000382.s002">Table S1</xref>).
                    Of these 11,057 genes 920 were deemed to be gene expression regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000382.s003">Table S2</xref>).
                    The experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g001">Figure
                    1</xref>) allowed us to assess DE between the crosses and we visualised the data
                    on an MA plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g002">Figure 2</xref>),
                    identifying 85 DE genes using conservative statistical criteria. The most DE
                    genes included slow twitch muscle structural genes (e.g. MYL2), which were
                    higher in the Wagyu crosses (W×H) than in the Piedmontese crosses
                    (P×H) and immune genes (e.g. HLA-DQA2), which were higher in the
                    P×H than in W×H. The most DE transcriptional regulator was
                    CSRP3 which was higher in W×H than in P×H. Consistent with

                    precedent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Hu1">[16]</xref>. However, two important modifications presented
                    in the current co-expression work include an absence of significance analysis
                    and the decision to limit the computation to a targeted subset of genes (i.e.,
                    transcriptional regulators versus DE genes). This targeting better emphasises
                    the transcriptional regulation of the change in two systems. This quantification
                    of a gene's differential connectivity is more sensitive than the
                    majority of published approaches where only the total number of
                    ‘significant’ connections is contrasted. Instead, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Hu1">[16]</xref> we
                    exploit the identity of the connectors and the differential magnitude of each
                    connection, even in circumstances where the correlation is weak in either (or
                    both) of the networks. As this principal forms the basis of the rest of our
                    analysis and appears to capture the regulatory rewiring that takes place in
                    myostatin mutant muscle, it will be referred to from this point on as
                    differential wiring (DW).</p>
                <p>In circumstances where we do analyse changes in total numbers of
                    ‘significant’ connections, we elected to use the term
                    differential hubbing (DH) on the grounds that the total number of connections
                    determines the extent to which a gene can be considered a hub. The PCIT
                    algorithm was used to establish significance in these cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Reverter1">[17]</xref>.

                <title>Phenotypic and regulatory impact factors</title>
                <p>In an attempt to assess the importance of each DE gene to the change in
                    phenotype, we propose a new metric: the “phenotypic impact factor
                    (PIF).” PIF is a mathematical abstraction designed to
                    ‘weight’ for the contribution the various DE genes make to
                    the difference in the molecular anatomy of the two systems, based purely on
                    their numerical properties. The values were generated by combining the amount of
                    DE between the crosses, coupled with the average abundance calculated for both
                    crosses at all time points for each of the 85 DE genes. Abundant transcripts
                    that were highly DE scored highly, whereas scarce transcripts that were only
                    slightly DE scored poorly. The high phenotypic impact genes enriched for slow
                    twitch muscle structural genes (MYL2, MYL3, TNNT1, MYH7, ACTN2 and MYOZ2)
                    correctly highlighting the observed phenotype change between the breed crosses,
                    namely the gross muscle fibre transition. The coherence of the output is very
                    consistent with an expectation based on the observed gross anatomical fibre
                    change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Greenwood1">[18]</xref>.</p>
                <p>We formalised this observation using the GOrilla tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Eden1">[19]</xref> comparing the GO
                    terms enriched by high DE to those enriched by high PIF, computed for all 11,057
                    genes. Not surprisingly, the extremes of both lists strongly enrich for muscle
                    structural components because the transcriptome data was derived from muscle
                    tissue. However, GOrilla assigned a p-value for ‘contractile fibre
                    part’ – the top match within the ‘cellular
                    component’ context - that was 7 orders of magnitude, or 10,000,000
                    times more significant for extreme PIF than for extreme DE
                    (p = 3.14E-21 versus
                    p = 2.01E-14). We thus conclude that PIF
                    performs well at enriching those genes which appear to contribute strongly to
                    the difference in phenotype between the two states, although a full
                    justification of this conclusion requires further experimental evidence.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the PIF metric is not particularly well suited to regulators,
                    although they were included in the analysis. Regulators are often stably
                    expressed at close to baseline levels making detection of isolated changes in
                    expression level challenging and possibly misleading. To account for this, we
                    ascribed “regulatory impact factors” (RIFs) to each of the
                    920 regulators based on their cumulative, simultaneous, DW to the DE genes,
                    accounting for the PIF of the DE genes. This metric was intended as a
                    mathematical abstraction to represent the relative importance of the regulators
                    in driving the phenotypically relevant part of the network described above,
                    based on differences in their correlations.</p>
                <p>Those regulators that were highly DW to many of the high PIF genes received
                    strong scores, whereas those that were DW to a few, low PIF genes scored poorly.
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g004">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the
                    extent to which myostatin is highly DW to the high PIF genes, with Piedmontese
                    and Wagyu co-expressions plotted on the two axes. The 85 red circles correspond
                    to the 85 myostatin-DE gene co-expression values. Circle size corresponds to the
                    PIF of the DE gene co-expressed with myostatin at that particular co-expression
                    intersection. The perpendicular distance from the diagonal line corresponds to
                    the amount of differential wiring. For myostatin, this distance tends to be
                    greatest for the high PIF genes (largest circles). The five largest circles are
                    MYL2, CSRP3, MYH6, CA3 and MYL3.</p>

                <p>In the absence of evidence favouring one approach over the other we decided to
                    follow the original thread of defining the question to which myostatin was the
                    answer. When we calculated the mean of the two different RIF values, myostatin
                    received the highest score out of the 920 regulators with a RIF of 3.49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000382-t002">Table 2</xref>). Two muscle
                    transcription factors MEF2C and MYOD1 also appeared in the top ten, although the
                    former was ranked much lower by Eq4. In addition, SUV39H2 (a histone
                    methyltransferase that cooperates with SMADs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Frontelo1">[21]</xref>, components of

                    major muscle TF, or components of the TGF-ß pathway, were in the top

                <p>To highlight which cluster of DE genes are being ‘perturbed’
                    by which cluster of regulators, the DW values for the 920 regulators (in rows)
                    and the 85 DE genes (in columns) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000382.s004">Table S3</xref>) can be assembled into a
                    ‘perturbation matrix’ which we visualised using PermutMatrix
                    software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Caraux1">[22]</xref>. This novel representation of gene expression
                    data (derived from the more traditional configuration with genes in rows and
                    samples in columns) allows for the separation of DE genes from regulators and,
                    after hierarchical clustering, reflects the way in which the regulators are
                    co-differentially wired with each other (i.e., where the differential wiring
                    behaves in a co-ordinated manner).</p>
                <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g006">Figure 6</xref> a small section
                    of the perturbation matrix is shown. Of particular note was a tight cluster of
                    18 DE genes comprising 5 genes encoding high PIF slow twitch structural proteins
                    (MYL3, TNNT1, MYH7, ACTN2 and MYOZ2) and also featuring SMPX and 2 DE regulators
                    (ANKRD1 and CSRP3). MYL2, another gene encoding a slow twitch structural
                    protein, did not feature in this DE module, but clustered on its own. The
                    regulatory axis contained several high impact regulatory ‘hot
                    spots.’ One of these included myostatin and MYOD1 at its heart, and
                    also included CSRP1, USF1, POU5F1, NR3C2, SBNO1 and PITX2. The very tight
                    clustering of myostatin and MYOD1 reflects closely coordinated patterns of DW
                    between the two crosses across the 85 DE genes.</p>

                <p>These biologically-sensible clusters imply that co-differential wiring can be
                    used as an explicit criterion to form an edge in a regulatory perturbation
                    network. We used a hard 0.9 threshold to establish network edges between those
                    regulators that were highly co-differentially wired to the 85 DE genes. We
                    visualised the deduced network in Cytoscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Shannon1">[23]</xref>. This approach led
                    to an enormous cohesive module of low impact regulators (those regulators that
                    apparently do not contribute to the change in phenotype), plus a number of
                    smaller high impact modules (those regulators that apparently do contribute to
                    the change in phenotype). A notable high impact module comprised 3
                    transcriptional regulators: MSTN, MYOD1 and IFRD1. The derivation of the high
                    co-differential wiring between the crosses for myostatin and MYOD1 is
                    illustrated in more detail with specific respect to the slow twitch module genes
                    in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g007">Figure 7</xref>. In contrast to
                    myostatin and MYOD1, which are highly positively co-differentially wired to each
                    other, the other member of the module, IFRD1, is highly negatively
                    co-differentially wired to them. The greatest DW values for all three
                    transcriptional regulators tend to be associated with the high PIF muscle
                    structural genes at the far right of the x axis (ANKRD1, MYOZ2, TNNT1, MYH6,
                    SMPX, CSRP3 and ACTN2).</p>

                <p>However, positive correlation of DW of regulators does not necessarily imply
                    positive correlation, or indeed any significant correlation, of expression of
                    the regulators themselves and vice versa. In other words, neither the clustered
                    regulators on the y axis of the perturbation matrix nor the clustered DE genes
                    on the x axis are actually significantly co-expressed with each other in any
                    combination, based on a PCIT analysis (unpublished data). Furthermore,
                    Myostatin, MyoD1 and IFRD1 are not significantly co-expressed with any of the
                    other 11,057 genes in the system, let alone the subset in the matrix. The same

                <p>We tested the distributional and numerical properties of RIF1 and RIF2 (Eq4 and
                    Eq5) on a simulated data to assess the extent to which our real output could be
                    ascribed to chance. The simulated data comprised 5,000 genes surveyed across 10
                    experimental conditions (in line with the 10 time points) in two treatments (in
                    line with the two breed crosses). In accordance with the real data, expression
                    values were simulated from a normal distribution with a mean of 8.6 and a
                    standard deviation of 2.8 and truncated at 4 and 16. Also, for each gene, its
                    expression profile across the two treatments was simulated to have a correlation
                    of 0.95.</p>
                <p>Simulations were performed under the null hypothesis of no differential
                    expression between treatments, no correlation between genes across conditions,
                    and no regulator-target relationships. Therefore, in these settings any observed
                    association could be attributed to chance alone.</p>
                <p>For the computations of RIF1 and RIF2, a random 920 genes were selected and
                    treated as potential regulators and their regulatory impact factor computed
                    against the 85 genes showing the most extreme measure of differential expression

                <title>Differential hubbing</title>
                <p>We used the PCIT algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Reverter1">[17]</xref> to establish the number of significant
                    connections for each regulator in the P×H and W×H datasets,
                    to determine how well this conventional approach performed in comparison to RIF.
                    In line with previous authors we discovered that the DH axis (i.e., the change
                    in the number of significant connections between the two breeds) enriches at its
                    extremes for transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The extreme 1% DH
                    (i.e., 110 genes out of the 11,057 available) contains 15 transcriptional
                    regulators rather than the 9 expected by chance alone (hypergeometric
                    p-value = 0.0192). This enrichment is not true
                    for the DE axis, which contains 9 transcriptional regulators. However, DH failed
                    to capture myostatin in its extremes, which suggests its usefulness as a metric
                    for the identification of transcriptional regulators of relevance may not be
                    broadly applicable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g008">Figure

                    As with the PCIT DH approach, myostatin was not enriched at the extremes of the
                    DiffK DH axis. This means it failed to identify the regulator containing the
                    known causal mutation as being differentially behaved in the two muscle systems.</p>

                <title>Reducing type III error by defining a cogent question</title>
                <p>In the introduction we posed a computational challenge: identify the question in
                    P×H versus W×H muscle development to which myostatin is the
                    answer. The subsequent analysis suggests the following: “Which
                    transcriptional regulator is cumulatively most differentially wired to the
                    abundant most differentially expressed genes?” This question is
                    clearly very different to the conventional “which transcriptional
                    regulator is the most differentially expressed?” and unsurprisingly
                    the latter gives quite different answers, including the notable failure to
                    identify myostatin out of the 920 candidates.</p>
                <p>This result suggests that traditional microarray approaches generating lists of
                    DE regulators may be committing type III statistical error, the error committed
                    when giving the right answers to the wrong questions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Kimball1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Mitroff1">[26]</xref>.
                    Regulators may indeed be correctly identified as DE, but this does not mean that
                    they are differentially activated. The converse is also true. For example, TF
                    activity can be regulated in many ways, localisation to the nucleus, chemical
                    modification, change in accessibility of DNA binding sites and availability of
                    cofactors that by and large are independent of TF expression level. It is
                    therefore inevitable that these common forms of regulatory change will be
                    overlooked by DE analysis.</p>
                <p>The positive identification of myostatin as the major regulatory perturbation in
                    this specific set of experimental contrasts is noteworthy, despite the stated
                    aims of the approach. The Piedmontese causative mutation exists at the first
                    level of organisation (genomic DNA), and manifests its effect at the third
                    (protein) and higher levels (phenotype). Despite this, we can identify it using
                    only data at the second level of biological organisation – the
                    transcriptome. In addition, all animals were Hereford hybrids so 50%
                    of the protein translated by the P×H animals was as functional as the
                    myostatin protein translated by the W×H; in line with this, the
                    increase in muscle mass was correspondingly subtle (∼9%)
                    (unpublished data).</p>

                <title>Assigning phenotypic and regulatory impact factors</title>
                <p>The new algorithm works, in effect, by firstly establishing a Phenotypic Impact
                    Factor (PIF) for each of the DE genes. Thus, genes that are both highly abundant
                    and highly DE between the crosses derive a correspondingly high PIF, or
                    discrimination factor. Taken together, this weighting provides an abstract
                    molecular description of the phenotype perturbation specific to the treatments
                    under consideration. In the P×H versus W×H comparison, the
                    genes with the highest PIF (i.e., those that are abundant and highly DE) tend to
                    be slow twitch muscle structural genes (MYL2, MYL3, TNNT1, MYH7, ACTN2 and
                    MYOZ2). This correctly reflects the most pervasive phenotypic change in
                    Piedmontese myostatin mutants (along with the increase in muscle mass) namely
                    the gross fibre type transition. We therefore conclude that DE, in the context
                    of transcript abundance, is a powerful measure of phenotypic / anatomical change
                    (but not necessarily, as we have already argued, regulatory change).</p>
                <p>RIF is based on the cumulative, simultaneous, differential wiring (DW) of each
                    regulator to the DE genes, ‘weighted’ for the PIF of each DE
                    gene. Satisfactorily, the regulator awarded the highest RIF by this approach is
                    myostatin, the gene that bears the known causal mutation (SNP) in Piedmontese
                    genomic DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Berry1">[11]</xref>. This positive result suggests that our
                    concept and method of assigning RIF represents a promising approach to the
                    identification of causal mutations, and additionally those regulatory
                    ‘hot spots’ resulting from non-genetic perturbations in
                    other systems.</p>
                <p>The highest impact regulators are documented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000382-t002">Table 2</xref>, and include known muscle master
                    regulators like MyoD1. A caveat: some known muscle master regulators (e.g. Myf5)
                    do not perform strongly in our analysis, i.e., they are ascribed relatively low
                    RIF's. This suggests not that these regulators are unimportant to
                    bovine muscle development, but rather that they play only a small role in the
                    rewiring that directs these two muscle phenotypes down different developmental
                    paths.</p>
                <p>During the conceptual development of the algorithm we tried several permutations.
                    The best performer, as described above and in the results section, incorporates
                    the average abundance and differential expression of the DE genes (which tend
                    not to be transcriptional regulators), and the cumulative DW of the regulators
                    to those weighted DE genes. Surprisingly, inclusion of either the average
                    abundance or DE of the regulators themselves actually impairs the ability of the
                    algorithm to identify myostatin (data not shown).</p>
                <p>While we assessed several versions of the algorithm, there is no evidence that
                    the data has been over-fitted because (1) the model is relatively simple
                    compared to the data it analyses, (2) like in any other expression experiment,
                    only the normalized gene expression levels for each gene in each of the samples
                    (or experimental conditions) are needed, (3) it is built on sound mathematical
                    principles (mixed-ANOVA models and model-based clustering), and (4) those
                    mathematical principles mesh well with our biological understanding of the
                    behaviour of both structural proteins (where DE and abundance are always
                    important) and transcriptional regulators (where DE and abundance are not
                    necessarily important, but transcriptional connectivity is important) in a range
                    of living systems.</p>
                <p>The two versions of the algorithm provided (Eq4 and Eq5) are alternatives in the
                    sense that they are built on the same set of concepts. However, at this stage,
                    it is not clear whether one can be considered superior to the other.
                    Consequently, we have derived our impact factor discussion from the combined,
                    averaged output of both equations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000382.s003">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000382-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000382-t003">3</xref>). Equation 5 has the appealing intrinsic
                    mathematical feature that it allows for auto-regulation, a biological feature
                    thought to be true for myostatin itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Berry1">[11]</xref>.</p>

                <p>Our observations imply caution when assessing isolated DE lists of TF. That TF
                    can behave differently in two systems without being strongly DE, has been
                    discussed before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Fuller1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Reverter2">[27]</xref> and is graphed

                    top 10 candidates generated by the new algorithm and the top 10 DE regulators do
                    not overlap, although HNRNPD and MYOD1 lie just outside the top ten most DE
                    regulators; the most DE regulator (CSRP3) was assigned only a modest RIF. CSRP3
                    has been reported to be a potential structural component of the sarcomere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Zheng1">[28]</xref>, but
                    also as a soluble component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Geier1">[29]</xref> and as a TF involved in the transduction of

                    The possible structural roles of these regulators may place them in an
                    intermediate category between structural protein and regulator, which
                    complicates the decision to include them in a transcriptional regulator list and

                <title>Wiring the regulatory network</title>
                <p>Assigning impact factors to the regulators (based on the behaviour of its
                    co-expression with respect to the phenotypically most relevant part of the
                    network) forms step 1 in a 2-step process, and it yields biologically valid
                    results. The next step is to computationally wire up the high impact regulators
                    into coherent transcriptional modules, whose coordinated behaviour drives the
                    phenotype change. We attempted to do this by establishing relationships between
                    regulators who were ‘similarly’ or co-ordinately
                    differentially-wired between the two crosses. To our knowledge this is the first
                    time co-differential wiring has been used for reverse-engineering regulatory
                    circuitry. The resultant output captures the phenotypic and regulatory
                    differences between the two crosses and so we view it as a
                    ‘perturbation matrix.’</p>
                <p>The building and clustering of the perturbation matrix satisfactorily resolves
                    both axes into biologically sensible modules. For example the DE axis generates
                    a very tight module of high phenotypic impact slow twitch muscle fibres (ACTN2,
                    MYH7, TNNT1, MYL3 and MYOZ2). Equally, the regulator axis resolves a high impact
                    regulatory module comprising myostatin and MYOD1, among others. Myostatin is
                    embedded in the middle of this high impact module. We interpret these clusters
                    of regulatory disturbance as representing ‘hot spots’ of
                    circuit rewiring that account for the major phenotypic changes between the
                    crosses.</p>
                <p>The exceptionally tight coupling of myostatin and MYOD1 on the y axis is the
                    product of a near perfect matching of co-differential wiring across all 85 DE
                    genes (p = 0.917). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g007">Figure 7</xref> illustrates the co-differential
                    wiring of these two regulators against the slow twitch module DE genes.
                    Unfortunately, our success in correctly determining the rewiring of myostatin in
                    (i.e., identifying the other regulators through whom it communicates its effect
                    on muscle mass and muscle fibre composition) is harder to evaluate than the
                    impact factor data. This is because the regulatory events that transduce
                    myostatin's influence on Piedmontese muscle mass and fibre composition
                    have not been well established. To establish the validity of the co-differential
                    wiring approach we examined the biological identity of those genes with the
                    highest co-DW coefficients. The distinction belongs to PTTG1 and TOP2A (0.994)
                    which are involved in the same highly fundamental biological process, that of
                    chromatid separation during DNA replication.</p>
                <p>With specific regard to the myostatin and MyoD1 clustering, the high co-DW
                    congruence makes a clear prediction that the myostatin SNP in Piedmontese exerts
                    its effect on skeletal muscle via circuit rewiring with MyoD1. MyoD1 has not
                    only been shown to drive the expression of a set of genes necessary for fast
                    muscle differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Maves1">[34]</xref>, but also to be specifically regulated by
                    myostatin in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Kambadur1">[35]</xref>; thus, our prediction appears robust. The
                    separation of abscissa clustering predicts that MYL2 is under a different
                    regulatory program to the other slow twitch muscle structural genes in the
                    system.</p>
                <p>When we next used the co-DW patterns to generate edges in a network, myostatin
                    was linked to 2 other high impact regulators, MYOD1 and IFRD1. It is highly
                    noteworthy that IFRD1, which is required for myoblast differentiation, forms a
                    known, experimentally-verified regulatory circuit with MYOD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Micheli1">[36]</xref>
                    adding further support to our co-differential wiring method. Taken together,
                    these results are very appealing because they indicate a single method that not
                    only correctly clusters regulators who behave the same in the two systems (PTTG1
                    and TOP2A) but also those who behave differently in the two systems (Myostatin,
                    MyoD1 and IFRD1). The additional myostatin module connections, i.e., between
                    myostatin and IFRD1 (−0.903) and between MYOD1 and IFRD1
                    (−0.925) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g007">Figure

                    (i.e., the signs on the edges are negative instead of positive). In contrast to
                    MYOD1, the high RIF MEF2C is not part of this cluster.</p>

                <p>The utility of this algorithm clearly relies on appropriate data selection.
                    Presumably, the microarray data must be assayed on the right tissue and at
                    biologically important times. However, the dataset that we analysed was not
                    designed to address the specific question of identifying the gene containing the
                    causal mutation, rather it was designed to study the impact of nutrition
                    restriction of the mother on the subsequent performance of the calves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Cafe1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Greenwood2">[38]</xref>.
                    A limitation of our method is that the regulators must be identified at the
                    start of the analysis. However, other than the initial identification of the
                    regulators, all the downstream information such as PIF, RIF and the topology of
                    the co-differentially wired network is entirely data-driven, i.e., computed
                    directly from the normalised microarray expression values.</p>
                <p>Finally, during the development of the algorithm we initially attempted to
                    determine regulatory changes via a simpler version of connectivity, i.e.,
                    describing changes in the <italic>number</italic> of connections of each
                    regulator, what we have termed DH (and what is sometimes referred to as
                    differential connectivity in the literature). DH approaches have previously
                    proved useful in identifying genes that appear to play key regulatory roles in
                    evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Oldham1">[39]</xref>, cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Taylor1">[40]</xref> and the development
                    of sexual dimorphism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-vanNas1">[41]</xref>. However, the procedure is limited because it
                    requires the application of a significance analysis to isolate the significant
                    from the non-significant connections. Which significance analysis to use is a
                    subject of ongoing debate with weighted networks appearing to hold the most
                    promise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Reverter1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Fuller1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Elo1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Zhang1">[43]</xref>.</p>
                <p>While it was true that high DH (coupled with low DE) proved diagnostic of
                    regulators in general (<italic>sensu</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Fuller1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Reverter2">[27]</xref>), it performed
                    poorly as a discriminatory metric with specific regard to myostatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g008">Figure 8</xref>). A possible reason
                    why can be illustrated by the following hypothetical example. Consider a
                    regulator with 100 positive associations in one system, and 100 negative
                    associations in another, and two entirely different sets of target genes. In its
                    most basic form, a DH analysis would suggest this regulator is not
                    differentially hubbed (as
                    100−100 = 0), clearly a false
                    negative. Thus, a DH analysis may suffer from (1) ignoring the identity of the
                    connected genes, (2) ignoring the sign on the edges, and (3) ignoring the
                    phenotypic impact of each connected gene. To further compare RIF to published
                    network approaches, we ran the DiffK hubbing analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Fuller1">[24]</xref>, which is a
                    sophisticated ‘signed’ differential hubbing algorithm. This
                    positioned myostatin 147<sup>th</sup> out of the 920 regulators on the DiffK
                    axis, i.e., it failed to identify myostatin as behaving differently in the two
                    muscle systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000382.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This result suggests that hubbing analyses, in their
                    various forms, are unable to identify the causal mutation in this particular
                    data.</p>
                <p>Our definition of RIF does not require computation of the number of connections
                    of a given regulator in each of the two networks. Therefore, algorithms for
                    network re-construction (weighted or otherwise) are of no relevance. Instead,
                    the difference between the connection weight of a given gene with each of the DE
                    genes, accounting for PIF, appears to be sufficient. In other words, RIF has a
                    set of refinements which make it highly sensitive. These refinements include
                    recognising the specific identity of target genes, recognising the possible
                    importance of ‘weak’ edges that would be deemed
                    non-significant by other methods and recognising the phenotypic importance of
                    the target genes.</p>
                <p>This principle is well illustrated by the DW of myostatin to MYL2. The
                    co-expression relationship significantly changes from +0.761 in the
                    P×H system to −0.342 in the W×H system. The
                    −0.342 Myostatin-MYL2 ‘edge’ in the Wagyu network
                    would be unequivocally discarded by all statistical methods as being
                    insignificant (whether by ARACNE, PCIT or some other approach) whilst the
                    +0.761 Myostatin-MYL2 ‘edge’ in the Piedmontese
                    would be borderline insignificant depending on the exact analysis used.
                    Therefore, comparisons between these arrangements (which underpin the success of
                    our present analysis) cannot be sensitively quantified by DH. Further, the fact
                    that MYL2 is highly abundant and highly DE (and therefore of great phenotypic
                    importance) would be overlooked by DH, unless the PIF metric was applied. It is
                    a telling observation that myostatin is neither DE nor DH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g008">Figure 8</xref>), yet is cumulatively the highest
                    RIF regulator on the array by some margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000382-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

                    error, i.e., it gives the right answer because it asks the right question. The
                    approach should be generalisable to other ‘omics data because its

                    non-regulatory molecules. Unlike other causal mutation finding computational
                    approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Lee1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Zhu1">[9]</xref>, RIF requires data at
                    only one level of organisation (the transcriptome). Having said this, the future
                    availability of more complete TF binding data and other resources will enable
                    the determination of a more complete path from causal mutation to phenotype. By
                    extracting richer regulatory information RIF may help establish novel regulatory
                    perturbations. These include a better understanding of the network topologies

                    as the quality of the extracted mRNA. The experimental layout was designed to

                <title>Generation of the list of regulators</title>
                <p>We used a number of approaches to establish a reasonably definitive list of genes
                    encoding proteins that directly or indirectly modify gene expression, including
                    chromatin remodelers. We made use of a comprehensive list of TF previously
                    published in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Kong1">[44]</xref> and identified the homologs on the Agilent

                    on TF binding motifs to further corroborate the list. While we discriminated
                    between modifiers of gene expression, such as TF, non-transcription factor
                    regulators (e.g. myostatin), chromatin remodelers (e.g. HDAC2) and signalling

                <p>Gene expression intensity signals were subjected to a series of data acquisition
                    criteria based on signal to noise ratio and mean to median correlation as
                    detailed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Tan1">[45]</xref>. In brief, we employed the following two
                    editing criteria for data acquisition: First, we required that the signal to
                    noise ratio (computed by dividing the background corrected intensity by the
                    standard deviation of the background pixels) be greater than unity; Second, we
                    required that the correlation between the mean and the median signal intensities
                    (computed by dividing the smaller of the mean or median by the larger) to be
                    greater than 0.85. Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000382-Tran1">[46]</xref> suggested that a correlation of 0.85 or
                    higher not only retains more data than other methods, but retained data are more
                    accurate than traditional thresholds or common spot flagging algorithms.
                    However, these criteria were applied separately for the red and for the green
                    intensity channels so that a different number of observations for each channel
                    were obtained. These resulted in a total of 2,083,641 gene expression intensity
                    readings (1,027,379 red and 1,056,262 green) on 11,057 genes that were
                    background corrected and base-2 log transformed. The arithmetic mean and
                    standard deviation (in brackets) for the red and green intensities were 8.67
                    (3.16) and 8.14 (2.82), respectively.</p>

                    respectively. Finally, ε is the random error term. In what follows, it

                    the main class treatment of cross (e.g. P×H versus W×H) as
                    well as the sub-class level (e.g. the 10 time points). That is:
                    <italic>v</italic> = 1, 2, …, 10 for
                    the Piedmontese cross at the 10 time points; and

                    the Wagyu cross also at the same 10 time points.</p>
                <p>For the random effects in model (1), standard stochastic assumptions are:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000382.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where iid denotes independently and identically distributed and

                <p>For every regulator in our dataset, we introduce a new term, namely Regulatory
                    Impact Factor (RIF) which simultaneously combines the DW between the TF and each

                    has the additional appealing features of expressing the product of the average
                    and the differential expression as the difference of the squared expression in
                    each cross (i.e., a computational simplification), as well as the squared

                    <italic>f</italic>-th TF and the <italic>i</italic>-th DE gene indicating the
                    strength of one variable (the TF) explaining variation in a second variable (the
                    DE gene). It also allows for the existence of self-regulation which more
                    realistically reflects biology (i.e., note that for DW<italic>

                    situation where a TF is also DE, impacting on the computation of RIF as per

                    deviation of one.</p>
                <p>PIF is implicit in the Equation 4 representation of RIF and is defined as the
