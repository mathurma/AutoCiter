<p>Novel imaging strategies reveal a conformational shift in a receptor tyrosine kinase domain that controls ligand shedding by an ADAM metalloprotease.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Release of cell surface-bound ligands by A-Disintegrin-And-Metalloprotease (ADAM) transmembrane metalloproteases is essential for signalling by cytokine, cell adhesion, and tyrosine kinase receptors. For Eph receptor ligands, it provides the switch between cell-cell adhesion and repulsion. Ligand shedding is tightly controlled by intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, which for Eph receptors relies on the release of an inhibitory interaction of the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane segment with the kinase domain. However, a mechanism linking kinase and sheddase activities had remained elusive. We demonstrate that it is a membrane-proximal localisation of the latent kinase domain that prevents ephrin ligand shedding in <italic>trans</italic>. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and electron tomography reveal that activation extends the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase intracellular domain away from the cell membrane into a conformation that facilitates productive association with ADAM10. Accordingly, EphA3 mutants with constitutively-released kinase domains efficiently support shedding, even when their kinase is disabled. Our data suggest that this phosphorylation-activated conformational switch of EphA3 directly controls ADAM-mediated shedding.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The Eph transmembrane receptors are part of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and play important roles in communication between neighbouring cells. An Eph receptor binds to its ligand, membrane-tethered ephrin, on a neighbouring cell so as to form a stable complex and activate downstream signalling events. One such event is regulation of ADAM10, a transmembrane protease of the ADAM metalloprotease family, which provides a feedback mechanism to Eph signalling. ADAM10 is located on Eph-expressing cells and cleaves ephrin from its membrane tether on the opposite cell (through its so-called sheddase activity), thereby separating the cell-cell connection and allowing the signalling complex to internalise. In other biological contexts, activity of the ADAM metalloprotease family underlies signalling mechanisms such as oncogenic EGF-receptor transactivation, adhesion molecule shedding and cytokine/chemokine release. In general, ADAM function is enhanced when receptor tyrosine signalling is active and repressed when tyrosine kinase signalling is inhibited. However, the mechanism through which receptor tyrosine kinase signalling regulates ADAM10, have remained elusive. By combining fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and electron microscopic tomography of EphA3, we have demonstrated in live cells at molecular resolution that tyrosine phosphorylation of activated EphA3 triggers a measurable movement of the kinase domain away from the plasma membrane. Only this conformation of the EphA3 kinase domain away from the plasma membrane permits ADAM10 to come close enough to EphA3 so that it can reach its tightly EphA3-bound substrate, ephrin-A5. Our findings delineate a new regulatory concept in cell-cell communication, whereby control over proteolytic sheddase activity is provided by an activation-induced switch in the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain of a receptor tyrosine kinase, rather than by a cytosolic signalling pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ADAM (A-Disintegrin-And-Metalloprotease) transmembrane proteases fulfil essential functions during normal and pathological tissue- and organ-development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Kheradmand1">[1]</xref>. ADAM10 and 17 in particular are widely expressed and knock-out mice lacking expression of either gene show severe, lethal defects in early development, in the formation of somites and the central nervous system (ADAM10) and the cardiovascular system (ADAM10/17). They have important roles in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and Notch signalling, highlighted by phenotypic resemblance of ADAM 10/17 knockouts with those of Notch, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGFR ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Hartmann1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Peschon1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Seals1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Blobel1">[5]</xref>. ADAM10 and 17 both target a range of EGFR ligands with distinct specificities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Sahin1">[6]</xref>, while ADAM10 cleaves both Notch and its ligand delta, as well as other targets with prominent roles in disease including amyloid precursor protein, interleukin 6 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Blobel1">[5]</xref>, cadherins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Reiss1">[7]</xref>, and ligands for Eph RTKs (Ephs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Hattori1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Ephs and their membrane bound ligands (ephrins) control cell positioning during normal and oncogenic development by modulating cell-cell adhesion and cell-cell segregation or repulsion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Pasquale1">[10]</xref>. Similar to ADAMs, they function in developmental processes including somite formation, neural and cardiovascular development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Lackmann1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Pasquale2">[12]</xref>, which, together with their common expression patterns, supports functional evidence for the critical role of ADAM10 in Eph biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Hattori1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>. Eph function relies on the direct contact between Eph- and ephrin-expressing cells, which triggers the assembly of signalling clusters at the cell-cell interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-WimmerKleikamp1">[13]</xref> and initiates Eph “forward” and ephrin “reversed” signals into the respective cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Pasquale1">[10]</xref>. For repulsion to proceed it is essential that the multivalent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Himanen1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Smith1">[15]</xref> signalling complexes that tether Eph- and ephrin-expressing cells are disrupted, allowing the cells to retract via ensuing actin cytoskeletal rearrangement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Lawrenson1">[16]</xref>. In the case of EphA/ephrin-A signalling clusters it was demonstrated that ephrin-shedding by ADAM10, constitutively associated with Ephs on the opposing cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>, is required for repulsion to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Hattori1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>ADAM proteins are produced as inactive precursors that become catalytically active upon removal of the prodomain during secretion. Interestingly, there is little evidence for a substrate cleavage sequence motif, and the regulation of proteolytic specificity is achieved by interaction of substrates with the non-catalytic disintegrin and cysteine-rich extracellular ADAM domains. For ephrin cleavage, a substrate recognition module within the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM10 specifically binds only the high-affinity ligand-receptor complex to ensure that only Eph receptor-bound ephrins are cleaved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>n addition to this direct control of ADAM10-facilitated shedding, substantial evidence documents intracellular regulation of ADAM proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Seals1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Blobel1">[5]</xref>. ADAM activity is enhanced upon activation of (receptor) tyrosine kinase signalling by growth factors, phorbol esters, or phosphatase inhibitors, while tyrosine kinase inhibitors or dominant-negative RTK mutants attenuate ADAM activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Seals1">[4]</xref>. This protein kinase-controlled ADAM activity is an essential component of the autocrine, mitogenic signalling that is triggered by G-protein coupled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Prenzel1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Yan1">[18]</xref> or stress-induced EGF receptor transactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Prenzel1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Fischer1">[19]</xref>. Conversely, ADAM shedding of L-selectin during leukocyte trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Rosen1">[20]</xref> is blocked by Calmodulin (CaM), via its binding to the 17-residue L-selectin intracellular domain (ICD), while CaM inhibitors trigger shedding of the L-selectin ectodomain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Kahn1">[21]</xref>. Surprisingly, while ADAM family members harbour potential protein docking motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Seals1">[4]</xref>, cytoplasmic-truncated ADAM17 is fully functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Reddy1">[22]</xref>, and signalling mechanisms regulating ADAM activity have remained elusive.</p>
<p>To elaborate the intracellular regulation of ADAMs by RTK signalling we investigated ADAM10 catalysed ephrin-A5 cleavage that is mediated by EphA3-expressing cells, as previous studies demonstrated that this sheddase activity depends on ephrins binding and activating the EphA3 RTK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Hattori1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>. Our results suggest that a conformational change in the EphA3 ICD, which upon activation moves the kinase domain away from the plasma membrane, relieves a steric hindrance preventing productive association with ADAM10. We demonstrate that this loss of steric hindrance, resulting from extension of the active Eph ICD, rather than classical signalling via intermediate proteins, regulates the sheddase activity of ADAM10.</p>

<title>Ephrin shedding is inhibited by lack of kinase activity but not by cytoplasmic truncation of EphA3 or ADAM10.</title>
<p>(A) EphA3 kinase activity is required for effective ephrin cleavage. HEK293T cells expressing EphA3 Wt or EphA3[KM] (with a mutated ATP-binding site, K<sub>653</sub>→M) were treated with clustered (C) or non-clustered (NC) ephrin-A5-Fc. Cleaved ephrin-A5 was extracted by EphA3-Fc pulldown and recovered ephrin-A5 and total cell extracts were immunoblotted as indicated. Low level ephrin-A5 shedding observed with ephrin-A5-Fc -treated EphA3[KM] cells is likely due to endogenous EphA3 present in parental HEK293T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Verveer2">[45]</xref>. (B) Truncation of the ADAM10 ICD (ΔICD) does not affect ephrin-A5 cleavage and internalisation. Cells expressing endogenous ADAM10 and EphA3-GFP were transfected with HA-ADAM10[ΔMP] (top), HA-ADAM10[ΔICD] (middle), or control vector (bottom) and exposed to Alexa<sup>594</sup>ephrin-A5-Fc coated beads. EphA3-GFP, internalised ephrin-A5, and HA-ADAM staining (Alexa<sup>647</sup>) were imaged by confocal microscopy. The relative ephrin-A5 labelling of receptor-expressing cells (mean+/−SEM), with or without ADAM10[ΔICD] or ADAM10[ΔMP] co-expression, is shown. (C) Cleavage of ephrin-A5 from conjugated beads in the presence of EphA3[Δcyto]-expressing cells. HEK293T cells expressing Wt EphA3-GFP or EphA3[Δcyto] as indicated were incubated with Alexa<sup>594</sup>ephrin-A5-Fc-conjugated beads before staining with Alexa<sup>647</sup>anti-EphA3 antibody. Confocal microscope images show representative cells stained with cleaved ephrin-A5. Pseudocolours in the merged images illustrate: green, EphA3-GFP; red, Alexa<sup>594</sup>ephrin-A5; blue, Alexa647anti-EphA3 antibody. The graph shows the relative ephrin-labelling of cells (mean+/−SEM), with cells containing internalised ephrin shown in dark grey and cell-surface ephrin in light gray.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, however, co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed robust binding of ADAM10 to an EphA3 mutant lacking the whole ICD (EphA3[ΔICD], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). This implies that the ADAM10/EphA3 association, which is necessary for ephrin cleavage and involves constitutive as well as ephrin-augmented interactions of their extracellular domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Hattori1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>, does not require the contribution of the EphA3 ICD. We therefore assessed if cytoplasmic-truncated ADAM10[ΔICD] or EphA3[ΔICD] could catalyse cleavage of Alexa-labelled ephrin-A5-Fc that had been conjugated to Protein-A-coated Dynabeads, an experimental approach previously used to characterise ephrin shedding by ADAM10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>. In agreement with earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Hattori1">[8]</xref>, over-expression of non-functional ADAM10 lacking the MP domain (ADAM10ΔMP) acts as a dominant negative protein to effectively prevent ephrin shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, over-expression of cytoplasmic-truncated ADAM10[ΔICD] did not notably affect ephrin-A5 cleavage and internalisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that the ADAM ICD may not be required for its sheddase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Reddy1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Likewise, cells over-expressing EphA3[ΔICD] efficiently supported ephrin-A5 shedding from Dynabeads, as evident from the marked cell surface labelling with fluorescent ephrin that had been released from the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The lack of efficient internalisation of the cleaved ephrin-A5 into cells in this case suggested that the EphA3 ICD is required for internalisation of the ligand/receptor complex, but is not essential for ligand cleavage. Cell surface labelling was efficiently blocked by ADAM metalloprotease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s002">Figure S2</xref>), consistent with ADAM-dependent shedding of ephrin-A5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>.</p>

<title>Active EphA3 Conformation rather than Kinase Activity Correlates with ADAM10-Mediated Ephrin Cleavage</title>
<p>To reconcile the observations that ephrin cleavage requires Eph kinase activity but still occurs in the absence of the entire ICD, we considered recent studies demonstrating an activation- and phosphorylation-dependent release of the Eph juxtamembrane (JM) segment from an inhibitory interaction with the kinase domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-WybengaGroot1">[26]</xref>. The existence of this structural switch, which converts a static/constrained conformation of the JM domain into a dynamic/relaxed one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-WybengaGroot1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Wiesner1">[27]</xref>, was recently confirmed also for EphA3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Davis2">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the inactive/constrained JM segment positions the kinase domain close to the membrane, a configuration that imparts a steric obstruction to the productive ADAM10/EphA3 interaction and thereby controls ephrin shedding. To test this hypothesis we examined whether forced approximation of the EphA3 kinase domain to the plasma membrane affects ADAM10 association and function. For these experiments we designed a series of EphA3 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) including: i) “EphA3[ΔJX]” short (“S”), lacking JM residues 591–614 and replicating the previously-reported EphB2[Δ599–621] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-WybengaGroot1">[26]</xref>; ii) “EphA3[ΔJX]” long (“L”) lacking all JM residues 567–614; iii) “EphA3[2YE]” where Y→E substitutions of JM tyrosines generate an unfolded JM domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-WybengaGroot1">[26]</xref>; and iv) EphA3[2YE-KM], a kinase-inactive form of EphA3[2YE]. All mutants were expressed at the cell surface and functional in ephrin-A5 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Loss of the JM tyrosines Y596 and Y602 in the truncated (EphA3[ΔJXS]) or Y→E substituted (EphA3[2YE]) JM domain reduced ephrin-A5 induced phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) without loss of EphA3 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). By contrast, only marginal phosphorylation of EphA3[ΔJXL] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) suggests that the very close proximity of the kinase domain to the inner membrane leaflet impedes the substrate interaction for this mutant.</p>

<p>Importantly, all EphA3 mutants retained the capacity to associate and co-immunoprecipitate with ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), in agreement with our previous finding that ADAM interacts with EphA3 via specific regions in their extracellular protein domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>. However, compared to Wt EphA3 or EphA3-[2YE], binding of the [ΔJXS] and [ΔJXL] mutants to ADAM10 was notably reduced, supporting our hypothesis that approximation of the EphA3 kinase domain to the plasma membrane imparts steric obstruction to ADAM10 binding that is relieved during JM domain unfolding. Also, binding to ADAM10 of “kinase-dead” [2YE-KM] was reduced compared to EphA3-[2YE] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting either that Eph kinase activity may play a role in facilitating the ADAM10 interaction or that JM domain unfolding of the [2YE-KM] mutant is incomplete, as implied from the crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Wiesner1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>To test our hypothesis of a conformational switch in the EphA3 JM domain that controls ADAM10 access and ephrin shedding, we compared the ability of Wt and mutant EphA3 receptors to support ADAM-catalysed shedding from ephrin-A5-coated beads and internalisation into EphA3-expressing cells. Confocal microscopy confirmed that indeed both EphA3 JM-truncations significantly affected the capacity to promote ephrin-A5 shedding, whereas the [2YE] mutant behaved comparable to Wt EphA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). Interestingly, kinase-compromised EphA3[2YE-KM] with an unfolded JM domain behaved similar to cytoplasmic-truncated EphA3[ΔICD] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g001">Figure 1C</xref>): cell surface ephrin-staining away from the beads revealed ability of this mutant to support ephrin shedding but failure to internalise the shed ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g003">Figures 3A, 3B</xref> and S5A), also evident when soluble, pre-clustered Alexa<sup>594</sup>ephrin-A5-Fc was used as substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Since EphA3[2YE] bearing an intact kinase but lacking JM tyrosines is internalised normally, this argues for EphA3 endocytosis requiring tyrosine kinase activity and/or phosphorylation, likely of the remaining critical phosphorylation site within the Eph kinase activation-loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-WimmerKleikamp1">[13]</xref>. We confirmed the ability to support ephrin-shedding using immunoprecipitation analysis, revealing similar levels of cleaved ephrin-A5 in cultures of EphA3[2YE] and EphA3[2YE-KM] cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>These experiments indicate that it is the proximity of the EphA3 kinase domain to the plasma membrane rather than its kinase activity per se that determines if shedding by ADAM10 is inhibited or promoted. For further evidence, and to clarify if there is any contribution from signalling intermediates that may communicate between the Eph and ADAM cytoplasmic domains, as implied from previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Seals1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Blobel1">[5]</xref>, we compared ephrin-A5 shedding by cells co-expressing EphA3 mutants together with either Wt ADAM10 or with cytoplasmic-truncated ADAM10[ΔICD] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g003">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s006">S6B</xref>). ADAM10[ΔICD] would be expected to overcome the steric hindrance exerted by EphA3 JM mutants, compared to full length ADAM10. To avoid the potential ambiguity caused by the presence of endogenous, Wt ADAM10/EphA3 complexes, we performed these experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from ADAM10 KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Hartmann1">[2]</xref> lacking any detectable ADAM10 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). Similar to our findings in HEK293T cells, ephrin-A5 shedding in these MEFs was apparent upon co-expression of either Wt or [ΔICD] ADAM10 together with Wt EphA3, and was greatly reduced when either of the EphA3 JM mutants EphA3[ΔJXL] or EphA3[ΔJXS] were expressed with Wt ADAM10. Importantly, co-expression of cytoplasmic-truncated ADAM10[ΔICD] together with EphA3[ΔJXL] or EphA3[ΔJXS] “rescued” the inhibitory effect of the JM positioning of the Eph kinase domain and resulted in shedding comparable to that seen with the Wt ADAM and Eph proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g003">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s006">S6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these experiments demonstrate that ephrin-A5 shedding by ADAM10 is controlled by steric hindrance exerted by the membrane-proximal EphA3 kinase domain, which prevents the functional interaction with ADAM10 that is needed for efficient substrate (ephrin) cleavage to occur.</p>

<title>Steric Hindrance as a Conserved Mechanism of ADAM Regulation</title>
<p>In addition to controlling RTK function, ADAMs are key modulators of cell–matrix interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-White1">[29]</xref>, and ADAM17-catalysed exodomain shedding regulates the function of the leukocyte adhesion protein L-selectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Rosen1">[20]</xref>. Of note, L-selectin shedding is blocked by CaM binding to the L-selectin cytoplasmic domain and is promoted by CaM inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Kahn1">[21]</xref>, indicating a similar regulation by steric hindrance. Intriguingly, these inhibitors also trigger metalloprotease-dependent EGFR signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Tebar1">[30]</xref>, further suggesting that steric hindrance, in this case imparted by CaM binding within the EGFR JM region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-MartinNieto1">[31]</xref>, may promote ADAM-catalysed ligand release.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that a bulky protein domain at the JM position would impair a productive ADAM/EphA3 alignment, the EphA3 cytoplasmic domain was replaced with that of L-selectin. We surmised that CaM-loaded EphA3/L-selectin could not effectively promote ephrin cleavage, while conversely inhibition of CaM binding to this chimeric receptor using CaM inhibitors should favour ADAM10 association and ephrin-A5 cleavage. Control experiments confirmed inhibition of CaM binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s007">Figure S7A</xref>) and increased ADAM10 association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). Indeed, shedding from ephrin-A5-Fc coated beads was markedly higher in inhibitor-treated than in untreated cells expressing EphA3/L-selectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g004">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>). Furthermore, immunoblotting of cleaved ephrinA5-Fc from cultures of EphA3/L-selectin cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) confirmed shedding in CaM-inhibitor-treated cells but not in control cells, at levels that are comparable to those observed in EphA3[2YE-KM] cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Likewise, engineering of inactivating mutations into the CaM-binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Kahn1">[21]</xref> (EphLsel EE) notably increased the capacity of these cells to support ephrin shedding as compared to Wt EphA3-L-selectin cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s007">Figure S7C</xref>). Of note, in these experiments ephrin-A5 labelled the cell membrane but was not internalised into cells with EphA3/L-selectin, confirming the need for the intact EphA3 cytoplasmic domain for endocytosis. We confirmed CaM inhibitor-induced shedding also of cell bound ephrin-A5, using co-cultures of green-fluorescent protein (GFP)-ephrin-A5-expressing and EphA3/L-selectin-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). In agreement with these imaging experiments, immunoblotting of cleaved GFP-ephrin-A5 recovered from GFP-ephrin-A5-expressing cells that had been co-cultured with EphA3/L-selectin-cells revealed CaM inhibitor-induced shedding, which is absent in inhibitor-treated control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). Thus, CaM binding to the EphA3/L-selectin protein effectively regulates shedding of ephrin-A5, further demonstrating that ADAM10 activity is controlled by steric constraints in the JM region of a (chimeric) EphA3 mutant that is devoid of tyrosine kinase– and kinase-dependent signalling activity.</p>

<title>Activation of EphA3 Is Accompanied by Extension of the ICD</title>
<p>To this point our analysis strongly argues for the notion that the “relaxed” and “constrained” conformations of active and inactive EphA3, respectively, would direct functional or dysfunctional alignment of ADAM10 with EphA3.

<p>Confocal FLIM analysis of live cells activated with clustered ephrin-A5-Fc revealed that fluorescence lifetimes (τ) of cell-surface EphA3-GFP increased (showing reduced FRET) 10–20 min after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g005">Figure 5B, 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s009">Figure S9A, S9B</xref>), indicating a drop of the cytoplasmic domain from a membrane-proximal to a membrane-distal conformation. The receptor population with increased fluorescence lifetimes (activated EphA3) returned to pre-stimulation levels at 40 min, likely reflecting de-phosphorylation of activated EphA3. However, energy transfer from GFP (donor) to <sup>tkRas</sup>RFP (acceptor) will not only depend on their distance but also on the local acceptor density that may vary as a function of time and space in a FLIM time-lapse series. To account for this, the FRET rate (<italic>k<sub>T</sub></italic>) per acceptor density (<italic>k<sub>T</sub></italic>/acceptor) that does not depend on the concentration of acceptors in the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Bastiaens2">[34]</xref> needs to be determined. We estimated this parameter from the slopes of a linear fit to the fluorescence rates (τ<sup>−1</sup>)–acceptor intensity (I<sub>accep</sub>) 2D-histograms of the confocal images at selected time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Ephrin-A5 stimulation of EphA3 resulted in a significant decrease in <italic>k<sub>T</sub></italic>/acceptor values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating an increased GFP-RFP distance. The maximal decrease in the <italic>k<sub>T</sub></italic>/acceptor ratio was observed after 20 min stimulation and was followed by partial recovery of the FRET efficiency to that seen with inactive EphA3. By comparison, a confocal FLIM time series of ephrin-A5 stimulated cells expressing constitutively active EphA3[2YE]-GFP or inactive EphA3[3YF]-GFP, containing Phe-replacements of all critical tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g005">Figure 5D, 5E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Lawrenson1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Wiesner1">[27]</xref> yielded no significant change in the <italic>k<sub>T</sub></italic>/acceptor slopes, indicating that in this case stimulation does not notably change the distance between GFP and RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g005">Figure 5D, 5E</xref>). The lower <italic>k<sub>T</sub></italic>/acceptor value for EphA3[2YE]-GFP and the higher value for EphA3[3YF]-GFP as compared to non-stimulated EphA3[wt]-GFP are consistent with constitutively extended and constitutively constrained conformations, respectively, of these receptor mutants.</p>
<p>We note that single cell FLIM analysis of the Wt EphA3 conformation during stimulation exhibits considerable variance, reflecting different mixtures of active and inactive receptor populations at each spatially resolvable volume element in the image. We therefore compared the constitutive conformations of kinase active EphA3[2YE]-GFP with that of inactive EphA3[3YF]-GFP. We computed cumulative 2D-histograms of fluorescence rates versus acceptor intensities for the [2YE]-, [3YF]-, and [2YE-KM]-mutants using fluorescence lifetime/acceptor intensity images of cells for each of the mutant receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g005">Figure 5F</xref>) obtained with wide-field frequency-domain FLIM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000215.s009">Figure S9C</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Squire1">[35]</xref>). The energy transfer rate, <italic>k<sub>T</sub></italic>/acceptor, was calculated from the slope of a linear fit to the fluorescence rate—acceptor intensity 2D-histograms in which the intercept was set to the measured fluorescence rate of the donor (GFP) in the absence of acceptor. The EphA3[2YE]-GFP mutant exhibited significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 7×10<sup>−14</sup>) lower FRET efficiencies (as apparent from <italic>k<sub>T</sub></italic>/acceptor, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g005">Figure 5F</xref>) than the inactive EphA3[3YF]-GFP mutant, indicating its extension from the plasma membrane and confirming the conformational change of the Wt EphA3 ICD observed upon stimulation of live cells. The FRET efficiency of EphA3[2YE-KM]-GFP was in between these extremes, suggesting that kinase-dead Eph with a flexible JM domain adopts an intermediate position between a fully extended and constrained cytoplasmic domain, as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Wiesner1">[27]</xref>. The FRET rate (<italic>k<sub>T</sub></italic>) is proportional to the fourth power of the distance between the donor chromophore and acceptor plane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Bastiaens2">[34]</xref>.

<title>Electron Tomography of Quantum Dot (Qdot) Labelled EphA3 Confirms Increased Span of the Active EphA3 ICD</title>
<p>To examine at increased resolution the change in the span between the plasma membrane and the carboxy-terminus of the latent and activated receptor, we used electron microscopy (EM) to image the EphA3 C-terminus that had been labelled with streptavidin-conjugated Qdots (SA-Qdots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Giepmans1">[36]</xref>).

<p>We validated the feasibility of the approach by binding SA-Qdots to an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal AP-tagged and biotinylated EphA3 (AP<sub>N</sub>-EphA3).

To allow comparison of data from EM tomography with our FRET analysis, we therefore analysed AP<sub>C</sub>-EphA3[2YE], representing EphA3 with relaxed JM regions, while co-expressing the clathrin-assembly protein AP180 to block endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Zhao1">[38]</xref> of activated receptors in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, left panel). The distribution of Qdot positions in these cells was clearly different to AP<sub>C</sub>-EphA3[3YF] cells, suggesting for activated EphA3[2YE] an average span of approximately 19 nm (19.37+/−3.8 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), approximately 1.6±0.5 times wider than that of inactive [3YF]EphA3. This relative distance increase is consistent with that determined by FLIM (above) and confirms a notable extension of the activated receptor away from the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Intracellular regulation of ADAM sheddases is known to control the release of transmembrane growth factor precursors and the activation of corresponding growth factor receptors. It was identified as a cause for EGF receptor transactivation almost a decade ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Prenzel1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Fischer1">[19]</xref>. However, the mechanism linking kinase and sheddase activities has remained elusive since its inception. We have now elucidated a previously unrecognized conformational switch that is embedded in the cytoplasmic domains of Eph receptors and ADAMs and controls ADAM-function and Eph signalling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, marking the EphA3 C-terminus with fluorescent (GFP) and electron-dense (Qdots) tags allowed for the first time to demonstrate in live cells at molecular resolution that receptor activation and tyrosine phosphorylation triggers a measurable shift of the kinase domain away from the plasma membrane. The increased span of activated EphA3 that we estimated by FLIM and EM tomography is consistent with partial extension of the 64-residue (G<sub>569</sub> – N<sub>633</sub>) receptor JM domain with a maximal theoretical (β-sheet) span of ∼20 nm. While it would seem formally possible that extension of the activated EphA3 ICD reflects an unfolding of the linker connecting the kinase with the C-terminal SAM domain, recently elucidated crystal structures of the EphA3 ICD argue against this possibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Davis2">[28]</xref>: in the structures of the active and of the inactive form, this C-terminal linker is tethered to the base of the kinase, indicating that the C-terminal part of the EphA3 cytoplasmic domain maintains a rigid, kinase-associated configuration.</p>
<p>Together, our data suggest a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000215-g007">Figure 7</xref>) where the inactive, membrane-proximal receptor kinase domain obstructs the productive alignment with ADAM10 that is necessary for effective ephrin cleavage. This alignment of the ADAM and Eph extracellular domains relies on a shift of the activated kinase domain away from the membrane and on docking of the ADAM10 substrate-recognition site to the high-affinity Eph/ephrin complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>. Such a conformational switch provides rapid and precise control of ADAM10-sheddase activity and challenges the relevance of signalling intermediates that are thought to be involved in the control of ADAM10 sheddase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Seals1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Blobel1">[5]</xref>:</p>

<title>Model for activation-mediated release of the membrane-proximal Eph kinase domain promoting productive ADAM10 alignment and ephrin shedding.</title>
<p>The (helical) JM segment (red) of the unligated Eph receptor is tethered to the small (N-terminal) lobe of the kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Stein1">[24]</xref>, keeping the kinase domain (green) in an inactive, membrane-proximal conformation. Ephrin binding, Eph clustering (for simplicity only one Eph/ephrin pair is illustrated instead of a cluster), activation, and auto-phosphorylation result in release of the tyrosine-phosphorylated JM segment into a dynamic disordered protein fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Vearing1">[25]</xref> that allows extension of the kinase domain and the Eph C-terminus away from the membrane. ADAM10, constitutively associated with the receptor, can then bind a new site formed by the Eph/ephrin complex via the ADAM10 substrate recognition motif, which in turn mediates the correct orientation of the protease domain for ephrin cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Reiss1">[7]</xref>. The stoichiometry of the ADAM10/Eph/ephrin complex remains to be elaborated. Importantly, this productive alignment of ADAM10 and Eph RTK relies on a RTK configuration where its kinase domain—exerting steric hindrance for ADAM10 association—is removed from the plasma membrane.</p>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item>
<p>Our finding that cytoplasmic truncation of ADAM10 or of EphA3 does not affect ephrin shedding confirms previous studies revealing that phorbol ester-stimulated shedding by ADAM17 is not effected by deletion of its cytoplasmic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Reddy1">[22]</xref>.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>We further show that EphA3 JM mutations that permanently raise the kinase domain close to the plasma membrane significantly reduce ADAM10 association and ephrin shedding, while mutations that cause constitutive extension promote ephrin cleavage. This holds true irrespective of kinase activity, as kinase-inactive but conformationally “relaxed” EphA3[2YE-KM] supports shedding, while EphA3[ΔJXS] with an active but membrane-proximal kinase does not.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of shedding by the membrane-proximal Eph kinase domain occurs only with intact ADAM10, but is effectively rescued with cytoplasmic-truncated ADAM10 as sheddase: This indicates that it is indeed the relief from a steric clash between the membrane-proximal receptor domain and the ADAM10 cytoplasmic tail that provides the molecular switch that allows productive shedding to occur.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>These findings have considerable implications for the understanding of Eph signalling: Currently it is established that contacts between Eph and ephrin-expressing cells that fail to activate robust Eph phosphorylation will lead to cell spreading and cell-cell adhesion while cell-contact induced Eph activation and phosphotyrosine signalling result in cell rounding and cell segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Lackmann1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Pasquale2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Holmberg1">[39]</xref>. Studies demonstrating the critical role of ADAM10-catalysed ephrin shedding for cell repulsion revealed that interaction with a cleavage-resistant ephrin mutant leads to persisting Eph/ephrin contacts but does not prevent cell rounding (axon collapse) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Hattori1">[8]</xref>, suggesting independent—but tightly synchronised—processes during cell repulsion. They further imply that the cell-biological consequence of an Eph/ephrin contact is determined only during assembly of the Eph/ephrin complex: Thus, synchronisation of cell rounding and segregation requires a molecular switch that rapidly relays the signalling competence of the Eph kinase to the protease controlling ephrin shedding.</p>
<p>We now have elaborated the molecular mechanics of this relay in which kinase-active and kinase-inactive Eph receptors adopt distinct protein configurations that allow productive and unproductive association with ADAM10, respectively. Previously, we demonstrated that processed, catalytically active ADAM10 lacking the inhibitory pro-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Blobel1">[5]</xref> is associated with EphA3 also in the absence of ephrin-A5 contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Janes1">[9]</xref>. In the current context this implies that ADAM10 is “on standby” to release Eph-bound ephrin from interacting cells in the moment EphA3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and adopts a conformation that allows ADAM10 alignment for optimal substrate access. Such a mechanism provides for the synchronised Eph-triggered cell rounding and segregation that is observed during cell-cell repulsion.</p>
<p>A host of stimuli that promote ADAM-mediated shedding, including most prominently phorbol esters and calcium ionophores, have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Blobel1">[5]</xref>. However, while interaction with signalling proteins, in particular via SH3-binding motifs, have been postulated, it has remained unclear if and how the different agents could modulate ADAM activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Seals1">[4]</xref>. The concept of regulation via cytosolic intermediates has been challenged in particular by the finding that PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) efficiently activates an ADAM17 mutant lacking the ICD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Reddy1">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, CaM inhibitor and calcium-ionophore-induced shedding of EGFR-ligands by ADAM10 is retained partially by a mutant lacking the ICD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Horiuchi1">[40]</xref>. Our findings now reveal an entirely novel concept of RTK/ADAM regulation whereby the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain directly regulates ADAM activity rather than involving intermediate signalling proteins and kinase activity per se.</p>
<p>It is tempting to speculate that steric hindrance represents a conserved mechanism for receptor-regulated ADAM activity. Regulated L-selectin shedding provides an important example of a very different receptor system that may be controlled by a mechanism, where CaM binding to the L-selectin ICD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Kahn1">[21]</xref> and its ensuing conformational change seem to hinder the ability of ADAM17 to shed L-selectin. Notably, upon protein binding to its target site, CaM changes from an elongated to a globular structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Chin1">[41]</xref> with very similar dimensions (4–5 nm diameter) to the RTK kinase domain. Our observation that CaM-binding to an EphA3/L-selectin chimeric receptor can also regulate ADAM10 cleavage of ephrins would seem to confirm steric hindrance as a mechanism regulating Eph-associated ADAM activity and to suggest this as a more widely conserved concept of ADAM regulation. For example, steric hindrance could also explain the regulation of ADAM activity by other RTKs such as the EGFR, which binds CaM within the JM region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-MartinNieto1">[31]</xref> and controls ADAM-facilitated ligand shedding in an activation dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Blobel1">[5]</xref>. Indeed, EGFR signalling can be triggered in a metalloprotease-dependent manner by CaM inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Tebar1">[30]</xref>, preventing CaM access to a binding site within the EGFR JM region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-MartinNieto1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our data suggest that ephrin cleavage and its receptor-mediated internalisation may be controlled separately, since EphA3 with “relaxed” JM but inactive kinase domain effectively supports ephrin cleavage but is not internalised. While details of Eph endocytosis mechanisms remain to be elaborated, this finding is consistent with signalling-dependent RTK endocytosis potentially involving the ubiquitin ligase Cbl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Schmidt1">[42]</xref>. Importantly, effective internalisation of the EphA3 2YE mutant suggests that the JM tyrosines may not be essential for this endocytic signalling mechanism.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have developed a novel imaging strategy, which bridges the gap between structural and cell-biological imaging, to provide functional information for individual proteins in whole cells at molecular resolution, and which could have applications in a wide range of cell-biological systems. Our integrated FLIM- and EM-based analyses reveal that Eph RTK activation triggers, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, a measurable extension of the ICD towards the cytosol. The previously unforeseen functional consequences of this conformational change for downstream Eph signalling and the regulation of ADAM10 activity are likely to have important implications for the understanding of ADAM-regulated biological processes in development and disease.</p>

Flow cytometric analysis shows cell surface receptor expression (α-EphA3-Alexa<sup>647</sup>) relative to overall expression level (GFP) and to the ability of cells to bind ephrin-A5-Alexa<sup>594</sup>. The fraction of GFP-tagged EphA3 protein on the cell surface was estimated as fraction of GFP-tagged receptor recognised by the anti-EphA3 antibody: all EphA3 ICD mutants are expressed at the plasma membrane and bind the IIIA4 antibody and ephrin-A5 at levels similar to the Wt receptor.</p>

<p><bold>Phosphotyrosine profile and ADAM10 binding capacity of EphA3 JM mutants.</bold> (A) Phosphotyrosine profile in cells transfected transiently to express Wt EphA3 and JM mutants. HEK293T cells were transfected with expression constructs for Wt EphA3-GFP or derived mutants, as indicated, and cells treated with non-clustered or pre-clustered ephrin-A5 Fc for 10 min. Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) antibody (4G10) immuno-precipitates from whole cell lysates were probed with anti-PY, and total lysates with anti-EphA3 antibodies, as indicated. Positions on the Western blot corresponding to molecular weights of GFP-EphA3 and IgG (heavy and light chains) are indicated on the left. Phosphorylated protein bands at the GFP-EphA3 position in the left panel are likely due to auto-phosphorylation due to high transient over-expression of the EphA3 constructs in these samples. (B) ADAM10 association with Wt and mutant EphA3. ADAM10 immunoprecipitates and total cell lysates from Wt or mutant (as indicated) EphA3-transfected cells (ephrin-A5-treated) were analysed for EphA3 and ADAM10 by immunoblot.

<p><bold>CaM inhibitors regulate association of EphA3-L-selectin with CaM and with ADAM10 and trigger ephrinA5 shedding by EphA3-L-selectin expressing cells.</bold> (A) CaM inhibitors block association of CaM with EphA3-L-selectin. Cells expressing AP-tagged EphA3/L-selectin or Wt AP-EphA3 were treated with CaM inhibitors trifluoperazine (TFP) or Calm or vehicle control, as indicated. Following biotinylation of AP-tagged receptors, EphA3 complexes were recovered by SA pulldown and analysed by Western blot with anti-CaM and anti-EphA3 antibodies. The positions of Wt EphA3 and of the EphA3/L-selectin fusion protein are indicated. (B) CaM inhibitors modulate the association of EphA3/L-selectin with ADAM10. HEK293T cells expressing EphA3/L-selectin (left panels) or Wt EphA3 (right panels) were pre-treated (30 min) with CaM inhibitors TFP (20 µM), Calm (2 µM), N-6-Aminohexyl0-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W7, 100 µM), or vehicle control before lysis. ADAM10 immunoprecipitates were analysed by Western blot with anti-EphA3 or anti-ADAM10 antibodies, and total lysates with anti-EphA3 antibodies, as indicated. The graph shows amounts of EphA3/L-selectin (left panels) or EphA3 (right panels) in ADAM10 immunoprecipitates relative to control lanes as determined by densitometry. (C) Mutation of the CaM-binding site in EphA3-L-selectin reduces its ability to support ephrinA5 cleavage. L358E and K359E substitutions, reported to affect CaM binding to the L selectin cytoplasmic domain, were introduced into the EphA3/L selectin chimera to produce EphLsel EE. HEK293T cells, transfected with Wt EphA3-L-selectin or with EphLsel EE were incubated with Alexa<sup>594</sup>-labelled ephrinA5 beads; the capacity to promote ephrin cleavage was monitored by measuring ephrin labelling of the cell membrane. Ephrin labelling relative to receptor expression was determined in 50 regions from five individual micrographs for each sample. The mean+/−SEM are shown in the graph.</p>

Strong (cytosolic) EphA3 GFP fluorescence was blacked out to exclude areas where the detector was saturated. Cumulative (2D) phase (τ<sub>Φ</sub>) and modulation (τ<sub>M</sub>) fluorescence lifetime histograms of cell populations (right panels) indicate significant fluorescence lifetime differences between EphA3-GFP-[2YE] and EphA3-GFP-[3YF].

A highly significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) difference between the two datasets suggests a measurable change in the donor (EphA3-GFP)/acceptor (RFP-labelled membrane) distance. The two datasets were entered for the KS test at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/KS-test.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/KS-test.html</ext-link>.

The images were taken from the same cell before (bottom row) and following (top row) RFP (acceptor) photobleaching. Areas of the cell where the fluorescent acceptor was photobleached show an increase in the GFP lifetime of the donor compared to the nonbleached sample, confirming the fidelity of lifetime imaging to detect FRET.</p>
