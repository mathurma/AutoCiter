<abstract>
<p>Reversible epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is central to tissue development, epithelial stemness, and cancer metastasis. While many regulatory elements have been identified to induce EMT, the complex process underlying such cellular plasticity remains poorly understood. Utilizing a systems biology approach integrating modeling and experiments, we found multiple intermediate states contributing to EMT and that the robustness of the transitions is modulated by transcriptional factor Ovol2. In particular, we obtained evidence for a mutual inhibition relationship between Ovol2 and EMT inducer Zeb1, and observed that adding this regulation generates a novel four-state system consisting of two distinct intermediate phenotypes that differ in differentiation propensities and are favored in different environmental conditions. We identified epithelial cells that naturally exist in an intermediate state with bidirectional differentiation potential, and found the balance between EMT-promoting and -inhibiting factors to be critical in achieving and selecting between intermediate states. Our analysis suggests a new design principle in controlling cellular plasticity through multiple intermediate cell fates and underscores the critical involvement of Ovol2 and its associated molecular regulations.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cumulative evidence reveals remarkable lineage plasticity of somatic cells. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) represents a prime example of such plasticity where an epithelial cell is converted into a mesenchymal cell. This process is used in normal development to generate crucial cell types, and is hijacked by cancer cells for invasion and metastasis. Recent studies also suggest the importance of EMT in generating stem cell properties. The reversibility of EMT and its sensitivity to varying environmental stimuli pose interesting challenges to understand the intricate regulatory networks that direct cellular state transitions and their dynamics. Here we use a systems biology approach to probe into the complexity of the EMT process. We report a new molecular regulation that expands the known regulatory network, and show that this new network is capable of generating multiple intermediate states, which we provide experimental evidence for. We present modeling and experimental results to highlight the significance of a delicate balance between EMT-promoting and -inhibiting factors for achieving and/or selecting an intermediate state, and to suggest the biological significance of the multiple intermediate states. This work further elucidates the complex strategies that control epithelial cell behavior and cancer/stem cell plasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) represents an extreme form of cellular plasticity where an epithelial cell is converted into a mesenchymal cell. Complete EMT is essential during embryogenesis to generate crucial developmental cell types [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], whereas partial EMT occurs in committed epithelial tissues with yet unknown functional significance [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recently, EMT has been shown to promote stem cell properties, as differentiated epithelial cells that have undergone a round of EMT gain multipotency and self-renewal capability [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, reversible EMT plays important roles in pathological processes such as cancer metastasis and wound healing. EMT endows cancer cells with the ability to migrate and invade adjacent tissues through changes in adhesion and behavior. Upon arrival to the destination site, EMTed cancer cells can revert to the epithelial phenotype via mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) to settle and differentiate into secondary tumors [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have identified key transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are involved in the regulation of EMT. In particular, mutual inhibition loops formed between Zeb1 and miR-200 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and between Snail and miR-34a [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are critical components in the regulatory network [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mathematical modeling suggested that these mutual inhibition loops govern a tri-stable system, in which cells can be stabilized at an epithelial (E) state, a mesenchymal (M) state, or an intermediate state exhibiting expression of signature genes of both E and M in a variable fashion [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The intermediate state identified by these models is proposed to associate with cancer cells that exhibit collective migration during tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], implicating the clinical relevance of the ternary switch in cell plasticity.</p>
<p>In recent experimental studies, we showed that transcription factor Ovol2 restricts EMT by directly inhibiting EMT-inducing factors including Zeb1, and that these regulations are critical for proper morphogenesis and for maintaining epithelial lineages in mammary gland and skin epidermis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the precise role of Ovol2 in the context of the well-studied core molecular network that controls EMT dynamics remains to be elucidated. In addition, it is unclear how EMT-inhibiting transcriptional factors like Ovol2 and EMT-promoting transcription factors like Zeb1 interact integratively to regulate the intermediate state.</p>
<p>In this work, we first provide new experimental evidence suggesting a direct regulation of Ovol2 by Zeb1, which together with previous reports of Ovol2 inhibition of Zeb1 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrates the existence of an Ovol2-Zeb1 mutual inhibition circuit. We then present a mathematical model that includes this new regulation, revealing two, rather than one, intermediate states with distinct propensities to differentiate into E and M states. We show that the Ovol2-Zeb1 mutual inhibition circuit is essential for the existence and robustness of both intermediate states in this model, and experimentally validate a specific prediction of the model, namely that Ovol2 is able to reprogram any given states to an E state. Furthermore, we describe experimental results suggesting that mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A represents one of the intermediate states that exhibit a bidirectional potential to differentiate into both E and M states. Together, our findings uncover a new layer of complexity of the dynamic, multi-step transitions between E and M states and unravel key regulatory mechanisms that control such transitions.</p>

<title>A regulatory network containing Ovol2-Zeb1 mutual repression results in multiple intermediate states and a four-state EMT system</title>
<p>Mutual inhibition loops between EMT-inducing TFs and miRNAs (e.g. Zeb1-miR200 and Snail-miR34a) are critical for robust control of EMT/MET [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our previous studies showed that Zeb1 is directly inhibited by Ovol2 in mammary and skin epithelial cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Zeb1 and Ovol2 are expressed in a mutually exclusive pattern in clinical and cell line samples [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], raising the possibility that Zeb1 may also inhibit Ovol2 expression. Indeed, sequence analysis revealed the presence of two conserved Zeb1 binding consensus sequences in the human and mouse <italic>OVOL2/Ovol2</italic> promoters, one near the transcriptional start site (-335 bp and -111 bp for human and mouse genes, respectively) and the other further upstream (-1546 bp and -1167 bp for human and mouse, respectively) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we detected Zeb1 binding to the downstream but not upstream site (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Furthermore, forced expression of Zeb1 in MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells significantly decreased <italic>OVOL2</italic> expression at a transcriptional level, whereas Ovol2 overexpression led to reduced level of <italic>ZEB1</italic> transcript as expected (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). These results are consistent with direct repression of <italic>OVOL2/Ovol2</italic> expression by Zeb1, and together with previously published data suggest the existence of an Ovol2-Zeb1 mutual inhibition loop.</p>

<p>To dissect the role of the Ovol2-Zeb1 loop in EMT dynamics, we incorporated this regulation, as well as the negative regulation of TGF-β signaling by Ovol2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] into a framework that has been successfully used to formulate a 3-state EMT system [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The new model thus contains three mutual inhibition loops: Zeb1-miR200, Snail-miR34a and Ovol2-Zeb1 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). To examine how the system might be stabilized at various stages of EMT, we performed bifurcation analysis with respect to external TGF-β as an EMT inducer. Interestingly, four distinct stable steady states corresponding to four cell phenotypes emerged with the addition of the Ovol2-Zeb1 loop (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). In particular, two intermediate states appeared between a terminal E state and an M state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). We named the intermediate state closer to the E state I1, and the one closer to the M state I2. The dynamic feature of the four-state system is consistent with the recently proposed sequential cell-state transition in which more than one intermediate states may exist [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and it is also compatible with existing EMT models [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in terms of possible ternary switch in the system (I1-I2-M, E-I1-I2, E-I1-M or E-I2-M, depending on specific external stimulations). Importantly, our model predicted that elevated production of Ovol2 is able to reprogram all other states to the terminal E state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). We will return to this notion later.</p>

<title>Experimental evidence supports the 4-state model and validates the reprogramming ability of Ovol2</title>
<p>Previous work stipulates that unstimulated MCF10A cells are in an epithelial state and when stimulated by increasing concentrations of TGF-β they transition into first an intermediate (partial EMT) state and subsequently an M state [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, by comparing the expression of epithelial (E-cadherin or Ecad) and mesenchymal (vimentin or Vim) markers between MCF10A and two breast cancer cell lines well-characterized for their cellular states (MCF7 = E state, MDA-MB231 = metastatic human breast cancer cells corresponding to an M state), we found MCF10A cells to be likely in a state that is intermediate between typical terminal E and M cells (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, compare green population to others; <xref rid="pcbi.1004569.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). This is consistent with a recent study showing that MCF10A cells tend to collectively migrate [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a feature that has been associated with the intermediate phenotype [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We surmise that the natural state of these cells is I1, because a majority of them show low to no Vim expression, suggesting more similarity to the terminal E than M cells.</p>

<p>To experimentally test whether Ovol2 is able to reprogram I1-state cells into an E state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), we overexpressed Ovol2 in MCF10A cells using a lentiviral expression system in which the Ovol2-expressing cells can be distinguished from uninfected cells by bicistronic expression of GFP (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). This led to significantly increased expression of Ecad, and decreased expression of Vim as assessed by quantitative population analysis using flow cytometry (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, blue population). Comparison with Ecad/Vim profiles in <xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> reveals the similarity between Ovol2-reprogrammed cells and terminal E cells (MCF7). In contrast, overexpression of EMT inducers Snail or Zeb1 directed MCF10A cells to an M phenotype (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, red and orange populations). To compare these observations with our mathematical model, we performed stochastic simulations with the basal model upon fluctuations in gene/protein expression (see details in <xref rid="sec008" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We started simulation with the initial condition at I1 state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, green). Remarkably, at high basal production rates of Zeb1 and Ovol2 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, red and blue), the simulation produced similar Ecad/Vim expression patterns of these populations as those observed in our experiments. Consistent with previous reports that EMT promotes stemness [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the expression of a well-known cancer stem cell marker CD44 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] decreased upon Ovol2-induced transition to E and increased upon Zeb1/Snail-induced transition to M (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). These observations demonstrate the bidirectional differentiation potential of MCF10A cells towards two opposite directions (i.e., I1 to E or I1 to M) and provide evidence for the opposing roles of Ovol2 and Snail/Zeb1 in the dynamic EMT system of MCF10A cells.</p>
<p>As bifurcation analysis also predicted the ability of Ovol2 to reprogram M-state cells into an E state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), we tested the effect of Ovol2 overexpression on MDA-MB231 cells. Indeed, forced expression of Ovol2 was able to convert these cells to exhibiting a pattern of Ecad/Vim expression that is reminiscent of the terminal E state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). This finding is consistent with previous reports of Ovol2 overexpression inducing epithelial features in M-state cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Results of stochastic simulations for control M-state cells and Ovol2-overexpressed M-state cells using the corresponding conditions are in good agreement with this observation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). Interestingly, a time series experiment revealed that the downregulation of Vim precedes the induction of Ecad, suggesting that upon Ovol2 expression these cells first lose their memory of the M state and then acquire the E phenotype (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with previous findings [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], a high dose of TGF-β resulted in a complete conversion of cells to what appears to be the M state, whereas low dose of TGF-β induced the appearance of two new populations in a heterogeneous culture that are likely I2 (previously termed P state for partial EMT in Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) and M states (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004569.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Of note, in both mathematical modeling and experiments, the I2 state appears less stable than I1, as it 1) shows more vulnerability when facing fluctuations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>); 2) entails a narrow range of Ovol2 concentration in the absence of strong TGF-β signaling (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>); and 3) is barely distinguishable from the M or I1 state experimentally and in simulations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004569.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). The degree of separation of the different cell populations in our study is less remarkable than that reported [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], possibly due to the dynamic nature of I2 and the subtle differences in experimental conditions.</p>

<p>Taken together, these experimental results support our computational discovery of a four-state dynamic system. Moreover, they highlight the ability of Ovol2 in reprogramming both I1- and M-state cells into a terminal E state, as predicted by our model.

<title>Critical regulatory controls in maintaining the four states</title>
<p>First, we explored the roles of Ovol2 in regulatory control of the four states. Through bifurcation analysis with respect to external TGF-β and basal production rate of Ovol2 representing examples of EMT-inducing and -suppressing signals that are responsive to changes of the tissue microenvironment, we found these two signals to produce various combinations of cell phenotypes (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A(I)</xref>). Clearly, Ovol2 basal production rate exerted positive and negative effects on the robustness of E and M states, respectively (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, blue and pink areas), and this is consistent with the demonstrated role of Ovol2 in preventing EMT and inducing MET ([<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and this study). The effect of Ovol2 on the two intermediate states can be either positive or negative. Stability of I1 can be maintained when the strengths of Ovol2 and TGF-β signals are approximately proportional, with low levels of both giving rise to the most robust condition (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, cyan area). In contrast, stability of I2 requires a minimum rate of Ovol2 basal production, but its robustness increases with higher levels of both Ovol2 and TGF-β (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, orange area). In a specific case, when TGF-β signal was increased by 10-fold, higher Ovol2 basal production rate was required to retain the stability of both I1 and I2 states and to prevent the cells from differentiating into M state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>, blue and orange triangles). Conversely, when Ovol2 basal production rate was increased, higher TGF-β signal strength was required to retain two stable intermediate states and to prevent the cells from differentiating into E state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>, blue and orange diamonds). Overall, our analysis suggests that Ovol2 production tends to stabilize E state and destabilize M state, and that the two intermediate states are favored in two distinct conditions (high- versus low-signals) but both require the proper balance between EMT-inducing (e.g. TGF-β) and -suppressing signals (e.g. signals that induce Ovol2 expression).</p>

<p>Next we reduced the strength of the Zeb1-Ovol2 mutual inhibition loop to determine its specific role in the four-state system. This led to no significant effect on the robustness of E state, moderately positive effect on that of M state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, middle column, blue and pink areas), but significantly reduced robustness of the two intermediate states (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, middle column, cyan and orange areas). A complete blockage of the mutual inhibition loop resulted in a very small I1 region, and complete disappearance of the I2 region (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, right column). The role of the Ovol2-Zeb1 loop appeared distinct from that of the miR34a-Snail and miR200-Zeb1 mutual inhibition loops, as at least one of the miRNA-TF loops becomes dispensable for I2 (but not I1) when the other is intact (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>, left and middle columns). This said, a complete blockage of both miRNA-TF loops abolished the intermediate states (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>, right column). Partial blockage of each mutual inhibition loop gave rise to complex effects on the robustness of the two intermediate states (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004569.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>), but these effects are consistent with the finding of redundancy between the two miRNA-TF loops in terms of maintaining I2 state. Interestingly, partial blockage of miR200-Zeb1 resulted in a merge of the I1 and I2 regions, forming a large, continuous intermediate region (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that while all three mutual inhibition loops contribute to the existence and robustness of the two intermediate states, the strength of the Ovol2-Zeb1 loop is more critical.</p>

<title>Distinct differentiation propensities of the two intermediate states</title>
<p>We next used stochastic modeling to examine how likely a population of cells at the two intermediate states differentiates into E or M state when gene/protein expression fluctuates. We chose a condition under which the four states are stable (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, green star). Simulations were performed under this condition for two populations of cells originating from I1 and I2 respectively (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A and 9F</xref>). When fluctuations were small, cells stayed in the basins of attraction of their initial steady state by the end of the simulation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A and 9D</xref>). Large fluctuations triggered both E(I)MT and M(I)ET of the cells originally in I1, resulting in a heterogeneous population containing E and M phenotypes, whereas the same level of fluctuations triggered E(I)MT of the cells originally in I2 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B and 9E</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004569.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Thus, the I1 and I2 cells have distinct differentiation propensities, with I1 cells more likely differentiating into E state, whereas I2 cells more likely into M state. These simulations also allowed us to infer that E and M states are more stable than the intermediate states, and that I1 is more stable than I2 under the particular conditions tested (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9C and 9F</xref>).</p>

<p>We also asked whether changing Ovol2 production rate can affect the differentiation propensities from the I1 state. We reduced the basal production rate of Ovol2 by 20% and performed stochastic simulations starting from I1 as in <xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>. We found that this reduced Ovol2 production rate enabled more cells to settle at M state, and less cells to settle at I1 or E state (compare <xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B and 9H</xref>). We speculate that this is due to the reduced stability of E and I1 states, and/or the reduced energy barrier from I1 to I2 and M states (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9I</xref>), providing a possible thermodynamic explanation for the role of Ovol2 in preventing EMT and inducing MET. Conversely, increased basal production of Ovol2 enabled some of the cells from I2 state to settle at E state instead of M state in the presence of large fluctuations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9J, 9K and 9L</xref>; compare panels E and K). These results suggest that the differentiation propensities of the two intermediate states can be regulated by tuning the level of Ovol2 expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study provides both modeling and experimental evidence for a new intermediate state that lies between E and M states in addition to the recently observed intermediate state [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous studies based on epigenetic modifications predicted that multiple intermediate states may exist between terminal E and M states, and they may contribute to phenotypic plasticity in a continuous manner [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, Huang et al. classified 43 ovarian carcinoma cell lines into four subgroups, including an E-like intermediate and an M-like intermediate states in the EMT spectrum, based on expression patterns of signature EMT genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To our knowledge, our work is the first unequivocal demonstration of two intermediate states in EMT. Previous theoretical study revealed four types of stable states during T cell differentiation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; a common feature of that and our study is the inclusion of multiple (a minimum of three) positive feedback loops (including mutual inhibition). We anticipate that as the complexity of modeling increases by adding more regulatory elements, even more intermediate states may be observed, with the most extreme scenario being a spectrum of metastable or stable cell phenotypes lying between the terminal E and M states. A unique and interesting feature of our four-state model is that intermediate states are not necessarily metastable; instead they can be stable with no (I1) or high (I2) EMT-inducing/inhibitory forces. It is the balance between these two opposing forces that is critical for maintaining the intermediate states.</p>
<p>Given the assumptions we make in our mathematical model, we have shown that the Ovol2-Zeb1 mutual inhibition loop is necessary for maintaining a four-state system. On one hand, this highlights the unique importance of the role of Ovol2 in EMT. On the other hand, the model leaves open the possibility that a four-state system could be governed by other unknown TFs that might be involved in a similar mutual inhibition loop. As discussed above, with additional positive feedback loops (&gt;3), it is conceivable that additional intermediate states will emerge. As such, our model provides a framework for identifying and analyzing multiple intermediate phenotypes in EMT, and suggests a general and unique role of TF-based mutual inhibition loop in this system. With a proposed Ovol-Zeb1 mutual inhibition loop, a recent modeling study suggested important roles of Ovol2 in controlling the previously established three-state EMT system [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This is in agreement with our findings that Ovol2 is critical for both intermediate states.</p>
<p>What is the advantage of having intermediate state(s)? Such state can be a “hybrid” state, where cells exhibit both, albeit partial, “E” and “M” phenotypes. Indeed, during mammary gland morphogenesis, some epithelial cells at the tips of growing ducts express mesenchymal markers while simultaneously retaining epithelial integrity, suggesting that they are in a naturally occurring “hybrid” state [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this case, a “hybrid” phenotype would enable the cells to undergo collective migration, by which they invade the surrounding stroma as a coherent epithelial front to facilitate branching morphogenesis. The same may be true for metastatic cancer cells as they acquire a mesenchymal phenotype to invade the surrounding tissue and colonize distant sites as epithelial tumors. Alternatively, an intermediate state can be a “naïve” state, where cells are devoid of typical epithelial and mesenchymal features. Along this line, we note our experimental observation that MCF10A cells seem to first lose their initial phenotypes (E or M), and then gain their destination phenotypes (M or E) during the factors-directed state transitions (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Traveling through a “naïve” state could be a useful mechanism to erase memories of old lineages, thus creating a window of opportunity for expanded differentiation plasticity as desired for multipotent stem cells.</p>
<p>Why multiple intermediate states then? Chuong and Widelitz proposed the interesting idea that stem cell states can be regulated depending on the physiological needs of tissues to generate different numbers of intermediate stops on their journey to differentiation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The same concept may be applicable to the EMT system, as having multiple intermediate states offers additional facets of regulation to more precisely control the temporal and spatial flux of epithelial cells through their differentiation/dedifferentiation pathway to adapt to various tissue environments or topology. Regardless of whether cells adopt an intermediate fate to gain "hybrid" behavior (e.g., collective migration) or to dedifferentiate to a naive state for lineage plasticity, the more intermediate states there are, the more thermodynamic traps that would be. Thus having more than one intermediate state would create a more controllable energy barrier so that cells do not easily fall into the mesenchymal state, which we know from previous studies is largely irreversible [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Non-genetic heterogeneity and spontaneous conversion among subpopulations have been documented for hematopoietic stem cells and breast cancer cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Theoretical analysis of these dynamic processes often involves the assumption that gene regulatory networks can generate multiple stem-like states that are adjacent in state space [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our model presents a good example in which a network of three mutual inhibition loops is capable of giving rise to two adjacent states that may be associated with subpopulations of cells having distinct propensities for differentiation or tumorigenesis. The unstable nature of the I2 state under conditions examined and the phenotypic similarities between I1 and I2 states prevented us from further characterizing the molecular differences between the two intermediate cell populations and their corresponding cellular behaviors. As such, the functional significance of having two intermediate states has yet to be experimentally established.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated bidirectional transitions of MCF10A cells upon Zeb1/Snail overexpression (I1-M transition), TGF-β treatment [I1-(I2)-M transition] and Ovol2 overexpression (I1-E transition) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). It is tempting to ask which extracellular signaling molecules can trigger Ovol2 upregulation and the subsequent transition to E state under physiological conditions. Among the possible candidates is a BMP signal as it is known to induce MET [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and to positively regulate Ovol2 expression during embryonic stem cell differentiation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Identification of Ovol2-inducing external signals that can induce MET of MCF10A cells will enable a finer analysis of the dynamic process of MET as well as further experimental validation of our mathematic model.</p>
<p>In summary, our work identifies transcriptional factor Ovol2 and its mutual inhibition relationship with Zeb1 as critical additions to the known EMT regulatory network. Specifically, these new regulatory elements are important for attaining and maintaining the two intermediate states. Furthermore, their experimental perturbations allowed us to observe the bidirectionality of transitions from the intermediate states. Together, our study offers a framework for understanding the molecular strategies and design principles by which epithelial stem, progenitor, or cancer cells achieve multipotency or collective migration.</p>

<title>Mathematical modeling</title>
<p>We used ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the regulatory network shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004569.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>. The framework of the model stems from a recently published EMT model [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the modeling details are described therein. This framework employs mass-action dynamics to model microRNA-mRNA interactions with considerations of the microRNA binding sites on their targets. This modeling strategy was introduced by Lu et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As other transcription factor regulations, interactions involving Ovol2 were modeled with Hill functions. Numerical bifurcation analysis was performed with PyDSTool [<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To consider fluctuations in gene expression, we added multiplicative white noise to some of the ODEs. To determine which phenotype (basin of attraction) a cell adopts at the end of the simulations, we set the noise terms to zero and let the simulation continue until it reached steady state (<xref rid="pcbi.1004569.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Lists of equations, parameters and assumptions can be found in supplementary materials.
