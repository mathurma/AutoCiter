				<article-title>The Unfolding of Amyloid's True Colors</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Amyloid is a generally insoluble, fibrous cross-β sheet protein aggregate. The process of amyloidogenesis is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington disease. We report the discovery of an unprecedented functional mammalian amyloid structure generated by the protein Pmel17. This discovery demonstrates that amyloid is a fundamental nonpathological protein fold utilized by organisms from bacteria to humans. We have found that Pmel17 amyloid templates and accelerates the covalent polymerization of reactive small molecules into melanin—a critically important biopolymer that protects against a broad range of cytotoxic insults including UV and oxidative damage. Pmel17 amyloid also appears to play a role in mitigating the toxicity associated with melanin formation by sequestering and minimizing diffusion of highly reactive, toxic melanin precursors out of the melanosome. Intracellular Pmel17 amyloidogenesis is carefully orchestrated by the secretory pathway, utilizing membrane sequestration and proteolytic steps to protect the cell from amyloid and amyloidogenic intermediates that can be toxic. While functional and pathological amyloid share similar structural features, critical differences in packaging and kinetics of assembly enable the usage of Pmel17 amyloid for normal function. The discovery of native Pmel17 amyloid in mammals provides key insight into the molecular basis of both melanin formation and amyloid pathology, and demonstrates that native amyloid (amyloidin) may be an ancient, evolutionarily conserved protein quaternary structure underpinning diverse pathways contributing to normal cell and tissue physiology.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Proteins typically adopt a well-defined three-dimensional structure, but can misfold and form aggregates with a specific cross-β sheet fold called amyloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b004">4</xref>]. The multistep process of amyloidogenesis is linked to a number of diseases, including many resulting in neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b007">7</xref>]. Nonpathogenic amyloid has not been detected in higher organisms and was unexpected because of the toxicity associated with its formation. We have discovered an abundant mammalian amyloid structure that functions in melanosome biogenesis, challenging the current view that amyloid in mammals is always cytotoxic.</p>
      <p>Melanosomes are highly abundant mammalian cellular organelles generated in developmentally specialized cells including melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b009">9</xref>] that reside in the skin and eyes. Melanosome maturation has been demonstrated to require the formation of detergent-insoluble, lumenal Pmel17 fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b012">12</xref>], which are believed to function in polymerization of intermediates in the synthesis of the tyrosine-based polymer melanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b014">14</xref>]. Melanin serves as one of nature's chemical defenses against pathogens, toxic small molecules, and UV radiation, and is present in most eukaryotic phyla ranging from fungi to insects and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b015">15</xref>]. The functional requirement for Pmel17 in pigmentation is also well established. In mice, a point mutation in the Pmel17/<italic>silver</italic> locus results in a progressive loss of pigmentation, apparently through loss of melanocyte viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b019">19</xref>]. Mutations in Pmel17 orthologs in chicken and zebrafish also result in hypopigmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b021">21</xref>]. Melanosome biogenesis utilizes the secretory and endocytic pathways to direct furin-like, proprotein-convertase-mediated proteolytic processing of the transmembrane glycoprotein Pmel17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b010">10</xref>] in an acidic post-Golgi compartment, yielding a 28-kDa transmembrane fragment (Mβ) and an 80-kDa lumenal fragment (Mα) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b012">12</xref>]. Mβ is degraded, whereas Mα self-assembles into fibers that form the core of mature melanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Herein we show that fibers in isolated mammalian melanosomes, consisting of Mα, have an amyloid structure. This conclusion is based on the binding of dyes that fluoresce upon interacting with a cross-β sheet structure and on our ability to reconstitute Pmel17 amyloid formation in vitro as demonstrated by a variety of biophysical techniques. The rapidity of recombinant Pmel17 fibrilization is unprecedented, consistent with a process optimized by evolution for function and to avoid the toxicity of pathological amyloidogenesis. Moreover, we have shown that reconstituted Pmel17 amyloid accelerates melanin formation in vitro, apparently by serving as a scaffold that templates the polymerization of highly reactive melanin precursors, probably influencing the resulting structure of melanin as well. Importantly, Mα amyloid may also mitigate the toxicity associated with melanin synthesis by sequestering and minimizing diffusion of highly reactive, toxic melanin precursors out of the melanosome. The utilization of the amyloid fold for a major cellular activity in mammals demonstrates that sequence and folding pathway evolution can harness this ancient structure for physiological purposes.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>As a first test to examine whether Mα fibers have an amyloid fold, we prepared a highly enriched melanosome fraction from homogenates of the RPE and choroidal layers from bovine eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b022">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This ex vivo sampling of melanosomes enables a variety of experiments unavailable in the context of whole tissue while maintaining a high degree of physiological relevance. As expected, purified melanosomes all contained Mα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g001">1</xref>C). The amyloid content of the melanosomes was interrogated using the amyloid-selective fluorophores thioflavin S and Congo red. These molecules preferentially bind to amyloid over other types of protein aggregates, and their fluorescence upon binding is commonly used in the laboratory and the clinic to diagnose the presence of amyloid in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b025">25</xref>]. Strikingly, greater than 95% of the structures in the melanosome fraction bound thioflavin S and Congo red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g001">1</xref>G), strongly suggesting that melanosomes contain Mα amyloid. Congo red birefringence was not observed from the stained melanosomes because their thickness is an order of magnitude smaller than the requisite 10-μm thickness achieved in tissue sections. Nevertheless, Congo red fluorescence has been shown to be as effective as birefringence in the diagnosis of amyloid diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b023">23</xref>].</p>

      </fig>
      <p>To substantiate that thioflavin S and Congo red binding-induced fluorescence reflect the existence of Mα amyloid, we took advantage of the fact that amyloid fibers resist moderate detergent extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b005">5</xref>]. When melanosomes were extracted with 1% Triton-X 100 to remove their membranes, thioflavin S–stained particle clusters recovered in the detergent-insoluble fraction showed nearly exclusive overlap with Pmel17 antibody fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g002">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that Mα is a component of the observed amyloid structures within melanosomes. Thioflavin S did not stain residual melanin-containing dense granules (observed by differential interference contrast microscopy) lacking Mα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g002">Figure 2</xref>, red arrowheads in insets), demonstrating that the melanin polymer is not responsible for fluorophore binding in intact melanosomes. Bovine melanosomes lose both Mα and thioflavin S binding upon boiling with 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (data not shown), consistent with the denaturation of the Mα amyloid fiber under these conditions. Because boiling in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate does not alter the covalent structure of melanin, these results provide further evidence that thioflavin S is specific for the Mα amyloid component of melanosome granules.</p>

      <p>The data suggest that the Mα fibers found in melanosomes within mammalian cells have an amyloid fold. Consistent with this, we found that Mα spontaneously self-assembles into amyloid in vitro. The non-glycosylated, 442-residue lumenal fragment of Pmel17, referred to as recombinant Mα (rMα; without carbohydrate) was reconstituted from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> inclusion bodies. Purification of rMα by gel filtration in 8 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) was required to preserve an unfolded, nonaggregated state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Dilution of rMα into nondenaturing buffers resulted in exceedingly rapid amyloidogenesis (within 3 s, rate-limited by the time required for mixing) over a broad pH range as monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) and endpoint Congo red analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, inset). To ensure that rMα amyloidogenesis kinetics were not altered by the presence of GdmCl-resistant Mα seeds, stock rMα solutions purified by gel filtration in 8 M GdmCl were subjected to ultracentrifugation (500,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h) before the top 90% of supernatant was removed and subjected to chaotrope-dilution-initiated amyloidogenesis. Ultracentrifugation did not decrease the rate of amyloidogenesis or alter the concentration of the rMα stock. Other highly amyloidogenic, natively unfolded proteins such as Aβ and α-synuclein do not form amyloid within the dead time of mixing upon transfer from denaturing to nondenaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In fact, rMα amyloidogenesis is at least four orders of magnitude faster than that of Aβ or α-synuclein under identical physiological conditions at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g003">3</xref>B). We are unaware of any other protein nearly so amyloidogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b026">26</xref>], consistent with a functional amyloid fold optimized by evolution to avoid the formation of toxic intermediates prominent in pathogenic amyloidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b007">7</xref>].</p>

          <p>(A) rMα samples (in 8 M GdmCl to preserve an unfolded, nonaggregated state) were diluted by manual mixing to start an amyloid fiber formation time course (monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence) at varying pHs: pH 7.4 (black line, triangles), pH 6.0 (dark grey line, circles), and pH 4.85 (light grey line, squares); control (thioflavin T buffer) (black line, white diamonds ).

      <p>A variety of structural techniques were employed to confirm that rMα aggregates possess an amyloid structure. Aggregate morphology was examined by electron microscopy, revealing fibers with an average diameter of 10 nm, typical of amyloid formed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b027">27</xref>]. X-ray powder diffraction of rMα aggregates revealed a very strong reflection at 4.6 Å and a weaker reflection at 10 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), consistent with the amyloid cross-β sheet quaternary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b028">28</xref>]. The presence of β-sheet structure is further supported by the far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of soluble rMα amyloid formed at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) and the attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of insoluble rMα amyloid, which are both fully consistent with known amyloid spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b029">29</xref>]. Both methods indicate approximately 50% β-sheet content, suggesting that rMα amyloid may contain folded domains external to the fiber structure. The Ure2p prion amyloid is known to have a central amyloid core with an attached globular domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b030">30</xref>]. Our biophysical data revealed that the Mα fibers required for melanosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b012">12</xref>] are amyloid.</p>

      <p>rMα amyloid was used to further investigate the native function of Mα amyloid fibers in melanogenesis. The monomeric precursor for melanin polymerization, indole-5,6-quinone (DHQ), is one of the terminal products of a series of oxidation steps initiated by the action of the type I transmembrane enzyme tyrosinase on the substrate tyrosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b015">15</xref>]. Melanin is thought to consist of DHQ and other intermediates polymerized upon a template of Mα fibers within the maturing melanosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g005">5</xref>B). To test this possibility, we employed an in vitro assay utilizing tyrosinase, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), and rMα amyloid that recapitulates melanin formation within the melanosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g005">5</xref>D). A time course reveals that rMα amyloid hastens the formation of insoluble melanin when added to the melanization assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), resulting in more melanin per unit time. rMα amyloid also affords more than 2.2-fold more melanin after 20 h than an equivalent amount of collagen IV, an α-helical fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Interestingly, DHQ shares a core that is isostructural with the benzothiazole substructure of the amyloidophilic fluorophore thioflavin T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, box), which might account for its affinity for amyloid fibers. Recent studies have shown that thioflavin T binds in a regular fashion parallel to the amyloid fiber axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b031">31</xref>]. Binding of DHQ in an analogous fashion may be what enables Mα amyloid to concentrate and organize reactive DHQ or analogous reactive melanin precursors along the Mα fiber, templating their efficient covalent polymerization. Because the Mα fibers are completely buried during the process of melanogenesis they are unlikely to function as catalysts. Strikingly, α-synuclein and Aβ amyloid enhance the yield of melanin formation in a manner comparable to rMα amyloid in our in vitro melanogenesis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040006-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Apparently, the cross-β sheet structure of amyloid, shared between Mα, Aβ, and α-synuclein fibers, functions specifically to template the synthesis of melanin in vitro. We suggest that this process occurs in vivo on Mα fibers within melanosomes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The discovery of amyloid as a prominent structure in eukaryotic cells now adds the amyloid fold to the repertoire of structures used in normal mammalian cell physiology. We provide a number of lines of in vitro and ex vivo evidence to support this conclusion. Ex vivo melanosomes exhibit selective environment-sensitive thioflavin T and Congo red fluorescence and have detergent-resistant properties expected of amyloid. rMα assembles faster than any known polypeptide into amyloid fibers, at least four orders of magnitude faster than the Aβ and α-synuclein peptides associated with Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, consistent with an evolved sequence that adopts an amyloid structure. The structure produced spontaneously by Mα in vitro exhibits the characteristic X-ray fiber diffraction, CD and FT-IR spectra, and fibrillar morphology expected of amyloid. Finally, rMα amyloid fibers can hasten melanin formation in vitro by serving as a template for DHQ polymerization, thereby recapitulating the fibers' putative native function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b016">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>Given the toxic nature of amyloid and its precursors in both intracellular and extracellular contexts, it would be expected that Mα fibrillogenesis be highly regulated to avoid damage to the cell. Indeed, full-length Pmel17 is synthesized and trafficked to early melanosomes as a transmembrane protein incapable of self-assembly. Only when sequestered in the specialized early melanosome compartment is the amyloidogenic fragment, Mα, released by proteolysis. The rapid self-assembly of Mα in combination with its membrane sequestration presumably minimizes the toxicity usually associated with amyloidogenesis. Other proteins may also be involved in the initiation and regulation of Mα amyloidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b032">32</xref>], as is the case for functional <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> extracellular curli fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b033">33</xref>], extracellular spider silk fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b034">34</xref>], Sup35 amyloid in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b035">35</xref>], and, potentially, CPEB prions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b036">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>While functional amyloidogenesis exhibits some similarities to pathogenic amyloid formation, it also displays striking differences. In gelsolin amyloid disease, proteolysis of mutant gelsolin during secretion by the proprotein convertase furin leads to slow, unregulated extracellular pathogenic gelsolin amyloid deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b037">37</xref>]. Mα amyloid formation is also initiated by proprotein convertase activity, but the product is a functional amyloid structure confined to a membrane-delimited compartment. The rapidity of rMα amyloidogenesis is likely important, as this may preclude the formation of toxic, diffusible intermediates that could compromise cellular integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b011">11</xref>]. These key differences in packaging and assembly appear to enable the usage of amyloid as a major intracellular structure for normal function. Study of functional Mα amyloid is likely to provide critical insights into the pathological basis for important misfolding diseases including Huntington, Parkinson, and Alzheimer disease, where the biological contexts and folding constraints differentiating normal from pathological folds are currently not appreciated.</p>
      <p>Mα fibers in melanosomes serve to bind and orient highly reactive melanogenic precursors, hastening their polymerization and likely influencing the resulting melanin structure. Another apparently important function of Mα amyloid is to prevent cytotoxicity associated with the process of melanin polymerization, and hence melanosome biogenesis. Highly reactive, uncharged hydrophobic melanin precursor compounds would be expected to diffuse across the membrane and enter the cytoplasm if they were not sequestered by Mα fibers, upon which they polymerize. Large excesses of melanogenic precursors have been shown to produce severe cytotoxic effects in melanizing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b038">38</xref>], and Pmel17 mutations leading to minimal Mα amyloid fiber formation result in reduced melanocyte viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b019">19</xref>]. These observations can be explained by the leakage of toxic melanogenic intermediates from the melanosome as a result of insufficient sequestration by Mα amyloid. Hence, the ability of Mα fibers to bind and concentrate these reactive precursors appears to protect the cell against the toxicity that can result from melanosome biogenesis.</p>
      <p>The discovery that a major mammalian biosynthetic pathway utilizes a cross-β sheet structure for function establishes the amyloid fold as a key protein structural motif utilized by a wide variety of organisms from prokaryotes to humans. Melanin polymer chemistry plays a wide variety of roles in an array of organisms—it is involved in pigmentation and cytoprotection in higher eukaryotes, it is critical for stress responses and structural stability in plants, and it is an integral component of the insect immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b015">15</xref>]. Mα amyloid has a critical role in melanin formation in humans, and is the first example to our knowledge of an amyloid that functions in a chemical reaction, pointing the way towards the discovery of amyloid in other important functional roles. It is now apparent that the amyloid fold has been selected multiple times during evolution for a variety of functions. Given the propensity of most polypeptides to form amyloid in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040006-b005">5</xref>], the usage of amyloid in biology may be as common as other canonical protein folds. This contrasts with the current view that there is evolutionary pressure against amyloidogenesis. We suggest that the amyloid fold is a fundamental protein structural motif with unique properties that is capable of performing a wide variety of functions. We propose the general name <italic>amyloidin</italic> for functional amyloid, with the expectation that the number and diversity of structures of this type will continue to grow.</p>

Lyophilized α-synuclein was dissolved in 25 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0) and induced to form amyloid by rocking at 37 °C for 48 h. The amyloid nature of the α-synuclein and Aβ aggregates was tested by far-UV CD (which showed β-sheet) and TEM or AFM (which showed fibers). α-Synuclein or Aβ amyloid was collected by centrifugation (16,000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min) and resuspended in assay buffer at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Collagen IV (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, United States) was rendered insoluble by lyophilization and resuspended in assay buffer at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. These solutions were vortexed, and 10 μg of tyrosinase was added. The solutions were allowed to react at room temperature for varying periods of time, after which they were centrifuged at 16,000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The pellets (insoluble rMα, α-synuclein, collagen IV, and melanin products) were resuspended in 125 mM CH<sub>3</sub>COOH/CH<sub>3</sub>COOK buffer (pH 5.0) and centrifuged again. The pellets were then resuspended in 1 M NaOH and then heated to 60 °C for 5 min and vortexed to effect dissolution. Absorbance spectra were recorded at 350 nm.</p>

          <p>rMα tryptophan emission in nondenaturing buffer is significantly blue-shifted with respect to rMα tryptophan emission in 8 M GdmCl, most likely owing to aggregation-induced burial and shielding of the tryptophan residues from the aqueous buffer. The red-shifted data indicate that rMα is unfolded in 8 M GdmCl, consistent with observations using gel filtration chromatography.</p>
