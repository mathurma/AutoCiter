<abstract>
<p>The field of medical systems biology aims to advance understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive disease progression and to translate this knowledge into therapies to effectively treat diseases. A challenging task is the investigation of long-term effects of a (pharmacological) treatment, to establish its applicability and to identify potential side effects. We present a new modeling approach, called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT), to analyze the long-term effects of a pharmacological intervention. A concept of time-dependent evolution of model parameters is introduced to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations. The progression of these adaptations is predicted by identifying necessary dynamic changes in the model parameters to describe the transition between experimental data obtained during different stages of the treatment. The trajectories provide insight in the affected underlying biological systems and identify the molecular events that should be studied in more detail to unravel the mechanistic basis of treatment outcome. Modulating effects caused by interactions with the proteome and transcriptome levels, which are often less well understood, can be captured by the time-dependent descriptions of the parameters. ADAPT was employed to identify metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), a potential drug target to treat or prevent atherosclerosis. The trajectories were investigated to study the cascade of adaptations. This provided a counter-intuitive insight concerning the function of scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a receptor that facilitates the hepatic uptake of cholesterol. Although activation of LXR promotes cholesterol efflux and -excretion, our computational analysis showed that the hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol was reduced upon prolonged treatment. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by immunoblotting measurements of SR-B1 in hepatic membranes. Next to the identification of potential unwanted side effects, we demonstrate how ADAPT can be used to design new target interventions to prevent these.</p>

<p>A driving ambition of medical systems biology is to advance our understanding of molecular processes that drive the progression of complex diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This insight is essential to enable the development of therapies to effectively treat diseases. A challenging task is to investigate the long-term effects of a treatment, in order to establish its applicability and to identify potential side effects. As such, there is a growing need for novel approaches to support this research. Here, we present a new computational approach to identify treatment effects. We make use of a computational model of the biological system. The model is used to describe the experimental data obtained during different stages of the treatment. To incorporate the long-term/progressive adaptations in the system, induced by changes in gene and protein expression, the model is iteratively updated. The approach was employed to identify metabolic adaptations induced by a potential anti-atherosclerotic and anti-diabetic drug target. Our approach identifies the molecular events that should be studied in more detail to establish the mechanistic basis of treatment outcome. New biological insight was obtained concerning the metabolism of cholesterol, which was in turn experimentally validated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A central aim of medical systems biology is the development of computational models and techniques to study molecular mechanisms that drive disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Tiemann1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Csete1">[13]</xref>. One potential contribution of computational modeling is to assess the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions to treat progressive diseases, e.g., Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A complicating factor to simulate and predict the effects of these interventions is the multiscale nature of the affected biological systems. The kinetic computational models in biology are typically constructed to simulate processes at a single timescale, usually capturing short-term dynamics ranging from seconds to hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Schmitz1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Schoeberl1">[19]</xref>. On the other hand, pharmacological interventions usually affect multiple processes that operate at different timescales, which in turn range over an extended time frame. A challenging but particularly relevant task is the investigation of long-term effects of a pharmacological treatment to determine its applicability and to identify potential side effects. Formulating mathematical descriptions of these effects is furthermore complicated by the lack of sufficient information of the underlying network structure and interaction mechanisms. An example is the study of pharmacological treatments associated with metabolic diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Grefhorst1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Grefhorst2">[21]</xref>. The acquired experimental data predominantly concern changes in plasma and tissue metabolite concentrations during one or more stages of the treatment. Conversely, it is less well understood to what extent the actual metabolite fluxes change in time and how corresponding processes are modulated by the treatment via interactions with the proteome and transcriptome. As a consequence, in many cases insufficient information is available to explicitly model the interaction mechanisms that modulate the metabolic processes. The lack of mechanistic descriptions of the modulating interactions in a mathematical model, referred to as undermodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Ninness1">[22]</xref>, forms a serious complication when studying the effects of a pharmacological treatment by means of computational analyses.</p>
<p>In the present paper we propose a computational approach that overcomes the aforementioned issues. The approach, called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT), employs mathematical modeling to predict the long-term effects of a pharmacological intervention. We introduce a concept of time-dependent descriptions of model parameters to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations, making use of experimental data obtained during different stages of an intervention. These model parameters typically represent reaction rate constants (linked to mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics), but could be any other quantity expressible in a mathematical model. The progression of adaptations is predicted by identifying necessary dynamic changes in the model parameters to describe the transition between experimental data obtained during different stages of the treatment. The obtained dynamic trajectories of model parameters, as well as metabolite concentrations and -fluxes, are constrained by the network topology and kinetic equations of the molecular processes. As such, our method exploits and integrates the merits from constrained-based modeling approaches (e.g., Flux Balance Analysis) and kinetic modeling. ADAPT is therefore particularly useful to study biological systems from which the network topology is relatively well known, such as the mass fluxes in metabolic pathways. The modulating effects on these pathways via interactions with the proteome and transcriptome, which are less well understood, can be captured by the time-dependent descriptions of the parameters. Hence, as will be shown here, an advantage of ADAPT is that pathway adaptations can be described without the necessity to develop detailed kinetic models of the modulating mechanisms. Moreover, it could provide a means to capture the effects of complex phenomena such as cell differentiation, developmental changes, and aging, that may contribute to the progression of long-term adaptations. The approach originates from our previous work in which computational modeling was used to identify necessary differences in parameters to describe how one phenotype could be evolved from another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Tiemann1">[1]</xref>. While the latter study aimed to explore steady-state differences between two experimentally observed phenotypes, the present study focused on the identification of dynamic adaptations induced by a treatment intervention.</p>
<p>Relevant applications of ADAPT are the investigation of metabolic pathways in relation to progressive diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for these diseases, and recognized markers such as plasma triglycerides, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, are used in clinical settings to assess disease risk and status. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms inducing adaptations in lipid metabolism are not fully understood, complicating the development of effective treatments. In the present study, ADAPT was applied to a model of mouse hepatic lipid and plasma lipoprotein metabolism to identify which metabolic adaptations are induced upon pharmacological treatment of mice by liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317. The family of liver X receptors, LXRα and LXR<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, plays a central role in the control of cellular lipid and sterol metabolism. Activation of LXRs by pharmacological agonists promotes the cellular efflux, transport, and excretion of cholesterol from the body, hereby reducing atherosclerotic plaques in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Oosterveer1">[23]</xref>. Therefore, LXRs are considered as potential drug targets to treat or prevent atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Calkin1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Repa1">[26]</xref>. However, pharmacological activation of LXR also induces the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides and promotes the secretion of enlarged very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, which complicates the clinical application of LXR agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Grefhorst1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Grefhorst2">[21]</xref>. The underlying molecular mechanisms inducing these adaptations in lipid and sterol metabolism are not fully understood. An extensive data set of C57BL/6J mice treated with T0901317 for 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21 days was generated and included in the computational analysis. A remarkable prediction was obtained concerning the scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a receptor that facilitates the uptake of cholesterol from high-density-lipoproteins (HDL) by the liver. As LXR agonists promote cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells and excretion of cholesterol from the body, it was expected that hepatic SR-B1 expression would be induced upon treatment to accommodate the increased hepatobiliary cholesterol excretion. However, the computational analysis showed that the SR-B1 expression decreased rather than increased upon T0901317 treatment. We recently confirmed this counter-intuitive prediction experimentally by immunoblot analysis of SR-B1 protein expression in hepatic membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Grefhorst3">[27]</xref>. Results from the computational analysis provided an integrative understanding of the dynamic response induced by T0901317 treatment that was not directly apparent from the experimental data itself. For instance, the results show a clear distinction between the processes that had an early onset and were rapidly activated, and processes that changed progressively during the treatment period.</p>

<title>Estimation of time-dependent parameters.</title>
<p>The progression of adaptations induced by a treatment intervention is predicted by identifying necessary dynamic changes in the model parameters to describe the transition between experimental data obtained during different stages of the treatment. The time-dependency of the parameters is introduced by dividing a simulation in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> steps of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> time period. Initially (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) the system is in steady-state and corresponding parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are estimated to describe the experimental data of the untreated phenotype. Subsequently, for each step <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the system is simulated for a time period of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using the final values of the model states of the previous step <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as initial conditions (B). Simultaneously, parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are estimated (A) by minimizing the difference between the data interpolants and corresponding model outputs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (C). Here, the previously estimated parameter set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was provided as initial set for the optimization algorithm.</p>

<title>Experimental data and Monte Carlo sampling of interpolants</title>
<p>Quantitative experimental data at different stages of a treatment intervention are required to study the dynamics of induced molecular adaptations. In metabolic research the acquired experimental data typically provides information about changes in metabolite concentrations in plasma and tissue compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Biddinger1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Osono1">[31]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 1). In the present study mathematical modeling is employed to generate additional insight on the treatment response by predicting which metabolic parameters and consequently metabolic fluxes necessarily have to change to describe the dynamic trend in the experimental data. The metabolic parameters and fluxes can generally not be considered constant in time. Due to the treatment intervention these quantities typically change in a time-dependent fashion. To allow for estimation of dynamic trajectories of metabolic parameters and fluxes, continuous dynamic descriptions of the experimental data were used as input for ADAPT. For this purpose, cubic smoothing splines were calculated that describe the dynamic trend of the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 2). To account for experimental and biological uncertainties a collection of splines was calculated using a Monte Carlo approach. Different random samples of the experimental data were generated assuming Gaussian distributions with means and standard deviations of the data. Subsequently, for each generated sample a cubic smoothing spline was calculated.</p>

<title>Time-dependent descriptions of model parameters</title>
<p>In many cases insufficient information is available to define the essential interaction mechanisms which are modulated by a specific treatment intervention, let alone to generate explicit mathematical descriptions of these processes. As a consequence, the dynamic adaptations in molecular processes were captured by inferring necessary changes in the model parameters which are therefore time-dependent. Note that it is not known <italic>a priori</italic> how the model parameters change during the experiment. Consequently, it is not possible to perform a dynamic simulation of the entire experiment in one go.

It was assumed that the induced adaptations proceed progressively in time. Therefore, highly fluctuating parameter trajectories were considered to be unphysiological. To prevent the occurrence of such behavior, a regularization term, given by the sum of squared derivatives of the normalized parameter values at current step <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was included in the parameter estimation procedure.

Relative derivatives were used to assign equal relevance to all parameters and to avoid domination of the optimization by large absolute values. Finally, trajectories of the parameters (and consequently also for the model states and fluxes) are obtained that describe the transition of the phenotype during the treatment intervention. By repeating the optimization procedure for all initial parameter sets in collection <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> a distribution of trajectories is obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 3).</p>

<title>Time-dependent sensitivities of trajectories</title>
<p>The calculated trajectories of molecular states, parameters and fluxes can be used for a wide range of analysis techniques to study the induced molecular adaptations. A class of computational techniques that is frequently applied to systems biology models (and complex systems in general) is sensitivity analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Marino1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Zi2">[35]</xref>. One such method is the multi parametric sensitivity analysis (MPSA), which is frequently used to study the relative importance of parameters with respect to model outputs. MPSA is a global sensitivity method that was first proposed in the field of hydrology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Hornberger1">[36]</xref>. More recently, the method was also applied to study biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Zi1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Zi2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Jeneson1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Cho1">[38]</xref>. An advantage of the MPSA method is that it allows to detect combinatorial effects of parameters on model outputs (by varying all parameters simultaneously) that might go unnoticed in local parameter sensitivity analysis based methods (see Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s002">Text S2</xref> for an example). Here, we briefly discuss the methodology and illustrate how this technique can be applied within the framework of ADAPT. Consider a parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a model output of interest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The basic principle of MPSA is to propagate the uncertainty of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> into <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by sampling parameter sets from predefined distributions and evaluate corresponding outcomes of the model output. For the present case these distributions are given by the outcomes of the trajectories corresponding to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at a specific time step <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The samples of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are subsequently classified as acceptable or unacceptable by comparing corresponding outputs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (or some metric involving <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with a threshold.

<p>The intervention starts at the proteome level and subsequently induces adaptations at the other levels (left part, vertical arrows). Mathematical modeling was focused on integrating biological pathways from which the topology is well known and a substantial amount of components were measured quantitatively, i.e. the metabolome level (right part). A detailed description of the mathematical model is presented in Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s003">Text S3</xref>. The modulating effects on metabolic pathways via interactions with the proteome and transcriptome levels are less well understood. At present it is not yet feasible to include a full mechanistic description of these interactions in the model. ADAPT overcomes this problem by introducing time-dependent parameters that incorporate missing modulating effects.</p>

<p>An extensive data set of C57BL/6J mice treated with T0901317 for 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21 days was generated and included in the computational analysis. A detailed description of the experimental materials and procedures is available (see Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s001">Text S1</xref>). In brief, the set contains quantitative measures of hepatic triglyceride, free cholesterol, and cholesterylester levels, as well as the fractional contribution of <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis to the hepatic triglyceride pool. Furthermore, data on plasma concentrations of triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and free fatty acids (FFA) were included. We also included data on VLDL production, VLDL clearance, VLDL particle size, and VLDL composition.

<title>Computational framework</title>
<p>A mathematical multi-compartment model of mouse hepatic lipid and plasma lipoprotein metabolism was used to predict the dynamics of metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological activation of LXR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Tiemann1">[1]</xref>. In the present study several small modifications were made to this model. In brief, the mathematical model contains three compartments representing the liver, blood plasma, and peripheral tissues. The liver includes the production, utilization and storage of triglycerides and cholesterols, as well as the mobilization of these metabolites to the endoplasmic reticulum where they are incorporated into nascent produced VLDL particles. These VLDL particles are subsequently secreted in the plasma compartment and provide nutrients for peripheral tissues. The model furthermore includes the hepatic uptake of free fatty acids from the plasma that predominantly originate from adipose tissue. Finally, the model includes the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, i.e., the net transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver via HDL. A detailed description of the mathematical model, including equations, is available (see Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s003">Text S3</xref>).</p>
<p>The rationale for including the aforementioned biological processes in the mathematical model is to generate a close and balanced match between model complexity and the available experimental data. The level of detail at which certain biological processes can be integrated in a mathematical model is determined by the selection of molecular species, as well as the type and quality of the measurements. Therefore, the model size and complexity of the reaction equations was kept to a minimum. Furthermore, model development was focused on integrating biological pathways from which the topology is well known and a substantial amount of components were measured quantitatively, i.e. mass fluxes at the metabolome level. The network topology of metabolic pathways is relatively well known and is available for different organisms in various pathway databases such as listed in Pathguide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pathguide.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pathguide.org</ext-link>). The modulating and regulatory effects on metabolic pathways via interactions with the proteome and transcriptome levels are less well understood. At present it is not yet feasible to include a full mechanistic description of these interactions in the model. Note that the computational model does not include any mathematical descriptions of processes involved in LXR activation and its transcriptional response. ADAPT overcomes the problem of undermodeling by introducing time-dependent parameters that account for the missing interactions.</p>

<title>Analysis of the cascade of induced molecular adaptations</title>
<p>The computational workflow of ADAPT was carried out using the computational model and the acquired experimental data. An overview of the experimental data and corresponding spline interpolants that were used as input for ADAPT is presented in Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s004">Text S4</xref>. Parameter trajectories were estimated using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> time steps. The impact of changing the number of time steps on the model outputs was investigated (see Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s005">Text S5</xref>). A small value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for regularization factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was chosen to bias the data fitting as little as possible (see Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s006">Text S6</xref>). A collection of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> acceptable parameter trajectory sets was obtained describing the experimental data. The dynamic characteristics of the resulting state, parameter, and flux trajectories were investigated to study the cascade of induced molecular adaptations. For this purpose, the rise and fall periods of the trajectories were calculated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Nise1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Levine1">[43]</xref>, which provides a broad overview of the response dynamics. The rise period is defined as the time period during which a trajectory rises from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of its maximal value or between two extrema. Similarly, the fall period is defined as the time period during which a trajectory falls from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of its maximal value or between two extrema. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows a selection of the rise and fall periods of metabolic concentrations, parameters, and fluxes, clustered by four major metabolic pathways: HDL metabolism, VLDL metabolism, hepatic triglyceride metabolism, and hepatic cholesterol metabolism. The rise and fall periods are respectively represented by light-gray and dark-gray bars (median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> median absolute deviation). A few observations can be made. First, there is a clear distinction between processes that have an early onset and were rapidly activated, and those that changed progressively during the treatment period. This is of importance as the latter processes likely play a crucial role in the long-term effects of the pharmacological intervention. Secondly, the majority of the processes were up-regulated in time. Interestingly, only a small collection of processes included in the model was down-regulated in time compared to the untreated phenotype. Two of these processes, the secretion of VLDL particles and the hepatic HDL-C uptake capacity, were explored in more detail as outlined in the following sections.</p>

<title>The hepatic HDL-C uptake capacity is reduced upon LXR activation</title>
<p>Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) measurements from pooled mice plasma showed an increased level of HDL-C (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fold increase) after one week of treatment, which remained at this elevated level upon prolonged treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g006">Figure 6a</xref>).

This increased efflux was accompanied by an elevated hepatic HDL-C uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g006">Figure 6c</xref>). Interestingly, only a minor difference between the efflux and uptake rates of HDL-C (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) could be observed during the first week of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g006">Figure 6d</xref>), implicating that only a small net effect in HDL-C metabolism underlies the marked increase in circulating HDL-C levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g006">Figure 6a</xref>).

Here, clearance capacity is defined as the ability to clear a certain amount of substrate per time unit from the plasma, which depends on the receptor number and corresponding activity level.

<title>Analysis and targeting of unwanted side effects</title>
<p>Besides its beneficial effects on cholesterol metabolism, pharmacological LXR activation also induces unwanted side effects such as the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver.

To assess the consistency of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> distances, one hundred batches were generated, each containing thousand randomly selected optimized trajectories.

Changing the number of batches did not qualitatively change the profiles. A <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> distance was considered significant when it exceeds the critical value indicated by the dotted lines (obtained from the Kolmogorov distribution using a significance level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

<p>The processes to which the hepatic triglyceride level is sensitive are potential targets for future interventions to prevent the unwanted side effect of excessive triglyceride accumulation in the liver. To illustrate this, we performed a computational analysis to investigate whether it is possible to prevent hepatic triglyceride accumulation upon T0901317 treatment by targeting one of the sensitive quantities, i.e., the triglyceride catabolism capacity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Here, triglyceride catabolism is defined as the hydrolysis of triglyceride into fatty acids and glycerol which are subsequently used in processes such as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-oxidation, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, sterol- and phospholipid synthesis. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter trajectory sets obtained from the previous analysis were used as input to simulate the computational model, with an exception for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This parameter is iteratively re-estimated (while keeping the other parameters fixed according to their trajectories) to maintain a constant hepatic triglyceride level (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) during the treatment intervention. The results of this analysis are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g008">Figure 8</xref>. The previous computational analysis showed that the triglyceride catabolism capacity was reduced upon treatment (top left), which is partly responsible for the hepatic triglyceride accumulation (top right).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A relevant topic explored in medical systems biology is the development of computational models and techniques to study the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions to treat progressive diseases. We presented ADAPT, a new modeling approach to analyze the long-term effects of a pharmacological intervention, which is particularly useful to study adaptations in metabolic pathways.</p>
<p>Pharmacological interventions are usually very complex in the sense that they affect multiple processes operating at different levels (metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome) and different timescales. Therefore, in many cases insufficient information is available to define the essential interaction mechanisms which are modulated by a specific treatment intervention. Hence including a full mechanistic description of these interactions in a mathematical model is not possible. ADAPT provides a solution to overcome the problem of undermodeling by introducing time-dependent parameters that account for the missing interactions. We have previously reported a concept of varying parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Tiemann1">[1]</xref>. In this study parameter differences/adaptations were estimated to identify molecular differences between phenotypes. The approach was developed to study steady-state differences in concentrations and fluxes between experimentally observed phenotypes. In contrast to ADAPT, no notion of time is integrated in the approach and the dynamics between phenotype transitions were not considered. ADAPT aims to dynamically link different experimentally observed phenotypes (phenotype snapshots) as a function of time, hereby providing an integrated understanding of the outcome of a pharmacological intervention or disease progression.</p>
<p>A concept of time-varying parameters is also used in linear parametric-varying (LPV) control analysis. LPV systems are predominantly applied to design gain-scheduled multivariate controllers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Apkarian1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Bamieh1">[45]</xref>. LPV systems are developed for different purposes and there are several essential differences compared to ADAPT. First, LPV controllers are restricted to linear systems. Second, LPV control analysis requires the time variation of parameters to be measured in real-time. The field of Systems Biology deals with the opposite challenge however. In case of biological systems the time variation in parameters is typically not known, and it is therefore the objective of ADAPT to estimate these. Linear time-varying (LTV) systems represent another class of systems in control theory that bear similarities with ADAPT. In LVT systems the input-output characteristics vary with time. These systems are used to design adaptive observers and controllers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Zhang1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Tse1">[47]</xref>. These methods also presume that the mechanisms causing the time-dependent differences in output behavior are known or can be measured.</p>
<p>To allow for time-dependent optimization of model parameters according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003166.e066">equation (10)</xref> at any time point during a treatment intervention, experimental data at that specific time point is needed. Therefore, continuous dynamic descriptions of the experimental data are required. This issue was addressed by calculating data interpolants. The selection of an appropriate interpolation scheme is important as it determines the dynamic behavior of corresponding model quantities. Considering the uncertainty associated with the acquired experimental data, it was decided to use cubic smoothing splines to describe the experimental data. These descriptions are preferred in cases of noisy observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Craven1">[48]</xref>. Note that the usage of splines provides the possibility to estimate the model parameters in a step-wise manner. However, when considering ‘small’ models (low number of model parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and/or a ‘low’ time resolution (low number of time points <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), such that the total number of parameters to be estimated (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is relatively small, one could opt for an approach to estimate all parameters in a single optimization procedure. This approach is computationally expensive but could provide a means to avoid the usage of data interpolants.</p>
<p>To account for variations in the dynamic behavior as well as experimental and biological uncertainties, a collection of smoothing splines was calculated using a Monte Carlo approach in which random samples of the experimental data were generated. This provides the possibility to determine the propagation of data uncertainty through model predictions, and hence allows to distinguish between predictions that are well constrained and as such can be made confidently, and those that display a large variation in possible outcomes. In case when parameter trajectories (or trajectories of states and fluxes) are not well-constrained by the experimental data, it might be worthwhile to study relative differences of these trajectories compared to the untreated phenotype, which for several cases display consistent behavior (see Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s008">Text S8</xref>). The analysis of parameter and prediction uncertainty is an important topic that triggered the development of various methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Vanlier2">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Gutenkunst1">[57]</xref>. The sampling of replicates of experimental data and their subsequent utilization in parameter estimation is a common approach to assess prediction uncertainty, a class of methods also referred to as bootstrapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Cedersund3">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Kirk1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Efron1">[63]</xref>.

A review of the state-of-the-art methods for uncertainty analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Vanlier3">[68]</xref>.

<p>ADAPT was applied to a model of hepatic lipid and plasma lipoprotein metabolism to predict the metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological treatment of mice with the LXR agonist T0901317. As values for model parameters need to be inferred from experimental data, mathematical modeling was focused on integrating biological pathways from which a substantial amount of components were measured quantitatively. For the present case these predominantly concerned measurements of metabolite concentrations in the liver and plasma. Therefore, mathematical modeling was centered on integrating corresponding pathways at the metabolic level. Interactions and processes at the proteome and transcriptome levels were not included, as insufficient information of the underlying network structure and interaction mechanisms was available. Conversely, these modulating effects were captured by inferring necessary changes in the model parameters. Note that the computational model does not include any mathematical descriptions of processes involved in LXR activation and its transcriptional response. We were able to quantitatively integrate data of untreated mice, as well as mice treated with T0901317 up to three weeks into a consistent model. The presented model predictions are in good agreement with experimental observations and our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Tiemann1">[1]</xref>. An additional analysis was performed that confirms that the parameters have to change in a time-dependent manner to describe the experimental data. It was not possible to describe the experimental data by simulating the system with time-constant parameters or a step-wise response in the parameters (see Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s010">Text S10</xref>). The calculated trajectories of metabolic states, parameters and fluxes can be used for a wide range of analysis techniques to study the induced molecular adaptations. Several of its potential applications were presented here, e.g., sensitivity analysis, and therapy design.</p>
<p>The obtained trajectories provided the opportunity to study the cascade of metabolic adaptations. Our results show a clear distinction between processes that had an early onset and were rapidly activated, and processes that changed progressively during the treatment period. For instance, the peripheral uptake of triglycerides via lipolytic enzymes is rapidly induced, while this process is induced progressively in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vs. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Analysis of the trajectories revealed that the majority of the processes were up-regulated in time. Interestingly, only a small subset of the included processes were down-regulated in time. One example concerns the secretion of VLDL particles. The computational analysis revealed that the secretion decreased rapidly up to one week of treatment and subsequently stabilized upon prolonged treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). This model prediction is consistent with the following experimental observations. A reduced level of hepatic apolipoprotein B mRNA (each VLDL particle contains one apolipoprotein B protein) was observed in T0901317 treated mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Grefhorst1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Grefhorst2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Schultz1">[69]</xref>. Although the secretion of VLDL particles decreased upon T0901317 treatment, the VLDL-mediated transport of triglycerides and cholesterol to the plasma increased progressively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g005">Figure 5b,c</xref>). This was accomplished by an increased loading of these lipids onto VLDL particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g005">Figure 5d,e</xref>), resulting in an enlargement of the particle volume (see Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003166.s004">Text S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Model predictions furthermore indicated that the efflux of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to HDL particles increased up to one week of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g006">Figure 6b</xref>), which most likely resulted from the induction of the cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 in peripheral tissues. The increased cholesterol efflux was closely followed by an increased uptake of HDL-C by the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g006">Figure 6c</xref>). However, a minor difference between the efflux and uptake rates of HDL-C can be observed during the first week of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g006">Figure 6d</xref>), resulting in an elevated plasma HDL-C level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g006">Figure 6a</xref>). Another interesting prediction obtained from the computational analysis concerns SR-B1, a receptor that facilitates the uptake of cholesterol from HDL by the liver. As LXR agonists promote the efflux of cholesterol from the periphery and excretion of cholesterol from the body, it was expected that SR-B1 expression level would be induced upon treatment to accommodate the increased hepatobiliary flux. In contrast, the computational analysis showed that the hepatic capacity to clear HDL-C (assumed to be proportional to the SR-B1 level) was reduced upon treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g006">Figure 6e</xref>). This counter-intuitive prediction was recently confirmed experimentally by immunoblotting analysis of SR-B1 protein expression in hepatic membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Grefhorst3">[27]</xref>. Hence, the increased HDL-C concentration is not only a consequence of increased peripheral cholesterol efflux to HDL particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Grefhorst1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-PlLsch1">[70]</xref> but also of impaired SR-B1-mediated cholesterol uptake by the liver.</p>
<p>The calculated trajectories form a hypothesis on how the various metabolic states, parameters, and fluxes changed during the treatment intervention. These trajectories can subsequently be exploited to establish the efficacy of a treatment and to identify its potential side effects. In case unwanted side effects occur, the trajectories may be used to design new or additional target interventions to prevent these. Here, we presented an example concerning the excessive accumulation of triglycerides in the liver upon LXR activation. First, a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify adapting processes to which the hepatic triglyceride level is sensitive, and therefore potentially contributed to the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Subsequently, we performed a computational analysis to investigate the possibility to maintain normal hepatic triglyceride levels upon T0901317 treatment by targeting the triglyceride catabolism capacity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), one of the sensitive quantities. This parameter is iteratively re-estimated to maintain a constant hepatic triglyceride content during the treatment intervention, while keeping the other parameters fixed according to their trajectories obtained from the original analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Note that although all parameters are fixed (with an exception for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the concentrations and fluxes can change due to the targeting of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Here, we assumed that the targeting of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003166.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> induces merely negligible adaptations on the model parameters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003166-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows to what extent the catabolism capacity should be targeted in order to maintain a hepatic triglyceride content within the normal range. Such information can subsequently be used to design specific target interventions to achieve this. One option could be to increase mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, thereby increasing triglyceride catabolism. Several therapeutic strategies to achieve this have been proposed in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Thupari1">[71]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Reddy1">[73]</xref>. Another strategy would be to inhibit Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that catalyzes malonyl-CoA synthesis. malonyl-CoA acts as an allosteric inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. ACC inhibition will therefore reduce malonyl-CoA levels, hence releasing the inhibitory effect on fatty acid catabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Schreurs1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003166-Thupari2">[75]</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we presented ADAPT, a new modeling approach to evaluate the consequences of a pharmacological intervention. The calculated trajectories of metabolic states, parameters and fluxes can be used for a wide range of analytical techniques to study the molecular adaptations. They provide insight in the affected underlying biological systems and identify the molecular events that should be studied in more detail to unravel the mechanistic basis of treatment outcome.</p>
