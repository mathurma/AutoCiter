      <abstract>
        <p>The origin of the bilaterian head is a fundamental question for the evolution of animal body plans. The head of bilaterians develops at the anterior end of their primary body axis and is the site where the brain is located. Cnidarians, the sister group to bilaterians, lack brain-like structures and it is not clear whether the oral, the aboral, or none of the ends of the cnidarian primary body axis corresponds to the anterior domain of bilaterians. In order to understand the evolutionary origin of head development, we analysed the function of conserved genetic regulators of bilaterian anterior development in the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. We show that orthologs of the bilaterian anterior developmental genes <italic>six3/6</italic>, <italic>foxQ2</italic>, and <italic>irx</italic> have dynamic expression patterns in the aboral region of <italic>Nematostella</italic>. Functional analyses reveal that <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> acts upstream of <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic> as a key regulator of the development of a broad aboral territory in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> initiates an autoregulatory feedback loop involving positive and negative regulators of FGF signalling, which subsequently results in the downregulation of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic> in a small domain at the aboral pole, from which the apical organ develops. We show that signalling by <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> is specifically required for the development of the apical organ, whereas <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> has an earlier and broader function in the specification of the aboral territory. Our functional and gene expression data suggest that the head-forming region of bilaterians is derived from the aboral domain of the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The evolutionary origin of head development is a fundamental question for understanding the evolution of animal body plans. Bilaterally symmetrical animals (Bilaterians) have an anterior-posterior (head-to-tail) axis, whose anterior end is usually characterized by a nervous system centralization, the brain. This region is often associated with a distinct structure, the head, and its development is regulated by a set of conserved transcription factors and signalling molecules. Bilaterians evolved from an ancestor shared with cnidarians (corals, sea anemones, jellyfish), but brain-like structures are absent in cnidarians, although they have an obvious oral-aboral axis. Cnidarian larvae move with the aboral pole forward, but as adult polyps this pole is anchored to the ground, while the oral end is used for feeding. It is unclear whether one of the termini of cnidarians corresponds to the bilaterian head-forming region. We show here that in the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> genes regulating bilaterian head development are expressed at the larval aboral pole and that a key anterior developmental gene, <italic>six3/6</italic>, controls the development of the aboral pole. These findings support the hypothesis that the anterior, head-forming, region of bilaterians and the aboral region of cnidarians derived from the same domain of their last common ancestor and are therefore homologues.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The head of bilaterians develops at the anterior end of the anterior-posterior body axis and is characterized by an accumulation of interconnected nerve cells, the brain. The polarity of the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis is in most bilaterians prefigured by the animal–vegetal axis of the oocyte, with the head forming anterior end developing from the animal hemisphere and the site of gastrulation from the vegetal hemisphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Goldstein1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Martindale2">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Comparative work in bilaterians has revealed highly conserved molecular mechanisms involved in the patterning of the anterior-posterior axis. Orthologous <italic>hox</italic> genes have been shown to have staggered anterior expression borders, providing a unique signature of <italic>hox</italic> gene expression for consecutive domains along the A-P axis. However, while <italic>hox</italic> genes are essential regulators of axial patterning, their expression in most bilaterians does not extend to the anterior-most part of the embryo, where the head will form (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Duboule1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Aronowicz1">[8]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The anterior, <italic>hox</italic>-free region of bilaterian embryos gives rise to head and brain structures and an important regulator of its development is the conserved homeodomain transcription factor <italic>six3</italic>. The anterior expression of <italic>six3</italic> is conserved in the three clades of bilaterians: deuterostomes, ecdysozoans, and lophotrochozoans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Lowe1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Santagata1">[18]</xref>. Knockdown of <italic>six3</italic> function in sea urchin results in loss of the anterior/apical plate, <italic>six3</italic> RNAi in the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> leads to failure of anterior head development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Wei1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Posnien2">[19]</xref>, and <italic>six3</italic> knockout mice lack almost the entire forebrain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Lagutin1">[20]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>six3</italic> regulated anterior development already in the last common ancestor of all bilaterians.</p>
      <p>A second well-conserved marker for anterior-most territories is the forkhead domain transcription factor <italic>foxQ2</italic>, which functions downstream of <italic>six3</italic> in the development of the anterior/apical domain of sea urchins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Wei1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Tu1">[21]</xref> and is expressed at the anterior tip of the cephalochordate <italic>Branchiostoma floridae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Yu1">[22]</xref>, the brachiopod <italic>Terebratalia transversa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Santagata1">[18]</xref>, the arthropod <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Lee1">[23]</xref>, and at the aboral pole of the cnidarian <italic>Clytia hemispherica</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Chevalier1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The posterior pole of a wide range of bilaterians is characterised by the expression of secreted signalling molecules of the <italic>wnt</italic> family. The posterior expression of canonical <italic>wnt</italic> genes results in the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and determines the site of gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Seaver1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Niehrs1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite the advanced understanding of the mechanisms that pattern the anterior-posterior axis and position the head of bilaterians, the evolutionary origins of axial patterning and head formation are not clear. As the sister group to Bilateria, cnidarians are an essential outgroup to understand the origin of the bilaterian anterior-posterior axis. Cnidarians (sea anemones, corals, jellyfish) do not have a brain-like centralization of the nervous system, but they possess a clear oral-aboral axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Technau1">[33]</xref>. This axis is commonly assumed to be related to the anterior-posterior axis of bilaterians, but there is no consensus as to whether one of the poles of the cnidarian axis corresponds to the anterior, head-forming pole of bilaterians. Competing hypotheses about the relation of the cnidarian primary body axis to the anterior pole of bilaterians suggest that either the oral or the aboral pole of cnidarians is homologous to the bilaterian anterior pole or that there is no homologous region in cnidarians. Similar to many ciliated bilaterian larvae, some anthozoan cnidarian planulae swim with an apical tuft, located opposite to the gastrulation site, pointing forward. These observations have led to the interpretation that the aboral pole of cnidarians corresponds to the anterior pole of bilaterians (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-SalwiniPlawen1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Nielsen1">[36]</xref>). In direct contrast, observations from comparative embryology motivated the hypothesis that the oral pole of cnidarians corresponds to the anterior pole of bilaterians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Martindale2">[3]</xref>. In cnidarians, gastrulation occurs in the domain that is derived from the animal pole of the fertilized egg and the blastopore becomes the only opening of the organism, whereas bilaterians gastrulate from the vegetal pole, but their mouth and anterior nervous system form from the animal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Martindale2">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Freeman1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Gilbert1">[42]</xref>. This fundamental embryological difference lead to the hypothesis that in stem bilaterians, determinants of the gastrulation site changed from the animal to the vegetal pole, while determinants of mouth and brain development remained at the animal pole, meaning that the oral pole of cnidarians corresponds to the anterior pole of bilaterians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Martindale2">[3]</xref>. In a third hypothesis, the absence of nervous system centralization and the incongruent expression of orthologs of some bilaterian anterior patterning genes have been interpreted to suggest that the anterior region of bilaterians has no equivalent in cnidarians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-deJong1">[43]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-SalwiniPlawen1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Rieger1">[44]</xref> for reviews).</p>
      <p>The expression patterns of homologs of bilaterian axial patterning genes in cnidarians have not provided support for any of the above-mentioned scenarios. <italic>Hox</italic> genes have frequently been used to understand axial patterning in cnidarians; however, since these genes are not expressed at the anterior-most end of bilaterians, they do not allow the identification of a putative equivalent of the head-forming region in cnidarians. Moreover, anterior group <italic>hox</italic> genes have been found to be expressed either at the aboral pole (<italic>Clytia</italic>, <italic>Eleutheria</italic>, <italic>Podocoryne</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Chiori1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Yanze1">[47]</xref>) or at the oral pole (<italic>Nematostella</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Finnerty1">[48]</xref>) of cnidarian planulae.</p>
      <p>Expression of cnidarian <italic>Wnt</italic> ligands is strongly correlated with the gastrulation site, both in species that gastrulate by invagination and by unipolar ingression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Kusserow1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Momose2">[51]</xref>. Functional studies have shown that canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling is required for proper axial patterning by promoting oral fates in <italic>Hydractinia</italic>, <italic>Clytia</italic>, and <italic>Hydra</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Plickert1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Broun1">[53]</xref>, and it has been shown to promote endoderm formation in <italic>Nematostella</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Wikramanayake1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Kumburegama1">[55]</xref>. These data suggest that a <italic>Wnt</italic>-expressing signalling centre was already present at the gastrulation site of the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians. This observation is often taken as evidence that the site of gastrulation in cnidarians identifies their posterior pole, as in bilaterians. However, even if this holds true, it remains unclear whether the opposite, aboral pole is developmentally equivalent to the bilaterian anterior pole (see above).</p>
      <p>Attempts to identify a conserved role of bilaterian head development genes in cnidarian development have so far been unsuccessful. These attempts were based on a limited number of genes, and their inconsistent expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-deJong1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Mokady1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Mazza1">[58]</xref> do not rule out that a core set of bilaterian anterior patterning genes with a conserved function in axial patterning exists in cnidarians.</p>
      <p>In the present study we show that such a conserved set of bilaterian anterior development genes regulates aboral pole development in the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. <italic>Nematostella</italic> gastrulates by invagination, forming a free swimming planula that carries a ciliated apical organ at the aboral pole. The planula settles on the aboral pole and develops into a sessile polyp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Fritzenwanker1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Hand1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Magie1">[61]</xref>. We analysed the role of orthologs of two conserved bilaterian anterior development genes, <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic>, and show that they are involved in the development of the aboral territory in <italic>Nematostella</italic> by establishing an autoregulatory FGF feedback loop that leads to the patterning of the aboral territory into distinct domains. Our functional and expression data suggest that the bilaterian head is derived from the aboral region of the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians.</p>

        <title>Bilaterian Head Genes Are Expressed in the Aboral Domain of Developing <italic>Nematostella</italic></title>
        <p>Recent gene expression analyses in bilaterian embryos have identified <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>foxQ2</italic> as highly conserved developmental markers of anterior/apical territories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001488.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>). Moreover, functional studies revealed an essential role for <italic>six3</italic> in anterior development in sea urchins, vertebrates, and the arthropod <italic>Tribolium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Wei1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Posnien2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Lagutin1">[20]</xref>, indicating that <italic>six3</italic> likely played this role in the common ancestor to all Bilateria.</p>

In situ hybridization revealed that <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and one of the <italic>Nematostella foxQ2</italic> genes, <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic>, display regionally restricted expression patterns: from the blastula stage on, they are expressed in a broad domain on one side of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1A1 and A2, 1B1 and B2</xref>), which can be identified as the aboral side following the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1A3 and A4, 1B3 and 4</xref>). From the mid-planula stage, the expression is excluded from a small spot-like domain at the aboral pole, preceding the appearance of the long cilia of the apical tuft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1A5–7, 1B5–7</xref>).

However, after gastrulation, the expression of <italic>NvIrx</italic> becomes restricted to a small spot at the aboral pole, matching the site from which <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic> are excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1C1–C7</xref>).

        <p>Single and double in situ hybridizations show that the restriction of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> and <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> expression precedes the occurrence of the gap in the expression of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1F1–F2</xref> and unpublished data).</p>
        <p>The apical sense organ, which develops at the aboral pole, consists of a heterogenous group of cells, most of which carry the long cilia that constitute the apical tuft. <italic>FoxJ1</italic> is an important regulator of cilia formation in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Thomas1">[74]</xref>, and it has been shown to be expressed in the apical tuft of the sea urchin larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Tu1">[21]</xref>. Similarly, we found that expression of <italic>NvFoxJ1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Larroux1">[62]</xref> is first detectable at the midplanula stage as a spot at the aboral pole, coincident with the development of the apical organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1E1–E7</xref>).</p>
        <p>From these data it is evident that a subset of bilaterian head development genes and components of the FGF signalling pathway are expressed at the aboral pole of <italic>Nematostella</italic> with distinct dynamics. At the blastula and gastrula stages, <italic>NvSix3/6</italic>, <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic>, <italic>NvIrx</italic>, <italic>NvFGFa1</italic>, <italic>NvFGFa2</italic>, and <italic>NvFGFRa</italic> are broadly expressed at the aboral pole, but after gastrulation they segregate into mutually exclusive domains: <italic>NvSix3/6</italic>, <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic>, and <italic>NvFoxD1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Magie2">[63]</xref> are expressed in a broad ring surrounding the apical organ (“ring genes,” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), whereas the expression of <italic>NvIrx</italic>, <italic>NvFGFa1</italic>, <italic>NvFGFa2</italic>, and <italic>FGFRa</italic> becomes restricted to the apical organ (“spot genes,” which include also <italic>NvSoxB(1)</italic> and <italic>NvHoxF/Anthox1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). <italic>NvFoxJ1</italic> exemplifies a third type of aboral expression pattern, with an onset of expression as a spot only after gastrulation (“late genes,” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1I</xref>), probably indicating a function in the differentiation of the apical organ cells.</p>

        <title>FGF Signalling Is Required to Exclude <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> from the Apical Organ Domain</title>
        <p>In order to understand how the observed dynamics of the expression patterns relate to the development of the aboral region, we conducted a series of morpholino (MO)-mediated gene knockdown experiments. Injection of two different control morpholinos had no effect on the development or on gene expression patterns. The expression of EGFP from specific reporter mRNAs was blocked when co-injected with the gene specific, but not with the control morpholinos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001488.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>We have previously shown that the development of the apical organ in <italic>Nematostella</italic> is controlled by the opposing activities of two FGF ligands, with <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> being essential for apical organ development and <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> counteracting FGF receptor activity to limit the size of the apical organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Rentzsch1">[72]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>). We used the morpholinos (MOs) against <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> and <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> in order to understand the dependence of the different aborally expressed genes on FGF signalling. Injection of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> MO does not affect the width of the <italic>NvSix3/6</italic>, <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic>, and <italic>NvFoxD1</italic> expression domains at the planula stage, however the spot-like gap at the aboral pole is not present any longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g002">Figure 2D, E, G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001488.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Expression of the “spot-genes” <italic>NvIrx</italic>, <italic>NvSoxB(1)</italic>, and <italic>NvHoxF/Anthox1</italic> and of the “late gene” <italic>NvFoxJ1</italic> is suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g002">Figure 2J, K, M, N, P, Q, S, T</xref>) in a specific manner, as demonstrated by unaffected expression of <italic>NvSoxB(1)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g002">Figure 2N</xref>) and <italic>NvHoxF/Anthox1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g002">Figure 2Q</xref>) in domains outside the aboral pole. In contrast, injection of <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> MO, which results in an expansion of the apical organ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Rentzsch1">[72]</xref>, leads to the opposite effect. For <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic>, the gap in the expression domains at the aboral pole is expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g002">Figure 2F and I</xref>), whereas for the “spot genes” and “late genes” the aboral expression domain is enlarged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g002">Figure 2L, O, R, U</xref>). These results suggest that the broad aboral expression of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic> is independent of FGF signalling but that their suppression at the aboral pole after gastrulation requires FGF activity. Furthermore, the expression of “spot” and “late” genes at the planula stage requires FGF signalling, suggesting an apical organ-specific function of the FGF pathway.</p>

        <title>Regulatory Interactions Change between the Gastrula and Planula Stages</title>
        <p>Until the midgastrula stage, “ring” and “spot” genes share a broad aboral expression domain that only at the late gastrula stage starts to segregate into mutually exclusive domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that the regulatory interactions between these genes may change after gastrulation. To test this scenario, we analysed the effect of morpholino injections at the midgastrula stage by in situ hybridization to detect potential spatial changes in expression and by quantitative RT-PCR to detect changes in expression levels that may not affect the extension of the expression domains. Since morpholinos can affect the stability of the targeted mRNA, we excluded the respective target genes from the qPCR analysis. Consistent with the observed effect at the planula stage, injection of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> morpholino has no negative effect on the expression of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g006">Figure 6A, E</xref>), but substantially reduces the expression of <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic>, <italic>NvFGFa1</italic>, and <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g006">Figure 6B–D, F–H, U</xref>).</p>

        <p>Injection of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> morpholino reveals differential regulation at the gastrula and planula stages, respectively. In contrast to the planula stage, the expression of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> itself is rather up-regulated at the gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g006">Figure 6K</xref>), whereas <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> is downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g006">Figure 6L, V</xref>), as it is at the planula stage. Interestingly, injection of a morpholino-targeting <italic>NvFGFRa</italic> strongly reduces the expression of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> and <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> at the gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g006">Figure 6S, T</xref>), while it has no effect on the expression of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g006">Figure 6Q, R</xref>). This suggests that an as yet unidentified FGF is required for the early expression of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> and <italic>NvFGFa2</italic>. This idea is supported by the increase in expression of these two genes upon knockdown of the inhibitory <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g006">Figure 6O, P, W</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus, the main difference in the interactions of these genes in the gastrula stage compared to the planula stage is a lack of positive feedback of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> on its own expression at the gastrula stage, suggesting that the autoregulatory FGF signalling loop becomes fully established only after gastrulation.</p>

        <p>Strikingly, in <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> MO-injected animals, the expression of <italic>NvWnt2</italic> extends progressively to the aboral pole, while the oral expression boundary is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g007">Figure 7D–F</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that at least part of the aboral domain acquires a more central fate. However, <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> MO-injected planulae appear shortened compared to control planulae, which could indicate that instead of being respecified, the cells of the aboral domain are not generated at all or undergo apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Gestri1">[76]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Carl1">[77]</xref>. To distinguish between these possibilities, we quantified the number of nuclei at different time points.

        <p>This suggests that the observed aboral expansion of the <italic>NvWnt2</italic> expression domain in <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> MO-injected animals reflects a respecification of the aboral domain to a more oral fate.</p>

        <p>Planulae injected with <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> or <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> morpholinos both lack an apical organ, but their overall morphology is strikingly different. To better understand the roles of these two genes, we stained injected animals with the nuclear stain DAPI and the F-actin stain Phalloidin to visualize their tissue morphology. In control MO-injected planulae, the ectodermal cells in the aboral region acquire a columnar morphology after gastrulation, whereas ectoderm cells in more central areas have a cuboidal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). The nuclei of the cells in the centre of the aboral region migrate to a more basal position before these cells form the long cilia of the apical tuft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g008">Figure 8E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Nakanishi1">[85]</xref>). In <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> MO-injected planulae, the ectodermal cells in the aboral region still become columnar, but the basal migration of nuclei does not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> MO-injected planulae, the cells of the aboral region retain a cuboidal morphology and nuclei do not migrate to a more basal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). Thus, consistent with the effect on the expression of <italic>NvWnt2</italic>, the aboral ectoderm of planulae injected with <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> MO displays a morphology resembling that of more central ectoderm, while <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> morphants specifically fail to initiate apical organ formation at the centre of the aboral region. Interestingly, in planulae injected with the <italic>NvHoxF/Anthox1</italic> morpholino, basal migration of aboral nuclei still occurs, but the outgrowth of long cilia is blocked, suggesting that <italic>NvHoxF/Anthox1</italic> acts at a late stage of apical organ formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g008">Figure 8H</xref>).</p>
        <p>The broader requirement of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> for the development of the aboral pole is also reflected in the expression of <italic>NvHoxF/Anthox1</italic>. In addition to the aboral pole expression, <italic>NvHoxF/Anthox1</italic> is expressed in scattered cells that are enriched in the aboral half of <italic>Nematostella</italic> planulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g002">Figure 2P</xref>). In <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> morphants, the apical organ expression is absent and the expression in individual cells is strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g003">Figure 3W</xref>).

        <p>Taken together, <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> is required for the development of the whole aboral territory, whereas <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> has a specific function in the development of the apical organ.</p>

        <title>Control of Aboral Domain Development in <italic>Nematostella</italic> by <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and FGF Signalling</title>
        <p>Our functional analyses lead us to a two-step model in which <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> acts as a key regulator of the development of the aboral domain of <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. First, the loss of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic> expression in <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> morphants already at the gastrula stage suggests that <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> is required during early stages to determine the identity of the whole aboral region. In a second phase, after gastrulation, NvFGFa1 signalling via NvFGFRa is required to suppress the expression of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic>, <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic>, and <italic>NvFoxD1</italic> at the aboral pole. This local suppression of the “ring genes” is necessary to allow the differentiation of the apical organ cells, with the activation of a specific cassette of genes that includes the presumably ciliary gene <italic>NvFoxJ1</italic>.</p>
        <p>Regarding the development of the apical organ, the key function of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> appears to be the initiation of an autoregulatory loop involving <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> and <italic>NvFGFa2</italic>, which uses positive (auto-activation of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic>) and negative (activation of the inhibitory <italic>NvFGFa2</italic>) feedback. This system is probably autonomously able to control the expression of FGF ligands and restrict their expression to the most aboral part of the larva, where the apical organ will form, after the down-regulation of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g009">Figure 9A,B</xref>). Thus, although inhibition of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> or <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> both leads to a lack of the apical organ, this phenotype reflects two different developmental roles: <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> has a broad and early role in determining the identity of the aboral region, while <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> has a later, apical organ-specific function. However, in contrast to knockdown of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic>, morpholinos targeting <italic>NvFGFRa</italic> suppress the expression of <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> and <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> already at the gastrula stage, suggesting that an as yet unidentified <italic>NvFGF</italic> ligand might be involved in the initiation of the <italic>NvFGFa1</italic>–<italic>NvFGFa2</italic> feedback loop. The <italic>Nematostella</italic> genome contains 15 <italic>FGF</italic>s, of which 10 have not been characterized yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Matus1">[71]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Rentzsch1">[72]</xref> and may play a role in this process.</p>

At the gastrula stage (A), all the genes are co-expressed in the aboral area and <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> positively regulates the expression of FGF ligands and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic>. The positive regulation of <italic>NvFGFa2</italic> by <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> is already in place, and it is likely responsible for the early restriction of <italic>FGFs</italic>' expression domains. At the planula stage (B), the aboral territory is divided in two domains, one surrounding the apical organ (in purple and blue/red) and one in the apical organ (orange and yellow). The first corresponds to the expression domain of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic> (and <italic>NvFoxD1</italic>), the latter to the expression of FGF ligands (drawing). The regulatory interactions change at this stage and <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> represses <italic>NvSix3/6</italic>; additionally, <italic>NvFGFa1</italic> starts a positive autoregulation (direct or indirect), responsible for the maintenance of the <italic>FGF</italic> expressing area.

In this case, however, the genes segregate in a slightly different way: <italic>six3</italic> forms a ring around the apical plate, while <italic>foxQ2</italic> is restricted to the apical plate itself. The apical domain expression of the FGF receptor is restricted to the apical plate.</p>

        <p><italic>Six3</italic>, <italic>foxQ2</italic>, and <italic>FGF</italic> genes have been shown to be expressed at the anterior/apical pole of protostome and deuterostome embryos and larvae (summarized for sea urchin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g009">Figure 9</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001488.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Lowe1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Poustka1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Kozmik1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Steinmetz1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Santagata1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Tu1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Yu1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Pani1">[86]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Lapraz1">[89]</xref>), suggesting that these genes are part of a conserved regulatory module for anterior development. The role of <italic>six3</italic> has been analysed in detail in the sea urchin <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Wei1">[11]</xref>. As in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, sea urchin <italic>six3</italic> is a key regulator of the apical domain—that is, the domain opposite to the gastrulation site. The sea urchin apical pole domain is characterized by an initial thickening of the ectodermal epithelium, which subsequently gives rise to the long cilia-bearing cells of the apical organ, and various surrounding cells, including serotonergic neurons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Angerer1">[90]</xref>). In embryos injected with a <italic>six3</italic> morpholino, the ectodermal thickening does not occur and neither the apical organ nor the neurons develop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Wei1">[11]</xref>. Microarray analysis revealed that in sea urchin <italic>six3</italic> is a positive regulator of the expression of <italic>foxQ2</italic>, <italic>foxJ1</italic>, and <italic>frizzled 5/8</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Wei1">[11]</xref>, genes that are also expressed at the aboral pole of <italic>Nematostella</italic> downstream of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g003">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Kumburegama1">[55]</xref> and unpublished data).</p>
        <p>However, despite the well-conserved overlapping expression in anterior/apical domains, there are also differences between the <italic>Nematostella</italic> and bilaterian expression domains. For example, while the expression patterns of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> and <italic>NvFoxQ2a</italic> are indistinguishable throughout development, their expression in sea urchin is highly similar only until the midblastula stage, when <italic>six3</italic> expression becomes excluded from the centre of the apical plate, while <italic>foxQ2</italic> remains expressed in this central apical domain of the sea urchin embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g008">Figure 8B,C</xref>). Similarly, the anterior expression domain of <italic>six3</italic> in the hemichordate <italic>Saccoglossus kowalewskii</italic> and the brachiopod <italic>Terebratalia transversa</italic> is slightly wider than that of <italic>foxQ2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Lowe1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Santagata1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Darras1">[87]</xref>. This suggests that although <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>foxQ2</italic> have an ancient function in anterior development, there have been modifications in their exact interactions, indicating that even very ancient developmental modules retain some degree of plasticity.</p>

        <title>The Relation of the Cnidarian Oral-Aboral Axis to the Anterior-Posterior Axis of Bilaterians</title>
        <p>Integration of the data presented here with studies in other cnidarians and in bilaterians shows that the aboral domain of cnidarians and the head-forming anterior domain of bilaterians share the expression of several transcription factors and signalling molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001488-g009">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001488.s001">S1</xref>). This suggests that in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians, aboral (i.e., contrablastoporal) development was controlled by <italic>six3/6</italic> and the aboral domain was additionally characterized by the expression of <italic>foxQ2</italic>, <italic>frizzled 5/8</italic>, <italic>rx</italic>, <italic>irx</italic>, and probably <italic>FGF</italic> signalling genes and <italic>foxD1</italic>. The most parsimonious explanation of these observations is that the anterior part and thus the head of bilaterians is derived from the aboral domain of the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor.</p>
        <p>The alternative hypothesis that cnidarians do not have a region homologous to the bilaterian head is based on the inconsistent expression of orthologs of some bilaterian anterior markers in cnidarians. However, the notion of a conserved aboral/anterior pattern mechanism does not require that all bilaterian anterior genes are already involved in cnidarian aboral development. Rather, we conjecture that additional genes became integrated into a more elaborate bilaterian anterior patterning system. This is likely for some genes that do not have clear orthologs in cnidarians (e.g., <italic>pax6</italic> or <italic>nk2.1</italic>). It could also be the case for <italic>orthodenticle/otx</italic> genes whose ancestral function might have been in endoderm development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-deJong1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Mazza1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Harada1">[91]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-ArenasMena1">[96]</xref> or for <italic>orthopedia/otp</italic> genes, which mark restricted anterior neural domains and cell types (e.g., dopaminergic neurons) in bilaterians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Lowe1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Santagata1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Nederbragt1">[97]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Acampora1">[99]</xref> and which consistent with the lack of a brain is not aborally expressed in <italic>Nematostella</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Mazza2">[100]</xref>. Analysis of additional bilaterian anterior markers (e.g., <italic>fez</italic>, <italic>foxG1</italic>, <italic>tailless</italic>) in cnidarians will help to define a putative ancient aboral/anterior patterning system.</p>
        <p>Our data are not consistent with the hypothesis in which the molecular determinants of the gastrulation site and those for bilaterian anterior neural development both localize to the animal pole in cnidarians and became spatially decoupled only after the site of β-catenin nuclearization moved to the vegetal pole in the ancestor of bilaterians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Martindale2">[3]</xref>. This hypothesis predicts that conserved bilaterian anterior development genes should be expressed, and function on the oral side of cnidarians, which is not consistent with the data presented here. Instead, conserved blastoporal and anterior patterning genes localise to and function at opposite poles in cnidarians, although with reversed orientation when related to the animal-vegetal axis of the oocyte.</p>
        <p>Evidence from several cnidarian and many bilaterian species suggests that the gastrulation site of the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor was characterized by the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Thus, the development of the two poles of cnidarian gastrulae appears to be regulated by two conserved molecular systems. Furthermore, our data suggest that antagonism between <italic>six3</italic> genes and canonical Wnt signalling in axial patterning may have an early evolutionary origin. This is indirectly supported by the aboral expression of <italic>foxQ2a</italic> in the hydrozoan <italic>Clytia hemispherica</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Chevalier1">[24]</xref>, which is negatively regulated by orally expressed <italic>wnt3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Momose2">[51]</xref>. Interestingly, aboral expression of <italic>foxQ2a</italic> commences at early gastrulation in <italic>Clytia</italic> and at the blastula stage in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and therefore is a zygotic event. In contrast, <italic>Wnt3</italic> acts as a maternally localized factor in <italic>Clytia</italic>, but localized expression of <italic>Nematostella Wnts</italic> becomes visible only zygotically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Chevalier1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Kusserow1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Momose2">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Momose3">[52]</xref>.</p>
        <p>It is worth noting that the suggested homology of the domains at the two poles of the cnidarian and bilaterian primary body axes does not necessarily mean that the complete patterning of their axes is homologous. For example, it remains to be shown that a region corresponding to the trunk region of bilaterians exists in cnidarians. Similarly, the conservation of regulators for the specification of the aboral region does not necessarily mean that the apical organs of anthozoans and bilaterians are homologues. Further studies addressing the development and function of the different cell types constituting the apical organ are necessary to resolve this question.</p>

        <title>Early Evolution of Head Development</title>
        <p>The head of most bilaterians is characterized by a centralization of the nervous system, the brain. In contrast, despite regional differences in neuron density, neither <italic>Nematostella</italic> nor other cnidarian planulae or polyps display a comparable brain-like centralization of the nervous system at the oral or aboral end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Marlow1">[83]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Nakanishi1">[85]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Watanabe1">[101]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Galliot1">[102]</xref>. In sea urchin and <italic>Tribolium</italic>, <italic>six3</italic> is required for anterior neural and epidermal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Wei1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Posnien2">[19]</xref>, whereas in vertebrates the expression and function of <italic>six3</italic> is restricted to the anterior nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Lagutin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Carl1">[77]</xref>. Our data indicate that <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> is not required for neurogenesis per se, although it influences the development of the aboral <italic>NvDmrtB</italic> positive neurons. We cannot rule out that <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> has an additional, direct function in the specification of aboral neurons, but based on the effects on general aboral markers and morphology, we favour the idea that the effect on neural specification is a secondary consequence of the broader patterning function of <italic>NvSix3/6</italic>. In any case, the function of <italic>six3</italic> in anterior/aboral patterning predates the evolution of any anterior nervous system centralization and the role of anterior patterning genes may have become restricted to the nervous system in the chordate lineage. Similarly, patterning systems controlling the development of secondary brain signalling centres in vertebrates may have evolved earlier than the corresponding structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001488-Pani1">[86]</xref>. This suggests that patterning systems with tissue-specific functions (e.g., in the nervous system) may have originated as more general axial patterning modules and only subsequently acquired tissue specificity.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we have shown that orthologs of the bilaterian anterior patterning genes <italic>six3</italic>, <italic>foxQ2</italic>, and <italic>irx</italic> are expressed at the aboral pole of a cnidarian and that <italic>NvSix3/6</italic> is a key regulator of <italic>Nematostella</italic> aboral pole development. Despite the lack of a morphological correlate of the bilaterian head in cnidarians, these data provide support for the homology of the cnidarian aboral and bilaterian anterior pole and suggest that a basic head development system evolved prior to the bilaterian brain.</p>
