      <p>During neural development, the axons of sensory and motor neurons must extend over
                long distances—meters in some animals—to reach the most distant parts of
                the limbs. The axons of these neurons adhere tightly together to form spinal nerves
                that project over these distances to their peripheral targets. This process, called
                fasciculation, controls axon outgrowth and guidance. However, the underlying
                signaling pathways that mediate this process are not well understood.</p>
      <p>Two molecules, semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) and neuropilin-1 (Npn-1), have been implicated
                in axon–axon interactions that mediate the segregation of axons in the
                olfactory system (a process that is similar to fasciculation of axons that innervate
                the limbs), and it has also been suggested that they are involved in the
                fasciculation of motor axons before they grow into the forelimb. Npn-1 is expressed
                in both spinal motor neurons and sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia, making
                it a potential mediator of interactions between the axons of these neurons.</p>
      <p>In this issue of <italic>PLoS Biology</italic>, Huber and colleagues have used
                conditional mouse genetics to investigate whether Npn-1 plays a role in the
                segregation and fasciculation of sensory and motor axons before they innervate
                peripheral targets. First, they generated mice in which Npn-1 expression was
                abolished in most motor neurons but not in sensory neurons. Lack of Npn-1 in motor
                neurons led to extreme defasciculation of motor axons and to dorsal–ventral
                guidance errors in the axon trajectories in the limb. Sensory axons, by contrast,
                were unaffected.</p>
      <p>As the next logical step, they then generated mice in which only sensory neurons of
                the dorsal root ganglia lacked Npn-1 expression. In these mice, both sensory and
                motor axons projecting to the limbs were strongly defasciculated and showed aberrant
                trajectories. Closer examination of the spinal nerves showed that defasciculated
                motor axons always followed sensory axons in these mice.</p>
      <p>After exiting the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, motor and sensory axons
                converge in a region called the plexus and are sorted into bundles according to
                their targets. In mice that lacked Npn-1 in motor neurons, defasciculation occurred
                only after motor axons had passed through the plexus. By contrast, in mice that
                lacked Npn-1 in peripheral sensory neurons, both motor and sensory axons were
                defasciculated before they reached the plexus as well as within and beyond it, with
                sensory fibers leading motor axons. These results support a role for Npn-1 in
                mediating the mutual dependence of sensory and motor axons during proper circuit
                wiring.</p>
      <p>In another experiment, the authors used genetic techniques to partially eliminate
                motor neurons. Mice with few motor neurons had reduced and abnormal sensory
                projections, although sensory axons projected normally towards the plexus region. On
                the other hand, elimination of sensory neurons caused defasciculation of motor axons
                as well as the remaining sensory axons before they reached the plexus.</p>
      <p>The results of these experiments support a model in which motor axons are required
                for sensory neurons to route through the plexus region, with sensory axons
                subsequently able to project into the limb on their own. Motor projections also rely
                on sensory axons for correct fasciculation and guidance. The role of Npn-1 and the
                importance of axon–axon interactions seem to vary depending on the location,
                offering important insight into the mechanisms of peripheral limb innervation.</p>
