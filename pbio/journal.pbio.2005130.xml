<abstract>
<p>Haploinsufficiency, a dominant phenotype caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation, has been rarely observed. However, high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping of yeast morphological characteristics revealed haploinsufficiency phenotypes for more than half of 1,112 essential genes under optimal growth conditions. Additionally, 40% of the essential genes with no obvious phenotype under optimal growth conditions displayed haploinsufficiency under severe growth conditions. Haploinsufficiency was detected more frequently in essential genes than in nonessential genes. Similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were observed mostly in mutants with heterozygous deletion of functionally related genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency phenotypes were caused by functional defects of the genes. A global view of the gene network was presented based on the similarities of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Our dataset contains rich information regarding essential gene functions, providing evidence that single-cell phenotyping is a powerful approach, even in the heterozygous condition, for analyzing complex biological systems.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Diploid organisms harboring a wild-type gene and a loss-of-function mutation are called heterozygotes. They are expected to have weak or no individual phenotypes because the mutation is compensated for by the intact allele. The dominant inheritance of phenotypes in heterozygotes is an exceptional phenomenon called haploinsufficiency. Haploinsufficiency was thought to be a rare occurrence; however, a sensitive technique called high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping challenges this perspective. Investigations of single-cell phenotypes revealed that a large extent of the essential genes in yeast exhibit haploinsufficiency. Our analyses also provided crucial information on gene functional networks based on haploinsufficiency phenotypes. This work shows that high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping is a useful tool that can be used to better understand complex biological systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The concepts of dominance and recessiveness were originally formulated by Gregor Mendel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref001">1</xref>] and are still fundamental to modern genetics. Loss-of-function mutations are mostly recessive and rarely dominant in diploid organisms. Haploinsufficiency is a rare manifestation of the dominant phenotype arising from a copy of a loss-of-function mutation in the heterozygous state and was initially studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref002">2</xref>]. There is great interest in haploinsufficient genes because the loss of 1 functional allele is linked to human diseases including cancer and tumorigenesis, developmental and neurological disorders, and mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref003">3</xref>]. Therefore, it is challenging to determine the number of genes in the genome that are sensitive to 1-copy gene loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Two models have been developed to explain the occurrence of haploinsufficiency. As can be seen in dosage-dependent sex determination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref006">6</xref>], a reduction in the gene copy number affects regulatory genes working at a threshold level. Some proteins are likely produced at the lowest level possible for proper function. Therefore, haploinsufficiency may simply be due to a reduction in protein level in the heterozygous state, which is referred to as the insufficient amount hypothesis. A second theory, referred to as the balance hypothesis, predicts that the stoichiometry of various protein components is important for maintaining the integrity of a protein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref007">7</xref>]. In yeast, representative haploinsufficient genes include cytoskeletal components such as actin (Act1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref008">8</xref>] and tubulin (Tub1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref009">9</xref>] as well as components of protein complexes such as spindle pole body component (Ndc1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref010">10</xref>] and myosin (Mlc1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref011">11</xref>]. In these circumstances, gene overexpression also results in an imbalance of the components and shows similar phenotypic consequences of 1-copy gene loss.</p>
<p>Genome-wide studies have been performed to investigate haploinsufficient growth phenotypes in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Among 5,900 yeast genes analyzed, approximately 3% (184 mutants) exhibited haploinsufficient growth in rich media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref012">12</xref>]. Many of the yeast haploinsufficient genes were functionally related and related to ribosomal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref012">12</xref>], suggesting a significant contribution of ribosomal function to rapid growth. By further investigating the growth phenotypes under limited nutrient conditions, up to 20% of the genome was found to display a haploinsufficient abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref013">13</xref>]. A recent systematic screen of another budding yeast, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, revealed that 10% of the genes in the genome influenced cell size under optimal growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref014">14</xref>]. However, the extent of haploinsufficiency was still restrictive, and little is known about the functional relationships between these genes.</p>
<p>One approach to identify haploinsufficiency is to monitor the phenotypes from different perspectives. Cell morphology is an attractive target for intensive analyses because it reflects a wide variety of cellular events, and hundreds of traits can be analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref015">15</xref>]. In this study, we investigated the haploinsufficiency of 1,112 heterozygotes of yeast essential genes using high-dimensional phenotyping with 501 morphological traits. We found that more than half of the essential genes displayed haploinsufficiency under optimal growth conditions, indicative of extensive haploinsufficiency. Similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were caused by heterozygous deletion of functionally related essential genes. Correlation networks of haploinsufficient genes provided a global view of their functional relationships. Our dataset offers useful resources for the study of essential gene functions in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<title>Frequently observed morphological haploinsufficiency in yeast essential genes</title>
<p>We employed yeast heterozygous diploid strains with deletions in each of the essential genes and examined haploinsufficiency in terms of its effects on morphology (morphological haploinsufficiency) by performing single-cell high-dimensional phenotyping. To minimize variation due to inconsistencies in data acquisition, we collected the cultures after growth to a precise point in early log-phase in rich medium, used the automated image processing system CalMorph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref015">15</xref>], and analyzed more than 200 cells for each strain. To exclude technical artefacts due to staining procedures and cell segmentation, automatic discriminators and classifiers built into CalMorph made it possible to obtain high-quality multivariate information on single cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition to 220 mean and 61 ratio morphological parameters, 220 variance parameters—which represent variance of the single-cell distribution in morphology—were extracted. To detect phenotypic abnormalities, a generalized linear model (GLM) was applied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s002">S1 Table</xref>). As expected, haploinsufficient morphological phenotypes were rarely observed. Of all the combinations between 501 traits and 1,112 heterozygous diploids, only 0.764% (4,258 assays) were significantly different from the wild-type diploid based on a 1-sample 2-sided test (false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.01; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 7.64 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s010">S1 Fig</xref>). However, an analysis of morphological phenotypes in each strain revealed a large number of haploinsufficient genes. A total of 59.1% (657 heterozygous diploids, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s003">S2A Table</xref>) of the heterozygous deletion mutants exhibited differences compared with the wild-type diploid in at least 1 of the morphological traits examined (FDR = 0.01; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 7.64 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; red area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s011">S2B Fig</xref>). The number of abnormal mutants detected for each trait was relatively small, mostly within the IQR between 2 and 12. We estimated that the rate of false positive (FP) abnormal mutants detected by chance in our analysis was 6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, black line), which was almost the same as the number of abnormal replicates in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, orange line). This confirmed that our statistical estimation of the number of haploinsufficiency phenotypes was not overestimated. We used an alternative approach to estimate the number of haploinsufficient mutants following dimensional reduction. A large number of heterozygotes (40% of 1,112) still displayed haploinsufficiency in at least 1 of the 20 principal components (PCs) covering 60% of variance of the morphological phenotypes (FDR = 0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s012">S3C Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Single-cell phenotyping used to detect morphological haploinsufficiency</title>
<p>We found that the cumulative number of haploinsufficient mutants increased with an increase in the number of morphological traits examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, red line). Mean parameters—and, more effectively, variance parameters—contributed to haploinsufficiency detection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s013">S4A Fig</xref>), highlighting the importance of single-cell phenotyping. Ratio parameters were less important because the cumulative number of haploinsufficient mutants reached 98% without the ratio parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s013">S4B Fig</xref>, light blue line). We next investigated whether the differences between the morphologies of haploinsufficient mutants increased or decreased phenotypic variance and found significantly more phenotypic variance in the 657 haploinsufficient strains than in the other strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s014">S5 Fig</xref>; <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01 after Bonferroni correction and Mann–Whitney U test). This observation is consistent with the previous finding that decreasing dosage with the use of conditional alleles often results in increased morphological variation within populations of isogenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, one widespread function of essential genes is to stabilize morphological phenotypes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Comparison between essential and nonessential genes</title>
<p>We counted the frequency of haploinsufficiency in nonessential genes by examining 100 randomly selected heterozygous gene-deletion mutants. For the 501 traits, 33% of the heterozygous diploids showed haploinsufficiency at the same threshold (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 7.64 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, gray line). Therefore, the frequency of haploinsufficiency in essential genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, red line) was approximately 2-fold greater than that in nonessential genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, gray line). We noted previously that 65% of the haploid mutants with nonessential deletions were morphologically distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref015">15</xref>], indicating that the morphological phenotypes in heterozygous diploids were less commonly observed than those in haploid deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s003">S2B Table</xref>). These analyses indicated that essential genes have a large impact on haploinsufficient morphological phenotypes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Morphological haploinsufficiency in poor synthetic medium</title>
<p>We tested the morphological haploinsufficiency of heterozygous diploids under nutrient-limited growth conditions in 50 randomly selected heterozygous deletion mutants, which exhibited no haploinsufficiency in rich media. After growth in poor synthetic medium, 40% (16.4% out of 40.9%) of heterozygous diploids that exhibited no obvious morphological phenotypes in rich media exhibited haploinsufficiency in at least 1 of the morphological traits (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 7.64 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, pink area). This indicated that up to 75.5% (59.1% + 16.4%) of the heterozygous diploids exhibited phenotypes either in rich or poor synthetic medium.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Functional defects associated with morphological haploinsufficiency</title>
<p>We examined the morphological haploinsufficiency to see whether it could be explained by functional defects of the genes. To investigate the relationship between gene function and a particular haploinsufficiency phenotype, we performed dimensional reduction by principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref018">18</xref>], which is used to explore the relationship between 2 multivariate sets of variables. PCA and CCA successfully compressed all combinations of 444 morphological traits and 830 gene ontology (GO) terms into linear combinations of phenotypic (21 phenotype canonical variables [pCVs]) and gene-function features (21 GO term canonical variables [gCVs]) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s015">S6 Fig</xref>). In fact, analysis of the canonical correlation coefficient revealed a significant correlation between phenotype (pCVs) and gene function (gCVs) (<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05, Bartlett’s chi-squared test). At a given canonical correlation coefficient in each pair of 21 CVs, no FPs were found by chance after 10,000 iterations of the randomization, indicating that randomized phenotypic data yielded no pairs of CVs. The phenotypic space composed of pCVs was suitable for understanding phenotypic features of haploinsufficient mutants with the same functional defects. For example, exploring the phenotypic space of pCV1 and pCV3 revealed that heterozygotes for RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) core complex (green) and for subunits of the cytosolic chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex (red) were plotted in different directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This graphically demonstrated that the heterozygous mutations in RNA pol II and chaperonin CCT caused specific morphologies, namely, large/elongated cell shape and large actin region/nonelliptical cell shape, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s004">S3A Table</xref>).</p>

<p>The logistic regression analysis can be used to identify the best combinations of pCVs for each GO term, yielding the maximum likelihood prediction of the gene functions with haploinsufficiency phenotypes (e.g., cytosolic large ribosomal subunit [ribosomal protein of the large subunit (RPL)] in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

<title>Correlation analysis of haploinsufficient genes for morphology</title>
<p>To better understand morphological haploinsufficiency, we examined the overlap between haploinsufficient genes for growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref012">12</xref>] and haploinsufficient genes for morphology. A contingency table test showed significant correlations between these 2 datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s005">S4 Table</xref>; <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01 according to Fisher’s exact test), suggesting a common integrant. A previous study revealed that ribosomal function was specifically enriched in haploinsufficiency based on cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref012">12</xref>]. Although many ribosomal genes were also morphologically haploinsufficient, specific gene functions were not enriched among the 657 morphologically identified haploinsufficient genes (FDR = 0.1); instead, genes encoding most of the essential cellular processes—such as replication, transcription, translation, protein degradation, membrane trafficking, transporter, cell cycle progression, morphogenesis, and macromolecular synthesis—were represented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s004">S3B Table</xref>). We also noted that specific gene functions were not enriched in genes that were not morphologically haploinsufficient (FDR = 0.1). Therefore, careful high-dimensional and single-cell phenotyping detected numerous haploinsufficient genes with functions in diverse cellular processes.</p>
<p>A previous study indicated that genes involved in protein complexes were enriched among haploinsufficient genes related to growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref012">12</xref>]. The genes involved in protein complexes were also significantly enriched among haploinsufficient genes related to morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s006">S5 Table</xref>, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01 by Fisher’s exact test for 1 side). This suggested that specific gene functions were enriched in both haploinsufficient morphological genes and genes involved in protein complexes. In fact, some gene functions (such as nuclear polyadenylation-dependent mRNA catabolic process, cytosolic large ribosomal subunit, etc.) were enriched with high degrees of protein–protein interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s016">S7A Fig</xref>, PPI). Similar but distinct gene functions were significantly enriched with high degrees of genetic interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s016">S7A Fig</xref>; genetic interaction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref019">19</xref>]. By comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g003">Fig 3</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s016">S7A Fig</xref>, a Venn diagram was constructed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s016">S7B Fig</xref>), which indicated that among 124 GOs of protein complexes, 70 GOs were enriched in morphologically identified haploinsufficient genes. Therefore, our analysis suggested that numerous haploinsufficient genes are involved in protein complexes with diverse cellular functions.</p>
<p>Haploinsufficient genes are the genes that are sensitive to 1-copy gene loss. Therefore, we next analyzed the correlation of haploinsufficient genes for morphology with overexpression-sensitive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref020">20</xref>] and with highly expressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref021">21</xref>]. We revealed a significant correlation with overexpression-sensitive genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s017">S8A Fig</xref>; Spearman rank correlation coefficient, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01 by <italic>t</italic> test) but failed to detect any correlation with highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s017">S8B Fig</xref>, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, <italic>P</italic> = 0.38 by <italic>t</italic> test). However, we detected a significant correlation when we selected genes annotated with a specific GO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s018">S9 Fig</xref>, Wald-test, FDR = 0.05). This implies that the correlation between morphologically identified haploinsufficient genes and highly expressed genes is GO specific.

<title>Linkage between cell growth and cell morphogenesis</title>

<title>Correlation of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes</title>
<p>Because the haploinsufficiency phenotypes were due to functional defects of the genes, we further assessed the degree of similarity between the phenotypic profiles of individual haploinsufficient mutants. To do this, a full matrix of gene–gene pairwise similarities was calculated based on the haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Although phenotypic correlation coefficients between all pairs of the heterozygous diploids were distributed largely from –0.23 to +0.23 (mean ± 1 SD), the mean values of those sharing the same GO categories were typically positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s020">S11 Fig</xref>). There were only a few (0.98%) highly correlated (&gt;0.5) cases. We analyzed the interactions with correlations above 0.5 and found many cases of interactions within the protein complex GO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s021">S12 Fig</xref>). Therefore, the similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were associated with the deletion mutants in the same GO categories. After dimensional reduction by CCA, a high level of precision and recall curve for GO terms was achieved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s022">S13 Fig</xref>), indicating that the positive correlation coefficient had substantial predictive power for gene function. We compared the precision-recall characteristics of our phenotypic data to the results from other high-throughput studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s023">S14 Fig</xref>) and found that our data (red) were almost as precise and sensitive as protein interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref023">23</xref>] (green) and microarray co-expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref024">24</xref>] (purple) and were more predictable than phosphoprotein (orange) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref025">25</xref>] and genetic interaction data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref026">26</xref>] (blue). We then tested pairs of correlation coefficients between representative functional gene groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s009">S8A Table</xref>) and observed both positive and negative correlations. For example, the mean value between “cytoplasmic translation” and “ribosomal large subunit assembly” (both involved in protein synthesis) was positive, while that between “ribosomal large subunit assembly” and “proteasome regulatory particle” was negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The negative correlations reflected the opposing nature of the cellular processes, namely, protein synthesis and degradation. Our results strongly suggest that positive and negative correlations of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes reflect functional relationships in cellular processes.</p>

<p>We used correlations between haploinsufficiency phenotypes to construct global functional maps among the yeast essential genes.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Comprehensive single-cell phenotyping of heterozygous diploids in budding yeast revealed that more than half of the essential gene mutants are haploinsufficient in morphology. Up to 76% of the heterozygous diploids showed distinct morphological phenotypes either in rich or minimal media. High-dimensional phenotyping with many points of view yielded an even larger number of haploinsufficient mutants. This suggests that future high-dimensional assays will identify more haploinsufficient genes that are linked to human diseases. Among phenotypic values acquired from hundreds of individual cells, the variance value of the traits was found to be more effective than others, demonstrating the importance of single-cell phenotyping. The morphological phenotypes of the haploinsufficient heterozygotes could be mainly explained by gene function. There was morphological similarity within the deletion mutants of functionally related genes, as evidenced by dense gene clusters with rich functional information, and functional networks based on morphological similarity.</p>
<p>Phenotypes can be perturbed by environmental changes, epigenomic effects, and/or experimental artefacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref027">27</xref>]. To demonstrate that the observed haploinsufficiency phenotypes were due to chromosomal heterozygous deletions, we determined whether the haploinsufficiency phenotypes could be explained by gene-functional defects. We found that 90% of genes with functional defects (553 of 610 haploinsufficient genes with reliable GO annotations) were associated with the phenotypes of heterozygous diploids. The strong correlation between gene function and the haploinsufficiency phenotype provides concrete evidence that a decrease in the gene dosage could result in malfunctioning in a large proportion of essential genes.</p>
<p>Given the results from previous comprehensive studies of haploinsufficient genes, it was quite surprising that such a large proportion of essential genes displayed haploinsufficiency. Studies in budding yeast revealed that approximately 9% of essential genes in the genome are haploinsufficient for growth in rich medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref012">12</xref>]. A careful survey of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome showed that only 56 loci were associated with an altered phenotype when present as a single copy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref028">28</xref>]. Compared with results from a previous study, we found that most of the genes involved in essential cellular processes were haploinsufficient in terms of morphology.</p>
<p>Genes encoding components of protein complexes were significantly enriched among the haploinsufficient genes, which supports the balance hypothesis. In addition, the significant correlation between overexpression-sensitive and haploinsufficient genes supports the balance hypothesis discussed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref012">12</xref>]. On the other hand, many genes encoding noncomplex enzymes were also haploinsufficient, which supports the insufficient amount hypothesis. Although we failed to detect a significant correlation between highly expressed and haploinsufficient genes on the whole, we detected a significant correlation when we selected haploinsufficient genes annotated with specific GO terms, including carbohydrate-derivative biosynthetic process (GO:1901137 in alcohol metabolic process group; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s018">S9 Fig</xref>), RNA methyl transferase activity (GO: 0008173 in tRNA processing group; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s018">S9 Fig</xref>), and mitotic cohesin complex (GO: 0030892). The correlation between highly expressed and haploinsufficient genes supports the insufficient amount hypothesis, and haploinsufficiency of these genes can be easily explained by this hypothesis. Therefore, according to our analysis, it is conceivable that both the insufficient amount and balance hypotheses are correct. Further study will be necessary to determine which hypotheses are applicable for each haploinsufficient gene.</p>
<p>Our dataset will provide researchers with a tool for gaining insights into the functions of yeast essential genes. First, haploinsufficiency phenotypes can be used to understand the function of essential genes. Compared with the various pleiotropic phenotypes frequently observed in conditional lethal mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref030">30</xref>], haploinsufficiency phenotyping is equally reliable. Second, phenotypic similarities between heterozygous diploids can be used either to identify previously known functional connections or propose previously unknown functional connections. It should be noted that phenotypic similarities between the nonessential deletion mutants were used to predict gene function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref015">15</xref>]. We observed both positive and negative correlations between haploinsufficiency phenotypes, suggesting that high-dimensional single-cell phenotypes reflect functional relationships in the cellular network. Third, it would also be interesting to compare haploinsufficient genes observed under different conditions. Because more than 1,000 chemical genetic assays revealed a growth defect for all deletion mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref031">31</xref>], phenotyping in multiple environments is a promising strategy. Therefore, as is the case for growth phenotyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref013">13</xref>], morphological phenotyping under different growth conditions will reveal important aspects of gene function. Finally, comparisons between haploinsufficient and chemical-induced morphological profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref032">32</xref>] will be used to explore intracellular drug targets. We will be able to make more precise predictions by integrating haploinsufficient morphological profiles with chemical-genetic interaction profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref033">33</xref>] or other gene features. These will give us additional tools for drug target prediction.</p>

<title>Statistical test for identification of haploinsufficiency phenotypes</title>
<p>To assess haploinsufficiency cell morphology phenotypes statistically, we used the GLM as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref039">39</xref>] with minor modifications. The haploinsufficiency phenotypes of heterozygotes were detected using the 1-sample 2-sided test with a null distribution estimated from 114 replicated wild-type strains.</p>
<p>The null distribution for each trait was estimated using 1 of 4 probability density functions (PDFs), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref039">39</xref>]. To minimize the effects of confounding factors affecting microscopic output, we applied the linear model using dummy variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s002">S1 Table</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s001">S1 Text</xref>). The maximum likelihood estimation for each PDF was performed using R function “gamlss” contained in the “gamlss” package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref040">40</xref>]. The validity of the null distributions estimated by the wild-type phenotype was assessed using the R-squared value of a quantile–quantile plot. A theoretical distribution for each trait was estimated using the “qqplot” function of the default package using random values (<italic>n =</italic> 11,400) generated from the PDF estimated as a null distribution. To calculate the R-squared value, the theoretical distribution was compared to the distribution of the wild type (<italic>n =</italic> 114). The median of R-squared values among 501 traits was 0.966 (IQR 0.964–0.976), indicating that the selected model and its estimated parameters approximated the distributions of the wild type.</p>
<p><italic>P</italic> values for each mutant were calculated based on the estimated PDF at 2 sides (low and high tails), such that twice the minimum <italic>P</italic> values were used for statistical tests (1-sample 2-sided test). The FDR was estimated using the R function “qvalue” in the “qvalue” package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref041">41</xref>]. Similarly, the number of deletion mutants for nonessential genes was estimated based on the 1-sample 2-sided test with 122 replicated wild-type and 4,718 nonessential gene-deletion mutant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The number of mutants detected for at least 1 trait was counted for each threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s011">S2 Fig</xref>). To estimate the number of samples detected by chance for at least 1 trait, we performed parametric bootstrap resampling using PDFs with maximum likelihood estimations. Random values of 114 samples were generated from each PDF for each parameter. The number of trials (<italic>n =</italic> 3,000) with at least 1 falsely detected trait among 501 traits was counted at each threshold and averaged. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s011">S2 Fig</xref>, the confidence intervals from the FPs were estimated by assuming binomial distribution.</p>

<title>CCA</title>
<p>The purpose of this analysis was to reduce the dimensions from 501 traits and identify biologically important morphological features. We used Z values of 501 traits as a morphometric profile and a Boolean matrix of GO terms as a gene function for each heterozygote. First, we obtained Z values using test statistics of the Wald test using the R function “coeftest” in the “lmtest” package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref042">42</xref>] and selected 657 heterozygotes (59%) with significant haploinsufficiency phenotypes at an FDR of 0.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We further discarded 47 genes that were annotated by GO terms with fewer than 3 genes. We then selected 830 GO terms that annotated more than 2 genes in the remaining 610 haploinsufficient genes and fewer than 200 genes in the genome with no identical sets of annotated genes. Finally, we used Z values of 444 morphological traits calculated from 610 of the 657 heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s011">S2B Fig</xref>), such that the 444 traits were detected in at least 1 of the 610 heterozygotes.</p>
<p>To reduce dimensionality, we subjected the morphometric profiles to PCA and the first 17, 29, 50, 91, and 130 PCs (phenotype principal components [pPCs]) contributed more than 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.95, respectively, to the cumulative contribution ratio (CCR). Next, to estimate functional relationships among the 610 genes, we used the structure of 830 GO terms. Dimensionality of GO terms can be reduced by PCA on a Boolean matrix (if a gene was annotated by GO, then its value was 1; otherwise, it was 0), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref043">43</xref>]. The 830 GO terms for the 610 genes were then subjected to PCA, and the first 59, 84, 120, 181, and 346 GO term principal components (gPCs) contributed 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.99, respectively, to the CCR indicating that approximately 346 gene functions were related to the 610 genes.</p>
<p>After projection of Z values on pPCs and a zero matrix on gPCs for 114 replicates of the wild type, we applied CCA to the 130 pPCs and the 346 gPCs, for which the CCRs were 0.95 and 0.99, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s015">S6 Fig</xref>). Significance of the canonical correlation coefficient was tested at <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 based on Bartlett’s chi-squared test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref044">44</xref>] to obtain 21 morphological features (pCVs) and 21 gene function features (gCVs). To characterize each pCV based on morphological features, linear regression analysis was performed based on the Z value of each trait on pCV and detected at <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 after Bonferroni correction using the F test. Morphological features for each pCV are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s004">S3A Table</xref> by successive PCA, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref045">45</xref>].</p>

<title>Logistic regression with combinational optimization</title>
<p>To detect correlation between GO terms and haploinsufficiency phenotypes, we applied multiple logistic regression analysis to each of the 830 GO terms with combinational optimization techniques for pCVs as explanatory variables. Logistic regressions were performed using the R function “brglm” in the “brglm” package, which was designed to determine a solution to the problem of separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref046">46</xref>]. Combinational optimization was performed using the R function step, in the default package after adaptation of the “brglm” function. A best linear model consisting of 1 of 21 pCVs as an explanatory variable was selected by optimization of algorithms based on Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref047">47</xref>]. The selected model was tested at <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 after Bonferroni correction by the likelihood ratio test using the R function “lrtest” in the “lmtest” package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref042">42</xref>].</p>

<p>The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g003">Fig 3</xref> was performed using the R function “hca.” Dissimilarity was calculated based on the ratio of shared genes to the union of genes annotated with 2 arbitrary genome-wide GO terms. The GO terms were divided into 20 groups as listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s004">S3B Table</xref> at a height value less than 0.99, such that height was the minimum ratio of the different genes between clusters (complete linkage).</p>

<title>Precision recall analysis</title>
<p>Precision and recall were calculated as described in Baryshnikova and colleagues (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref048">48</xref>] with minor modifications. Correlation coefficients of all (185,745) pairs of 610 genes were calculated using 130 pPC scores or 21 pCV scores. The gene pairs were sorted in ascending order of correlation coefficient and were ranked by the correlation coefficient. The number of gene pairs for which 2 genes were co-annotated by at least 1 of the 830 GO terms listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s004">S3B Table</xref> were counted as true positives (TPs) for each <italic>n</italic>th (<italic>n =</italic> 1, 2, …. 185,745) rank of gene pairs from the first to <italic>n</italic>th rank of the gene pairs. TP was used for the recall. The precision of each TP was calculated by dividing TP by each rank of pairs.</p>

<sec id="sec020">
<title>Pairwise CCA</title>
<p>We first divided the genes into functional gene groups with no common term. The 553 haploinsufficient genes with significant high probabilities of correlation to the gene functions were classified into disjunctional functional gene groups using GO annotations in common. The binary distance between each pair of genes was calculated based on a Boolean matrix of the selected 306 GO terms and used for clustering by the complete linkage method using static branch cutting with a height value less than 1; 62 gene groups were identified, each of which contained from 1 to 33 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). To assign the most appropriate GO terms to each gene group, enrichment of GO terms was analyzed using Fisher’s exact test (<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 after Bonferroni correction; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s009">S8A Table</xref>). In 49 of the groups, more than 1 GO term was enriched. The remaining groups were therefore identified as functional gene groups with no GO terms in common.</p>
<p>Next, we calculated pairwise correlation coefficients between the functional gene groups. To detect significant relationships between the gene groups, we performed pairwise CCA between arbitrary pairs of the 62 gene groups (<sub>62</sub>C<sub>2</sub> = 1,891) using 21 pCV scores. To eliminate possible detection bias, we used a smaller number of genes than the number of pCVs by reducing dimensionality of genes after applying PCA to the data of heterozygous genes. For pairwise CCA, we applied CCA to pCV scores using the genes and/or the selected PCs as variables, and extracted heterozygote canonical variables (hCVs) as independent components that correlated between the gene groups. We then tested the significance of the canonical correlation coefficient of the first hCV at <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 after Bonferroni correction using Bartlett’s chi-squared test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref044">44</xref>]. Among 1,891 pairs of the 62 gene groups, 136 pairs were detected with significant relationships between the gene groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>

<title>Networking with phenotypic correlation</title>
<p>A good way to show a global view of functional relationships based on phenotypic correlation is through graphical representation of gene networks. Similarity of phenotypes between the pairs of 513 heterozygotes was calculated using 21 pCV scores and expressed as a correlation coefficient. To visualize the network of the 46 GO term-enriched gene groups (513 genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005130.s009">S8B Table</xref>) with significant relationships to other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), we used the R function “qgraph” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref049">49</xref>], with which a correlation matrix can be represented as a network. We fed the matrix of the pCV-score–based correlation coefficient after zero filling cells into the “qgraph” of R function when at least 1 of 2 genes in the combination was not significantly related to the first hCV at <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 by <italic>t</italic> test for correlation coefficient (see Pairwise CCA section).</p>

In each GO, logistic regression of the interaction degree was applied to the GO annotation of 1,044 genes for PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref052">52</xref>] and 940 genes for GI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref026">26</xref>]. Enrichment of the genes annotated to each GO with a high degree of interaction was assessed using a 1-tailed Wald test for the slope of the linear model at <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 after Bonferroni correction. Color peaks indicate <italic>P</italic> values of the 1-tailed Wald test for each of 830 GOs. The vertical dashed line indicates <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 after Bonferroni correction. Colors of peaks and text for 124 and 201 GOs in PPI and GI, respectively, indicate the GO group and representative GO term, which are the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Black peaks and grey texts indicate no correlation was detected at <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 after Bonferroni correction. (B) Venn diagram of the enriched GO terms in the 3 datasets. The GOs detected in each dataset (306 GOs for cell morphology shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005130.g003">Fig 3</xref>, 124 GOs for protein interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref052">52</xref>], and 201 GOs for genetic interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005130.ref026">26</xref>]) were summarized in a Venn diagram. GI, genetic interaction; PPI, protein–protein interaction.</p>
