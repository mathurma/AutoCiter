        <p>Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) must select—from a large repertoire—which odor receptors to express. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, most ORNs express one of 60 <italic>Or</italic> genes, and most <italic>Or</italic> genes are expressed in a single ORN class in a process that produces a stereotyped receptor-to-neuron map. The construction of this map poses a problem of receptor gene regulation that is remarkable in its dimension and about which little is known. By using a phylogenetic approach and the genome sequences of 12 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, we systematically identified regulatory elements that are evolutionarily conserved and specific for individual <italic>Or</italic> genes of the maxillary palp. Genetic analysis of these elements supports a model in which each receptor gene contains a zip code, consisting of elements that act positively to promote expression in a subset of ORN classes, and elements that restrict expression to a single ORN class. We identified a transcription factor, <italic>Scalloped</italic>, that mediates repression. Some elements are used in other chemosensory organs, and some are conserved upstream of axon-guidance genes. Surprisingly, the odor response spectra and organization of maxillary palp ORNs have been extremely well-conserved for tens of millions of years, even though the amino acid sequences of the receptors are not highly conserved. These results, taken together, define the logic by which individual ORNs in the maxillary palp select which odor receptors to express.</p>

          <p>Odors are detected by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Which odor an individual neuron detects is dictated by the odor receptors it expresses. Odor receptors are encoded by large families of genes, and an individual neuron must thus select the gene it expresses from among many possibilities. The mechanism underlying this choice is largely unknown. We have examined the problem of receptor gene choice in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, whose maxillary palp contains six functional classes of ORNs, each expressing different odor receptor genes. By comparing the DNA sequences flanking these genes in 12 different species of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have identified regulatory elements that are evolutionarily conserved and specific to each odor receptor. Genetic analysis of these elements showed that some act positively to dictate expression in a subset of ORNs, while others act negatively to restrict the expression of a receptor gene to a particular ORN class. We identified a transcription factor, Scalloped, that mediates repression. We were surprised to find that the odor response spectra of these neurons have been well-conserved for tens of millions of years, even though the amino acid sequences of their receptors have diverged considerably.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Odor discrimination is based on the differential activities of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), which in turn depend on the odor receptors that the ORNs express [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b002">2</xref>]. This raises an intriguing problem: how do individual ORNs select, from among a large repertoire, which receptor genes to express?</p>
      <p>Two models—a deterministic model and a stochastic model—are often proposed to explain the problem of receptor gene choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b003">3</xref>]. In the deterministic model, different receptor genes contain different combinations of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, and an individual gene is selected in those ORNs with corresponding transcription factors. In the stochastic model, individual receptor genes are selected by an unknown, singular entity or process that can act on only one gene at a time.</p>
      <p>In mammals, the expression of an individual receptor is restricted to a particular zone of the olfactory epithelium, but within a zone, the choice of one receptor by a neuron is widely believed to be accomplished via a stochastic mechanism, followed by negative-feedback inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b006">6</xref>]. Only a single allele of an OR gene is expressed in an ORN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b007">7</xref>], a property that has recently been found to be widespread among 4,000 autosomal genes surveyed in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b008">8</xref>]. A 2.1-kb region called the H element, defined by its high homology between human and mouse, was shown to be required for normal expression of several OR genes adjacent to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b004">4</xref>]. Further analysis of the H element suggested an elegant model in which it also acts as a <italic>trans</italic>-acting enhancer element that allows stochastic activation of a single OR gene in each neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b005">5</xref>]; however, recent data have favored a model in which the primary function of the H region is to act in <italic>cis</italic>, as one of many <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements required for OR expression in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b010">10</xref>]. These results focus attention on the question of how <italic>cis</italic>-regulation might underlie the strikingly sophisticated problem of receptor gene choice.</p>
      <p>The fruit fly <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> contains two olfactory organs, the antenna and the maxillary palp, each covered with olfactory sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Each sensillum contains ORNs, usually two, combined according to a strict pairing rule. In the antenna, each ORN class is restricted to a zone of the antennal surface, with zones showing varying degrees of overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b011">11</xref>]). In the maxillary palp, physiological data showed that different types of sensilla, and by extension, different classes of ORNs, appear to be largely if not completely coextensive, as if the maxillary palp constituted a single zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b012">12</xref>].</p>

      <p>There are 60 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Odor receptor</named-content> (<italic>Or</italic>) genes, most of which are expressed in either the antenna or the maxillary palp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b016">16</xref>]. Each receptor is expressed in ORNs of a single functional class; ∼37 ORN classes have been defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b019">19</xref>]. Most ORN classes express a single receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b022">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>In an earlier study, we identified two regulatory elements that are required for organ-specific expression of receptor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b023">23</xref>]. Within an organ, we found no evidence for a negative-feedback mechanism. However, we identified a <italic>cis</italic>- regulatory element required for receptor expression in one ORN class. These findings suggested the possibility that neuron-specific odor receptor choice in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may depend on a sophisticated combinatorial code of <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements, as opposed to a stochastic mechanism followed by a negative feedback mechanism. The results thus laid a foundation for a systematic investigation of the most challenging aspect of the problem: how different receptors are expressed in different ORNs of an individual organ. The maxillary palp was chosen because it offers the virtue of numerical simplicity. It contains ∼120 ORNs, which are housed in three types of sensillum: pb1, pb2, and pb3. Each sensillum contains two ORNs: pb1 contains pb1A and pb1B; pb2 contains pb2A and pb2B; pb3 contains pb3A and pb3B. The odor response profile of each ORN has been defined and a receptor-to-neuron map has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b021">21</xref>]. Seven <italic>Or</italic> genes are expressed in the maxillary palp, with two genes coexpressed in the pb2A neuron.</p>
      <p>We systematically identified novel regulatory elements that dictate the proper expression of the maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes in the correct ORNs, that is, elements that underlie the receptor-to-neuron map. These elements were identified by using a phylogenetic approach, much as the H element was identified through a comparison of two species. We compared the regulatory regions of orthologs from two <italic>Drosophila</italic> species whose genomes have been sequenced, and we identified elements that are evolutionarily conserved and that are specific to individual maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes. Analysis of these elements across all 12 sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes identified six that are conserved particularly highly. Functional analysis of these six elements reveals that some act positively to express individual <italic>Or</italic> genes in a subset of ORNs, and some act negatively to restrict the expression of individual <italic>Or</italic> genes to a single ORN class. Repression can be mediated via upstream or downstream regions, and in one case is mediated by the transcription factor Scalloped. Some elements are also used in other chemosensory organs, and some are conserved upstream of genes required for ORN axon targeting, sorting, and guidance.</p>
      <p>Taken together, the data support a model in which the receptor-to-neuron map is constructed via a system of molecular zip codes. <italic>Or</italic> genes contain three classes of regulatory elements: elements that specify expression in the correct organ, positive elements that activate <italic>Or</italic> genes in a subset of ORN classes within an organ, and negative elements that restrict expression to a unique ORN class within that organ. We propose that the concerted action of these three classes of elements thus solves a formidable biological regulatory problem. We carried out a functional analysis of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> maxillary palp. Surprisingly, we found a remarkable degree of conservation in the response spectra of the ORNs over tens of millions of years of evolution. The receptor-to-neuron map is also conserved.</p>

        <title>Spatial Overlap of ORN Classes in the Maxillary Palp</title>
        <p>We examined the spatial organization of ORN classes in the maxillary palp. First, an anti-Elav antibody was used to illustrate the distribution of the entire population of ORN nuclei of the maxillary palp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Second, we carried out a multiple-label experiment to differentially mark ORNs of the three types of sensilla: ORNs of the pb1A class were labeled in green, pb2B in yellow, and pb3A in red. The three classes of ORNs show extensive spatial overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). These results are consistent with the intermingling of sensillum types that are observed when recordings are taken from sensillar shafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b012">12</xref>]. The spatial overlap of ORN nuclei indicates that the identity of an ORN and, by extension, its choice of a receptor gene, are not dictated solely by its spatial position in a field.</p>

        <title>Identification of Conserved, Gene-Specific Elements</title>
        <p>We previously compared the upstream regions of the two <italic>Or</italic> genes coexpressed in pb2A to identify regulatory sequences shared by these two genes, but not by any other maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b023">23</xref>]. To identify upstream regulatory elements for the other five maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes, we used a different strategy based on phylogenetic analysis.</p>
        <p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> diverged tens of millions of years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b024">24</xref>] and contain orthologous receptor genes. We examined the upstream regions of orthologous <italic>Or</italic> genes for conserved elements shared by the members of each orthologous pair, but not by any of the other maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes. Accordingly, we identified all conserved upstream sequences greater than 6 base pairs (bp) in length for each pair of orthologs using DOT-PLOT analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), and from these conserved elements we selected those that were specific to each gene. The analysis was focused on the 500 bp that are upstream of the translational start site, because in a previous study, this extent of DNA was sufficient to confer faithful expression to a <italic>GAL4</italic> reporter gene in the case of each of two maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes analyzed in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b023">23</xref>]. One pair of orthologs, <italic>Or85d</italic> and its <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> counterpart, was exceptionally well-conserved in the 500-bp upstream region, showing 80% identity. To identify discrete conserved elements within the region upstream of <italic>Or85d</italic>, we expanded our analysis to include a more divergent species, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. virilis</named-content>.</p>
        <p>Conserved, gene-specific elements were identified for each of the five <italic>Or</italic> genes analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). The number of such elements varies: <italic>Or59c</italic> contains one, whereas <italic>Or42a</italic> contains six. In the special case of <italic>Or85d</italic>, two elements are shared by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. virilis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> upstream of <italic>Or85d</italic>, but are not found upstream of any other maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> gene.</p>
        <p>To identify the best candidate for a regulatory element for each of these receptor genes, we used a powerful bioinformatic approach that takes advantage of the recent sequencing of the genomes of ten other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species: <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. simulans</named-content>, <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, <italic>D. erecta</italic>, <italic>D. ananassae</italic>, <italic>D. persimilis</italic>, <italic>D. willistoni</italic>, <italic>D. virilis</italic>, <italic>D. mojavensis</italic>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. grimshawi</named-content>. The upstream regulatory regions of the orthologous receptor genes from all 12 species were aligned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B) using the genome browser at the University of California Santa Cruz, and each of the elements was mapped onto the alignment. Using this approach, we were able to identify the gene-specific element with the highest sequence conservation for each of the receptor genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figures 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg001">Figure S1</xref>); in the case of <italic>Or42a</italic>, two elements were nearly identical in their extent of conservation, and we have analyzed both.</p>

        <p>To determine whether the evolutionarily conserved, gene-specific elements have a regulatory function, we tested them in vivo using two complementary approaches, one based on a loss of function and one on a gain of function. For each gene, we analyzed the element with the highest sequence conservation. We did not analyze <italic>Or85d</italic> elements because we lacked a faithful <italic>Or85d</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> driver.</p>
        <p><italic>Or46a</italic> is expressed in the pb2B neuron, and its upstream region contains two conserved, gene-specific elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). One of these elements, 46a1, is more highly conserved. It is 10 bp long, its sequence shows 93% identity across the 12 species, and its position is conserved. A 1.9-kb region of DNA upstream of <italic>Or46a</italic> drives faithful expression of a <italic>GAL4</italic> reporter in pb2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b021">21</xref>]). However, when the 46a1 element is mutated, the 1.9-kb region no longer drives expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). In most cases, no cells are labeled; in rare cases, a single ORN is labeled (<italic>n</italic> = 0.52 ± 0.24 cells/maxillary palp; <italic>n</italic> = 8 independent lines examined; <italic>n</italic> &gt; 10 maxillary palps examined per line). The simplest interpretation of these results is that the 46a1 element is necessary for <italic>Or46a</italic> expression in pb2B.</p>

        <p>We then asked whether the 46a1 element can drive expression in the context of a minimal promoter. We placed four copies of 46a1 upstream of a TATA box and found that this small construct can in fact drive expression in maxillary palp cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Many, if not all, of the cells could be identified as ORNs, because they contain dendrites and axons; their identity is considered further below. Expression from this artificial promoter could also be detected in a small subset of neurons in the main gustatory organ, the labellum (unpublished data).</p>
        <p><italic>Or71a</italic> is expressed in pb1B. Its upstream region contains multiple gene-specific elements, of which the longest and best conserved is 71a3, consisting of 16 bp and showing 97% sequence identity. This element was tested in the context of the <italic>Or71a</italic> 5′ + 3′ construct, which contains sequences both upstream and downstream of <italic>Or71a</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b021">21</xref>]. This construct drives faithful expression of <italic>GAL4</italic> when the 71a3 element is intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b021">21</xref>]), but not when it is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>E; <italic>n</italic> = 0.25 ± 0.1 cells/maxillary palp; <italic>n</italic> = 8 independent lines examined; <italic>n</italic> &gt; 20 maxillary palps examined per line). When multiple copies of 71a3 were placed upstream of a TATA box, the construct drove <italic>GAL4</italic> expression in maxillary palp cells that can be identified as ORNs by virtue of their dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Low levels of expression could also be detected in a small subset of cells in the labellum (unpublished data).</p>
        <p><italic>Or59c</italic> is expressed in pb3A, and its upstream region contains a single gene-specific conserved element, 59c1, which is 11 bp long and shows 97% sequence identity across nine species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>G); the region containing the 59c1 sequences could not be identified in three of the most distantly related species, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. virilis</named-content>, <italic>D. mojavensis</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. grimshawi</named-content>. We have tested its function by placing multiple copies upstream of a TATA box and found that this minimal promoter drove robust expression of GAL4 in the maxillary palp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>H). Expression was not detected in the labellum.</p>

        <title>Dependence of Neuron-Specific Elements on the POU Transcription Factor Acj6</title>
        <p>Earlier studies have shown that the expression of a subset of the maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes requires the POU domain transcription factor Acj6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b025">25</xref>], which is expressed in all ORNs of the maxillary palp [46]. Acj6 also controls axon targeting specificity of a subset of maxillary palp ORNs . The 46a1, 71a3, and 59c1 elements do not contain predicted Acj6 binding sites (Bai L, Carlson JR, unpublished results), and the transcription factors that act on these sequences are unknown. To test whether the factors that act on these neuron-specific elements are dependent on <italic>acj6</italic>, we examined the expression of the minimal promoter constructs in an <italic>acj6<sup>6</sup></italic> background.</p>
        <p>In the <italic>acj6<sup>6</sup></italic> mutant, although the expression of the <italic>Or46a-GAL4 driver</italic> is lost, which is consistent with the loss of <italic>Or46a</italic> mRNA observed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b013">13</xref>], the expression of the 46a1 minimal promoter construct is still strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">2</xref>J). These results suggest that the factors that direct expression from the 46a1 motif are independent of <italic>acj6</italic> for their expression and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>K). An alternative possibility is that another transcription factor can compensate for the loss of <italic>acj6</italic>.</p>
        <p>Expression of the <italic>Or71a-GAL4</italic> driver can be detected in <italic>acj6</italic>, and the expression of the 71a3 minimal promoter construct can also be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>L and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">2</xref>M). These results suggest that the factors binding to 71a3 do not require <italic>acj6</italic> for their expression or function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>N).</p>
        <p>In the case of <italic>Or59c</italic>, we find that <italic>acj6</italic> is required both for expression of the gene and for the minimal promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>O and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">2</xref>P). These results suggest that <italic>acj6</italic> is required directly or indirectly for the expression of the 59c1 binding factor or for its function at the 59c1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>Q).</p>

        <title>A Gene-Specific Element That Represses <italic>Or</italic> Expression</title>
        <p><italic>Or42a</italic> is expressed in pb1A, and 4.1 kb of upstream DNA drives faithful expression of GAL4 in maxillary palp ORNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b021">21</xref>]. Two elements are nearly identical in their high conservation: 42a4 (98%) and 42a6 (98%), and we tested the function of both elements in vivo. 42a6 maps only three bp from 42a5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). We constructed a small deletion that eliminates both 42a6 and 42a5 elements, and we found no effect on <italic>Or42a</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> expression (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>The longer of the two most highly conserved elements at <italic>Or42a</italic>, 42a4, contains an inverted repeat: <underline>AGTGTAAA</underline>AG<underline>TTTACACT</underline>T. We were surprised to find that mutation of this element led to a 2-fold increase in the number of labeled maxillary palp cells, from 18.2 ± 1.8 (<italic>n</italic> = 9 maxillary palps) to 33.2 ± 3.7 (<italic>n</italic> = 9 maxillary palps quantified from two independent lines; <italic>n</italic> = 8 independent lines examined, <italic>n</italic> &gt; 20 maxillary palps examined/line) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g003">Figure 3</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g003">3</xref>C). The simplest interpretation of this result is that 42a4 is a negative regulatory element that represses <italic>Or42a</italic> in a subset of ORNs. To test this interpretation, we first carried out a double-label experiment using probes for the endogenous <italic>Or42a</italic> mRNA and for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) that is driven by the mutant promoter via GAL4. We found that all <italic>Or42a<sup>+</sup></italic> cells express GFP, but that GFP is also expressed in an additional subset of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g003">Figure 3</xref>D).</p>

        <p>To identify the cells that ectopically express GFP, we undertook a series of additional double-label experiments. We found that the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells do not express <italic>Or59c</italic> mRNA, indicating that they are not pb3A neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g003">Figure 3</xref>E; 0% of the GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons are <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>n</italic> = 8 maxillary palps); nor are they paired with cells that express <italic>Or59c</italic> mRNA, indicating that they are not pb3B neurons. In another experiment, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells did not label with an <italic>Or33c</italic> probe (only 3% of the GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons appear <italic>Or33c<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>n</italic> = 8 maxillary palps), indicating that they are not pb2A neurons; however, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were often found paired with <italic>Or33c<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (arrowheads), indicating that many GFP<sup>+</sup> cells are pb2B neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). The identity of these GFP<sup>+</sup> cells as pb2B neurons was confirmed directly in another double-label experiment using a probe for <italic>Or46a</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g003">Figure 3</xref>G; 94% of the cells labeled with <italic>Or46a</italic> mRNA were GFP<sup>+</sup>; this value is the mean of values determined from <italic>n</italic> = 8 maxillary palps).</p>
        <p>The simplest interpretation of these results is that positive regulatory elements in the <italic>Or42a</italic> upstream region are capable of driving expression not only in the pb1A neuron but also in the pb2B neuron. The 42a4 element represses expression in pb2B neurons, thereby restricting expression to a single ORN class, pb1A.</p>

        <title>Reciprocal Control of <italic>Or42a</italic> and <italic>Or46a</italic></title>
        <p>The ectopic expression of an <italic>Or42a</italic> promoter in <italic>Or46a<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons suggested a relationship between these two genes. Further evidence for a relationship came from analysis of the minimal promoter containing multiple copies of 46a1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This promoter drove GFP expression in more ORNs than could be accounted for by <italic>Or46a<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons alone. A double-label experiment showed that while most of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells are in fact <italic>Or46a<sup>+</sup></italic>, some are <italic>Or42a<sup>+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g003">Figure 3</xref>H).</p>
        <p>The reciprocal relationship between <italic>Or42a</italic> and <italic>Or46a</italic> misexpression suggests that <italic>Or42a</italic> may contain an unidentified positive regulatory element, 42ax, that is similar in sequence to 46a1, with both sites able to bind a transcription factor present in both pb1A and pb2B. To test this interpretation, we examined the 500 bp upstream region of <italic>Or42a</italic> for an element similar, but not identical, to 46a1 (GACATTTTAA). We identified a sequence, T<underline>A</underline>T<underline>ATTTTAA</underline>, identical to 46a1 at the 8 underlined positions, at −455 bp. Moreover, these two sequences share an ATTTTA core, which has been shown to function as a binding site for basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors at other loci. TATATTTTAA is not found upstream of any other maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes. This 42ax sequence is conserved in sequence (80% identity) and location in seven of the 12 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. It will be interesting to identify the transcription factor that binds 46a1 and then test directly its binding to 42ax.</p>

        <title>Expression of <italic>Or59c</italic> Is Refined by Repression via Downstream Sequences</title>
        <p>When DNA upstream of <italic>Or59c</italic> was fused to <italic>GAL4</italic>, expression of the reporter GFP was not faithful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g004">Figure 4</xref>A; <italic>n</italic> = 5 independent lines); the same result was obtained when upstream regions of varying lengths were used (either 2.1 kb, which extends to the next upstream gene, or 5.2 kb, which includes upstream coding sequences). Double-label experiments using an <italic>Or59c</italic> probe revealed misexpression in many <italic>Or59c<sup>–</sup></italic> cells; moreover, many <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup></italic> cells did not express GFP. Some of the misexpressing cells are the neighboring pb3B neurons, which can be seen to be paired with <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup></italic> pb3A cells (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g004">Figure 4</xref>A; 75% of the cells neighboring the <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup></italic> cells were GFP<sup>+</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 9 palps). To identify the other ORNs that ectopically express the <italic>Or59c-GAL4</italic> construct, we carried out double-label experiments with other <italic>Or</italic> genes.

        <p>Because neither of the varying lengths of upstream DNA sequences were sufficient to restrict <italic>GAL4</italic> expression to the <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, we added 3′ sequences to the construct. Initially, 500 bp of DNA taken directly from the region immediately downstream from the <italic>Or59c</italic> stop codon was added downstream of the <italic>GAL4</italic> coding region. Between the downstream sequences of <italic>Or59c</italic> and the <italic>GAL4</italic> coding region was the <italic>Hsp70</italic> 3′ untranslated region (UTR), which is present in the <italic>GAL4</italic> vector and which is often present in promoter-<italic>GAL4</italic> analysis.</p>
        <p>This <italic>Or59c</italic> 5′ + 3′ construct showed much less misexpression in <italic>Or59c</italic><sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). The total number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells declined from 49.7 ± 1.3 to 27.3 ± 2.1 (SEM; <italic>n</italic> = 10 in each case). However, some misexpression remained, and only 62% of the <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons were GFP<sup>+</sup>. We then removed the <italic>Hsp70</italic> 3′ UTR sequences, such that the <italic>Or59c</italic> downstream sequences were in close proximity to the 3′ end of the <italic>GAL4</italic> coding region and the <italic>Or59c</italic> 3′ UTR is used. This construct drove faithful expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g004">Figure 4</xref>E; <italic>n</italic> = 8 independent lines examined). Thus, there is a negative regulatory element downstream of <italic>Or59c</italic> that restricts expression of this gene to pb3A neurons, and either there is a requirement that the native 3′ UTR be used, or else there is a regulatory factor that acts on this element in a context-dependent fashion in order to achieve this negative regulation. We note with interest that the inclusion of the downstream sequences, without the Hsp70 sequences, also drove expression in <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons that had previously failed to express the reporter, suggesting that the downstream sequences are required for positive as well as negative regulation of <italic>Or59c</italic>.</p>

        <p>To test whether <italic>sd</italic> represses <italic>Or59c</italic>, we carried out in situ hybridizations to the maxillary palp of a hypomorphic <italic>sd</italic> mutant, <italic>sd<sup>1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). We found a 40% increase in the number of <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). By contrast, there was no increase in the number of <italic>Or42a</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g005">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g005">5</xref>E). There was, however, an increase in the number of <italic>Or85d<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, and we note with interest that there is another type of Sd binding site, TAAAATTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b026">26</xref>], 737 bp downstream from the stop codon of <italic>Or85d</italic>.</p>
        <p>The <italic>Or59c-GAL4</italic> construct that contains only upstream sequences, <italic>Or59c</italic> 5′, misexpresses in two ORN classes, the neighboring pb3B cell (<italic>Or85d<sup>+</sup></italic>) and pb1A (<italic>Or42a<sup>+</sup></italic>), as shown above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g004">Figure 4</xref>. We asked whether <italic>sd</italic> is expressed in these two ORN classes. Using an <italic>Or59c</italic> probe, which labels the pb3A cell, we found that <italic>sd</italic> is in fact expressed in neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g005">Figure 5</xref>F), but not in pb1A cells, which express <italic>Or42a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g005">Figure 5</xref>G). These results suggest that Sd may repress the <italic>Or59c</italic> gene in pb3B. If so, we would expect that in an <italic>sd</italic> mutant, we would observe cells that coexpress <italic>Or59c</italic> and <italic>Or85d</italic>. We tested this possibility by carrying out double-label in situ hybridizations in two different hypomorphic alleles of <italic>sd</italic>, <italic>sd<sup>1</sup></italic>, and <italic>sd<sup>SG29.1</sup></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b028">28</xref>]. In both alleles, we found <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup> Or85d<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g005">Figure 5</xref>H), but not <italic>Or59c<sup>+</sup> Or42a<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (unpublished data). Thus repression of <italic>Or59c</italic> in the neighboring pb3B cell requires both a Sd binding site and Sd.</p>
        <p>Since Sd represses <italic>Or59c</italic> in pb3B, why doesn't Sd also repress <italic>Or85d</italic> in pb3B, given that both <italic>Or</italic> genes have Sd binding sites? The simplest explanation is that the two Sd binding sites are distinct. There are several potential interacting partners with which Sd may interact to form a functional transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b029">29</xref>], and the pb3B cell may contain a partner necessary for repression at the <italic>Or59c</italic> binding site but not a partner necessary for repression at the <italic>Or85d</italic> binding site. If a faithful <italic>Or85d-GAL4</italic> construct becomes available, it will be interesting to replace the <italic>Or85d</italic>-type Sd binding site with the <italic>Or59c</italic>-type Sd binding site, to determine whether the <italic>Or59c</italic>-type site confers repression in the pb3B cell.</p>
        <p>We note that <italic>Or85d</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> constructs containing only the 5′ regions of <italic>Or85d</italic>, which lack the Sd binding site, drive misexpression in a number of non-neuronal cells of the maxillary palp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). Most of the labeled cells lack dendrites and axons, and when labeled with a membrane-bound GFP, as opposed to with RNA probes that label the cell bodies, these cells appear larger than ORNs. These results suggest that Sd may interact with a binding partner in non-neuronal cells to repress <italic>Or85d</italic> expression in these cells.</p>

A mutation that affects both 42a6 and 42a5, which did not affect expression in the maxillary palp, had no effect on expression in these other organs. However, mutation of 42a4, which relieved repression of <italic>Or42a</italic> in other maxillary palp ORNs, also relieved repression of <italic>Or42a-GAL4</italic> in the larval olfactory organs and the labellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g006">Figure 6</xref>B): in both cases supernumerary neurons were labeled.

        <title>The Response Spectra and Organization of Maxillary Palp ORNs Have Been Conserved for Tens of Millions of Years</title>
        <p>In this study we have identified and functionally characterized a number of regulatory elements that operate in directing the formation of the receptor-to-neuron map of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>. Because the newly defined elements we have analyzed here are conserved in sequence and position among <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, we predicted that the programmed regulation leading to the formation of receptor-to-neuron maps would be conserved as well. To test this prediction, we carried out a physiological analysis of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> maxillary palp. Although each of the seven <italic>Or</italic> genes expressed in the maxillary palp has an ortholog expressed in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> maxillary palp ( as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b021">21</xref>] and unpublished data), we expected that their odor response profiles would have diverged a great deal over the course of tens of millions of years. We did not know a priori whether we would be able to correlate <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> ORNs with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> counterparts.</p>
        <p>We were surprised to find that the profiles of the maxillary palp ORNs are remarkably well conserved between these two species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Despite the tens of millions of years of separation, each ORN class in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> has a counterpart in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content>, and their responses to a panel of ten diverse odorants are strikingly similar. Not only are the magnitudes of the responses well conserved, but the modes of the responses, i.e., excitation versus inhibition, are conserved. For example, both the pb2B ORN of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and its <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> counterpart are excited by 4-methyl phenol and inhibited by 3-octanol. The orthologous receptors show amino acid identity as low as 59% in the case of Or71a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), and in no case exceeded 84%, the identity determined for Or42a. Thus pb1B in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>, which expresses Or71a, shows the same specificity for 4-methyl phenol and 4-propyl phenol as the corresponding ORN in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content>, although Or71a is only 59% identical between the two species.</p>

        <p>Given the success in identifying gene-specific elements required for the expression of individual <italic>Or</italic> genes in individual classes of ORNs, we asked whether the same approach could be used to identify sensillum-specific elements required uniquely by the <italic>Or</italic> genes that are expressed in the neighboring ORNs of a common sensillum.

Furthermore, expression was not affected by mutation of the more proximal of the two copies of this element in the <italic>Or71a</italic> upstream region (unpublished data).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have analyzed the problem of how individual ORNs select which receptor genes to express, a fundamental problem that underlies all odor coding. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the foundation of olfactory perception is a stereotyped receptor-to-neuron map. The developmental process by which this map is constructed has been examined here using an analysis of evolutionary conservation as a point of departure.</p>
      <p>We identified conserved, gene-specific elements flanking five maxillary palp receptor genes. Functional analysis of the six most highly conserved elements confirmed that elements upstream of four of these genes act either positively or negatively in gene regulation, thereby validating the experimental approach. Two elements did not appear to be required for normal gene regulation; however, it is possible that they act in a redundant fashion or that they mediate a response to such epigenetic factors as feeding status, mating status, or circadian rhythm, which we did not examine.</p>
      <p>The elements varied in length from 7 to 19 bp; some of the longer ones could be composite sites that bind more than one factor. Several of the sites contain AT-rich cores, reminiscent of binding sites for certain classes of transcription factors including POU domain proteins. One element, 42a4, contains two iterations of an octamer, in an inverted repeat. Two elements, 46a1 and 71a3, overlap with a Dyad-1 element, CTA(N)<sub>9</sub>TAA, a positive regulatory element that is required for normal maxillary palp expression and that is found upstream of all of these maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b023">23</xref>]. The close juxtaposition of regulatory elements suggests an interaction among the regulatory proteins that they bind.</p>
      <p>Our strategy for identifying these elements required that each be specific to a single maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> gene. The identification of these elements reveals that each gene contains at least one unique element that is not shared with any other maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes. This need not have been the case: the system could alternatively have been composed entirely of nonunique regulatory elements, each shared by multiple genes, but in unique combinations. In any case, in the maxillary palp the combinatorial code of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements appears to include both unique and shared elements (e.g., Dyad-1).</p>
      <p>The regulatory elements and the logic by which they operate are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g008">Figure 8</xref>. Positive regulatory elements direct expression in subsets of maxillary palp ORNs. Negative regulatory elements restrict this expression to a single ORN class. Overall, the correct expression pattern is determined by the interplay of positive and negative elements.</p>

          <p>Conserved gene-specific regulatory elements, the genes that contain them, and the maxillary palp ORNs in which the genes are expressed, are depicted. Green elements are positive regulatory elements; red, pink, and orange elements are negative. Solid green arrows connect genes to the ORNs in which they are expressed in wild-type. These arrows originate from regulatory elements in cases where the elements have been shown to act positively, but do not imply that such elements alone are capable of directing proper expression. By contrast, 42ax has not been tested functionally and its arrow does not originate from this element. Dashed green arrows indicate ectopic expression driven by the indicated elements in the context of a minimal promoter, expression that in wild-type is repressed through the agency of other indicated elements, as represented by the curved red, pink, and orange lines. The pink and orange elements and their positions in <italic>Or46a</italic> and <italic>Or59c</italic>, respectively, have not been defined. The prefix “pb” has been deleted from the ORN designations. In the ORNs are ovals representing predicted transcription factors, color-coded according to the elements upon which they are presumed to act. For simplicity, a single factor (dark green; left column, second row), expressed in pb1A, pb3A, and pb3B, is proposed to act on 59c1, and a single factor (light green; left column, top row) expressed in both pb2B and pb1A is proposed to act on 46a1; more complicated models in which these elements are acted upon by multiple factors are also possible. Promoters are not drawn to scale. AMC, antenno-maxillary complex, which contains the dorsal organs.</p>

      <p>The negative regulation we have observed is highly specific. When the 42a4 element was ablated, <italic>Or42a</italic> misexpression was observed specifically in pb2B. One possible interpretation is that pb2B and pb1A, the cell that normally expresses <italic>Or42a</italic>, share a positively acting transcription factor that other ORNs lack. Thus the two ORNs with contexts that are permissive for <italic>Or42a</italic> expression are not neighboring ORNs that share a sensillum, but ORNs in different sensilla, with very different odor response profiles. Reciprocally, a positively acting element upstream of <italic>Or46a</italic>, which is expressed in pb2B, drives expression not only in pb2B but also in pb1A. This connection between pb1A and pb2B suggests a developmental relationship that remains to be defined in mechanistic terms.</p>
      <p>This study has concentrated on receptor gene choice in the maxillary palp, on account of its numerical simplicity. Does a system of molecular zip codes also underlie the process of receptor gene choice across the entire odor receptor repertoire? In addition to the seven maxillary palp receptors, the <italic>Or</italic> gene family contains 53 other members expressed in the antenna or the larval olfactory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b032">32</xref>]. Using a comparative bioinformatic approach, we performed a large-scale analysis of sequence conservation in the 500 bp upstream of each of 42 <italic>Or</italic> genes across all 12 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-se001">Text S1</xref>).<bold> </bold> We found great diversity in the number, lengths, and distribution of highly conserved upstream regions. Within the most highly conserved of these regions we identified a variety of elements that are shared among subsets of <italic>Or</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg006">Figure S6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg006">S6</xref>B). This analysis, then, reveals a combinatorial structure to the organization of shared elements upstream of these receptor genes. This pattern supports a model in which a combinatorial code of positive and negative regulatory elements dictates the proper expression of each <italic>Or</italic> gene.</p>
      <p>What kind of proteins accomplish this regulation? In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>, several kinds of transcription factors have been elegantly shown to play roles in specifying ORN identity and receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b033">33</xref>]. In the mouse, a LIM-homeodomain protein, Lhx2, is required for normal ORN differentiation and expression of OR genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b035">35</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the POU domain protein Acj6 is required for the expression of a subset of <italic>Or</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b036">36</xref>]. We have also shown that Sd, a TEA domain-containing transcription factor, is critical in restricting the expression of some <italic>Or</italic> genes to their proper ORNs. Sd has been shown to act as a repressor in other systems and in fact is required for normal taste behavior in both larvae and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b037">37</xref>]. Another aspect of receptor gene choice depends on proteins of the Notch pathway: receptor choice in neighboring ORNs of a sensillum appears to be coordinated via asymmetric segregation of regulatory factors from a common progenitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b038">38</xref>].</p>
      <p>Some elements that are essential to odor receptor gene choice are also located upstream of genes required for axon guidance and sorting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-sg007">Figure S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060125-se001">Text S1</xref>). The presence and positions of these elements have been conserved for tens of millions of years of evolution. The presence of <italic>Or</italic> regulatory elements upstream of ORN axon-guidance genes could reflect a relationship between receptor gene choice and axon targeting. In addition to selecting particular <italic>Or</italic> genes for expression, ORNs send axons to particular glomeruli in the antennal lobe of the brain. ORNs that express the same <italic>Or</italic> gene send axons to the same glomerulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b019">19</xref>]. Thus the olfactory system contains both a stereotyped receptor-to-neuron map and a stereotyped connectivity map in the antennal lobes. The tight coordination between receptor gene choice and axonal projection could in principle arise in part from overlap in the mechanisms underlying these processes. In mammals, odor receptors play a role in ORN targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b041">41</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ORN targeting does not require the receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b020">20</xref>], but could require the regulatory apparatus used to express the receptors. Acj6 provides an example of a link between the two processes: it acts both in receptor expression and ORN axon targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g002">Figure 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b025">25</xref>]. Moreover, we have found that Acj6 is required for the activity of one of the regulatory elements identified here.</p>
      <p>We found a remarkable similarity of function between the maxillary palp ORNs of two species that diverged more than tens of millions of years ago. We had expected that over this time interval, the odor specificities of the ORNs would have diverged markedly to serve differing needs of the two evolving species. Instead, every ORN class showed strikingly similar responses, with few exceptions. The results show that two odor receptors can differ a great deal in amino acid sequence and still exhibit a very similar odor specificity.</p>
      <p>The organization of the organ in the two species is also identical, in that corresponding ORNs are combined according to the same pairing rules. This high degree of conservation suggests a critical role for the maxillary palp in odor coding and in the generation of olfactory-driven behavior. The conservation of regulatory elements and organization also suggests that the two species use common mechanisms to specify the receptor-to-neuron map.</p>
      <p>The regulatory challenge confronted by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system represents an extreme among problems of gene regulation. It requires the storage and deployment of a great deal of information. Our data support a model in which <italic>Or</italic> gene expression is controlled by a system of molecular zip codes. Each <italic>Or</italic> gene contains elements that dictate expression in the proper olfactory organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b023">23</xref>], positive regulatory elements that specify expression in a subset of ORN classes, and negative regulatory elements that restrict expression to a single ORN class. This logic and the components that execute it have solved such a challenging problem with such efficiency that they have apparently been well conserved for tens of millions of years.</p>

        <p>To identify gene-specific conserved sequences in the upstream maxillary palp <italic>Or</italic> genes, we used ClustalW alignments and DOT-PLOT analysis (MacVector ). To map identified <italic>cis-</italic>elements to sequences and identify overrepresented motifs, the DNA-PATTERN (STRINGS) and OLIGO-ANALYSIS programs were used at the RSA tools website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/rsat/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/rsat/</ext-link>). For the identification of conserved sequences the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome browser at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link> was used. A multiple alignment was constructed using MULTIZ from the best-in-genome pairwise alignments generated by BLASTZ. Large-scale predictions of conserved elements were obtained from the multiple alignments using the PhastCons program with the most-conserved option. Shared elements were identified using the OLIGO-ANALYSIS program at the RSA tools website.</p>

        <title>Mutant promoter constructs.</title>
        <p>The wild-type <italic>Or42a</italic> 4.1-kb promoter-<italic>GAL4</italic> construct has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b021">21</xref>]. In (42a4)-<italic>GAL4</italic>, the 42a4 element, which contains an inverted repeat (<underline>AGTGTAAA</underline>NN<underline>TTTACACT</underline>), was mutated to (AGTG–––TTT<italic>GGATCC</italic>), resulting in a deletion within the first half-element and the substitution of a <italic>BamHI</italic> recognition sequence in the second half-element (italicized). This was accomplished by PCR amplification of two promoter fragments, one terminating immediately upstream of the TAAA in the first octamer of the 42a4 element, and the second wasa fragment extending from immediately downstream of this element to the start codon of <italic>Or42a</italic>. Primers for these PCR reactions contained the <italic>BamHI</italic> restriction site in place of ACACTT. The PCR products were AT-cloned into pGEM-T Easy. Subsequent ligation of the two PCR fragments resulted in the desired replacement in the context of the <italic>Or42a</italic> 4.1-kb promoter-transgene.</p>
        <p>In the (42a5+6)-<italic>GAL4</italic> construct a small deletion was designed to delete both the 42a5 and the 42a6 elements, which are separated by 3 bp (<underline>TGTGAAC</underline>GAT<underline>TGCAGCCTG</underline>). This was achieved by using a similar approach as for 42a(4)-<italic>GAL4</italic>, but in this case the two primers, containing <italic>BamHI</italic> sites at their ends, were designed to start immediately upstream of 42a6 and immediately downstream of 42a5. Ligation of the appropriate fragments led to the replacement of the entire 19-bp region, comprising the two elements, by a <italic>BamHI</italic> site.</p>
        <p>In the (46a1)-<italic>GAL4</italic> construct the 46a1 element (GACATTTTAA) was mutated by replacing the first six bases with a <italic>BamHI</italic> restriction site. This was achieved using a PCR cloning strategy similar to the ones described for the <italic>Or42a</italic> constructs.</p>
        <p>In the (71a3)-<italic>GAL4</italic> construct the 71a3 element (TGAATTTTAATTGAAA) was mutated to (GCTAGCTTAATTGAAA) by replacing the first six bases with a <italic>NheI</italic> restriction site using a PCR cloning strategy similar to the one described earlier, resulting in the desired mutation in the context of the <italic>Or71a</italic> 5′ + 3′-<italic>GAL4</italic> construct.</p>
        <p>We note that 46a1 and 71a3 each overlaps with a Dyad-1 motif, CTA(N)<sub>9</sub>TAA, a positive regulatory element that is required for expression of <italic>Or</italic> genes in the maxillary palp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b023">23</xref>]; the mutations of 46a1 and 71a3 were designed so as not to affect the Dyad-1 motif.</p>
        <p>The <italic>Or59c</italic> 2.1-kb promoter-<italic>GAL4</italic> construct has been described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b021">21</xref>] and has been shown to express in a large number of non-endogenous cells in the palp. The <italic>Or59c</italic> 5′ + 3′-<italic>GAL4</italic> was constructed by cloning a 0.5-kb fragment of DNA that lies immediately downstream of the <italic>Or59c</italic> stop codon into the <italic>SpeI/BamHI</italic> site that is positioned downstream of the <italic>GAL4</italic>-hsp70 3′ UTR in pG4PN. The 0.5-kb fragment was PCR-amplified from Canton-S genomic DNA with primers designed to add a <italic>Spe1</italic> site to the 5′ end and a <italic>BamHI</italic> site to the 3′end.</p>
        <p>The <italic>Or59c</italic> (5′ + 3′ direct)-<italic>GAL4</italic> construct was made in several steps. First the 0.5-kb fragment of DNA immediately downstream of the <italic>Or59c</italic> stop codon, described above, was cloned into the <italic>BamHI/Spe1</italic> site of pSK+ to generate plasmid pSK3'. Second, the <italic>GAL4</italic> coding region was cloned as a <italic>HindIII</italic> fragment into pSK3' to yield pSKGAL4. The <italic>Or59c</italic> 5′ region was excised from the <italic>Or59c</italic> 2.1kb-<italic>GAL4</italic> vector using <italic>KpnI/NotI</italic>(blunted) and it was <italic>KpnI</italic>/blunt cloned into the <italic>Kpn1/Apa1</italic>(blunted) site of the pSKGAL4 plasmid. Finally the <italic>KpnI</italic>/<italic>SpeI</italic> fragment from this plasmid was ligated with the <italic>KpnI/SpeI</italic> fragment of pG4PN to yield <italic>Or59c</italic> complex-<italic>GAL4.</italic></p>

        <title>Minimal promoter constructs.</title>
        <p>Complementary pairs of oligonucleotides were designed such that upon annealing, they would yield a double-stranded DNA fragment that includes multiple copies of the corresponding conserved elements and overhangs on either side for EcoR1 restriction enzyme sites. These fragments were cloned directly into the EcoR1 site of the <italic>pPTGAL Drosophila</italic> transformation vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b042">42</xref>].

We note that the constructs for 46a1 and 71a3 contain Dyad-1 motifs, but these motifs are not sufficient to drive expression in the maxillary palp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b023">23</xref>]. The underlined sequences indicate the gene-specific elements, and the italicized sequences indicate the Dyad-1 sequences.

        <p>In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical localization were performed as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b021">21</xref>]. Mouse anti-βGAL antibody (1:1000), and rabbit anti-GFP (1:250) were obtained from Promega.</p>
        <p>To generate a high-resolution map of the nuclei of the three sensilla types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), (<italic>42a4</italic>)<italic>-GAL4/UAS-GFP</italic>; <italic>UAS-GFP/+</italic> was used to label pb1A and pb2B in green, and <italic>Or46a</italic> and <italic>Or59c</italic> in situ hybridization probes were used to label with red the pb2B and pb3A cells, respectively. Thus pb1A was labeled green, pb2B was labeled yellow (red and green); pb3A was labeled red. Confocal Z-stacks consisting of nine optical sections of each palp were analyzed in Photoshop. Positions of the labeled nuclei were manually marked with the corresponding color at each optical plane, and the 9 stacks were compressed to generate a 2-D representation of all the labeled neurons.</p>

For the identification of conserved regions upstream of the 42 antennal and larval <italic>Or</italic> genes, we used a phylogenetic hidden-Markov model program, PhastCons, to automate the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060125-b016">16</xref>]. The 11 species compared to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> are in the same order as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060125-g001">Figure 1</xref>D. Conservation scores are displayed as a “wiggle” histogram where height reflects the magnitude of the score. Grayscale density plots underneath indicate conservation. Double lines in alignment indicate an unalignable sequence, single lines indicate absence of sequence. “+” indicates transcription of a gene is from left to right; “–” indicates right to left. The dark boxes underneath the density plots indicate the positions of the conserved sequences identified by the PhastCons program.

          <p>The <italic>Or</italic> genes showed remarkable variation in the number, lengths, and distribution of these conserved DNA sequences. The number of sequences ranged from 13, in the case of <italic>Or45b</italic>, to none, in the cases of <italic>Or13a</italic>, <italic>Or22b</italic>, <italic>Or43b</italic>, and <italic>Or85a</italic>, with a mean number of 3.7 elements/gene. The lengths of individual sequences identified by this procedure ranged from 186 bp to 9 bp. In some cases, the conserved sequences were primarily located in a single block, as in <italic>Or35a</italic> and <italic>Or69a</italic>, either near (<italic>Or35a</italic>) or far (<italic>Or69a</italic>) from the translation start site; in other cases the conserved sequences were distributed more evenly across the entire 500-bp region, as in the case of <italic>Or56a</italic>. We did not find that highly conserved receptors contain more highly conserved upstream regions than poorly conserved receptors (unpublished data).</p>
