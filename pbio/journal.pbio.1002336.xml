<article-title>To Attract Others, Immune Cells Release a Packet Which Releases a Signal</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) is secreted by chemotactic neutrophils, forming a secondary gradient that amplifies the reach of primary chemoattractants. This strategy increases the recruitment range for neutrophils and is important during inflammation. Here, we show that LTB<sub>4</sub> and its synthesizing enzymes localize to intracellular multivesicular bodies that, upon stimulation, release their content as exosomes. Purified exosomes can activate resting neutrophils and elicit chemotactic activity in a LTB<sub>4</sub> receptor-dependent manner. Inhibition of exosome release leads to loss of directional motility with concomitant loss of LTB<sub>4</sub> release. Our findings establish that the exosomal pool of LTB<sub>4</sub> acts in an autocrine fashion to sensitize neutrophils towards the primary chemoattractant, and in a paracrine fashion to mediate the recruitment of neighboring neutrophils in trans. We envision that this mechanism is used by other signals to foster communication between cells in harsh extracellular environments.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Neutrophils represent the first line of attack against infections and inflammatory insults. The ability of neutrophils to reach these sites, a key feature in the resolution of infections, is mediated by their capacity to sense and migrate directionally to the core of the inflammation site. Chemicals released at the site of inflammation are known as primary attractants. The binding of these attractants to receptors on the surface of neutrophils leads to the secretion of secondary attractants that amplify the reach of primary attractants. We studied the mechanism by which secondary attractants are released from neutrophils. We found that the secretion of a key secondary attractant is mediated in the form of small vesicles called exosomes. These exosomes originate inside the cells, encapsulated in larger vesicles called multivesicular bodies. We purified exosomes from activated neutrophils and show that they contain the machinery to synthesize this secondary attractant and act specifically to elicit neutrophil motility. The inhibition of exosome release leads to a loss of secretion of the secondary attractant as well as a loss in directional motility. Together, our findings provide insight into the mechanisms cells use to protect labile attractants from harsh extracellular environments and communicate directional cues during inflammatory responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells in response to external chemical gradients, is essential to a wide array of biological processes ranging from developmental processes, wound healing, angiogenesis, and immune responses and is implicated in pathological conditions such as chronic inflammatory diseases and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref001">1</xref>]. Upon exposure to endpoint primary chemoattractants, cells secrete secondary chemoattractants that serve to maintain the robustness and sensitivity to the primary chemoattractant signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref002">2</xref>]. Once secreted, these secondary chemoattractants form a gradient to recruit cells that are farther away, thereby dramatically increasing the range and persistence of detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref003">3</xref>]. Intercellular communication through the release of secondary chemoattractants may be homotypic, where the primary and secondary chemoattractant are the same, or it may be heterotypic, where the secondary chemoattractant is different from the primary chemoattractant and is released following stimulation by primary attractants. Homotypic intercellular communication is remarkably exhibited in the social amoebae <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, where collective chemotaxis of cells towards cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is regulated by the release of cAMP and the formation of characteristic chains of cells called streams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref004">4</xref>]. Unlike cAMP in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, the release of the secondary chemoattractants CCL3 and CXCL8 by monocytes and dendritic cells in response to the primary chemoattractant Serum Amyloid A represents an example of heterotypic intercellular communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref005">5</xref>]. This ability of chemotaxing cells to transduce autocrine and paracrine chemical signals in response to primary signals has been termed signal relay.</p>
<p>Heterotypic signal relay occurs in neutrophils migrating towards primary chemoattractant gradients through the release of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref006">6</xref>]. Following stimulation, cytoplasmic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>α translocates to the nuclear envelope, where it is poised to hydrolyze membrane bound lipids to form arachidonic acid (AA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref007">7</xref>]. Simultaneously, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is mobilized to the nuclear envelope where it associates with the 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) and acts on AA to generate leukotriene A<sub>4</sub> (LTA<sub>4</sub>). LTA<sub>4</sub>, by means of LTA<sub>4</sub> hydrolase (LTA<sub>4</sub>H), is finally converted into LTB<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref007">7</xref>], which is then secreted from cells by an unknown mechanism. Initially thought to be released at the site of infection to mediate neutrophil recruitment and proinflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref009">9</xref>], LTB<sub>4</sub> was later shown to be a central secondary chemoattractant in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref010">10</xref>]. More recently, we showed that LTB<sub>4</sub> preferentially mediates neutrophil swarming towards tissue injury sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref011">11</xref>] and established that the secreted LTB<sub>4</sub> in physiological gradients of primary chemoattractants acts as an amplifier of neutrophil chemotaxis and mediates signal relay between migrating neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>In order for secondary chemoattractants to act as bona fide signal relay molecules, they must be released in a form that enables the generation of stable gradients during chemotaxis. It has been established that the release and subsequent diffusion of LTB<sub>4</sub> creates extremely transient gradients due to the small size of the molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref012">12</xref>]. The self-diffusion coefficient of a typical formyl chemoattractant is ~ 10<sup>−5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/sec, which is a log order of magnitude higher than typical unsaturated fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref013">13</xref>]. This implies extremely shallow LTB<sub>4</sub> concentration profiles. Indeed, assessment of the diffusive properties of AA, the structurally similar precursor of LTB<sub>4</sub>, shows shallow and transient gradients compared to a primary chemoattractant such as N-formylMethionyl-Leucyl-Phenylalanine (fMLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref012">12</xref>]. As a plausible mechanism to generate stable secondary gradients, one may argue in favor of a carrier-based mechanism for passive LTB<sub>4</sub> transport, such as binding to serum albumin, and this may indeed be true for systemic transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref014">14</xref>]. This, however, would not account for short-range gradients in migrating cells owing to protracted and uncontrolled LTB<sub>4</sub> release. Moreover, this mechanism would not explain how hydrophobic molecules such as LTB<sub>4</sub> are protected from the aqueous environment of the extracellular milieu.</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which LTB<sub>4</sub> is secreted and how LTB<sub>4</sub> gradients are formed or mediate signal relay of primary chemotactic signals have yet to be determined. However, studies on gradient formation of lipid-modified <italic>Drosophila</italic> morphogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref015">15</xref>], or the formation of palmityolated-Wnt gradients during <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref016">16</xref>] and cAMP gradient propagation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref017">17</xref>], point towards vesicular packaging as an effective way of signal dissemination in the extracellular milieu. In the present study, we investigated whether a similar vesicular packaging of LTB<sub>4</sub> is involved in the creation of a stable gradient during neutrophil chemotaxis. To do so, we assessed whether LTB<sub>4</sub> is secreted though extracellular vesicles (EVs) and if its synthesis and transport involve intracellular vesicular trafficking. Most importantly, we also determined if vesicles released during chemotaxis are indeed capable of mediating the LTB<sub>4</sub>-dependent signal relay response during neutrophil chemotaxis.</p>

<title>5-LO Translocates to CD63 and LAMP1 Positive Fractions upon fMLP Addition</title>
<p>To begin identifying the mechanisms that underlie LTB<sub>4</sub> secretion, we measured LTB<sub>4</sub> content as well as the distribution of 5-LO in resting and activated neutrophils. We fractionated unstimulated and fMLP-stimulated primary human neutrophils using nitrogen cavitation, differential centrifugation, and separation on iodixanol density gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In resting neutrophils, LTB<sub>4</sub> content was primarily low across the different fractions with a small peak observed in fraction 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). On the other hand, in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils, a nonuniform asymmetric increase of LTB<sub>4</sub> levels was observed, where LTB<sub>4</sub> levels were elevated in both low- (fractions 1–5; density ~1.05–1.08 g/ml) and high-density fractions (fractions 10–12; density ~1.17–1.19 g/ml), but not in intermediate density fractions (fraction 6–9; ~1.09–1.11 g/ml) that contained the cis-Golgi markers GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). This fMLP-induced asymmetric partitioning of LTB<sub>4</sub> across different densities was unlike other canonical secretory proteins such as myeloperoxidase (MPO—a marker for the azurophilic granules) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9—a marker for gelatinase granules) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref018">18</xref>], although total MPO and MMP9 levels appeared to increase poststimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These findings suggest that canonical secretory pathways used by MMP9 and MPO are not involved in LTB<sub>4</sub> trafficking. On the other hand, fMLP stimulation did induce the redistribution of the tetraspannin CD63 to higher density fractions. As CD63 is known to traffic between late endosomal and secretory compartments such as multivesicular bodies (MVBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref019">19</xref>], we reasoned that CD63 redistributes to MVBs upon fMLP addition. This was confirmed by the presence of LAMP1, a high-density lysosomal marker shown to be present in MVBs of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref020">20</xref>], in fractions 9–12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Remarkably, 5-LO was also found in CD63- and LAMP1-positive high-density fractions upon fMLP stimulation, and the distribution pattern of LTB<sub>4</sub> was similar to that of 5-LO in both resting and activated conditions, suggesting active 5-LO in this cellular compartment. Together, the presence of LTB<sub>4</sub> and 5-LO in CD63- and LAMP1-positive fractions suggest the involvement of MVBs in LTB<sub>4</sub>/5-LO transport.</p>

<title>5-LO Localizes on MVBs and Released Exosomes</title>
<p>To confirm whether the 5-LO-containing vesicles indeed reside in MVBs, we performed transmission electron microscopy (EM) on neutrophils chemotaxing towards fMLP. As previously reported using immunofluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref021">21</xref>], we observed substantial 5-LO labeling on the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g002">Fig 2D, 2E and 2G</xref>) compared to antibody control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Consistent with our fractionation findings, we also detected 5-LO on MVBs—both on the membrane and on intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g002">Fig 2B–2E, 2G and 2I</xref>). Indeed, quantitation of immunogold staining of different vesicular compartments showed that the majority of 5-LO localized to MVBs compared to non-MVB vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), with 30%–35% of all MVBs staining positive for 5-LO. In addition, 5-LO was observed on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>), which may be due to the transfer of 5-LO-containing outer MVB membranes to the plasma membrane during fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g002">Fig 2Giii</xref>). Most interestingly, we found that a substantial number of 5-LO-containing MVBs (25%–30%) were tightly associated with the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g002">Fig 2E, 2G and 2Hi</xref>). These MVB-associated regions of the nuclear envelope also showed specific enrichment for 5-LO. MVBs typically fuse to the plasma membrane and release their ILVs, termed exosomes, into the extracellular milieu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref022">22</xref>]. In this context, we readily observed 5-LO-containing ILVs released as exosomes from the trailing edge of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g002">Fig 2H</xref>) and the presence of 5-LO-containing vesicles at the synapse between two migrating neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g002">Fig 2I</xref>).</p>

<p>As CD63 is highly enriched in exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref023">23</xref>], we next assessed the cellular distribution of 5-LO and CD63 in live chemotaxing cells. We expressed mCherry-tagged 5-LO (mCherry-5LO) and/or GFP-tagged CD63 (CD63-GFP) in the pluripotent hematopoietic cell line PLB-985, which can be differentiated into neutrophil-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref024">24</xref>]. We again found that 5-LO localizes to the nucleus in resting mCherry-5LO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s003">S1A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s010">S1 Movie</xref>). However, upon uniform fMLP addition, we readily observed the redistribution of mCherry-5LO to the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s011">S2 Movie</xref>). This vesicular localization was even more apparent in cells chemotaxing in a gradient of fMLP and was found to be more prominent at the trailing edge compared to the leading edge of chemotaxing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s012">S3 Movie</xref>). The trailing edge localization of 5-LO-containing vesicles was further substantiated through phalloidin counterstaining, which marks the leading edge F-actin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s003">S1B Fig</xref>). To determine the nature of the 5-LO positive vesicles, we visualized the dynamic distribution of CD63-GFP. As expected, we observed a punctate localization of the MVB marker in both resting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s003">S1A Fig</xref>) and stimulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s003">S1C Fig</xref>) cells expressing CD63-GFP. Remarkably, in mCherry-5LO/CD63-GFP coexpressing cells chemotaxing towards fMLP, we observed a clear colocalization of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s013">S4 Movie</xref>), which again occurred mainly at the trailing edge of the chemotaxing cells. Together, these findings establish that 5-LO is present on MVBs that fuse with the plasma membrane and release their exosomal content during chemotaxis.</p>

<title>Neutrophils Release Exosomes Containing LTB<sub>4</sub> and LTB<sub>4</sub> Synthesizing Enzymes upon fMLP Addition</title>
<p>Having established the presence of 5-LO in MVBs, we set out to determine whether neutrophils secrete exosomes that contain LTB<sub>4</sub> and LTB<sub>4</sub> synthesizing enzymes. To this end, supernatants from fMLP-stimulated neutrophils were filtered through 0.45 μm pore-sized membranes and centrifuged to remove larger vesicles and cell fragments. Pellets recovered from ultracentrifugation of the filtrate contained a heterogeneous mixture of EVs (unpurified EV) ranging in size from 50–500 nm, as ascertained from by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Crude EVs were further fractionated on a discontinuous gradient of iodixanol to yield a vesicle population with a density of ~1.09 g/ml and vesicle size between 50–120 nm (median vesicle size = 80 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3D</xref>)—a characteristic size for exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref025">25</xref>]. We found that the purified vesicles were enriched in the tetraspannins CD63 and CD81, also reported in exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref023">23</xref>], and had very low amounts of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) integral protein Calnexin or the ER lumen marker GRP94 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Furthermore, the possibility of contamination from ectosomes and other plasma membrane-derived vesicles was excluded by the absence of the ectosome marker CD11b in purified vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s004">S2A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref026">26</xref>]. We also found that the release of exosomes from neutrophils increased upon fMLP addition, as the detection of the exosomal markers CD63 and CD81 increased with fMLP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). This increase was dependent on the concentration of fMLP added to cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s004">S2B Fig</xref>). Moreover, the release of exosomes from cells was also observed following ionomycin addition but not with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s004">S2C Fig</xref>). Most importantly, we determined that the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of LTB<sub>4</sub>, namely 5-LO, FLAP, and LTA<sub>4</sub>H, were all present in fractions containing HSC70 (another known exosome marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref027">27</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3G</xref>) and EM analyses revealed that both 5-LO and CD63 specifically decorate exosomes isolated in these fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). The exosomes isolated from fMLP-stimulated neutrophils showed a high LTB<sub>4</sub> content, which was dramatically reduced by pretreating neutrophils with the FLAP inhibitor MK886 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). Together, these findings show that upon fMLP addition, neutrophils release exosomes containing LTB<sub>4</sub> and the enzymes required for its synthesis.</p>

<title>Exosomes Activate Neutrophils in an LTB<sub>4</sub>-Dependent Manner</title>
<p>We next studied the extent by which exosomes mediate the effects of LTB<sub>4</sub> on neutrophil function. We first purified exosomes from mCherry-5LO and CD63-GFP expressing cells following fMLP treatment in the presence and absence of MK886 and measured their LTB<sub>4</sub> content. We found that the exogenous expression of either mCherry-5LO or CD63-GFP significantly increases exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and, as we observed with neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g003">Fig 3I</xref>), LTB<sub>4</sub> content was dramatically inhibited by pretreatment with MK886 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Quantification of the released exosomes showed that the decrease in LTB<sub>4</sub> content in MK886-treated cells was not a result of a decrease in exosome release by these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). More importantly, the addition of exosomes derived from mCherry-5LO or CD63-GFP expressing cells to neutrophils rapidly induced cellular polarization and adhesion, indicating that the exosomes readily activate resting neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These observations were further strengthened by the increase of both pErk1/2 and pAkt levels upon the exogenous addition of exosomes from mCherry-5LO or mCherry expressing cells to resting neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s005">S3A Fig</xref>). Of note, the extent by which the exosome preparations increased pErk1/2 and pAkt levels was greater in cells exposed to mCherry-5LO exosomes versus mCherry exosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s005">S3A Fig</xref>), which could reflect the higher LTB<sub>4</sub> content of exosomes derived from mCherry-5LO expressing cells, compared to mCherry expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>The EZ-Taxiscan microfluidic device was used to assess whether exosomes are capable of inducing a chemotactic response. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g004">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s014">S5 Movie</xref>, neutrophils were able to migrate towards exosomes derived from mCherry-5LO expressing cells with speeds and chemotactic indices (CIs) comparable to those observed in the presence of LTB<sub>4</sub> alone. To determine whether the chemotactic response was mediated by LTB<sub>4</sub>, we exposed neutrophils treated with the LTB<sub>4</sub> receptor-1 antagonist LY223982 to exosomes. We found that LY223982 treatment dramatically reduced the chemotactic response of neutrophils to both LTB<sub>4</sub> and exosomes derived from mCherry-5LO-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g004">Fig 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s015">S6 Movie</xref>). The antagonist-treated cells, however, did not show migration defects to saturating concentrations of fMLP, showing that LY223982 treatment did not impede chemotaxis due to nonspecific effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s005">S3B Fig</xref>). We also observed that exosomes derived from MK886-treated mCherry-5LO cells displayed weak chemotactic activity compared to exosomes from control treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s016">S7 Movie</xref>), further showing that the LTB<sub>4</sub> present in exosomes is responsible for the chemotactic behavior. These results were confirmed biochemically by assessing the effects of the exogenous addition of LTB<sub>4</sub> or exosomes on pAkt in neutrophils pretreated with LY223982. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g004">Fig 4G</xref>, LTB<sub>4</sub> or exosome addition gave rise to equal levels of pAkt for each exosome preparation and LTB<sub>4</sub> amounts used and, most importantly, the pAkt response was blocked by pretreating the cells with LY223982 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s005">S3C Fig</xref>, for quantification). Together, these findings establish the central role of LTB<sub>4</sub> in exosome-mediated neutrophil activation.</p>

<title>Reduced Exosome Production Leads to a Decrease in Exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> Release and a Loss in Directional Migration</title>
<p>To specifically assess the role of exosome formation and release for LTB<sub>4</sub> secretion, we knocked down Rab27a or neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSmase2; SMPD2 gene) using small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) in PLB-985 cells. Rab27a is critical in MVB docking to the plasma membrane, and its depletion was shown to reduce exosome secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref029">29</xref>]. nSmase2 is important in exosome secretion by mediating the budding of exosomes into MVBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref030">30</xref>]. We achieved an efficient knockdown (KD) of Rab27a and SMPD2 expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated PLB-985, and the KD of one gene did not alter the expression of the other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s006">S4A Fig</xref>). Of the six shRNA sequences screened for each gene, we selected Rab27a shRNA 1 (sh1) and Rab27a shRNA 3 (sh3) for further studies (presenting 75% ± 4% and 70% ± 8% reduction of protein levels, respectively), whereas shRNA 2 (sh2) and shRNA 4 (sh4) were selected for SMPD2 (presenting 82% ± 8% and 85% ± 6% reduction in protein levels, respectively). Using CD63 and CD81 as markers, we found that both SMPD2 and Rab27a KD cells show reduced exosome production upon treatment with 2 nM fMLP compared to control nonspecific shRNA (NSshRNA) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s006">S4B Fig</xref>). The purity of the exosome preparations was assessed using the ectosome marker CD11b. Similarly, LTB<sub>4</sub> content of purified exosomes from both KD cell lines was markedly lower than in control cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), although LTB<sub>4</sub> levels across the different cell types were not different when normalized to the total exosomal protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). These findings indicate that depletion of either nSmase2 or Rab27a does not affect LTB<sub>4</sub> synthesis. When we measured the total amount of LTB<sub>4</sub> secreted from each cell line in response to 1 nM fMLP, a physiological relevant concentration, we also observed a 75%–85% reduction in KD cells compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Interestingly, stimulating cells with a saturating concentration of fMLP (1 μM) reduced total LTB<sub>4</sub> secretion by 40%–50%. Although this could result from residual Rab27a or nSmase2 activity in the KD cell lines, nonexosomal sources of LTB<sub>4</sub> could become dominant under bulk activation conditions.</p>

<p>We next set out to assess the chemotactic behavior of the KD cell lines. We found that KD of either SMPD2 or Rab27a specifically reduced the directional motility (or CI) of cells towards a subsaturating concentration of fMLP (effective concentration 1 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s017">S8 Movie</xref>), as the speed of migration remained unchanged for both KD cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). To further investigate whether exosomes play a role in the relay of primary chemotactic signals, we measured myosin light chain II (MLCII) phosphorylation following a subsaturating fMLP stimulation, a process acutely affected by the disruption of LTB<sub>4</sub> signaling in neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref006">6</xref>]. As we previously reported, we measured an increase in pMLCII levels in cells expressing NSshRNA in response to 2 nM fMLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). We also found that the increase of pMLCII levels was further accentuated in PLB-985 cells over expressing the receptor for LTB<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>R1), suggesting higher sensitivity of LTB<sub>4</sub>R1 expressing cells towards signal relay processes and the pivotal role that LTB<sub>4</sub> plays in this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). In sharp contrast, and as observed in neutrophils where LTB<sub>4</sub> synthesis is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref006">6</xref>], no fMLP-mediated pMLCII increase was measured in either Rab27a or SMPD2 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s006">S4C Fig</xref>). Together, these findings show that exosome release regulates LTB<sub>4</sub> secretion and signal relay during neutrophil chemotaxis.</p>
<p>Importantly, the defects of the KD cells appeared to be highly specific. Both SMPD2 and Rab27a KD cells did not show defects in their ability to adhere upon fMLP stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s007">S5A Fig</xref>), nor did they show any defect in their ability to increase pERK1/2 upon fMLP stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s007">S5B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, as we found with MK8886 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref006">6</xref>], the defects in directional migration were absent when a saturating concentration of fMLP (effective concentration 100 nM) was used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s007">S5C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s018">S9 Movie</xref>).

<p>While we observed a dramatic improvement in the CI of GW4869- or MK886-treated cells through the paracrine effects of exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), we noticed that the treated cells showed defects in the time required to migrate towards fMLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). It required up to 35 min for cells treated with either drug to traverse 300 μm, compared with 20 min for untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). In addition, the treated cells exhibited slower speeds as well as a loss of directional persistence in the initial phases of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). These defects in migration initiation and sensitization to a chemoattractant cue highlight a key role for exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> in autocrine signaling.</p>
<p>One may argue that exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> merely increases the robustness of the chemotactic response by regulating the cellular machinery as opposed to acting as a chemotactic beacon. We tested this by mixing cells that cannot detect fMLP with cells defective in exosome release and observed their migration towards fMLP. Due to their higher sensitivity to LTB<sub>4</sub>, we used LTB<sub>4</sub>R1 overexpressing cells as receiving cells in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). We treated green-labeled LTB<sub>4</sub>R1 cells with the FPR-1 antagonist cyclosporin H (CsH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref031">31</xref>] and mixed them with red-labeled cells expressing control shRNA (NSshRNA), which were also treated with CsH. These cells did not migrate towards fMLP, confirming the efficacy of the antagonist treatment, and no such defects were observed when control-labeled cells were mixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). However, the motility defect of CsH-treated LTB<sub>4</sub>R1 cells was readily rescued when mixed with untreated NSshRNA cells, but not with MK886-treated NSshRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). These findings reiterate that LTB<sub>4</sub> released by NSshRNA cells is responsible for the trans-recruitment of CsH-treated cells. Importantly, no rescue in motility was observed in CsH-treated LTB<sub>4</sub>R1 cells when they were mixed with Rab27a or SMPD2 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) and in GW4869- or MK866-treated neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002336.s009">S7 Fig</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> relays chemotactic signals in response to primary attractants during neutrophil chemotaxis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our prior studies on neutrophils migrating in chemotactic gradients identified LTB<sub>4</sub> as an important signal relay molecule that increases the recruitment range of neutrophils to sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref011">11</xref>]. This observation led us to study the mode of LTB<sub>4</sub> release from cells and its effective dissemination. In this study, we show that LTB<sub>4</sub> is packaged in MVBs that are released as exosomes during neutrophil chemotaxis. We present this as a mechanism through which hydrophobic low-diffusible lipid molecules, like LTB<sub>4</sub>, mediate the signal relay process. Our study proposes that neutrophils migrating in primary chemoattractant gradients release exosomes containing LTB<sub>4</sub> and LTB<sub>4</sub> synthesizing enzymes. These exosomes subsequently act in an autocrine manner—by sensitizing cells towards the primary chemoattractant—and in a paracrine manner, by acting as molecular beacons for following cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002336.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<p>We found that both LTB<sub>4</sub> and 5-LO are present in MVBs and exosomes, which also contain LTA<sub>4</sub>H and FLAP. The presence of LTB<sub>4</sub> synthesizing enzymes has previously been reported in exosomes derived from macrophages and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref032">32</xref>]. However, unlike dendritic cells that constitutively produce exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref033">33</xref>], we detected little or no release of exosomes in unstimulated neutrophils. Instead, we observed exosome release upon treatment with ionomycin as well as following the addition of fMLP, but not GM-CSF, indicating that exosome release is a result of primary stimulation and not a priming event. fMLP is also known to increase the release of plasma membrane-derived secretory vesicles and ectosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref034">34</xref>] that have considerable overlap with exosomes in terms of size (50–200 nm). However, owing to their differences in lipid composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref035">35</xref>], we were able to separate exosomes from ectosomes using iodixanol density gradients. Moreover, the purified exosomes were able to activate resting neutrophils, indicating proinflammatory responses compared to the reported anti-inflammatory responses of ectosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref034">34</xref>]. Finally, using Rab27a and SMPD2 KD cells, we established that exosomes represent the primary pathway for LTB<sub>4</sub> release in chemotaxing neutrophils under physiological stimulation conditions. Impaired neutrophil recruitment has been observed in Rab27a KO mice under in vivo neutrophil recruitment models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref036">36</xref>]. Furthermore, neutrophils deficient in vesicle fusion show less migration in vitro and in an in vivo model of gout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref037">37</xref>]. The migration defects we observed in Rab27a and SMPD2 KD cells therefore provide valuable mechanistic insights into the migration defects observed in vivo. Furthermore, the docking of 5-LO containing MVBs at the back of cells and the subsequent release of exosomes are reminiscent of the molecular beacon model first shown in chemotaxing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref017">17</xref>]. This is similar to recent in vivo observations made by Sung and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref038">38</xref>], where exosomes released by HT1080 cells bind to integrins and act as adhesion trails for cellular guidance.</p>
<p>Under uniform stimulation conditions, exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> levels range from 2–10 nM and are sufficient to elicit neutrophil migration in chemotaxis assays. This, however, may not reflect the actual amount of LTB<sub>4</sub> being released from exosomes during chemotaxis for the following reasons: (i) exosome release is fMLP dose-dependent and hence a function of the primary chemoattractant gradient; (ii) purified exosomes were prepared by uniformly stimulating neutrophils with subsaturating fMLP concentrations and losses incurred during the purification processes could lead to underestimated amounts of exosomes recovered; (iii) the rate of LTB<sub>4</sub> release from exosomes and the effective LTB<sub>4</sub> gradient across and between cells cannot be reliably measured in real time due to the lack of sensitive methodologies; and (iv) the presence of the LTB<sub>4</sub> synthesizing enzymes, 5-LO, LTA<sub>4</sub>H, and FLAP in neutrophil exosomes along with the presence of the primary substrate AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref039">39</xref>], suggest active exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> synthesis. Indeed, exosomes isolated from dendritic cells are capable of synthesizing AA metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref032">32</xref>]. Although our study elucidates the trafficking and secretion of LTB<sub>4</sub> during neutrophil chemotaxis, the mechanisms regulating the release of exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> remain to be determined. These may include membrane diffusion, passive or active lysis through released neutrophil proteases, or through docking to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref040">40</xref>]. Alternatively, active LTB<sub>4</sub> release may be mediated through ABC transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref041">41</xref>] or other types of active processes. The availability of methods that are sensitive and, most importantly, capable of measuring LTB<sub>4</sub> in real time and space will help elucidate how LTB<sub>4</sub> gradients are established and propagated during neutrophil chemotaxis.</p>
<p>EM analyses on chemotaxing neutrophils provide key insights into the mechanisms that regulate LTB<sub>4</sub> synthesis and trafficking. In addition to its enrichment on the nuclear envelope, 5-LO is localized to the plasma membrane and to MVBs. Most interestingly, the 5-LO containing MVBs are often observed in close proximity to the nuclear envelope. The origination of MVBs from the nuclear envelope has previously been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref043">43</xref>]. Moreover, Record and colleagues have reported a close association of MVBs containing internalized exosomes with the nucleus in RBL-2H3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref039">39</xref>]. From these findings, we envision that the nuclear envelope represents a central hub for 5-LO distribution, leading to its segregation in two independent cellular pools: (i) the nucleus, where LTB<sub>4</sub> has been shown to bind to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref044">44</xref>] and regulate transcriptional responses and (ii) MVBs, where LTB<sub>4</sub> is destined to secretion and signal relay. We reason that the 5-LO plasma membrane labeling arises upon MVB fusion and release of exosomes into the extracellular environment. Our findings also bring into question the role of the canonical ESCRT-dependent exosomal biogenesis machinery in the synthesis and release of LTB<sub>4</sub>-containing exosomes. Indeed, the fact that nSmase2 depletion results in a near complete inhibition of exosome release suggests that neutrophil exosome biogenesis predominantly relies on a ceramide-dependent and ESCRT-independent mechanism. Our observations are consistent with a study by Trajkovic et al. showing that secretion of CD63 in a mouse oligodendroglial cell line is blocked by a sphingomyelinase inhibitor, but not by a dominant-negative ESCRT component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref030">30</xref>]. On the other hand, ESCRTIII, one of the key members of the ESCRT complex involved in ILV formation and MVB biogenesis, has recently been shown to localize at juxtanuclear regions that mediate the reformation of the nuclear envelope during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref045">45</xref>]. It hence remains to be determined whether the ESCRT machinery is involved in regulating the assembly of 5-LO-containing MVBs from the nuclear envelope during neutrophil chemotaxis.</p>
<p>Our findings show that exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> regulates neutrophil chemotaxis in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. First, we found that Rab27a and SMPD2 KD cells as well as neutrophils treated with an nSmase2 inhibitor exhibit profound defects in directionality and recruitment range towards fMLP. Similar defects were observed in neutrophils derived from Rab27a KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref036">36</xref>] and were primarily attributed to granule exocytosis, a process that is closely related to exosome biogenesis and release. Chemotaxis has not been studied in neutrophils isolated from SMPD2 KO mice, although its role may be inferred through the effects of GW4869 on neutrophil migration. GW4869 did not inhibit neutrophil speed but abrogated directional migration towards fMLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref046">46</xref>], an observation that mirrors our own observation with GW4869 and SMPD2 KD cells. Second, we found that the defects in directionality and recruitment range of SMPD2 KD as well as GW4869-treated cells are rescued by the presence of control cells that provide exosomes to relay signals. One could argue that the rescue was simply due to supplementation of ceramide from the released exosomes and not related to LTB<sub>4</sub> content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref046">46</xref>]. However, we observed a very similar phenotypical recovery by inhibiting LTB<sub>4</sub> synthesis alone. More importantly, unlike control cells, the KD cells were unable to send a paracrine signal to neutrophils with blocked FPR1, clearly establishing that exosomes represent a critical bearer of the signal relay message.</p>
<p>Exosomes are well-established mediators of intercellular communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref047">47</xref>] and have been known to mediate cell migration in various systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref038">38</xref>]. This work establishes that exosomal communication is extremely efficient and critical in fast moving cells and occurs at a faster rate compared to the slow constitutive release of exosomes reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref029">29</xref>]. Moreover, our findings add valuable insight into the mechanisms that underlie chronic inflammatory conditions, such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref048">48</xref>], as well as lung cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref049">49</xref>], where LTB<sub>4</sub> plays a central role. We envision that the secretion of other signals that foster communication between cells in harsh extracellular environments are similarly processed through exosome packaging.</p>

<title>Under-agarose assay</title>
<p>Cell culture dishes were coated with 0.2% gelatin in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. 0.5% agarose in 50% PBS—50% mHBSS was poured and allowed to solidify for 40 min. Three 1 mm diameter wells were carved at 2 mm distance from each other. A chemoattractant was placed in the middle well 15 min before plating neutrophils. The chemoattractant concentration achieved using this method was assessed as described by Afonso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref006">6</xref>]. Typically, a gradient of 50 pM/μm fMLP was used for under-agarose assays. 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> neutrophils in 5 μL mHBSS were plated in the outer wells and incubated at 37°C. Cells were allowed to chemotax for 30 min to 2 h depending on the experimental requirement. Cells migrating under-agarose were imaged using Axiovert 200 (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a confocal system (Ultraview ERS; PerkinElmer) with a spinning disk head (Yokogawa). Single plane images and z stacks were taken using 63 and 100× plan neofluor objectives (Carl Zeiss, Inc.).</p>

<title>EZ-Taxiscan Assay</title>
<p>The EZ-Taxiscan chamber (Effector Cell Institute, Tokyo, Japan) was assembled as described by the manufacturer. Cell migration was recorded every 15 s for 45 min at 37°C in a humidified environmental chamber. Coverslips and chips used in the chamber were coated with 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. All glass coverslips were ultrasonicated and washed before use. Cell migration analysis was conducted using MATLAB software as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref051">51</xref>].</p>

<title>Adhesion Assay</title>
<p>Cells (5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were plated on 96-well plates coated with fibronectin, stimulated for 30 min at 37°C, shaken at 2,000 RPM (radius = 1 cm) for 10 s on an orbital shaker, and unbound cells were removed. The remaining cells were fixed (4% PFA) and stained with crystal violet 5 mg/mL in 2% ethanol. Crystal violet was extracted by the addition of 2% SDS and absorbance was measured at 570 nm.</p>

<sec id="sec025">
<title>EM Analyses</title>
<p>Neutrophils were allowed to migrate under-agarose towards an fMLP gradient for 1 hr after which the agarose was removed and the cells were fixed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4, containing 5% sucrose, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 0.1% glutaradehyde for 2 h at 22°C. The cells were blocked and permeablized in PBS + 5% BSA, 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>, and 0.1% saponin, followed by the addition of 5-LO antibody or a control rabbit antibody, and subsequently with rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to nanogold (4 nm; Nanoprobes). The cells are fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde followed by gold enhancement of the nanogold particles (Nanoprobes), osmium tetroxide staining, and epoxy block preparation. Immunoelectron staining was performed on thin cut block sections (EML, NCI) using Hitachi H7600 Transmission electron microscope. MVBs with greater than 5 immunogold particle/μm were considered 5-LO positive MVBs for quantification purposes. In separate experiments, uranyl acetate negative-stain immuno-EM was performed to analyze the size and number of purified exosome samples.</p>

<title>Mixed Cell Chemotaxis Assay, Image Acquisition and Motility Analysis</title>
<p>Cytotracker dyes were added to differentiated PLB-985 cells or freshly isolated neutrophils according to manufacturer’s protocol (Life Technologies), washed and resuspended in modified HBSS (mHBSS) containing appropriate inhibitors/antagonists. Cells were then washed and 2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells of differently labeled cells were mixed. These cells were resuspended in 5 μl mHBSS and loaded onto an under-agarose chamber. Time-lapse imaging was performed using a Plan-Neofluar 10x/0.30 objective (Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope). Cell tracks were extracted and analyzed using a method developed by McCann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref054">54</xref>] supplemented by tracking through ImageJ. CI and Δα (persistance) were used to analyze motility behavior. CI was calculated by taking the cosine of the angle between the final displacement vector and the line connecting the chemotactic source to the initial position of the cell. A value of 1 designates perfect chemotaxis. Δα is measured through the angular change between the displacement vector at any given time and the preceding displacement vector. Larger Δα designates lower persistence.</p>

<title>LTB<sub>4</sub> Measurements</title>
<p>Total LTB<sub>4</sub> levels were measured using an ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems). Briefly, neutrophils or PLB-985 cells were resuspended at 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in PBS and incubated for 30 min on ice. GM-CSF (5 ng/ml; R&amp;D Systems) was added and cells were further incubated for 1 hr at 37°C, centrifuged at 400 xg for 5 min, resuspended in a volume of 200 μl at 24 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in RPMI and incubated at 37°C until stimulated. The reactions were stopped by adding cold PBS. Cells were centrifuged and LTB<sub>4</sub> in supernatants were assayed according to manufacturer’s instructions. Exosomal LTB<sub>4</sub> was measured using the EIA kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (Cayman Chemicals) after disruption by sonication. To measure LTB<sub>4</sub> in the vesicular fractions of lysed neutrophils, total lipids were first extracted from the different fractions using a method outlined by McColl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002336.ref055">55</xref>]. The extracted lipids were acidified to pH 4.0 loaded onto a C18 SPE column and eluted with ethyl acetate containing 10% methanol, evaporated under inert nitrogen stream and resuspended in buffer to obtain a concentrated pool of LTB<sub>4</sub>. LTB<sub>4</sub> levels were measured using the EIA kit (Cayman chemicals) according to manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Neutrophils were either resuspended in RPMI (1% bovine serum) or plated on fibronectin-coated chambers (for pMLCII) and incubated with inhibitors and diisopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP) (2 mM) for 10 min at 37°C. Cells were then stimulated with fMLP, collected at specific time points, lysed for 15 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mN NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 3 mM DFP, 2 mM orthovanadate, 10 g/mL aprotinin, 10 g/mL leupeptin, 2.5 mM napyrophosphate, Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail [Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN]), and processed for SDS-PAGE analyses.</p>
