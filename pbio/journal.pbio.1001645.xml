<p>The CK2 kinase plays diverse roles in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian clock by controlling stability of the CLOCK transcription factor itself, besides its known role in degrading CLOCK repressors.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Phosphorylation is a pivotal regulatory mechanism for protein stability and activity in circadian clocks regardless of their evolutionary origin. It determines the speed and strength of molecular oscillations by acting on transcriptional activators and their repressors, which form negative feedback loops. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the CK2 kinase phosphorylates and destabilizes the PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) proteins, which inhibit CLOCK (CLK) transcriptional activity. Here we show that CK2 also targets the CLK activator directly. Downregulating the activity of the catalytic α subunit of CK2 induces CLK degradation, even in the absence of PER and TIM. Unexpectedly, the regulatory β subunit of the CK2 holoenzyme is not required for the regulation of CLK stability. In addition, downregulation of CK2α activity decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> transcription. These results indicate that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. Since the CK1 kinase promotes CLK degradation, we suggest that CLK stability and transcriptional activity result from counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The CK2 kinase is an ancient enzyme known to be at the heart of self-sustaining circadian clocks in animals, plants, and fungi. Circadian clocks are responsible for daily circadian rhythms in molecular, physiological, and behavioral processes. Their mechanism relies on transcriptional activators and repressors that constitute a feedback loop. The CLOCK (CLK) activator is required to initiate the transcription of the <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) and <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>) genes in the late day. The PER and TIM repressors accumulate in a delayed manner and translocate to the nucleus to repress their own gene. Degradation of these repressors allows the activator to start a new cycle. In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the PER and TIM repressors targets them for degradation. Here we find that the CLK activator is also regulated by CK2. In contrast to PER and TIM, CLK is stabilized by CK2α phosphorylation; we also show that PER and TIM are dispensable for this stabilization of CLK. The identification of CK2–CLK protein complexes and the <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation of CLK by CK2 hint at a direct action of the kinase on the activator. Although transcription factor stabilization is generally expected to be associated with increased activity, genetic analysis indicates that CK2 represses CLK. Hence CK2 phosphorylation seems to be a key signal for the transcriptional activator complex to adopt a proper activation state at a given point of the circadian cycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circadian oscillations of gene expression, physiology, and behavior are found in a wide range of organisms. They are governed by temporally regulated feedback loops in which transcription factors activate the expression of their own inhibitors. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian oscillator, the CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) bHLH-PAS domain transcription factors activate expression of the <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) and <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>) genes at the end of the day. The delayed accumulation of PER and TIM and their transfer to the nucleus leads to transcriptional repression of CLK/CYC during the late night. The repression phase is also shaped by other repressors/activators such as CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO) and KAYAK-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Kadener1">[1]</xref>. Subsequent degradation of PER and TIM repressors in the morning allows transcription to resume towards the evening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Weber1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Hardin1">[3]</xref>. Controlled phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and proteasome-dependent degradation of PER and TIM set the timing of their delayed accumulation and clearance. The PER protein is phosphorylated by the DOUBLETIME (DBT, CK1δ/ε), CK2, and NEMO kinases and polyubiquitylated by the SCF<sup>Slimb</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Kloss1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Chiu2">[12]</xref>. TIM associates with PER, preventing its degradation, but TIM itself is subjected to phosphorylation and subsequent breakdown. TIM phosphorylation involves the CK2 and SHAGGY (SGG, GSK-3) kinases and TIM degradation also depends on SCF<sup>Slimb</sup> and a CULLIN-3-based ubiquitin ligase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Grima1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lin1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Martinek1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>. Phosphatase activity counterbalances the effects of the aforementioned and probably also of other kinases: PP2A regulates PER abundance, while PP1 targets both PER and TIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Sathyanarayanan1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Fang1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>CLK phosphorylation cycles with a peak in the morning and a minimum in the early night <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lee1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Hung1">[21]</xref>. Similarly, CLK immunoreactivity in head extracts or brain tissue seems to oscillate in phase with its phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Hung1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lamaze1">[23]</xref>, although harsh extraction liberates chromatin-bound CLK, which results in relatively constant CLK levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Sun1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Luo1">[25]</xref>. Whether oscillations of CLK immunoreactivity in neurons reflect rhythmic changes of total CLK protein amount is still unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lamaze1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Houl1">[26]</xref>. Due to the cyclic regulation of CLK as opposed to constitutive expression of CYC, the CLK protein appears to represent the key rhythmic component of the circadian activator in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Bae1">[27]</xref>. CLK DNA-binding and transcriptional activity show a robust oscillation with an evening peak that is associated with the rapid increase of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> mRNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Menet1">[22]</xref>. The release of CLK from DNA goes hand in hand with its hyperphosphorylation, which depends on both PER and DBT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Kim1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Menet1">[22]</xref>. Since kinase activity of DBT does not seem to be required for hyperphosphorylation, it was proposed that DBT acts as an interface for the recruitment of other kinases into a complex with CLK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu2">[28]</xref>. The PER kinase NEMO destabilizes CLK <italic>in vivo</italic> and might thus be a CLK kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu3">[29]</xref>. CLK transcriptional activity in cultured cells is affected by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and mitogen-activated protein kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Weber2">[30]</xref>. Ubiquitylation is also involved in the regulation of CLK and BMAL1, the CYC ortholog in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Kwon1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lee2">[32]</xref>. In Drosophila, USP8 was recently reported to decrease CLK activity by deubiquitylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Luo1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>The CK2 kinase has a key function in the clockwork of various organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Allada1">[33]</xref>. In <italic>Neurospora</italic>, CK1 and CK2 phosphorylate both the White Collar Complex (WCC) transcriptional activator as well as its inhibitor FREQUENCY (FRQ) to control their activity, subcellular localization, and stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yang1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Huang1">[36]</xref>. In mammals, CK2 and CK1 destabilize PER2, although phosphorylation at specific CK2 target sites stabilizes the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Maier1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Tsuchiya1">[38]</xref>. The CK2 holoenzyme is formed by a tetrameric complex consisting of two catalytic (α) and two interacting regulatory (β) subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-StDenis1">[39]</xref>. The β subunits stabilize the α subunits that possess constitutive kinase activity. Phosphorylation of most substrates is enhanced by CK2β, while some substrates are more efficiently phosphorylated by free CK2α in the absence of CK2β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Montenarh1">[40]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, CK2α and CK2β affect PER and TIM abundance and subcellular localization, which correlates with a direct phosphorylation of both proteins by the CK2 holoenzyme <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lin1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Akten1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lin2">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Akten2">[43]</xref>. The dominant-negative CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> mutation strongly increases TIM stability even in the absence of PER, supporting TIM as the main target of CK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>. The CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> protein overexpression induces hyperphosphorylation of TIM that could be explained by enhanced phosphorylation or reduced dephosphorylation of TIM by other kinases and phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since the identity of the kinases involved in the control of CLK phosphorylation remains unclear, we asked whether CK2 plays a role in the phosphorylation and regulation of CLK. Our results indicate that inhibition of CK2α activity strongly increases CLK degradation, whereas CK2β does not affect CLK stability. The CK2 holoenzyme is recruited onto PER, TIM, and CLK mainly during late night, inducing CLK hyperphosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> and CK2 phosphorylates CLK <italic>in vitro.</italic> Specific CLK activity is increased in dominant-negative CK2α<sup>Tik</sup>-expressing flies indicating repression of CLK by CK2α. Our findings define, to our knowledge, the first <italic>bona fide</italic> kinase of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLK that plays a role in its degradation and hyperphosphorylation. The unstable but strongly active CLK acquired by CK2α inhibition joins the club of other circadian transcription factors with similar properties such as the WCC complex in <italic>Neurospora</italic>.</p>

<title>CK2α Activity Promotes CLK Protein Phosphorylation and Stability</title>
<p>A putative role of CK2 in CLK regulation was first addressed by analyzing head extracts of flies expressing a dominant-negative version of the CK2α catalytic subunit. As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Smith1">[42]</xref>, <italic>w;tim-gal4;UAS-CkIIα<sup>Tik</sup></italic> flies (hereafter <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies) were behaviorally arrhythmic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001645-t001">Table 1</xref>) and displayed weak and strongly delayed PER and TIM oscillations, with high levels of mildly phosphorylated PER and highly phosphorylated TIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). As CLK efficiently binds to DNA in the evening, the estimation of CLK levels through the circadian cycle is affected by extraction conditions. In sonicated head extracts, CLK protein has been shown to stay at constant levels, in contrast to a robust cycle of its phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Kim1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu1">[20]</xref>. However, the existence of oscillations in CLK levels remains discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Menet1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Luo1">[25]</xref>. In our hands, sonicated extracts of control flies showed weak cycling of CLK levels, although peak time was rather variable between experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s001">S1A</xref>). Nonsonicated extracts always showed CLK levels cycling with a trough in the evening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Importantly, both sonicated and nonsonicated extracts of <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies showed very low CLK levels with reduced phosphorylation on the first day of constant darkness (DD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s001">S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s001">S1B</xref>). In order to better estimate CLK levels in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies, sonicated extracts were treated with λ protein phosphatase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Again, a strong decrease of unphosphorylated CLK abundance was observed in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> animals. Moreover, <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA levels were about 1.5-fold higher in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that low CLK protein levels are not a consequence of reduced <italic>Clk</italic> expression. Consequently, the protein/mRNA ratio for CLK decreased to approximately 10% in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). Immunolabeling of whole-mount brains of <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies also supported a strong reduction of CLK levels in the small ventral lateral neurons (s-LNvs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), with no change in its nuclear-only localization (not shown).</p>

<p>To independently analyze the effect of decreasing CK2α activity on CLK, a UAS-<italic>CkIIα</italic> RNA interference (RNAi) construct was expressed under <italic>tim-gal4</italic> control. Adult flies were kept at 29°C to increase Gal4-dependent expression. CLK in sonicated head extracts of <italic>w;tim-gal4/+;UAS-CkIIα-RNAi</italic> (<italic>tim&gt;CkIIα-RNAi</italic>) flies showed a similar phenotype to that of <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies, with reduced phosphorylation and levels throughout the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Dampened and delayed PER and TIM oscillations were observed with increased protein levels during the day. In support of its specificity, the induction of RNAi reduced CK2α protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). Although high mortality of <italic>tim&gt;CkIIα-RNAi</italic> flies after long incubation at high temperature prevented the assessment of their locomotor activity rhythms at 29°C, they displayed long period rhythms at 25°C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001645-t001">Table 1</xref>). Similar long period rhythms are observed in heterozygous <italic>w;tim-gal4/+;UAS-CkIIα<sup>Tik</sup>/+</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001645-t001">Table 1</xref>), as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Smith1">[42]</xref>.</p>

<title>CK2α Stabilizes CLK in the Absence of PER and TIM</title>
<p>TIM was described as the likely primary target of CK2α in the circadian clock, effects elicited on PER being only secondary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>. We thus asked whether TIM was required for CK2α effects on CLK, by comparing the profile of CLK protein in sonicated head extracts of <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> and <italic>tim<sup>01</sup> tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies. In the absence of TIM, the CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> protein induced a prominent reduction in CLK phosphorylation and a significant decrease of protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA levels were about four times higher in <italic>tim<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Tik</italic> compared to <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic>, supporting a strong degradation of the CLK protein in <italic>tim<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Since a PER/DBT complex controls CLK phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu2">[28]</xref>, we asked whether PER was required for CLK modifications by CK2α, even in the absence of TIM. Effects of the CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> protein were thus analyzed in <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim<sup>0</sup></italic> double mutants, where CLK appeared minimally phosphorylated in a <italic>CkIIα</italic><sup>+</sup> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s002">S2A</xref>). CLK levels and phosphorylation were further diminished in the presence of the CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s002">S2A</xref>). Since the CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> protein overproduction increased <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA levels by about twofold in <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim<sup>0</sup></italic> double mutants, the CLK protein/mRNA ratio was reduced just as in <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). A similar decrease of CLK protein levels was observed in <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) despite increased <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA levels, suggesting that CLK protein was again strongly destabilized in the absence of PER. These observations reveal that CK2α stabilizes CLK in the absence of PER and/or TIM. Since CLK phosphorylation is further decreased by CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> expression, CK2α is important for the PER/TIM-independent minimal phosphorylation program of CLK.</p>

<p>The up-regulation of <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies suggested that CK2α could repress <italic>Clk</italic> transcription. To test whether <italic>Clk</italic> transcription was affected in the <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> genotype, <italic>Clk</italic> pre-mRNA levels were estimated. They were not increased in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies compared to controls, although a reduced antiphasic cycling was observed at DD1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). The antiphasic oscillation was reminiscent of PER and TIM oscillations persisting in these flies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The increase of mature <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies thus seems not to be the consequence of higher <italic>Clk</italic> gene transcription and rather supports a posttranscriptional control of <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA by CK2α. In agreement with a posttranscriptional control, the VRI and PDP1 regulators of <italic>Clk</italic> transcription were not affected in <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Finally, since the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>cry</italic>) gene is similar to the one of the <italic>Clk</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Glossop1">[44]</xref>, we tested <italic>cry</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies. No increase of <italic>cry</italic> mRNA levels was observed in the presence of the CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s002">Figure S2E</xref>), supporting a specific control of <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA levels by CK2α.</p>
<p>The data from <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies strongly suggested that CK2α controls CLK stability independently from PER and TIM. To obtain direct evidence for this, CLK degradation kinetics were analyzed in a cycloheximide (CHX) chase-based assay in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells. Since transfected V5-tagged CLK induced both <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> expression in S2 cells in our hands, we used RNAi against <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> to eliminate any effect of PER and TIM proteins. After blocking protein synthesis with CHX, CLK showed robust degradation during the following 9 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). When FLAG-HA-tagged CK2α was co-expressed, CLK degradation proceeded very slowly. The increase of CK2α levels by exogenous expression was rather limited in these conditions, indicating that a small increase in total CK2α protein can have substantial effects on CLK degradation. These results confirm the <italic>in vivo</italic> observations and strongly support a role for CK2α in the inhibition of CLK breakdown.</p>

<title>CK2β Does Not Influence CLK Stability</title>
<p>Since inhibition of CK2α affected CLK stability and phosphorylation, we asked whether CK2β knockdown would have similar effects. <italic>Pdf-gal4 UAS-CkIIβ-RNAi/+</italic> flies have been reported to display long period rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Zhang1">[45]</xref>.

The specificity of the <italic>CkIIβ</italic> RNAi was first behaviorally assessed by rescue experiments involving <italic>CkIIβ</italic> RNAi under the control of the strong PDF<sup>+</sup> cell driver <italic>gal1118</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Blanchardon1">[46]</xref> and the co-expression of different CK2β isoforms. The strongly altered behavior of <italic>w;; gal1118/UAS-CkIIβ-RNAi</italic> could be rescued by overexpression of the VIIa, VIIb, and VIIc CK2β isoforms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Jauch1">[47]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001645-t001">Table 1</xref>). Western blots against CK2β revealed a reduction in two isoforms in <italic>tim&gt;CkIIβ-RNAi</italic> animals, while a third isoform remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). TIM and PER cycling was profoundly altered in head extracts of <italic>tim&gt;CkIIβ-RNAi</italic> flies at DD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s003">S3B</xref>). In contrast, CLK oscillations were only slightly affected. In particular, <italic>tim&gt;CkIIβ-RNAi</italic> flies did not show the pronounced decrease in CLK levels that was observed in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies. Furthermore, CK2β depletion in a <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> background did not result in a marked reduction of CLK phosphorylation or quantity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Since equivalent levels of <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA were observed in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies with or without <italic>CkIIβ</italic> RNAi expression, their protein/mRNA ratios were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g003">Figure 3C and D</xref>), in contrast to <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies. Similarly, CLK was not affected when <italic>CkIIβ</italic> RNAi was expressed in a <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> background (not shown). In conclusion, although CK2α and CK2β proteins similarly affect TIM and PER accumulation and phosphorylation, the CK2β subunit does not seem to be required for CK2α to control CLK degradation and phosphorylation.</p>

<title>CK2α Preferentially Forms Complexes with Highly Phosphorylated CLK in the Morning</title>
<p>The strong effects of CK2α inhibition on CLK suggested that the two proteins might physically interact. Flies expressing a FLAG-tagged CK2α protein under <italic>tim-gal4</italic> control displayed strong behavioral rhythms with a 1 h period lengthening (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001645-t001">Table 1</xref>). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from FLAG-CK2α-expressing fly head extracts at different circadian times and showed co-immunoprecipitation of TIM, PER, and CLK mostly at the end of the subjective night and in the subjective morning when these proteins are mainly hyperphosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Although relatively abundant medium-phosphorylated clock proteins were observed in the extracts at CT16, they were poorly co-immunoprecipitated with CK2α. The CK2α subunit thus appears to preferentially make complexes with highly phosphorylated forms of TIM, PER, and CLK. Flies expressing FLAG-tagged CK2β were also behaviorally rhythmic with a slightly lengthened period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001645-t001">Table 1</xref>), and FLAG-CK2β expression could rescue the severe period lengthening induced by <italic>CkIIβ</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001645-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the tagged protein was functional. Similarly to CK2α, CK2β was found to be associated with hyperphosphorylated TIM, PER, and CLK in the late subjective night and in the subjective morning, whereas little amounts of proteins were co-immunoprecipitated at other circadian times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The results thus suggest that CK2 holoenzyme is involved in the hyperphosphorylation of CLK, PER, and TIM in the late night/morning part of the cycle.</p>

<title>CK2α Increases CLK Phosphorylation in a PER-Dependent Manner</title>
<p>To further decipher the function of CK2α in CLK phosphorylation, CLK protein was analyzed in flies overexpressing wild-type CK2α.

<p>The CLK phosphorylation defects in flies with altered CK2α functions and the presence of CLK-CK2α/β complexes suggested that CK2 might directly phosphorylate CLK. We thus asked whether the CK2 holoenzyme could phosphorylate CLK <italic>in vitro</italic>. Indeed, CLK was phosphorylated by CK2, and the presence of PER increased CLK phosphorylation by about twofold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). Addition of TIM protein did not affect the CK2-dependent phosphorylation of CLK.

<p><italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> pre-mRNA levels were measured to more directly estimate CLK transcriptional activity. Average nonoscillating levels of <italic>pre</italic>–<italic>per</italic> and <italic>pre</italic>–<italic>tim</italic> were observed in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g006">Figure 6B,C</xref>), despite the very reduced amounts of CLK protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). It thus suggested that CLK transcriptional activity was strongly increased when CK2α activity was diminished. Flies expressing the CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> protein in a <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic>, <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic>, or <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim<sup>0</sup></italic> double mutant background revealed no statistically significant changes in <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> mRNA levels compared to wild-type CK2α controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g006">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s005">S5A</xref>). However, CLK protein levels were reduced to 25–50% in CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> expressing flies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s002">S2</xref>), suggesting that specific CLK activity was still increased. Effects of CK2α on the transcriptional activity of CLK thus appears to be at least partly independent of PER and TIM. <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> mRNA levels were also measured in <italic>tim&gt;CkIIβ-RNAi</italic> flies and showed intermediate levels compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Since CLK quantity is unaffected by <italic>tim&gt;CkIIβ-RNAi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), CK2ß does not strongly modify CLK transcriptional activity.</p>
<p>Finally, CLK-dependent transcription was tested by CLK-induced reporter gene expression in S2 cells. On a CLK-binding synthetic minimal enhancer composed of three <italic>per</italic>-derived E-boxes, CLK-dependent transcription was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by CK2α co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Since CLK quantity was increased in the presence of CK2α overexpression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), the transcriptional decrease could hardly be a consequence of lower CLK levels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Temporally controlled phosphorylation of clock proteins is a key feature of the transcriptional-translational negative feedback loop underlying the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian clock. Although the CLK activator shows robust oscillations of its phosphorylation levels, the phosphorylation mechanisms and how they affect CLK function remain largely unknown. Our study aimed at determining whether CK2 was involved in the control of CLK phosphorylation and how it would affect CLK circadian function. Overexpression of the CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> dominant-negative enzyme or RNA interference against <italic>CkIIα</italic> substantially reduced CLK phosphorylation as well as protein levels. In accordance with the <italic>in vivo</italic> observations, co-transfection of CK2α with CLK in S2 cells increased CLK stability. This supports a function for CK2α in CLK stabilization. High CLK target gene transcription was induced by the CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> protein despite the low-level accumulation of CLK, indicating that CK2α decreased the expression of CLK targets. This was further corroborated in the luciferase activity assay in S2 cells where overexpression of CK2α inhibited CLK activity. Furthermore, CK2α associated with hyperphosphorylated forms of CLK in the morning and it was able to directly phosphorylate the CLK protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. Effects of CK2α on CLK stability and activity did not require PER or TIM, but CLK phosphorylation by CK2α involves both PER-independent and PER-dependent functions. The results suggest that direct phosphorylation by CK2α stabilizes CLK and diminishes its transcriptional activity.</p>
<p>CLK protein levels but not <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA levels are low in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> and <italic>tim&gt; CkIIα-RNAi</italic> flies, indicating that CK2 specifically affects CLK protein levels. Although a role of CK2α in CLK protein synthesis cannot be completely excluded, three sets of experimental data support a posttranslational action of CK2α on CLK. First, CK2α associates with CLK, PER, and TIM in protein complexes. Second, CK2α affects CLK phosphorylation state <italic>in vivo</italic> and is able to phosphorylate CLK directly <italic>in vitro</italic>. Third, CK2α stabilizes CLK even after protein synthesis blockage with CHX. Importantly, <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies show reduced CLK phosphorylation, as predicted from kinase inhibition. This is in contrast with the effects of <italic>CkIIα<sup>Tik</sup></italic> on PER and TIM, for which highly phosphorylated forms of the proteins accumulate, although PER phosphorylation remains lower than the highest state in the wild-type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lin1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lin2">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Smith1">[42]</xref>. Nevertheless, CK2 is able to phosphorylate PER and TIM <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lin1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lin2">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Zeng1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>CkIIα<sup>Tik</sup></italic> mutation affects TIM phosphorylation in the absence of PER, whereas TIM is required to observe effects of <italic>CkIIα<sup>Tik</sup></italic> on PER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>. TIM was thus proposed to be a direct target of CK2 that drives CK2-dependent modification of PER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>. One might expect that TIM or PER relays the effects of CK2 on CLK. This is not supported by the strong effect of <italic>CkIIα<sup>Tik</sup></italic> on the CLK protein in <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>, <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic>, or <italic>per<sup>01</sup> tim<sup>01</sup></italic> double mutants. However, PER strongly influences CLK phosphorylation by CK2. First, overexpression of wild-type CK2α induces CLK hyperphosphorylation in <italic>per+</italic> but not in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies. Second, PER enhances <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation of CLK by CK2α. Finally, the abundance of CLK/CK2 complexes observed in head extracts is much lower in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> mutants. In comparison to <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic>, wild-type flies accumulate much more CLK/CK2α complexes, particularly in the morning when PER and CLK are abundant and hyperphosphorylated. The PER–CLK interaction is the strongest in the morning and the weakest in the early evening when PER is highly degraded. It seems unlikely that this temporal pattern of CLK interactions with PER is strongly altered in FLAG-CK2α overexpressing animals used for the immunoprecipitation since they show behavioral and molecular rhythms similar to wild-type flies. CLK/CK2α complexes strongly decrease after CT4 when high levels of CLK but not PER remain, suggesting that CLK/CK2α interactions follow phosphorylated PER abundance. PER hence could drive a large fraction of CLK/CK2α interactions with PER-free CLK being a weaker CK2 substrate. Since PER interacts in the late night with CLK species that no longer bind chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Menet1">[22]</xref>, it suggests that CLK/PER/CK2α complexes are mostly unbound to DNA.</p>
<p>PER/DBT-dependent phosphorylation marks CLK for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Kim1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu1">[20]</xref>. Although the NEMO kinase destabilizes CLK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu3">[29]</xref>, whether it acts as a PER/DBT-dependent CLK kinase is not known. Our results indicate that inhibiting CK2α activity increases CLK breakdown, whereas overexpressing CK2α induces accumulation of highly phosphorylated CLK. CK2α thus appears to have opposite effects on CLK stability, compared to DBT and NEMO. Since both CK1 (DBT) and CK2 show a preferential association with CLK in the morning, they might counteract each other to control CLK degradation and recycling for a next transcription cycle. Interestingly, a kinase complex that includes CK1 promotes the SUPERNUMERARY LIMBS (SLMB)-dependent proteolysis of the CUBITUS INTERRUPTUS (CI) transcription factor, whereas CK2 stabilizes CI by preventing its ubiquitylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Jiang1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Jia1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>As opposed to <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies, flies expressing <italic>CkIIβ</italic> RNAi did not show significantly decreased CLK levels. In addition, CK2α and the CK2 holoenzyme are both able to phosphorylate <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLK <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data suggest that CLK, in contrast to PER and TIM, might be a substrate of CK2α alone rather than a substrate of the CK2 holoenzyme <italic>in vivo</italic>. Several studies suggest that CK2α and β do not act synergistically on a handful of substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Stigare1">[52]</xref> or even play antagonist roles with CK2β inhibiting CK2α-dependent phosphorylation of some target proteins (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Montenarh1">[40]</xref>). In mammals, CK2α is more efficient than the CK2 holoenzyme to phosphorylate BMAL1, and can also phosphorylate CLK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Tamaru1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Smith1">[42]</xref>, <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies showed intermediate levels of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> transcripts. We corroborated the involvement of transcription in this phenomenon by determining <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> pre-mRNA profiles. It has been proposed that the high levels of hyperphosphorylated TIM in <italic>tim&gt;Tik</italic> would prevent normal PER-dependent transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Meissner1">[15]</xref>. However, the fact that flies expressing the CK2α<sup>Tik</sup> protein in a <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic>, <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic>, or <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim<sup>0</sup></italic> double mutant background have only half dose (or less) of CLK but as high levels of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> transcripts as the <italic>CkIIα</italic><sup>+</sup> controls supports an additional PER/TIM-independent transcriptional function of CK2. Importantly, the small amount of remaining CLK protein in the late night in <italic>per<sup>+</sup> tim&gt;Tik</italic> flies drives similarly high pre<italic>–per</italic> expression as much more CLK in the wild-type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001645-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). That also undermines CK2's involvement only in PER/TIM repressor function during CLK-mediated transcription. A likely explanation is that the low-level hypophosphorylated CLK is extremely active in flies with reduced CK2α activity. In line with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results, the luciferase activity assay in cultured S2 cells uncovered a dose-dependent repression of CLK activity by the CK2α subunit on a minimal enhancer-promoter element.</p>
<p>CK2α thus appears to control CLK-dependent transcription by increasing PER/TIM repressing capacity and jointly decreasing CLK activity by some other mechanism. CK2β supports TIM-dependent repression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001645.s005">Figure S5B</xref>), but may not contribute to the PER/TIM-independent control of CLK activity by CK2α. Since deubiquitylation of CLK by USP8 decreases its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Luo1">[25]</xref>, it will be interesting to investigate whether CK2α phosphorylation affects CLK ubiquitylation.</p>
<p>In the <italic>Neurospora</italic> circadian transcriptional feedback loop, the FRQ repressor recruits CK1 and CK2 to promote phosphorylation of the WCC activator complex resulting in the inhibition of its transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-He1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Schafmeier1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Schafmeier2">[57]</xref>.

This is reminiscent of our finding about the role of CK2 in CLK activity regulation. Recently, BMAL1 and CLK were also shown to be “Kamikaze” activators in mammals in that their activity was dependent on proteasome function—highly unstable CLK and BMAL1 were the most active, while proteasome inhibition resulted in long-lived but less potent activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Kwon1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Lee2">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Stratmann1">[58]</xref>. Our findings indicate that CK2 might be a key player in such a mechanism, by promoting CLK stability and decreasing its activity. It remains to be seen how CK2 and DBT-dependent kinase activities interact on CLK to set CLK transcriptional activity to a proper phase in the circadian cycle.</p>

<title>Behavioral Analysis</title>
<p>Behavioral assays for locomotor activity rhythms were carried out with 1- to 5-d-old males at 25°C in <italic>Drosophila</italic> activity monitors (TriKinetics). Illumination was provided by standard white fluorescent low-energy bulbs. Light intensity at fly level was in the range of 300–1000 µW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Flies were first entrained to 12 h∶12 h light-dark (LD) cycles for 4 d and then transferred to constant darkness (DD). Activity data were analyzed from the second to the ninth day in DD. Data analysis was done with the FaasX 1.16 software that is derived from the Brandeis Rhythm Package (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Klarsfeld1">[65]</xref>) and is freely available upon request (Apple Mac OSX only). Rhythmic flies were defined by χ2 periodogram analysis of an 8-d dataset with the following criteria (filter ON): power ≥20, width ≥1.5 h, with no selection on period value. Power and width represent the height and width of the periodogram peak, respectively, and give the significance of the calculated period. Genotypes with a reduced number of rhythmic flies (&lt;50%), low power (&lt;50), and high s.e.m. of the period (&gt;1) are considered arrhythmic.

We homogenized 30–60 heads on ice in a modified RBS buffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001645-Yu1">[20]</xref>: 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche), Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 and 3 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 20 mM β-glycerophosphate (3–4 µl buffer/head). A Brinkmann Heidolph Mechanical Overhead Stirrer RZR1 was used for the homogenization. After 1 min of extraction, tubes were incubated in ice for 30 min, then homogenized again for another minute. If sonication was included after this step, samples were sonicated on ice with a Vibracell ultrasonic processor (Bioblock Scientific) at 4W output for 5×10 s with 1 s breaks. Following Bradford protein concentration measurement (BioRad), supernatants were used for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When supernatants were treated with λ protein phosphatase, 1,600 units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> were added to sonicated extracts prepared in phosphatase inhibitor-free buffer [10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM DTT, and EDTA-free Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche)] and subsequently incubated for 30 min at 30°C. Reaction was stopped by adding 1× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies), 500 mM DTT, and incubation for 10 min at 70°C. We loaded 50 µg total protein on Novex 4% Tris-Glycine precast gels (Life Technologies) for PER, TIM, and CLK immunoblotting, except specifically indicated. When indicated, NuPAGE Novex 3–8% Tris-Acetate gels were used for TIM and CLK immunoblotting for a better resolution of hyperphosphorylated forms. Samples (50 µg) for FLAG, CK2α, and CK2β immunoblots were run on NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris precast gels (Life Technologies). Electrophoresis and blotting were done according to the manufacturer's instructions except for a 3 h running time for Tris-Acetate and a 2 h running time for Tris-Glycine gels. Equal loading was verified by Ponceau S staining on blotting membranes, which were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at 25°C and then incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C.

RNA was treated with rDNase (NucleoSpin RNA Kit, Macherey-Nagel) in solution after RNA isolation to ensure optimal conditions for pre-mRNA detection. One µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 50 µl final reaction in presence of 0.4 µM oligodT(15) or random hexamer primers (for detection of pre-mRNA-s), 8 mM dNTP, 40 units of RNasine, and 400 units of M-MLV RTase H-minus (Promega), during 3 h at 37°C. Quantitative PCR was performed with a Roche LightCycler (mRNA-s) or an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (pre-mRNA-s) using the SYBR green detection protocol of the manufacturer.
