The Z ring forms at the division plane and is attached to the membrane. After assembly, it maintains a stable yet dynamic steady state. Once induced, the ring contracts and the membrane constricts. In this work, we present a computational deterministic biochemical model exhibiting this behavior. The model is based on biochemical features of FtsZ known from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, and it quantitatively reproduces relevant <italic>in vitro</italic> data. An essential part of the model is a consideration of interfacial reactions involving the cytosol volume, where monomeric FtsZ is dispersed, and the membrane surface in the cell's mid-zone where the ring is assembled. This approach allows the same chemical model to simulate either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions by adjusting only two geometrical parameters. The model includes minimal reactions, components, and assumptions, yet is able to reproduce sought-after <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior, including the rapid assembly of the ring via FtsZ-polymerization, the formation of a dynamic steady state in which GTP hydrolysis leads to the exchange of monomeric subunits between cytoplasm and the ring, and finally the induced contraction of the ring. The model gives a quantitative estimate for coupling between the rate of GTP hydrolysis and of FtsZ subunit turnover between the assembled ring and the cytoplasmic pool as observed. Membrane constriction is chemically driven by the strong tendency of GTP-bound FtsZ to self-assembly. The model suggests a possible mechanism of membrane contraction without a motor protein. The portion of the free energy of GTP hydrolysis released in cyclization is indirectly used in this energetically unfavorable process. The model provides a limit to the mechanistic complexity required to mimic ring behavior, and it highlights the importance of parallel <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> modeling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The division of a cell into two daughter cells is an essential characteristic of living systems. This process requires the assembly of a contractile ring attached to the membrane at the site of division. At the appropriate point of the cell cycle, the ring constricts and pulls the membrane with it, pinching the cell at the division plane and forming daughter cells. In bacteria, the ring is a polymer of the protein FtsZ. The biochemical features of the isolated FtsZ protein have been studied intensively, but how these features are related to the function of the ring in living cells is not clear. In this work, we mathematically modeled the dynamics of FtsZ ring assembly, steady-state maintenance, and contraction both inside and outside of a cellular environment. The model is extremely simple and includes only experimentally known features of the FtsZ protein. The model exhibited behavior associated with the FtsZ ring in living cells, indicating that no additional mechanistic features are needed to explain this behavior. Our systems biology approach has been successful in relating molecular-level chemical processes with cellular-level behavior. A similar approach might be used to develop an analogous model for the more complex contractile rings found in eukaryotic (e.g., human) cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the National Science Foundation (DMS-0714896).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the fundamental elements of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytokinesis is the assembly of a cytoskeletal ring at the future cell division plane. Such rings are attached to the cell membrane and, at the appropriate point in the cell division cycle, contract with the membrane to cause cell division. In prokaryotes, FtsZ is the key protein of this contractile ring. This homologue of the eukaryotic cytoskeletal protein tubulin is among the first proteins to localize at the division plane where it forms the polymeric core of the so-called <italic>Z ring</italic>. At subsequent steps during cytokinesis, at least ten others proteins are recruited to the ring and are involved in contraction in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Homologs of FtsZ appear to be found universally in almost all bacteria and archaea, but this is not the case for other <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins utilized in ring formation. Thus, it appears that the Z ring is a universal component of prokaryotic cytokinesis but that there are species-to-species differences regarding other aspects of the process. Given that an FtsZ homolog is found in wall-less prokaryotes such as <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>, the presence of a cell wall does not appear to be essential for this process.

The assembled ring is maintained for an extended period (up to 50 minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-DenBlaauwen1">[29]</xref>). Although the size of the ring appears to be constant, the ring itself is highly dynamic, undergoing fast exchange of subunits with FtsZ in the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Stricker1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Chen2">[34]</xref>.

These time intervals place qualitative constraints for kinetic models of <italic>E. coli</italic> cytokinesis (i.e. assembly should be far faster than contraction). The factors that control the timing of ring assembly and the commitment from one phase to another remain unknown, as do the factors that define the kinetics of assembly and contraction.</p><p>There are uncertainties as to whether the FtsZ features which are revealed through <italic>in vitro</italic> studies can be applied directly to understanding <italic>in vivo</italic> Z ring behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Weiss1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Michie1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Shih1">[8]</xref>. This uncertainty arises, to some extent, by the lack of a kinetic Z ring model capable of assuming both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. So far, only <italic>in vitro</italic> FtsZ polymerization kinetics have been analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Romberg2">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Romberg3">[13]</xref> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models have been proposed. The kinetic model suggested by Chen and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Chen1">[20]</xref> includes an activation step, a nucleation/dimerization step (with equilibrium constant <italic>K<sub>nuc</sub></italic>) and a series of favorable elongation steps (up to polymers of length 7, with <italic>K<sub>el</sub></italic>∼10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> <italic>K<sub>nuc</sub></italic>). In the steady state model considered by Gonzalez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Gonzalez2">[35]</xref>, polymerization was supposed to be isodesmic (i.e. <italic>K<sub>nuc</sub></italic> = <italic>K<sub>el</sub></italic>) and, in contrast to the model of Chen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Chen1">[20]</xref>, cyclization of FtsZ polymers was included. The equilibrium constant of cyclization <italic>K<sub>cyc</sub></italic> was greater than that associated with dimerization and elongation (i.e. <italic>K<sub>cyc</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>K<sub>el</sub></italic> [<italic>Fts</italic>Z]). Central to the model of Gonzales <italic>et al.</italic> is the assumption that cyclization will be most probable for polymers of a certain length while less probable for shorter or longer polymers. This is due to the intrinsic curvature of FtsZ polymers which leads to the probability that the ends of polymers of a particular length will be near to each other. The observation of FtsZ rings <italic>in vitro</italic> by EM and AFM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Gonzalez2">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Mingorance2">[36]</xref> demonstrates that cyclization occurs with preferred ring sizes. Proposed models were supported by stopped-flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Chen1">[20]</xref> and sedimentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Gonzalez2">[35]</xref> data and were invoked to interpret the apparent cooperativity of FtsZ assembly. But these models focused only on <italic>in vitro</italic> polymerization. Currently, there is no chemical kinetic Z ring model which would be useful in understanding mechanistically how the FtsZ ring functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. A study describing possible forces involved in contraction has recently appeared <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Lan1">[37]</xref> but no chemical/molecular aspects of FtsZ contraction were included.</p><p>In this study, we have developed a mechanistic model of the <italic/>Z ring that uses reactions established by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and exhibits <italic>in vivo</italic> desired behavior. Such behavior includes assembly, dynamic ring maintenance, and constriction. We have kept the model as simple as possible (i.e. a minimal number of reactions, components and assumptions) and have adhered closely to relevant experimental results. This minimal model semi-quantitatively reproduces the behavior observed for assembly, dynamic stability, and contraction of the Z ring in real cells. Interestingly, this behavior could be reproduced only when interfacial reactions involving the cytosol volume and the membrane surface were assumed. This model limits the mechanistic complexity required to mimic Z ring behavior and it highlights the utility of parallel <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> modeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Model</title><p>In this section we develop a biochemical kinetic model of the FtsZ ring with the behavior described in the <italic>Introduction</italic>.

First, it appears that the <italic>GTP</italic>/<italic>GDP</italic> ratio is essentially constant in real cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Shih1">[8]</xref>. Second, the total concentration of rings declines severely in the middle of the contraction process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g011">Fig. 11 <italic>B</italic></xref>). Although there are no quantitative experimental data on how the amount of FtsZ associated with the ring changes during contraction, we expect that the concentration of Z rings would not decline dramatically throughout this process.</p><p>Another approach to inducing contraction was to decrease polymerization rates, perhaps mimicking the effect of some hypothetical inhibitor. We simulated this by reducing the forward rate constants for nucleation, elongation and annealing (<italic>k<sub>nuc1</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>el1</sub></italic>, and <italic>k<sub>an</sub></italic>). All three rate constants were inhibited to the same relative extents, as might be expected for a situation in which a hypothetical protein binds to the open ends of Z<sub>T</sub> and to all Z<sub>i</sub>'s, thereby generating a form of FtsZ that is blocked from dimerizing, elongating and annealing. Reducing these rate constants 5-, 10-, or 20-fold induced ring contraction within a period of 2–5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g010">Fig. 10 <italic>B</italic></xref>), with the rate of contraction faster when the rate-constant-reduction was more severe. (The assumed absence of inhibition for cyclization could be viewed as an oversimplification. Thus, we have considered an expanded model with 2 annealing rate constants – one for cytoplasmic components (<italic>k<sub>an1</sub></italic>) and one for membrane components (<italic>k<sub>an2</sub></italic>). We assumed inhibition of the components exclusively in the cytoplasm by simultaneously reducing <italic>k<sub>nuc1</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>el1</sub></italic>, and <italic>k<sub>an1</sub></italic>. In this case, the FtsZ ring contracted similarly to that reported with the original model.)</p><p>The time-dependent distributions of open and cyclized polymers for the case where rate constants were reduced 5-fold are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g011">Fig. 11 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>, respectively. As a result of this inhibition, a sizable proportion of FtsZ proteins become dimers. However, a significant portion remains as relatively long polymers, more so than by shifting the <italic>GTP</italic>/<italic>GDP</italic> ratio. This difference appears to be primarily responsible for the greater concentration of cyclized rings which remain during the contraction process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g011">Fig. 11 <italic>D</italic></xref>). This “inhibitor controlled” contraction mechanism retains Z rings at a higher concentration and thus is more likely to occur in real cells.</p><p>Although the rates of contraction were similar for the different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g010">Fig. 10, <italic>A vs. B</italic></xref>), the shapes of the two plots were somewhat different. The plot arising from the inhibitor-controlled contraction mechanism decreased in a simple pseudo-exponential fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g010">Fig. 10 <italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>inset</italic>) whereas that arising from the metabolite-controlled contraction mechanism was somewhat sigmoidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g010">Fig. 10 <italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>inset</italic>). Such differences might arise from the step within the mechanism which is controlled. In the metabolite-controlled mechanism, the nucleotide exchange reaction is perturbed, and it takes time for this perturbation to “work its way” through the system and influence ring size. In the inhibitor-controlled mechanism, the reactions directly involved in polymerization are perturbed, which more immediately influences ring size.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have formulated a deterministic kinetic model for the assembly, dynamic maintenance, and contraction of the FtsZ ring. The model was designed at the biochemical level and with minimal complexity. By this we mean that the fewest reactions, components and assumptions necessary to achieve the desired behavior were used. Of the six reactions included, one serves to activate/deactivate FtsZ (GTP/GDP exchange), three reactions largely provide for the growth of polymers (nucleation, elongation, and annealing), one reaction is responsible for ring formation (cyclization), and one primarily functions in ring contraction but it also maintains the ring in a dynamic and responsive steady state (hydrolysis tied to the expulsion of FtsZ units from polymers). Once the Z ring is formed, its size becomes self-regulated. Simulations of the model were compared against pertinent experimental <italic>in vitro</italic> results and <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior. The overall kinetic behavior exhibited by the model simulations was semi-quantitatively similar to that observed for the assembly, stability, and contraction of the Z ring in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In our simulations, ring assembly occurred in seconds, whereas contraction required minutes, consistent with experiment. As we discuss below, a portion of the energy released during GTP hydrolysis is probably used to drive these processes.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Design of the Biochemical Mechanism Assumed by the Model</title><p>The biochemical steps in the model were inspired largely by previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Chen and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Chen1">[20]</xref> used a kinetic model of FtsZ assembly that included FtsZ activation (analogous to GTP/GDP exchange in our model), nucleation, and elongation. Their model was used to analyze fluorescence stopped-flow data for the <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly, in a physiological buffer, of an FtsZ mutant for which fluorescence was enhanced upon polymerization. Their model considered only polymers with lengths up to 7 subunits whereas our model includes three additional reactions and polymers as long as 150 monomeric units. Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Gonzalez2">[35]</xref> considered a steady state model that included polymerization and cyclization reactions analogous to those included here. Neglecting hydrolysis and annealing steps allowed them to derive an analytical expression for polymer distribution at steady state. Based on a qualitative comparison of simulations to analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation data, they concluded that the cyclization equilibrium constant is much stronger than that for polymerization. They also introduced the idea that FtsZ polymers have a flexible intrinsic curvature and that the probability of cyclization should depend on the length of the polymer <italic>i</italic>. Within our model we expand on these ideas by assuming that current membrane circumference dictates which open polymer length <italic>i</italic><sub>0</sub> is optimal for cyclization, and that the forward rate constant of the cyclization reaction is sensitive to polymer length.</p><p>In both previous kinetic and steady state models, GTP hydrolysis was neglected. As we have shown, this reaction is relevant for both the initial stage of assembly and at later stages as polymers elongate. Hydrolysis also influences the steady state system achieved, in terms of polymer distribution, the fraction of FtsZ that polymerizes, and the averaged length of filaments.</p><p>Annealing plays an important role in FtsZ assembly by generating long polymers. That this reaction occurs during FtsZ ring assembly had been proposed previously but it had not been included in any published biochemical mechanism. Annealing reflects the same fundamental tendency of FtsZ to self-association as is responsible for dimerization and elongation reactions. Thus, for consistency, annealing should be included (unless it is argued that annealing may be slower than these other processes and thus could be ignored). We found that annealing shifts polymer distributions <italic>in vitro</italic> toward longer polymers, which is important to achieve rings of appropriate size during <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly. Using AFM, Mingorance <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Mingorance2">[36]</xref> observed annealing and breakage of the FtsZ filaments <italic>in vitro</italic>, which demonstrates that these processes should be included in models.</p><p>With the chosen rate constants, our model predicts the same effect of GTP hydrolysis on the critical concentrations for FtsZ assembly close to those reported, namely an increase in critical concentration with faster hydrolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Huecas1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Gonzalez1">[21]</xref>. It also predicts a shift in the average size of FtsZ polymers with changes in the rate of hydrolysis similar to that measured by the Erickson group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Romberg2">[12]</xref>. Mimicking this shift qualitatively required both hydrolysis and annealing steps. By shutting off the hydrolysis reaction <italic>in silico</italic>, our model qualitatively reproduces the kinetics of stopped-flow experiments that were carried out in the absence of hydrolysis (in buffer lacking Mg). The model predicts that the system reaches steady state slower in the absence of the hydrolysis reaction, similar to the results and conclusion of the original works.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Additional Features and Assumptions for Modeling the Z Ring <italic>In Vivo</italic></title><p>After successfully testing the model using available <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we applied exactly the same biochemical mechanism, including the same rate constants, to the analogous <italic>in vivo</italic> situation. A number of additional assumptions were required for an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, the most important of which was that the Z ring could assemble only within a narrow mid-zone region of a cell membrane. Our current model does not include a mechanism for such localization, but this is thought to involve the MinCDE system and/or nucleoid occlusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Errington1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Romberg1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Margolin1">[6]</xref>. Nor does our model consider the mechanism that controls the <italic>timing</italic> of cytokinesis events, including the assembly, steady state maintenance, and contraction of the Z ring. We suppose that features of FtsZ alone determine the dynamics of the Z ring, while progression from one phase to another is independently controlled. As such we have not modeled the commitment from one phase to the next. Rather, we modeled each phase of ring dynamics separately. Indeed, our results show that the FtsZ system alone might be responsible for the observed kinetics of assembly and contraction. Our model implies that such control might be realized by an inhibitor (or several inhibitors) of polymerization. Then, a drop in the concentration of such an inhibitor might lead to Z ring assembly. A subsequent increase in the inhibitor concentration (or in the concentrations of other similarly-acting species) might induce ring contraction. Lastly, our model does not include the final step in cytokinesis – namely cell scission. There are probably additional processes required to accomplish this.</p><p>A third major assumption of our model is that FtsZ polymers of lengths greater than dimers are attached to the membrane, which in reality, might be realized through interactions with other proteins such as FtsA and/or ZipA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-CarballidoLopez1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Margolin1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Shih1">[8]</xref>. Since we did not consider mechanisms of attachment explicitly, we simply assumed that all trimers and higher polymers are surface-bound. To assess whether this assumption of a “critical” length for membrane attachment is important in the behavior of the model, we performed simulations of a modified model in which only pentamers and higher polymers were attached to the membrane and shorter polymers were localized to the cytosol; no differences in qualitative behavior were observed with only minor changes in quantitative behavior (<italic>i.e.</italic> the cytosolic fraction was shifted from 20% to 22%).</p><p>A fourth set of assumptions in our model involved the cyclization reaction. We assumed that the rate constant for cyclization varies with the length of the reacting open polymer. Prior to Z ring formation, the optimal length for cyclization (<italic>i</italic><sub>0</sub>) is a fixed parameter external to the dynamical system and dictated by the circumference of the membrane. After the Z ring (or rings) form(s), Eq. 5c is applied, such that the optimal length for the synthesis of new Z rings <italic>i</italic><sub>0</sub> is dictated by the average size of existing Z rings, which in turn is dictated by the dynamics of the system. Thus, after the ring assembly, <italic>i</italic><sub>0</sub> becomes an internal parameter for the FtsZ system – i.e. controlled by the current state of the system.</p><p>The combination of Eq. 5b with 5c prevents the optimal cyclization length <italic>i</italic><sub>0</sub> from changing dramatically when a single Z ring opens. There are several possible mechanisms which could provide this. Firstly, cyclization might be much faster than the time of the membrane remodeling. Secondly, several Z rings could form at any given moment, and one such ring could open (and shorten) while the remaining rings maintain the membrane at the current circumference. A third mechanism involves cell wall synthesis. If the FtsZ ring opens, the rigid cell wall could keep the membrane at a relatively stable circumference. Once the FtsZ ring opens and incrementally squeezes, the cell wall would remodel to the new circumference. If this last mechanism is realized, the stable steady state required in the FtsZ model might not be necessary. This would be the case since Eq. 5c is only valid when the cell wall synthesis machinery is assembled, which may permit ring contraction. However, this cell-wall-remodeling mechanism seems less likely since there are wall-less cells - <italic>viz</italic>. Mycoplasma - which contain an FtsZ homolog and almost certainly divide by a mechanism similar to that used by other FtsZ-containing cells.</p><p>We used a Gaussian function to describe the <italic>i</italic>-dependence of <italic>k<sub>cyc</sub></italic>(<italic>i</italic>) implying a symmetric minimum in the chemical potential around <italic>i</italic><sub>0</sub>. We considered an asymmetric potential as a possible expansion of the model, but this did not change the qualitative behavior of the system significantly, although it helped to stabilize self-regulated rings.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Model Simplicity</title><p>We tried to keep our model of the Z ring as simple as possible. Since such a minimal model exhibits the desired behavior, extra features that are not included in the model appeare to be unnecessary in generating this behavior. One simplifying assumption was that Z<sub>D</sub> monomers do not polymerize. Under some experimental conditions, GDP-bound FtsZ polymers have been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Lu2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Huecas1">[19]</xref>. However, the affinity between units was much less than for GTP-bound units, which resulted in very short polymers. This suggests that GDP-bound FtsZ polymers may not have any physiological significance, and so we have ignored this type of polymer in our model. Consistent with this, we also assumed that any FtsZ polymer containing a GDP-bound unit will fragment as a Z<sub>D</sub> unit is expelled.</p><p>Another simplification of our model involved neglecting GTP/GDP exchange within assembled FtsZ polymers. In contrast to the tubulin dimer structure, nucleotides bound within the FtsZ dimer are not completely occluded by the protein surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Oliva1">[14]</xref>. On this basis, it has been proposed that the opening is large enough for nucleotides to pass into and out-of the active site, allowing GTP/GDP exchange to occur in FtsZ polymers. We examined the potential importance of this polymer-level GTP/GDP exchange reaction by expanding our current model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000102.s003">Text S1</xref>). This expansion did not lead to any major additional critical behavior (data not shown), though it does allow us to explain the observed coupling between rates of GTP hydrolysis and FtsZ subunit turnover (see below).</p><p>Another simplifying assumption of our model was that χ was considered to be a constant. In the future, we plan to relax this assumption by incorporating our FtsZ model within a growing and dividing whole-cell model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Surovtsev1">[38]</xref>. Nor does our model consider bundling or overlapping of FtsZ filaments. There is a modicum of experimental evidence for bundling, but no functional properties have been established. There has been speculation that such bundles cause cooperative behavior and that they might be involved in the mechanism of contraction. Our results show that bundling or overlapping is not required for Z ring constriction <italic>per se</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations of the Model</title><p>In this study, we have described the chemical kinetics of the FtsZ system by applying deterministic equations based on the law of mass action which is valid when reacting species are abundant. To make <italic>quantitative</italic> predictions of behavior an <italic>in vivo</italic> kinetic model should take into account low copy-numbers of species present in real cells and the confined space of real cells. Using deterministic kinetics allowed us to simplify the problem relative to a stochastic treatment, but it should be viewed as a “stepping stone” toward a more comprehensive quantitative model of Z ring dynamics based on a stochastic treatment. Such treatments use deterministic rate constants as inputs in estimating probabilities of reactions. With a viable set of values in hand, it should be possible to “stochasti-size” our model and determine whether the modeling approach (deterministic <italic>vs.</italic> stochastic) influences the stability of the rings, alters the polymer distribution, or modifies dynamical behavior. Another consideration would involve the introduction of fractionary-order kinetics due to interfacial reactions and/or macromolecular crowding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Schnell1">[43]</xref>.</p><p>Although many of the kinetic parameters used in this model have been estimated from experimental results, others were adjusted so as to achieve desired behavior. Through this process, we have noticed that more than one set of parameters, when used in conjunction with our model, is able to achieve the same desired qualitative behavior. Thus, our model and parameter set are not unique. Further restrictions of these parameters will require fitting to additional experimental results and perhaps model expansion.</p><p>We applied quasi steady state conditions to all intermediates of the form {Z<sub>j</sub>Z<sub>d</sub>Z<sub>i−j−1</sub>} (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g001">Fig. 1 R6</xref>). This allowed us to eliminate such species from ODEs and to avoid considering all polymers with higher number of GDP-bound FtsZ units in the chain (such as Z<sub>j</sub>Z<sub>d</sub>Z<sub>d</sub>Z<sub>i−j−2</sub>). This is a simplification of reality, but it made our analysis possible. Also, the collective experimental evidence suggests that this simplification does not deviate much from reality. As mentioned above, GDP-bound FtsZ polymers disassemble quickly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Margolin1">[6]</xref>, and Romberg and Mitchison determined that about 80% of FtsZ in polymers are in the GTP-bound form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Romberg3">[13]</xref>.

By increasing the cyclization rate (or by decreasing the polymerization rate), the system shifts such that the dominant flux forms a saw-tooth pattern which results in ring contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g010">Fig. 10 <italic>C</italic></xref>).

Such “loose” coupling can be explained by an expanded model which includes nucleotide exchange reactions in polymers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000102.s003">Text S1</xref>). With these reactions included, there is no requirement that every GTP hydrolysis event must lead to polymer fragmentation since GTP can substitute for GDP within unstable intermediate Z<sub>j</sub>Z<sub>D</sub>Z<sub>i−j−1</sub> polymers. This substitution stabilizes the polymer and prevents fragmentation, resulting in loose coupling. Moreover, using the expression for fragmentation rate given in Eq.

At any given time, only ∼3 open polymers participate significantly in cyclization, including the polymer closest to <italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic> and the polymers one subunit longer or shorter (see inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g002">Fig. 2 <italic>D</italic></xref>). If <italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic> is close to a natural number (e.g. <italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic>≈100), then cyclization of the corresponding Z<sub>i</sub> (i.e. Z<sub>100</sub>→Z<sup>cyc</sup><sub>100</sub>) dominates, and the system tends to maintain the same <italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic>. However, if <italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic> is staggered between natural numbers (e.g. <italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic>≈99.5), there are two equally strong cyclization processes (Z<sub>99</sub>→Z<sup>cyc</sup><sub>99</sub> and Z<sub>100</sub>→Z<sup>cyc</sup><sub>100</sub>). Since hydrolysis of the Z ring always leads to an open polymer one subunit shorter than the ring (Z<sup>cyc</sup><sub>100</sub>→Z<sub>99</sub>), this will shift the flux from bigger rings to smaller ones (Z<sup>cyc</sup><sub>100</sub>→Z<sup>cyc</sup><sub>99</sub>), which will cause further changes in <italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic>. So, the decline in <italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic> leads the system from a metastable state (<italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic>≈100) to a non-stable state (<italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic>≈99.5), until <italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic> approaches the next natural number (<italic>i<sup>cyc</sup><sub>av</sub></italic>≈99), in which case the system returns to a metastable state. The process repeats to afford the observed pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g009">Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g010">Fig. 10</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Advantages of the Model</title><p>Although our kinetic model is based on previous models describing FtsZ assembly, it extends well beyond these earlier models. Specifically, ours is the first to include not only FtsZ ring assembly as a behavioral target, but also dynamic stability and contraction. It may also be the most tested model of its kind, in that we have tried to simulate all pertinent published results using it. Our simulations mimic these results with various degrees of fidelity, ranging from highly qualitative to semi-quantitative.</p><p>That the model was constructed to be of minimal complexity is also significant, because it is now clear that no reactions besides the six that we have included are needed to achieve the behavior described here. Including other reactions will be required to mimic more complex behavior (e.g. how the ring is positioned and attached to the membrane) or to regulate the transition from one state of the ring to the next (i.e. assembly → stability → contraction), but doing so is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>The model is the first to consider both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings for these processes, and an ability to switch easily between these settings. We used the same set of rate constants for both settings. Quantitative biochemical information is generally available only for <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. This raises the issue of whether this information can be transferred to <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. The successful <italic>in vivo</italic> modeling of FtsZ behavior as demonstrated here, using the same mechanism and kinetic parameters, suggests that this is indeed the case.</p><p>With our approach, we need only change χ and σ to switch between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings. χ is the surface-to-volume ratio which must be included in rate expression terms for particular species that are involved in interfacial reactions. In a previous study we found that these modifications of rate law expressions are required to accurately model interfacial reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Surovtsev1">[38]</xref>. In real cells, the processes of FtsZ ring assembly, stability and contraction <italic>must</italic> include interfacial reactions, since the monomeric units of the ring are synthesized by ribosomes in the cytosol whereas the ring itself and undoubtedly some (or all) open polymers are surface-bound. The unknown issue here is the step of the process for which interfacial reactions should begin. In our model, we assume that monomer and dimer FtsZ units are volume-bound whereas trimers and longer FtsZ polymers are surface bound.</p><p>The importance of interfacial considerations is highlighted by the very different behavior observed when <italic>in vitro</italic> vs. <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions are assumed. When <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions are assumed, the distribution of open polymers favors longer polymers and the concentration of cyclized polymers is dramatically higher. This difference arises due to the small value of χ assumed, which leads to an “effective” increase in the concentrations of polymers on the surface mid-zone. It is generally tempting to attribute any and all differences between <italic>in vitro</italic> vs. <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior to the presence of additional (often unknown) proteins or metabolites under <italic>in vivo</italic> settings and their absence under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. Our study suggests that some observed differences in behavior may simply arise from differences in the <italic>geometry</italic> of the system. With regard to our particular model, the possibility that FtsZ polymers which are assembled <italic>in vitro</italic> may actually involved interfacial reactions (e.g. polymers may form exclusively on the surface of the reaction vessel) should also be considered. If this were the case, reported rate constants may need to be recalculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Driving Force of Z Ring Contraction</title><p>Many issues remain regarding cytokinesis in prokaryotes, including identifying the force which drives membrane constriction, describing mechanistically how the Z ring functions during this process, and the overall role of the Z ring in membrane constriction. Several mechanisms of Z ring contraction have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Errington1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Romberg1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Margolin1">[6]</xref>. Analogous to those of the eukaryotic contractile ring, relatively short FtsZ filaments may slide against each other without disassembling, driven by an unidentified motor protein. Another possibility is that the bending of FtsZ filaments (resulting from the hydrolysis of GTP) drives constriction. Alternatively, FtsZ subunits may be expelled from the ring without loss of ring integrity, thereby causing constriction. Finally, a pinching force provided by inward growth of the septum wall may be involved in constriction. In this case, the Z ring would passively contract ahead of the wall invagination and would serve only as a scaffold protein for the divisiome machinery. Although our model is compatible with the latter two cases, we suggest below another mechanism of contraction.</p><p>Until recently, the sliding model has been most popular despite the fact that no motor protein associated with the Z ring has been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Amos1">[44]</xref>. Osawa and Erickson recently demonstrated that FtsZ from divergent species can successfully operate in <italic>E. coli</italic>, despite low sequence identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Osawa1">[45]</xref>. Although their results did not eliminate the sliding mechanism completely, they made it unlikely. Osawa and Erickson suggest that a hypothetical motor protein is unnecessary and that “FtsZ may generate the constriction force through <italic>self-interactions</italic>, not requiring interaction with downstream cell division proteins”. Our model supports their suggestion, as it does not include other proteins (motoring or otherwise) yet the Z ring can contract. Our model provides an explicit biochemical mechanism which could serve as a possible set of “self-interactions”.</p><p>What drives contraction within our model is the high affinity of GTP-FtsZ to self-assembly which results in a non-zero probability of cyclization at suboptimal length. GTP hydrolysis opens and shortens the ring by one subunit. There are two main scenarios regarding what will happen with this open ring. Elongation by one subunit followed by rapid cyclization will restore the initial ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g012">Fig. 12 <italic>B</italic></xref>). Alternatively, immediate cyclization after ring opening will result in a ring one subunit smaller then the initial one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g012">Fig. 12 <italic>C</italic></xref>). The probability of such suboptimal cyclization is non-zero, although it is lower than that for cyclization of an optimally-sized polymer. This is so because cyclization requires membrane remodeling, and thus is energetically suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g012">Fig. 12 <italic>C</italic></xref>). These two alternative pathways are competing, and at steady state addition of GTP-FtsZ monomers is more likely which leads to the appearance of a stable ring. Once the probability of monomer addition is suppressed (i.e. by lowering GTP/GDP ratio or by inhibition of <italic>k<sub>el</sub></italic>), this balance between hydrolysis/elongation/cyclization is upset, and suboptimal cyclization dominates which results in ring contraction.</p><p>Cyclization occurs when the free ends of the polymer contact each other due to thermal motion. Eq. 5c with the distribution for the forward cyclization rate (meaning also the distribution for <italic>K<sub>cyc</sub></italic>) implies that the conformation of polymers in which open ends are in contact are less favorable for polymers of non-optimal length. But once these ends are close to each other, the probability to form a closed structure is high. The probability of finding open ends in proximity depends on two factors: the distance between the ends and work necessary to bend the membrane and pull the two ends close together. In this study, we considered two distributions for cyclization rate, including σ = 10 (<italic>in vitro</italic>) and σ = 0.5 (<italic>in vivo</italic>). Although forces are not considered explicitly in our model, using the narrow distribution for the <italic>in vivo</italic> case implies that there is work used for membrane bending. However, this distribution is also influenced by a geometrical factor describing changes in available conformations of the ring, such that the work contribution cannot be quantified.</p><p>Such a process of Z ring contraction utilizes the energy of GTP hydrolysis indirectly to constrict the membrane. The energy of each GTP hydrolysis event is released in several steps. Initially, energy is stored in the form of energetically enriched GTP-FtsZ (Z<sub>T</sub> compared to Z<sub>D</sub>, with Δ<italic>G<sub>GTP</sub></italic> representing the difference in energy per molecule of FtsZ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g012">Fig. 12 <italic>D</italic></xref>). A portion of Δ<italic>G<sub>GTP</sub></italic> is released in a spontaneous elongation reaction, when Z<sub>T</sub> units attach to a growing open polymer. Another portion is released when the polymer cyclizes. A Z ring of length <italic>i</italic> can be viewed as being “high-energy” relative to <italic>i</italic> Z<sub>D</sub> units but lower energy than <italic>i</italic> Z<sub>T</sub> units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g012">Fig. 12 <italic>D</italic></xref>). What remains of Δ<italic>G<sub>GTP</sub></italic> is released when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP and a Z<sub>D</sub> unit is expelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g012">Fig. 12 <italic>D</italic></xref>). Only the portion of Δ<italic>G<sub>GTP</sub></italic> which is released in cyclization at suboptimal length is coupled to unfavorable membrane constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000102-g012">Fig. 12 B</xref>), and thus is the chemical force of contraction within this scheme. Another critical role of GTP hydrolysis is to make the ring unstable which together with the changes in the conditions (with decreased probability of elongation) provides the direction for changes in ring size. Cyclization “locks” the new conformation of the rings which then becomes the current state for the system. The process repeats until ring contraction ceases.</p><p>Given the equilibrium constant for the cyclization reaction used in our simulations (<italic>K<sub>cyc</sub></italic> = 150) the apparent force provided by such a mechanism can be estimated. The free energy change is Δ<italic>G<sub>cyc</sub></italic> = −<italic>k<sub>b</sub>T</italic>ln<italic>K<sub>cyc</sub></italic>≈2×10<sup>−20</sup> J. (<italic>k<sub>b</sub></italic> and <italic>T</italic> are Boltzmann gas constant and absolute temperature with values 1.38×10<sup>−23</sup> J/K and 300 K, respectively). One reaction event would shorten a ring by one subunit, thus the maximum force generated would be <italic>F</italic> = Δ<italic>G<sub>cyc</sub></italic>/<italic>d</italic>≈5 pN (<italic>d</italic> = 4 nm is the length of a monomer). This is a lower limit of the force available for contraction, since we used a modest value of <italic>K<sub>cyc</sub></italic> (compared to 10<sup>4</sup> assumed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Gonzalez2">[35]</xref>). Recently, Lan <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000102-Lan1">[37]</xref> considered the mechanics of cytokinesis for bacteria with a cell wall. By considering the material parameters of the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell wall, they concluded that a force as small as 8 pN would be sufficient to enforce contraction. Within their model a small force provided by the ring leads to incremental invagination of the plasma membrane which is then followed by remodeling of a rigid cell wall. They assumed a constant force generated by the Z ring, but did not detail the molecular origin of that force. The model presented here provides a molecular mechanism of how the known chemical features of the FtsZ protein, including GTPase activity, could result in such a force. Besides indicating forces of the same magnitude, the time of contraction exhibited by their model (∼300 s) is similar to those reported here. Thus, these two models are <italic>absolutely compatible</italic> in describing prokaryotic cytokinesis, with the model of Lan <italic>et al.</italic> treating the mechanics of contraction and our model treating the chemical mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study presented here demonstrates that currently known biochemical reactivity and physical properties of the FtsZ protein (as revealed by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies) are sufficient to afford observed <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior. Such behavior includes the assembly of the Z ring, maintenance of the ring in a dynamic steady state, and contraction of the ring. Within this minimal system, Z ring contraction does not require motor proteins and is driven by the strong tendency of GTP-bound FtsZ proteins to self-assemble. This model provides a foundation upon which a more comprehensive understanding of bacterial cytokinesis can be investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000102.s001" mimetype="image/tiff" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000102.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Polymer distributions <italic>in vitro</italic> as a function of total FtsZ concentrations.
