        <p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Candida albicans</named-content> is the most common cause of hematogenously disseminated and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Both of these diseases are characterized by fungal invasion of host cells. Previously, we have found that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> hyphae invade endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells in vitro by inducing their own endocytosis. Therefore, we set out to identify the fungal surface protein and host cell receptors that mediate this process. We found that the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> Als3 is required for the organism to be endocytosed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells and two different human oral epithelial lines. Affinity purification experiments with wild-type and an <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ mutant strain of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> demonstrated that Als3 was required for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to bind to multiple host cell surface proteins, including N-cadherin on endothelial cells and E-cadherin on oral epithelial cells. Furthermore, latex beads coated with the recombinant N-terminal portion of Als3 were endocytosed by Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human N-cadherin or E-cadherin, whereas control beads coated with bovine serum albumin were not. Molecular modeling of the interactions of the N-terminal region of Als3 with the ectodomains of N-cadherin and E-cadherin indicated that the binding parameters of Als3 to either cadherin are similar to those of cadherin–cadherin binding. Therefore, Als3 is a fungal invasin that mimics host cell cadherins and induces endocytosis by binding to N-cadherin on endothelial cells and E-cadherin on oral epithelial cells. These results uncover the first known fungal invasin and provide evidence that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> Als3 is a molecular mimic of human cadherins.</p>

          <p>The fungus <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Candida albicans</named-content> is usually a harmless colonizer of human mucosal surfaces. In the mouth, it can cause oropharyngeal candidiasis, also called thrush. In hospitalized and immunocompromised patients, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> can enter the blood stream and be carried throughout the body to cause a disseminated infection, which is associated with a mortality rate of up to 40%. The organism invades the epithelial cell lining of the mouth during oropharyngeal candidiasis and invades the endothelial cell lining of the blood vessels during disseminated candidiasis. We discovered that Als3, a protein expressed on the surface of <italic>C. albicans,</italic> is required for this invasion process. Cadherins on the surface of human cells normally bind other cadherins for adhesion and signaling; however, we found that Als3 also binds to cadherins on endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells, and this binding induces these host cells to take up the fungus. The structure of Als3 is predicted to be quite similar to that of the two cadherins studied, and the parameters of the binding of Als3 to either cadherin are similar to those of cadherin–cadherin binding. These results suggest that Als3 is a functional and structural mimic of human cadherins, and provide new insights into how <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> invades host cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The fungus <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Candida albicans</named-content> causes both hematogenously disseminated and oropharyngeal disease. During the initiation of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, blood-borne organisms invade the endothelial cell lining of the vasculature to infect deeper tissues. Fungal invasion of the superficial oral epithelial cells is also characteristic of oropharyngeal candidiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b003">3</xref>]. The invasion of either endothelial or oral epithelial cells by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> is necessary for the organism to damage these cell types in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b005">5</xref>]. Host cell invasion and damage are likely critical virulence attributes of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> because mutants with defects in these processes in vitro are highly likely to have attenuated virulence in experimental animal models of hematogenously disseminated or oropharyngeal candidiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b008">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Because of the importance of host cell invasion in the pathogenesis of candidiasis, we have been investigating the mechanism by which this process occurs. Previously, we have found that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> invades both endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells in vitro by inducing its own endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b007">7</xref>]. Endothelial cell endocytosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> is induced when the organism binds to N-cadherin and other endothelial cell surface proteins. This binding induces microfilament rearrangement, which results in the formation of pseudopods that engulf the organism and draw it into the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b010">10</xref>]. Endothelial cell endocytosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> is dependent on extracellular calcium and is governed at least in part by the tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial cell proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b011">11</xref>].</p>
      <p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> is a dimorphic fungus that can grow as either ovoid-shaped blastospores or as filamentous hyphae. The ability to reversibly change between blastospores and hyphae is a key virulence factor for this fungus, and mutants that are unable to form hyphae have greatly attenuated virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b013">13</xref>]. We have found previously that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> mutants with defects in the signal transduction pathways that govern hyphal formation have a significantly reduced capacity to invade both endothelial and oral epithelial cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b007">7</xref>]. Furthermore, studies with killed organisms indicate that induction of endocytosis is passive on the part of the organism because killed hyphae are endocytosed as avidly as are live hyphae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b007">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>An important, yet-unanswered question from these studies has been the identity of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> surface structure(s) that induces host cell endocytosis. Numerous other medically important fungi such as <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Rhizopus oryzae</named-content> invade normally nonphagocytic host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b018">18</xref>]. Remarkably, no fungal surface protein that induces fungal uptake by these host cells has been identified. Discovering such an invasin-like protein is important not only for its biological significance, but also because it could serve as a therapeutic or vaccine target.</p>
      <p>In bacterial pathogens, proteins that mediate host cell invasion frequently also function as adhesins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b019">19</xref>]. In <italic>C. albicans,</italic> a major group of adhesins consists of the proteins encoded by the <italic>ALS</italic> gene family. This gene family encodes eight GPI-linked cell surface proteins that mediate binding to diverse host substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b025">25</xref>]. Each Als protein has three domains. The N-terminal domain contains the substrate-binding region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b026">26</xref>]. The central portion of the protein consists of a variable number of 36–amino acid tandem repeats. The C-terminal domain is rich in serine and threonine, and contains a GPI anchorage sequence that is predicted to be cleaved as the protein is exported to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b020">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Computer-assisted modeling of the N-termini of Als1, Als3, and Als5 predicts the presence of antiparallel β sheets that define the immunoglobulin superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>]. This prediction has been substantiated by circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis of the N-terminus of Als1 and Als5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b027">27</xref>]. Interestingly, the predicted 3-D structures of the N-termini of many Als proteins are remarkably similar to the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</named-content> invasin, a protein that induces the endocytosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Y. pseudotuberculosis</named-content> by mammalian epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b029">29</xref>]. This relationship led us to investigate whether any of the Als proteins could induce host cell endocytosis. We found that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> expressing Als3 were avidly endocytosed by endothelial cells. Similar experiments suggested that Als1 and Als5 could also induce endocytosis, although with considerably less efficiency than Als3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the current study, we investigated the role of Als1 and Als3 in inducing the endocytosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> by both endothelial and oral epithelial cells. We discovered that Als3, and to a lesser extent Als1, induce endocytosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> by binding to N-cadherin on endothelial cells and E-cadherin on oral epithelial cells. Furthermore, computer-assisted molecular modeling of the binding of Als3 with N- and E-cadherin suggests that Als3 is a structural and functional mimic of these cadherins.</p>

        <title>Als3 Is Necessary for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to Bind to N-Cadherin on Endothelial Cells and E-Cadherin on Oral Epithelial Cells</title>
        <p>Endocytosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> by endothelial cells is induced when the organism binds to N-cadherin on the endothelial cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b009">9</xref>]. We used an affinity purification approach to determine whether Als1 or Als3 was required for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> hyphae to bind to N-cadherin in endothelial cell membrane extracts. As predicted by the results of the endocytosis assay, the <italic>als1</italic>Δ/<italic>als1</italic>Δ mutant bound to the same endothelial cell surface proteins, including N-cadherin, as did the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). In contrast, the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant did not bind to N-cadherin, and it bound very weakly to the other endothelial cell surface proteins. This defect in binding to N-cadherin was reversed when the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant was complemented with a wild-type copy of <italic>ALS3</italic>. Therefore, Als3 is required for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to bind to N-cadherin and other proteins on the endothelial cell surface.</p>
        <p>The surface proteins on oral epithelial cells that are bound by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> hyphae have not been identified previously. We found that the wild-type strain of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> bound to at least four different proteins on the surface of FaDu oral epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Many of these proteins appeared to be different from the endothelial cell proteins that were bound by wild-type <italic>C. albicans.</italic> FaDu oral epithelial cells express very low levels of N-cadherin (unpublished data), but high levels of E-cadherin. Therefore, we investigated whether E-cadherin was one of the epithelial cell proteins that was bound by <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Using an anti-E-cadherin monoclonal antibody, we detected a significant amount of this protein in immunoblots of epithelial cell membrane proteins that were bound by hyphae of wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Furthermore, although the <italic>als1</italic>Δ/<italic>als1</italic>Δ mutant still bound to E-cadherin, the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant did not.</p>
        <p>To verify that these results were not specific to the FaDu oral epithelial cell line, we repeated these experiments using the OKF6/TERT-2 cell line. This cell line was developed by the forced expression of the human telomerase catalytic subunit in oral mucosal keratinocytes obtained from a healthy adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b030">30</xref>]. The <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant was endocytosed poorly by OKF6/TERT-2 cells and bound poorly to the surface proteins, including E-cadherin, of this cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050064-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> bound to similar surface proteins of both OKF6/TERT-2 and FaDu epithelial cells. Collectively, these results indicate that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> hyphae bind to epithelial cell E-cadherin in an Als3-dependent manner.</p>
        <p>When <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> interacts with the oral epithelium in vivo, the organisms are coated with saliva, which has been reported to either inhibit or enhance the adherence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to oral epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b032">32</xref>]. Also, it is possible that salivary proteins could potentially act as bridging molecules between the hyphae and oral epithelial cells and thereby facilitate endocytosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content>. To investigate these possibilities, we incubated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> hyphae in the presence and absence of 20% saliva and then measured their interactions with both intact FaDu oral epithelial cells and oral epithelial cell surface proteins. Killed organisms were used in these experiments to obviate potential effects of saliva on the growth of the hyphae. We have previously shown that killed hyphae adhere to and are endocytosed by oral epithelial cells similarly to live hyphae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b005">5</xref>]. Incubating hyphae in saliva prior to adding them to the epithelial cells had no effect on the number of endocytosed or cell-associated organisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050064-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). As predicted by the endocytosis assay, saliva also had no detectable effect on the binding of epithelial cell surface proteins, including E-cadherin, to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> hyphae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050064-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050064-sg002">S2</xref>C). Therefore, salivary components do not act as bridging molecules between the organisms and epithelial cells.</p>
        <p>Next, we confirmed that oral isolates of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> other than those derived from the oral strain SC5314 also bound to E-cadherin and were endocytosed by FaDu oral epithelial cells. Two additional strains that had been obtained from patients with AIDS who had oropharyngeal candidiasis were tested in our assays. Hyphae of these strains were endocytosed similarly by the oral epithelial cells, although strain 7392 had slightly higher adherence to these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Also, all strains bound to the same oral epithelial cell surface proteins, including E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g002">2</xref>C). To verify that that these strains expressed Als3 on their surface, we used flow cytometry with an Als3-specific polyclonal antiserum. As expected, all wild-type strains had detectable Als3 on their surface, whereas the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p>

        <p>Next, we verified that binding of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> hyphae to N-cadherin and E-cadherin on the surface of intact host cells required Als3 and was associated with induction of endocytosis. Monolayers of endothelial cells or FaDu oral epithelial cells were infected with the various strains of <italic>C. albicans,</italic> after which N-cadherin and E-cadherin were detected by indirect immunofluorescence.

        <p>We observed that endothelial cell N-cadherin colocalized with hyphae of the wild-type strain and the <italic>als1</italic>Δ/<italic>als1</italic>Δ null mutant that were being endocytosed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

As expected, N-cadherin accumulated around hyphae of the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ::<italic>ALS3</italic> complemented strain similarly to the wild-type control strain. A comparable pattern was observed with E-cadherin and oral epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g004">Figure 4</xref>). E-cadherin colocalized with the endocytosed hyphae of all strains except for the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant.

        <title>Als1 and Als3 by Themselves Are Sufficient to Induce Endocytosis</title>
        <p>To determine if either Als1 or Als3 alone was able to induce endocytosis, we coated latex beads with the purified, recombinant N-terminal portion of Als1 (rAls1-N) or Als3 (rAls3-N), which consisted of amino acids 17 to 432 of either protein. Control beads were coated with biotinylated bovine serum albumin (BSA). We then assessed the number of beads that were endocytosed by and associated with endothelial cells and FaDu oral epithelial cells. Although rAls1-N–coated beads were endocytosed similarly to the BSA-coated beads by endothelial cells, significantly more of these beads were endocytosed by FaDu epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g006">6</xref>B). The number of rAls1-N–coated beads that were associated with both cell types was similar to that of the BSA-coated beads, indicating that the N-terminal portion of Als1 by itself is insufficient to mediate adherence to either cell type.

Also, a greater number of beads coated with Als3 were associated with the endothelial cells compared with the control beads.</p>

        <p>Next, we examined the interactions of the beads with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing N-cadherin or E-cadherin to investigate whether binding of Als1 or Als3 to these cadherins alone was sufficient to induce endocytosis. The CHO cell assay was more sensitive than the assays using endothelial cells or oral epithelial cells because the background adherence and endocytosis of the BSA-coated beads was lower when CHO cells were used (unpublished data). Beads coated with rAls1-N were endocytosed more efficiently than the control beads by CHO cells expressing either N-cadherin or E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g006">6</xref>D). Also, slightly more rAls1-N–coated beads were associated with the CHO cells expressing N-cadherin, but not the ones expressing E-cadherin. However, the beads coated with rAls3-N were endocytosed significantly more efficiently by the CHO cells expressing N- or E-cadherin than were the beads coated with either BSA or rAls1-N. In addition, a slightly greater number of rAls3-N–coated beads were associated with cells expressing either N-cadherin or E-cadherin than were the control beads. The enhanced endocytosis mediated by rAls3-N required the presence of either N- or E-cadherin on the surface of the CHO cells because beads coated with rAls3-N were endocytosed similarly to beads coated with BSA by control CHO cells that did not express either N- or E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g006">Figure 6</xref>E). These results demonstrate that Als3, and to a lesser extent Als1, bind directly to N-cadherin and E-cadherin, and that this binding is sufficient to induce endocytosis.

        <title>The Predicted N-Terminal Structures of Als1 and Als3 Are Different</title>
        <p>Although the N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 are 84% identical at the amino acid level, they interacted differently with N- and E-cadherin. Therefore, we used computer-assisted modeling to identify differences in the secondary structure of the N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 that might account for their functional differences. Our initial models of the N-terminal regions of these proteins indicated that they share general structural features, including a modular β sheet configuration interposed by extended regions, and an overall negative surface potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>]. In the current study, we generated higher resolution models of the N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3. These models predicted that the N-termini of both proteins contain recurrent β barrel (“beads-on-a-string”) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Interestingly, the N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 bear a striking resemblance to the N-terminal ectodomains of N- and E-cadherin. The cadherin ectodomains have five β barrel domains, the first two of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g007">Figure 7</xref>A. Similarly, the N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 contain at least four β barrel domains (the first two of these domains are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, and all four domains are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Notably, the first such domain (N1 domain) of each of the four proteins contains their most hydrophobic sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). However, Als1 and Als3 differ from the cadherins in that the fungal proteins bear less negative charge on their N1 than their N2 domains, whereas the cadherins bear the most negative charge on their N1 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g007">Figure 7</xref>C).</p>

Note that the Als1 model encompasses 187 amino acids (residues 3–190) in an equivalent 3-D space as that of Als3, which includes 279 amino acids (residues 20–299). Such a comparison illustrates the overall similarities in conformation among these polypeptide domains, with a more compact configuration of Als3.</p>

            <p>The interactions of the N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 with the N-terminal regions of N-cadherin and E-cadherin, as well as N-cadherin and E-cadherin self-association were modeled as outlined in Materials and Methods.

        <p>The present computational models of the Als1 and Als3 N-terminal regions also indicated potentially significant differences between these two proteins. The most conspicuous differences are the predicted size and shape of these regions. Both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the N-terminal domains of Als1 favor an extended conformation, while those of Als3 tend toward a more compact, β propeller–like arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Also, the spatial distribution of surface hydrophobicity and electrostatic potential within the N1 and N2 domains differ between Als1 and Als3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g007">7</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Als3 Is Predicted to Bind to Cadherins Differently than Als1</title>
        <p>Next, we modeled potential sites of interaction between the N-terminal regions of Als1, Als3, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin. The N-terminal domains of Als1 and Als3 were modeled in common, semi-extended conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This consensus conformation allowed comparable access of any potential Als-docking domains to the cadherin ligands. Significant differences between Als1 and Als3 docking interactions with N- and E-cadherin were found. The binding of Als1 to N-cadherin was predicted to have greater contact area and electrostatic energy compared to the binding of Als3 to N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050064-t001">Table 1</xref>). The hydrophobicity and hex energy of the binding of either Als1 or Als3 to N-cadherin were similar. However, the overall favorability of binding to N-cadherin was much better for Als3 than for Als1. Interestingly, the predicted parameters of Als3 binding to N-cadherin were very similar to those of one molecule of N-cadherin binding to another (N-cadherin self-association). The docking studies also predicted that different regions of Als1 and Als3 bind to N-cadherin. The N1 and N3 domains of Als1 bind to domains N1 and N2 of N-cadherin, whereas the N2 and N3 domains of Als3 bind to domains N1 and N2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050064-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g008">Figure 8</xref>A).</p>

        <p>The N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 are also predicted to interact differently with E-cadherin. The energetics of Als1 binding to E-cadherin are considerably weaker than either Als3 binding to E-cadherin or E-cadherin binding to itself (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050064-t001">Table 1</xref>). Also, Als1 N1 and N3 domains likely interact only with the N1 domain of E-cadherin, and they do not appear to have energetically favorable interactions with the N2 domain of this cadherin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050064-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Als3 is predicted to interact with E-cadherin differently than Als1. Moreover, the Als3-E-cadherin interaction is somewhat different from the Als3–N-cadherin interaction. Domains N1, N2, and N3 of Als3 appear to form a cleft that binds E-cadherin domains N1 and N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g008">Figure 8</xref>). More important, the geometry of this interaction assumes a parallel orientation, such as that which occurs when E-cadherin binds to itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050064-g008">Figure 8</xref>A).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previous studies have focused on the adherence properties of the Als proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b038">38</xref>]. The different Als proteins mediate adherence to broad variety of host substrates, and this adherence is likely critical for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to infect host surfaces. In this study, we report that an additional function of Als3 is that it can act as an invasin protein and induce endocytosis by normally nonphagocytic host cells. Furthermore, we show that this endocytosis occurs as a result of the N-terminal region of Als3 binding to either N-cadherin or E-cadherin. These conclusions are supported by the following results. First, an <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant was endocytosed poorly by endothelial cells and two different oral epithelial cell lines. Second, latex beads coated with rAls3-N were efficiently and specifically endocytosed by both endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells. Third, the rAls3-N–coated beads were avidly endocytosed by CHO cells expressing either N-cadherin or E-cadherin, but not by CHO cells that did not express these cadherins. These current results are also consistent with our previous data that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> expressing Als3 are endocytosed by endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>In our prior studies, we have determined that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> must be endocytosed by either endothelial cells or oral epithelial cells to cause damage to these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b039">39</xref>]. We found that the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant caused virtually no damage to either endothelial cells or FaDu oral epithelial cells. Similarly, Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b024">24</xref>] reported that an <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant had markedly reduced capacity to damage reconstituted human epithelium. Our results suggest that the reduced capacity of the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant to damage endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells in vitro is due to its defect in invading these cells.</p>
      <p>The invasion and damage defects of the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant suggest that Als3 is important for virulence during hematogenously disseminated and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Investigations to determine the role of Als3 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> virulence are currently ongoing. However, we have found that vaccination of mice with rAls3 provides significant protection from lethal hematogenously disseminated candidiasis and ameliorates the course of oropharyngeal and vaginal candidiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b040">40</xref>]. Thus, Als3 is a useful therapeutic target.</p>
      <p>In our assays, the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant had significantly reduced adherence to endothelial cells, but normal adherence to oral epithelial cells. It has been reported by others that an <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant had reduced adherence to endothelial cells, buccal epithelial cells, and FaDu epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b035">35</xref>]. Also, we found that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> expressing Als3 bound to both endothelial cells and FaDu oral epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>]. The discrepancy between the previous and current results is likely due to differences in the methodology of the assays. Specifically, the longer incubation time and the use of a 24-well tissue culture plate (rather than a 6-well plate) in the current endocytosis assay make it less sensitive to differences in adherence among strains.</p>
      <p>We also found that the <italic>als1</italic>Δ/<italic>als1</italic>Δ mutant was endocytosed normally by oral epithelial cells, whereas latex beads coated with rAls1-N induced some endocytosis by these cells. The probable explanation for these apparently conflicting results is that the <italic>als1</italic>Δ/<italic>als1</italic>Δ mutant still expressed Als3 on its surface. Thus, the presence of Als3 masked the effects of the absence of Als1 when the endocytosis assay was performed using whole organisms. Studies performed with latex beads coated with rAls1-N indicated that Als1 is capable of inducing epithelial cell endocytosis by itself. Collectively, these results demonstrate the utility of using both mutant analysis and recombinant proteins to assess the contribution of an individual Als protein to host cell interactions.</p>
      <p>Previously, we determined that the N-terminal region of Als proteins contains the substrate-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b026">26</xref>]. This conclusion is supported by our current finding that latex beads coated with just the N-terminus of Als3 were able to induce endocytosis. However, it was notable that coating the latex beads with rAls3-N resulted in a much greater increase in endocytosis than adherence. Also, coating beads with rAls1-N resulted in little to no increase in adherence, even though previous studies have clearly demonstrated that Als1 is an adhesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b037">37</xref>]. The likely explanation for the relative lack of adherence of the beads is that they were coated with fragments of Als1 or Als3 that lacked the tandem repeats present in the central portion of the full-length proteins. Previously, we have found that the adhesive function of Als1 is dramatically reduced when some or all of the tandem repeats are eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b026">26</xref>]. Similarly, Oh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b035">35</xref>] found that versions of Als3 with fewer tandem repeats mediated less adherence than did versions of Als3 with more tandem repeats. In addition, Rauceo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b038">38</xref>] reported that the absence of tandem repeats reduced the binding affinity of Als5. Collectively, these results support a model in which the tandem repeats influence the conformation and/or the substrate accessibility of the N-terminal region of Als3 and thereby enhance its binding affinity for host substrates. However, even the weak binding of the N-terminal portion of Als3 to N-cadherin or E-cadherin is sufficient to induce endocytosis.</p>
      <p>The results with the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant and the latex beads coated with rAls3-N demonstrate that endothelial cell N-cadherin and epithelial cell E-cadherin are two host cell ligands for Als3. Furthermore, binding of the N-terminus of Als3 to either of these cadherins is sufficient to induce endocytosis. Previously, we have reported that N-cadherin is one of the endothelial cell surface proteins that mediate endocytosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b009">9</xref>]. E-cadherin is known to mediate the endocytosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Listeria monocytogenes</named-content> by epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b041">41</xref>], but it was not previously known to mediate the endocytosis of any fungi. Our results with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> raise the interesting possibility that perhaps <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. monocytogenes</named-content> can utilize N-cadherin to invade endothelial cells.</p>
      <p>Although the N-termini of Als1 and Als3 share considerable homology at the amino acid level, Als3 induced endocytosis much more efficiently than did Als1. The results of computer-assisted modeling provide a possible structural explanation for these functional differences. A striking finding was that the 3-D structures of the N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 are predicted to have recurrent β barrel domains and a global negative surface potential similar to the N-terminal regions of N-cadherin and E-cadherin. Even though N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 share general features, they are predicted to differ both in their 3-D structure and their interactions with N- and E-cadherin. While Als1 appears to favor an extended conformation, Als3 tends toward a more folded structure that forms a more distinct molecular cleft.</p>
      <p>Our molecular modeling results also suggest that Als1 binds more weakly to N- and E-cadherin than does Als3. These results are consistent with our finding that beads coated with rAls3-N were endocytosed more avidly by CHO cells expressing N- or E-cadherin than were beads coated with rAls1-N. Computer-assisted modeling also predicted that Als1 and Als3 interact with N- and E-cadherin via different domains, and the geometry of Als3 binding to E-cadherin is similar to that of E-cadherin binding to itself. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that Als3 functions as a molecular mimic of mammalian cadherins, thereby facilitating <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> invasion of endothelial and oral epithelial cells.</p>
      <p>The N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 are also predicted to share structural homology to bacterial adhesins and invasins. The conformation of Als1 is similar to that of the pfam02368 family of bacterial immunoglobulin-like domain surface protein/adhesins, which includes the invasin of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Y. pseudotuberculosis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b043">43</xref>]. In contrast, the cleft motif of Als3 is more similar to that of the COG4886 family of leucine-rich repeat invasins/intimins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b042">42</xref>]. Interestingly, this family of proteins includes internalin A of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. monocytogenes</named-content>, which mediates epithelial cell invasion by binding to E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b044">44</xref>].</p>
      <p>The models presented here do not purport to specify exact interactions between cadherins and Als proteins. Defining such interactions at the atomic level requires physicochemical methods such as ultracentrifugation and x-ray crystallography. However, our findings are strengthened by the fact that the results of our modeling of cadherin–cadherin interactions were very similar to what has been found by x-ray crystallography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b045">45</xref>].</p>
      <p>Previously, we have reported that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> expressing Als1 or Als3 binds to a variety of host constituents, including endothelial cells, epithelial cells, laminin, and fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>]. In the affinity purification experiments, hyphae of the <italic>als3</italic>Δ/<italic>als3</italic>Δ null mutant failed to bind to multiple host proteins, including N-cadherin and E-cadherin. Thus, these results are consistent with the model that Als3 binds to a broad range of host substrates. However, our data also indicate that there is some specificity in the binding of Als proteins to host constituents. For example, beads coated with rAls3-N were endocytosed much more efficiently than were beads coated with rAls1-N. These results, combined with those of the molecular modeling studies, suggest that Als3 binds with greater affinity to N- and E-cadherin than does Als1. Nevertheless, it is highly likely that additional host cell ligands, other than N- or E-cadherin, also contribute to the endocytosis of <italic>C. albicans,</italic> and we are currently working to identify them.</p>
      <p>For many microbial pathogens, invasion of host cells is critical for the initiation and maintenance of infection, and many of these organisms have more than one mechanism for inducing their own uptake by host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b046">46</xref>]. Thus, it is logical to speculate that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> has also evolved at least one Als3-independent mechanism to invade host cells. The Als family of proteins contains six members in addition to Als1 and Als3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b025">25</xref>]. Most of these proteins are known to have adhesive function. When expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> Als5 induces weak endothelial cell endocytosis similar to that induced by Als1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b023">23</xref>]. Als6, Als7, and Als9 do not appear to mediate significant endothelial cell endocytosis, and Als2 and Als4 have not yet been tested in this assay. While it is possible that Als3 is the only member of its family that has significant invasive function, it is also conceivable that one or more of the other Als proteins mediates invasion of other types of host cells. Thus, a detailed analysis of these proteins will likely provide further insight into the pathogenesis of hematogenously disseminated and mucosal candidiasis, and perhaps additional therapeutic targets.</p>

        <p>Models of the N-terminal regions of Als1 and Als3 generated as above were then examined for predicted interactions with E-cadherin or N-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b062">62</xref>] in silico using the program Hex 4.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b064">64</xref>]. The structures of these cadherins have been determined to a resolution of 2 Å by x-ray crystallography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b045">45</xref>]. To enhance the predictive accuracy of modeling and evaluate all probable interactions, multiple docking simulations were performed from different starting positions. For example, in a systematic approach, docking was initiated with the target cadherin located next to each of the major Als N-terminal domains. The search range was set to 60 Å using full rotation mode and a 0.75 Å step size with two substeps. Initial searches were based on shape and electrostatics; post-processing was based on 3-D shape and surface topography. Post-processing with molecular mechanics or molecular mechanics minimization (0.75 Å step size, two substeps) gave equivalent results. As a comparator to Als-cadherin interactions, the self-association of two N-terminal domains of E-cadherin and N-cadherin was also assessed. To assess the validity of the hex algorithms applied, we separated the two E-cadherin molecules, the structures of which are contained in the Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pdb.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b045">45</xref>]. The two peptides were then redocked using the approach described above, initiated from multiple orientations of the peptides. In every case, the best dock was clearly discernable by the energy score. Visually, E-cadherin redocking was virtually indistinguishable from that of the reported structure determined by crystallography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b045">45</xref>]. Quantitatively, redocked E-cadherins had a root mean square deviation of &lt; 1 Å deviation from the crystal structure. No attempt was made to optimize the output because the crystal packing forces may account in part for any differences between published structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050064-b045">45</xref>] and hex algorithm model output. Nonetheless, docking parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050064-t001">Table 1</xref><bold>)</bold> varied less than 10% between the experimental and redocked E-cadherins (unpublished data).</p>
