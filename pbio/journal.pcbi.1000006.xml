The widely studied GroEL chaperonin is a double-barreled complex that can trap non-native proteins in one of its two barrels. The ATP-driven binding of a GroES cap then results in a major structural change of the chamber where the substrate is trapped and initiates a refolding attempt. The two barrels operate anti-synchronously. The central region between the two barrels contains a high concentration of disordered protein chains, the role of which was thus far unclear. In this work we report a combination of atomistic and coarse-grained simulations that probe the structure and dynamics of the equatorial region of the GroEL/GroES chaperonin complex. Surprisingly, our simulations show that the equatorial region provides a translocation channel that will block the passage of folded proteins but allows the passage of secondary units with the diameter of an alpha-helix. We compute the free-energy barrier that has to be overcome during translocation and find that it can easily be crossed under the influence of thermal fluctuations. Hence, strongly non-native proteins can be squeezed like toothpaste from one barrel to the next where they will refold. Proteins that are already fairly close to the native state will not translocate but can refold in the chamber where they were trapped. Several experimental results are compatible with this scenario, and in the case of the experiments of Martin and Hartl, intra chaperonin translocation could explain why under physiological crowding conditions the chaperonin does not release the substrate protein.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Chaperonin complexes capture proteins that have not yet reached their functional (“native”) state. Non-native proteins cannot perform their function correctly and threaten the survival of the cell. The chaperonins help these proteins to reach their native state. The prokaryotic GroEL-GroES chaperonin is an ellipsoidal protein complex that is approximately 16 nm long. It consists of two chambers that are joined at the bottom. Interestingly, protein repair by this chaperonin is not a one-step process. Typically, several capture and release steps are needed before the target protein reaches its native state. It is commonly assumed that substrate proteins cannot translocate, i.e., move inside the complex from one chamber to the other. In the absence of translocation, proteins that have not yet reached their functional conformation have to be released into the cytosol before being recaptured by a chaperonin. We present multi-scale simulations that show that it is, in fact, surprisingly easy for substrate proteins to translocate between the two chambers via an axial pore that is filled with disordered protein filaments. This finding suggests that non-native proteins can be squeezed like toothpaste from one chamber to the other: the incorrect structure of the protein is broken up during translocation and the protein has an increased probability to find its native state when it reaches the other chamber. The possibility for intra-chaperonin translocation obviates the need for a potentially dangerous release of non-native proteins.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is part of the research program of the Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie (FOM), which is financially supported by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO).

For this reason, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have evolved special macro-molecular “chaperone” complexes that capture and refold partially folded proteins, thereby preventing them from indulging in cellular mischief <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Fenton1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Thirumalai1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Young1">[3,]</xref>. An important class of chaperone complexes are the cage chaperones or <italic>chaperonins</italic>. These complexes can efficiently trap partially folded proteins in a cavity that is barely larger than the target protein, and assist in the folding of an entire class of proteins with different amino acid sequences. Hence, the chaperonin is able to distinguish partly folded states from the native state, independently of the specific amino-acid sequence. It is important to stress that in the presence of molecular crowding (similar to the one present in a cell) the chaperonin complex has been demonstrated to not release the substrate protein before it reaches the native state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Martin1">[4]</xref>. Below, we report a detailed numerical study of protein dynamics inside the so-called GroEL-GroES chaperone complex. The GroEL complex consists of two barrel-shaped protein complexes joined at the bottom (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000006-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Non-native proteins can be captured in an open GroEL “barrel”. The GroES “lid” can then cap a protein-containing barrel, thereby initiating the refolding process. After about 15 seconds and several refolding cycles, the GroES cap is released and the other barrel is capped (if it contains a protein). A single “cycle” of the GroEL-GroES chaperone hydrolyses seven ATPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Sigler1">[5]</xref>. This energy is presumably used to compress the protein in a smaller, more hydrophilic GroEL cavity, thus increasing the thermodynamic driving force to expel this protein. Recently we reported simulations of the kinetics of chaperone-induced protein refolding, using a lattice model for the GroEL-GroES complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Coluzza1">[6]</xref>. This study suggested that proteins may refold either inside the cavity in which it has been captured or, surprisingly, by translocating from one barrel of the GroEL dimer to the other (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000006-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This second route is unexpected because it is generally believed that proteins cannot cross the equatorial plane that separates the joined GroEL barrels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Thiyagarajan1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Saibil1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Saibil2">[9]</xref>.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000006-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000006.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Space-filling representation of the X-Ray structure of the GroEL/GroES/ADP complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Sigler1">[5]</xref>.</title><p>Colours represent the type of surface: all hydrophobic amino acids (A, V, L, I, M, F, P, Y) are in <italic>yellow</italic>, while the polar ones (S, T, H, C, N, Q, K, R, D, E) are <italic>red</italic>.

In the initial configuration (1), the chaperonin barrel is open and exposes a hydrophobic rim for binding partially folded proteins. After a non-native protein is captured, the GroEL-GroES complex closes (i.e., the barrel gets capped) (2). After that, the protein can either refold in the original barrel (3A) or, if their structure is far from native <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Coluzza1">[6]</xref>, translocate to the other side (3B). The early stages of translocation cost free energy, as the protein must locally unfold to initiate the translocation. This implies that the translocation route will be preferentially followed by relatively unstable non-native conformations. The gain in free energy as a result of folding facilitates the subsequent translocation process, when the protein enters the other barrel of the chaperonin complex (4). If, after translocation, the protein is still in a non-native state, it will remain trapped, as the surface of the open barrel can bind to the hydrophobic surface of non-native proteins. In this way the folding cycle can start again, with the capping of the second cavity and the opening of the first. The process (shuttling) continues until folding is completed.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000006.g002" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>In the present paper we use atomistic and mesoscopic simulations to test whether such a translocation scenario is compatible with the available structural information on the GroEL complex. Our simulation studies focus on the equatorial regime of the GroEL complex that might be expected to act as a barrier against translocation.

We therefore performed Monte Carlo simulations on a suitably coarse-grained model for the GroEL complex. We focused on the structural fluctuations within a spherical region (diameter 40 Å) around the trans side of the equatorial cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000006-g001">Figure 1</xref>), because the cis chains did not appear to represent an obstacle to translocation. The disordered chains in the cavity (22 monomeric units long) were rigidly anchored on a circular rim around the trans hole of ∼30 Å radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000006-g001">Figure 1 inset</xref>). To this end, we represented all peptide backbones using a model that keeps track of the positions of 5 distinct types of backbone atoms (H, N, <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub>, C, and O). Side chains are represented as hard spheres with a radius of 2.5 Å, centred on the <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub> atoms. Neighbouring spheres along the chain are allowed to overlap (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000006.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We used this coarse-grained model to estimate the free-energy cost associated with the insertion of a short and rigid helix, 21 monomeric units long, in the region of disordered protein chains. We sampled the free energy as a function of a reaction coordinate <italic>Q<sub>s</sub></italic> that measures the progress of the translocation process. <italic>Q<sub>s</sub></italic> is defined as the total number of <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub> atoms that have passed the entrance of the trans ring. We define the entrance as a plane through the average position of the hydrogen atoms in the anchoring amino acid of the chains. In order to translocate, a protein must first “find” the translocation hole. From our study of a lattice model GroEL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Coluzza1">[6]</xref>, we know that this first step is relatively easy. The key question is therefore whether or not the free-energy cost for the subsequent translocation is prohibitive. The present calculations address this issue by computing the free energy difference involved in moving an α-helix from the entrance of the pore region to the inside. Of course, the free-energy barrier depends on the interaction between the α-helix and the disordered chains that consist mainly of <italic>Gly</italic> and <italic>Met</italic>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Analysis</title><p>We start by considering a very naive estimate that has the advantage that it is based on the fully atomistic simulations. From these simulations, we know the density profile of <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub> atoms in the trans ring (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000006-g004">Figure 4</xref>). If, in the spirit of the Flory model, we assume that the density fluctuations of independent polymer Kuhn segments are Poisson distributed, we can estimate the probability <italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub> that a tube with the diameter of an α-helix contains no <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub> atoms at all. This would lead us to an estimate of the free energy barrier that is equal to −<italic>kT</italic>ln<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub>. Using the density profile of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000006-g004">Figure 4</xref> and an estimate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Maritan1">[14]</xref> for the persistence length of a protein filament, we obtain a translocation barrier of approximately 4 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>. If we make the (unrealistic) assumption that all <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub>'s in a single chain are fully correlated, then we estimate the barrier height to be only 1 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, which should be a significant underestimate. To see whether such a rough estimate is at all reasonable, we can repeat the same procedure for the coarse-grained model where we can also perform direct free-energy calculations. To be consistent with the previous case, we assume that the there are only excluded-volume interactions between the (mainly <italic>Gly</italic>) chains and the helix residues. In terms of the interaction matrix of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Betancourt1">[15]</xref> this is equivalent to assuming that the helix consist entirely of <italic>Thr</italic> residues. Assuming all Kuhn segments fluctuate independently, we estimate the barrier to be 4 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, and the assumption of fully correlated fluctuations will again yield an estimate of order 1 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>. The good agreement between the fully atomistic and coarse grained estimates is, of course, somewhat fortuitous, in view of the fact that the two density distributions are not identical. However, it suggests that the coarse-grained model may be of practical use.</p><p>Next, we compute the free energy barrier for the coarse-grained model system using the MC method described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>.</p><p>First we considered the case of pure steric interactions between both the chains and the helix. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000006-g005">Figure 5</xref> we plot the free energy <italic>F</italic>(<italic>Q</italic><sub>S</sub>) as a function of the reaction coordinate <italic>Q<sub>S</sub></italic> that measures the number of <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub>'s that have entered the pore region. The plot shows a symmetric barrier with a height of approximately 2 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, which is surprisingly close to the estimate obtained assuming fully correlated fluctuations of protein segments. In other words: the chains tend to move as a whole in an out of the central area of the pore. This picture is supported by the snapshot of the pore region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000006.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The main conclusion that we can draw from the coarse-grained free-energy calculations is that the presence of seven protein chains in the central core region of the trans ring is not enough to obstruct translocation on steric grounds alone.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000006-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000006.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Translocation free energy as a function of the number of translocated amino acids <italic>Q<sub>s</sub></italic>, for the different interaction scenarios.</title><p>For steric interactions (circles), the profile is rather symmetrical and presents a small barrier of 2 <italic>kT</italic>.

To consider the effect of both attractive and repulsive interactions, we consider the two cases separately. As the chains consist predominantly of <italic>Gly</italic>, we consider the scenarios that the interactions between the filament residues and the <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub> atoms of the helix are all equal to the twice the average of all attractive (resp. repulsive) interaction energies of <italic>Gly</italic> in the Betancourt-Thirumalai interaction matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Betancourt1">[15]</xref> (−0.1<italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> and +0.1<italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, respectively). The strength of attractive/repulsive interactions between the <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub>'s of the helix and the filament is therefore −0.2<italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> (resp +0.2<italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>).

The translocation barrier is appreciably lower when the chains attract the α helix (2 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>) than in the opposite limit (4.5 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>). However, the most striking observation is that the barrier is quite small in either case - a barrier of 4.5 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> can easily be crossed due to the action of thermal fluctuations.</p><p>In fact, in the case of attractive interactions, there is virtually no barrier for translocation. This absence of a barrier may provide a rationale for the experimental observation that Krueger et al. observed in their SANS experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Krueger1">[13]</xref> that a non-native protein (DPJ-9) was partially sucked into isolated trans rings. If proteins can indeed translocate through the GroEL equatorial plane then this may also be relevant for the mechanism by which the GroEL/GroES chaperonin can help the refolding of proteins that are too big to be encapsulated. In such cases, portions of the protein could be attracted to the inside of the pore and perform either a complete or a partial translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000006.s005">Figure S5</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Coluzza1">[6]</xref> either process can enhance the refolding efficiency.</p><p>The translocation of encapsulated non-native proteins is most likely in cases where the initial structure is far native. The reason is two fold: first of all, for such conformation there should be a low free-energy cost associated with partial unfolding—a necessary first step in translocation. Secondly, non-native chains that are trapped in a hydrophilic cage tend to be compressed. They can lower their free energy by translocating out of the cage. The simulations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Coluzza1">[6]</xref> suggest that the driving force for such translocation can be as much as 0.5 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> per amino-acid residue. Such a free-energy gradient is enough to completely remove a small free-energy barrier that might oppose translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000006.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In conclusion, our simulation results are not compatible with the assumption that the disordered protein chains in the cis or trans rings provide an effective barrier against translocation. The present findings may help explain a puzzling experimental finding concerning refolding experiments in the presence of crowding agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Martin1">[4]</xref>. The experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Martin1">[4]</xref> demonstrated that, under physiological crowding conditions, the substrate protein does not escape from the chaperonin until it has reached its native state. This phenomenon is difficult to reconcile with the standard scenario where a protein (folded or not) is expelled from the cis-chamber as another non-native protein binds to the ATP-trans chamber. However, if it is not <italic>another</italic> protein that binds to the hydrophobic rim of the trans chamber, but the original protein that has translocated from the cis-chamber (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000006-g002">Figure 2</xref>), then it becomes clear why non-native proteins are unlikely to escape. We stress that the present findings do not rule out the possibility that non-native proteins fold into the native state without translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Chaudhry1">[16]</xref>—translocation is simply an added route for protein folding. Such a route maybe very important for proteins that folds co-translationally, where confinement in a optimal size tunnel is crucial for efficiently reaching the native state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-ContrerasMartnez1">[17]</xref>.Our simulations suggest that it would be interesting to carry out refolding experiments on GroEL with mutated chains that would strongly stick to each other (or that could be cross-linked). Such mutation would impede the translocation and should thereby reduce the efficiency of the GroEL/GroES complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Atomistic Molecular Dynamics</title><p>The flexible nature of this region prevented accurate X-ray determination of the chains filling the interconnecting pore. To obtain a full-atomistic model, the program MODELLER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Fiser1">[18]</xref> has been used to generate a starting configuration of the chains missing in the X-ray structure (PDB code: 1AON) of the GroEL/GroES complex loaded with ADP. The reconstructed fragments (sequence KNDAADLGAAGGMGGMGGMGGM) are added at the C-term extremity of each monomeric building block of the chambers. In order to avoid steric clashes between the chains, the procedure has taken into account of the quaternary assembly of the chains. After the generation of the chains structures, three steepest-descent minimisations were performed, using the program GROMACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Berendsen1">[11]</xref> (energy minimisation tolerance: 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01 kJ/mol<sup>−1</sup>nm<sup>−1</sup>). Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were subsequently performed with the GROMACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Berendsen1">[11]</xref> package by using GROMOS96 force field with an integration time step of 2 fs. Non-bonded interactions were accounted for by using the particle-mesh Ewald method (grid spacing 0.12 nm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Darden1">[19]</xref> for the electrostatic contribution and cut-off distances of 1.4 nm for Van der Waals terms. Bonds were constrained by LINCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Hess1">[20]</xref> algorithm. The system was simulated in the NPT ensemble by keeping constant the temperature (300 K) and pressure (1 atm); a weak coupling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Berendsen2">[21]</xref> to external heat and pressure baths was applied with relaxation times of 0.1 ps and 0.5 ps, respectively. As we intended to simulate a solution at a pH-value of 7 the protonation states of pH sensitive residues were assigned as follow: <italic>Arg</italic> and <italic>Lys</italic> were positively charged, <italic>Asp</italic> and <italic>Glu</italic> were negatively charged and <italic>His</italic> was neutral. The protein's net charge was neutralised by the addition of Cl<sup>−</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions. It would have been prohibitively expensive to simulate the entire chaperonin plus surrounding water. However, this was not necessary, as our aim was to study the structure and dynamics of the strongly fluctuating the equatorial rings, rather than the relatively rigid remainder of the GroEL “chamber”. We therefore immobilised the chamber atoms that are not directly connected to the pore chains. Of course, the equatorial chains were free to move and relax in the pore. In order to further reduce the number of degrees of freedom treated, we only considered water molecules (SPCE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Berendsen3">[22]</xref>) <italic>inside</italic> the GroEL chamber. We achieved this by imposing a strong repulsive external potential outside the GroEL chamber. Ignoring the water outside the cage is not an unreasonable simplification, as we found that the disordered chains were completely solvated by water molecules and never moved outside the atoms of the internal surface of the chamber. We assumed periodic boundary conditions only along the symmetry axis of the GroEL complex (“z-axis”).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Coarse-Grained Monte Carlo Simulations</title><p>The Caterpillar model is a modification of the tube model of Maritan and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Maritan1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Hoang1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000006-Magee1">[24]</xref>.
