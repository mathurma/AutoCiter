<abstract>
<p>Phenotype switching is commonly observed in nature. This prevalence has allowed the elucidation of a number of underlying molecular mechanisms. However, little is known about how phenotypic switches arise and function in their early evolutionary stages. The first opportunity to provide empirical insight was delivered by an experiment in which populations of the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> SBW25 evolved, de novo, the ability to switch between two colony phenotypes. Here we unravel the molecular mechanism behind colony switching, revealing how a single nucleotide change in a gene enmeshed in central metabolism (<italic>carB</italic>) generates such a striking phenotype. We show that colony switching is underpinned by ON/OFF expression of capsules consisting of a colanic acid-like polymer. We use molecular genetics, biochemical analyses, and experimental evolution to establish that capsule switching results from perturbation of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Of central importance is a bifurcation point at which uracil triphosphate is partitioned towards either nucleotide metabolism or polymer production. This bifurcation marks a cell-fate decision point whereby cells with relatively high pyrimidine levels favour nucleotide metabolism (capsule OFF), while cells with lower pyrimidine levels divert resources towards polymer biosynthesis (capsule ON). This decision point is present and functional in the wild-type strain. Finally, we present a simple mathematical model demonstrating that the molecular components of the decision point are capable of producing switching. Despite its simple mutational cause, the connection between genotype and phenotype is complex and multidimensional, offering a rare glimpse of how noise in regulatory networks can provide opportunity for evolution.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Phenotype switching—the ability to switch rapidly between phenotypic states—is an evolutionary survival strategy commonly used by organisms in the face of unpredictable environmental conditions. However, little is known about how phenotype switches emerge and function in their early evolutionary stages. A previous study observed the evolutionary emergence of colony morphology switching in <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> populations in response to fluctuating selection. Here we describe the underlying molecular basis of this colony switching, providing the first account of the mechanism behind a real-time evolved phenotype switch. We show that colony switching in this instance is underpinned at the cellular level by high frequency ON/OFF expression of colanic acid-like capsules in response to varying levels of a metabolite. Biochemical assays revealed that capsule switching results from mutations that reduce concentrations of intermediates in a central metabolic pathway—the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Of key importance is the partitioning of these metabolic resources between polymer production (leading to capsulation) and cell division (leading to noncapsulation); this bifurcation marks a decision point whereby cells with low metabolite levels divert resources towards polymer production, increasing the likelihood of switching to the capsulated state. As a greater proportion of cells become capsulated, colony switching emerges. These findings show that, while colony switching evolved with relative ease, the underlying molecular mechanism is surprisingly complex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Life is constantly challenged by environmental change. Survival requires that organisms match their phenotype to current conditions. In predictable environments, this occurs by phenotypic acclimation [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In unpredictable environments, where the quality of environmental information is unreliable, stochastic phenotype switching allows organisms to hedge their evolutionary bets [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Bet hedging spreads the risk of being maladapted in the current environment among variable offspring, each of which has a chance of being fit in some future environment [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Bet-hedging strategies are widespread in nature, with examples from humans through to microbes [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Such strategies appear to be common in bacterial pathogens and commensals; when confronted with the challenge of survival in the face of an unpredictable host immune response, these bacteria have evolved mutational mechanisms that allow stochastic modulation of phenotype (contingency loci [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Typically, these involve short repetitive DNA sequences that affect expression of genes involved in critical interactions with the host. By virtue of their repeated nucleotide motifs, contingency loci are prone to polymerase slippage, resulting in localized hypermutation.</p>
<p>The sophistication of contingency loci begs questions as to their evolutionary origins. Given that pathogens and commensals are often derived from environmental reservoirs, it is likely that the ancestral state was a gene, or gene network, that was subject to environmental regulation. A recent experiment in which a plant saprophyte subject to fluctuating environmental conditions evolved, de novo, the capacity for stochastic phenotype switching [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] offers opportunities to understand how such switches originate. In this previous study, an experimental population of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> SBW25 was propagated under fluctuating conditions that mimicked essential aspects of the host immune response [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. After multiple environmental reversals in which evolving populations experienced repeated bottlenecks and phenotypic exclusion, genotypes able to stochastically switch between different colony states were identified in two of 12 replicate lines. This work focuses on the first of these lineages.</p>
<p>The capacity to stochastically switch evolved after nine mutations (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The first eight facilitated bouts of adaptation to different states of the fluctuating environment. The ninth, a single nucleotide change in <italic>carB</italic> (c2020t; encoding a subunit of CarAB, EC 6.3.5.5), gave rise to a genotype referred to as 1B<sup>4</sup> (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> for details of evolutionary series genotype names) that switched at high frequency between two colony types (translucent and opaque; <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Further investigation showed that differences in colony type were attributable to the varying proportion of cells with different capsulation states (Cap<sup>-</sup> and Cap<sup>+</sup>, respectively; <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In addition, allelic replacement studies showed the <italic>carB</italic> mutation alone was sufficient to generate stochastic colony and capsule switching in the wild-type background (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Here we describe empirical and theoretical efforts to understand how a single mutation in a gene deeply enmeshed in central metabolism generates such a striking phenotype. The switch-causing mutation reduces concentrations of intermediates in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, thus exposing a pre-existing epigenetic switch (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Central to the switch is the latter portion of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, which we postulate includes a cell-fate decision point. Together, these components possess functional and regulatory connectivities that a simple mathematical model shows are sufficient to generate stochastic switching.</p>

<title>An Epigenetic Basis for Capsule Switching</title>
<p>The transition between capsulation states in genotype 1B<sup>4</sup> resembles phase or antigenic variation in pathogens, which is typically underpinned by contingency loci [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Initial hypotheses predicted that the mechanism of switching would be mutational, involving either high-frequency gain and loss of the <italic>carB</italic> mutation or amplification and collapse of the <italic>carB</italic> locus. Both hypotheses were rejected (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). Attention therefore turned to the likelihood that the <italic>carB</italic> mutation established an epigenetic switch.</p>
<p>In order to identify genes with a role in capsule switching, 1B<sup>4</sup> was subjected to transposon mutagenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. From a pool of ~69,000 transposon mutants, 157 were deficient in their capacity to switch between capsulation states. While six showed an increase in the proportion of Cap<sup>+</sup> cells, 151 showed loss (or reduction) of Cap<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Thirty-eight mutants were implicated in biosynthesis of a capsular polymer (see below). Of the remaining 119 mutants, 38 contained insertions in potential regulators of capsule biosynthesis (see below) and 81 contained insertions in genes involved in a wide range of cellular processes, the most prominent of which were transport and central metabolism (22 mutants), cell division and DNA processing (11 mutants), RNA processing (ten mutants), and nucleotide biosynthesis (five mutants).</p>

<title>Capsule Synthesis Relies on the Expression of a Colanic Acid-Like Polymer</title>
<p>Nineteen transposon mutants contained insertions in the <italic>wcaJ-wzb</italic> locus (<italic>pflu3658–3678</italic>), a region of the genome that resembles the colanic acid biosynthetic locus of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Deletion of the entire <italic>wcaJ-wzb</italic> locus (giving 1B<sup>4</sup>-Δ<italic>wcaJ-wzb</italic>) produced translucent colonies (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) comprised of Cap<sup>-</sup> cells. These phenotypes were indistinguishable from those of 19 transposon mutants with insertions in <italic>wcaJ-wzb</italic> (previously reported in [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]).</p>

The usual genes encoding enzymes for biosynthesis of the fourth precursor (UDP-galactose) are absent in SBW25, indicating that the 1B<sup>4</sup> capsule polymer is structurally different than colanic acid. Indeed, analysis of the monosaccharide composition of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) in SBW25, 1A<sup>4</sup>, 1B<sup>4</sup>, and two transposon mutants indicates that the 1B<sup>4</sup> capsule polymer contains six monosaccharides: fucose, glucose, glucuronic acid, galactouronic acid, and two unidentified monosaccharides (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Only three of these monosaccharides are present in colanic acid, which consists of repeating units of fucose, galactose, glucose, and glucuronic acid [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
<p>On the basis of the genetic organisation of the <italic>wcaJ-wzb</italic> locus, the similarity of these enzymes to functionally characterized enzymes from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, the requirement for colanic acid-like precursors, and the monosaccharide analysis, we conclude that the 1B<sup>4</sup> capsule polymer is related to, but distinct from, colanic acid. Henceforth, the 1B<sup>4</sup> capsule polymer will be referred to as the colanic acid-like polymer (CAP).</p>

<title>Bistable CAP Expression in 1B<sup>4</sup> Is Controlled at the Transcriptional Level</title>
<p>Epigenetic switches are often underpinned by differences in gene expression. Total mRNA was extracted from SBW25, 1A<sup>4</sup>, 1B<sup>4</sup>-Cap<sup>-</sup>, and 1B<sup>4</sup>-Cap<sup>+</sup> cells and sequenced. Four pairwise comparisons (SBW25 versus 1A<sup>4</sup>, 1A<sup>4</sup> versus 1B<sup>4</sup>-Cap<sup>-</sup>, 1A<sup>4</sup> versus 1B<sup>4</sup>-Cap<sup>+</sup>, and 1B<sup>4</sup>-Cap<sup>-</sup> versus 1B<sup>4</sup>-Cap<sup>+</sup>) allowed differences in transcription to be detected (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> Tables). Each comparison revealed differential expression of ~60% of all coding sequences, including expression of genes encoding polymer biosynthetic enzymes, cell surface components, metabolic enzymes, and cell division genes. Of note is that transcription of <italic>wcaJ-wzb</italic>, the CAP biosynthetic locus, was significantly greater in 1B<sup>4</sup>-Cap<sup>+</sup> than 1A<sup>4</sup> or 1B<sup>4</sup>-Cap<sup>-</sup>. To corroborate this, a promoterless <italic>lacZ</italic> gene was transcriptionally fused to 1B<sup>4</sup> <italic>wcaJ</italic>. Growth of 1B<sup>4</sup>-<italic>wcaJ-lacZ</italic> on media containing X-gal gave rise to colonies with blue sectors comprised of predominantly Cap<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), indicating that <italic>wcaJ</italic> transcription is indeed increased in Cap<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>
<p>The 1B<sup>4</sup> transposon mutagenesis screen identified three regulators of CAP biosynthetic genes (Pflu4939, BarA-GacA, and Pflu3654-Pflu3657; <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The first of these is Pflu4939, a probable transcriptional regulator with homology to MvaT, a global regulator of virulence gene expression in other pseudomonads [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Three independent transposon insertions in <italic>pflu4939</italic> (and the ~10 bp immediately upstream) led to increased capsule production, suggesting that Pflu4939 is a negative regulator of CAP biosynthetic gene transcription. Conversely, insertions in loci encoding the other two regulatory systems caused elimination or reduction of capsule formation, indicating that these are activators of CAP biosynthetic gene transcription.</p>
<p>The second regulatory pathway, identified by 24 transposon insertions, is the BarA-GacA two-component signal transduction relay system. BarA-GacA is known to regulate a broad range of virulence and stress response systems in various gram-negative bacteria [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The third regulatory system is identified by 14 insertions in <italic>pflu3654-pflu3657</italic>, a genomic region directly upstream of the CAP biosynthetic genes (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), most of which has no significant database matches. Notably, when a transcriptional fusion of <italic>gfpmut3</italic> and the genomic region upstream of <italic>pflu3655-pflu3657</italic> was inserted into the 1B<sup>4</sup> genome, expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in Cap<sup>+</sup> cells was observed (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s027" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>). This demonstrates that this region contains a promoter sequence transcribed in response to the capsule ON signal.</p>
<p>None of the above regulators bears homology to the Rcs phosphorelay that controls colanic acid gene transcription in the <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Erwinia</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, and <italic>Rhizobium</italic> genera [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

<title>The Pyrimidine Biosynthetic Pathway Links <italic>carB</italic> and the CAP Biosynthetic Genes</title>
<p>Thus far, phenotypic observation of 1B<sup>4</sup> colonies, combined with the results of transposon mutagenesis and transcription analyses, indicates colony switching to be the result of bistable CAP expression, which is at least partially effected at the transcriptional level. To understand the epigenetic events by which the <italic>carB</italic> mutation influences CAP expression, we next studied the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, which provides a molecular link between <italic>carB</italic> and CAP (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In brief, CarB is the product of the second gene of the <italic>carAB</italic> operon, which encodes the two subunits of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase, EC 6.3.5.5). The product of CPSase, carbamoyl phosphate (CP), is the precursor for synthesis of arginine and pyrimidines. The pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway concludes with synthesis of UTP, which is further metabolised by PyrG (to produce cytidine triphosphate [CTP] for DNA synthesis) and/or GalU (to produce UDP-glucose, a precursor of CAP biosynthesis).</p>
<p>The importance of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in 1B<sup>4</sup> capsule switching is corroborated by the isolation of a transposon mutant (JG176) carrying an insertion in one of the pathway genes, <italic>ndk</italic> (encoding nucleoside diphosphate kinase, EC 2.7.4.6). This mutant is intriguing because it generates uniformly opaque colonies—a rare phenotype in the mutagenesis screen. Cre-mediated excision of the transposon left a 189 bp inactivational insertion in <italic>ndk</italic>, creating JG176ΔCre and eliminating the possibility of polar effects. The mutant showed elevated levels of capsulation compared to 1B<sup>4</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). A similar increase was observed upon deletion of the entire <italic>ndk</italic> reading frame from 1B<sup>4</sup> (1B<sup>4</sup>-Δ<italic>ndk</italic>; <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Deletion of <italic>ndk</italic> from wild type also resulted in an increase in capsulation (SBW25-Δ<italic>ndk</italic>; <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), demonstrating that a reduction in <italic>ndk</italic> activity plays a role in capsule bistability; hypercapsulation as a result of <italic>ndk</italic> inactivation indicates that capsule production is a response to perturbations in the supply of nucleotide precursors. Notably, SBW25-Δ<italic>ndk</italic> has a lower capsulation level than 1B<sup>4</sup>-Δ<italic>ndk</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), highlighting that multiple mutations in the pyrimidine pathway can have additive effects on capsule bistability.</p>

<p>Given that production of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) is an essential intracellular process, the viability of the <italic>ndk</italic> deletion strains indicates that SBW25 possesses at least one alternative enzyme with nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) activity; adenylate kinase [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], pyruvate kinase [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and polyphosphate kinase [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have been shown to function as alternative NDKs in other species. While each enzyme showing NDK activity uses UDP, CDP, GDP, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) as substrates for NTP production, differing affinities of the enzymes for each substrate can carry large consequences for intracellular UTP, CTP, GTP, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

<title>The <italic>carB</italic> Mutation Reduces Concentrations of Pyrimidine Biosynthetic Intermediates</title>
<p>Reduced growth of 1B<sup>4</sup> compared to that of the immediate precursor genotype (1A<sup>4</sup>) indicates that the <italic>carB</italic> mutation causes a reduction in CPSase function (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).

Similar measurements in SBW25 and SBW25-Δ<italic>ndk</italic> revealed that deletion of <italic>ndk</italic> leads to significant reductions in UMP, UDP, and UTP (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>). Thus, we conclude that function-reducing mutations in pyrimidine biosynthetic genes lead to reductions in pyrimidine pathway intermediates (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), which in turn lead to increases in capsulation (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>Given the above results, it is likely that the greater the loss in pathway functionality, the greater the reduction in pyrimidine pathway intermediates. However, genotypes containing a mutation in both <italic>carB</italic> and <italic>ndk</italic> (1B<sup>4</sup>-Δ<italic>ndk</italic> and JG176ΔCre) showed an increase in UMP, UDP, and UTP compared to 1B<sup>4</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), despite relative capsulation increases (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<title>Addition of Exogenous Uracil Affects the Proportion of Capsulated Cells</title>
<p>Results to this point have demonstrated that the <italic>carB</italic> mutation causes (i) a reduction in concentrations of pyrimidine intermediates and (ii) capsule switching. Next, we investigated whether reduction of one or more pyrimidine intermediates causes (rather than merely correlates with) capsule switching. If the relationship were causal, then switching should be reduced or eliminated by restoration of the concentration of relevant pyrimidine intermediates to ancestral levels. Thus, the effect of adding increasing amounts of exogenous uracil—which is taken up by cells and enters the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway as UMP (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>)—on capsule switching was investigated.

<p>Together, the above findings not only demonstrate a causal relationship between reduction of pyrimidine biosynthetic intermediates and capsule switching, but they also show that the switching phenotype can be eliminated through provision of an intermediate (UMP) several enzymatic steps downstream of <italic>carB</italic>.

<title>A Mutation in <italic>pyrH</italic> Causes Capsule Switching</title>
<p>Work to this point has shown that the likelihood of cells becoming capsulated is negatively related to the supply of pyrimidine pathway intermediates, particularly downstream of UMP. In principle, supply-reducing mutations elsewhere in the pyrimidine pathway should effect a similar reduction in pyrimidine concentrations, leading to switching. In order to investigate whether mutations in genes other than <italic>carB</italic> can give rise to capsule switching, an evolution experiment was performed in which we sought to evolve new switching genotypes from 1A<sup>4</sup>. Each of these genotypes was expected to contain the first eight mutations of the evolutionary series (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) plus an independently evolved switch-causing mutation. A set of 36 independent replicate populations of 1A<sup>4</sup> (the nonswitching predecessor of 1B<sup>4</sup>) was subjected to one round of selection under the regime that delivered 1B<sup>4</sup>. At the conclusion of this “re-evolution” experiment, cells from each population were plated on agar and screened for the presence of rapidly sectoring colonies.</p>
<p>From 36 replicates, six populations produced switchers. A capsule counting assay showed that each switcher genotype produced populations of cells with distinctly different ratios of Cap<sup>+</sup> to Cap<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting that the underlying mutations had quantitatively different effects on concentrations of pyrimidine intermediates and the likelihood of switching. Indeed, analysis of intracellular metabolite levels in two of the re-evolved switchers, Re1_4 and Re1_5, revealed that the switch-causing mutations in these genotypes cause a multitude of metabolic effects (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s024" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>), including alteration of the concentration of pyrimidine intermediates.</p>
<p>In order to see whether the switch-causing mutations lay upstream or downstream of the entry point of uracil, the effect of uracil supplementation on the frequency of switching was examined. Five of the six re-evolved switchers showed a response to uracil that was typical of 1B<sup>4</sup>; however, the sixth (Re1_4) was unresponsive (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). On sequencing the <italic>carB</italic> gene, each of the five uracil-responsive switchers was found to contain a <italic>carB</italic> mutation (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Re1_4 did not contain a <italic>carB</italic> mutation. Genome resequencing of Re1_4 revealed the final mutation as a single, nonsynonymous change in <italic>pyrH</italic> (R123C). PyrH encodes uridylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.22), the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of UMP to UDP. As the UDP/UMP ratio of Re1_4 was decreased 28-fold relative to that of 1A<sup>4</sup> (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s024" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>), this mutation was deleterious to PyrH function. Given that <italic>pyrH</italic> is six genes along the pyrimidine pathway from <italic>carB</italic>, this finding reduced the number of genes and regulatory connections under consideration: from this point on, attention focused on <italic>pyrH</italic> and downstream genes.</p>

<title>Overexpression of Pyrimidine Biosynthetic Genes Affects Capsule Switching</title>
<p>To define a set of genes necessary for switching, the expression of each gene downstream of <italic>pyrH</italic> was manipulated. We reasoned that manipulations of any candidate gene that led to a change in the behaviour of the switch indicated the involvement of that component in the circuit. Thus, <italic>carB</italic>, <italic>pyrH</italic>, <italic>ndk</italic>, <italic>galU</italic>, and <italic>pyrG</italic> were overexpressed in turn in 1B<sup>4</sup>, and the ratio of Cap<sup>+</sup> to Cap<sup>-</sup> cells determined for each (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Although no longer a central focus, <italic>carB</italic> was included in the overexpression set by way of positive control; given that 1B<sup>4</sup> switching results from a loss of <italic>carB</italic> function, successful overexpression of wild-type <italic>carB</italic> is expected to reduce capsulation.</p>
<p>Identifying the point in the pyrimidine pathway at which the switch decision occurs is central to understanding the switch mechanism. Logic suggests this is likely to be the UTP bifurcation point (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), and the results shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> are consistent with this prediction. First, overexpression of <italic>carB</italic>, <italic>pyrH</italic>, and <italic>ndk</italic> (the three enzymes immediately prior to the bifurcation) significantly lowered 1B<sup>4</sup> capsulation levels, indicating that sufficiency prior to the UTP bifurcation directs pathway resources away from capsulation. Second, overexpression of PyrG and GalU (two enzymes immediately beyond the UTP decision point) had opposing effects on 1B<sup>4</sup> capsulation: <italic>pyrG</italic> overexpression lowered capsulation, while <italic>galU</italic> overexpression increased capsulation. The ability to both decrease and increase capsulation through manipulation of these genes demonstrates that these components encompass key elements of the switch.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing 1B<sup>4</sup> capsulation levels, <italic>galU</italic> overexpression led to cell chains. Each chain, composed of 2–10 cells, was exclusively Cap<sup>+</sup> or Cap<sup>-</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). This is in contrast to the phenotype of the Cap<sup>-</sup> <italic>galU</italic> transposon mutant (JG114ΔCre, <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), which is low in UDP-glucose (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s024" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>) and produces short cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The fact that an increase in GalU inhibits cell division (producing cell chains) and a reduction in GalU stimulates cell division (producing short cells) indicates that GalU, or downstream pathway components, play a role in regulation of cell division. Indeed, such a finding has recently been reported in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], in which UDP-glucose appears to function as a “metabolic sensor” that couples nutrient availability to cell division. Introduction of the <italic>carB</italic> mutation from SBW25 to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B REL606 did not generate any obvious cellular- or colony-level phenotypic switching (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Capsule Expression Is Costly, and Switching Depends on Population Size</title>
<p>In order to directly observe capsule switching events, a genotype carrying a transcriptional fusion of <italic>gfpmut3</italic> and the region directly upstream of <italic>pflu3655</italic>—a probable regulator of CAP expression (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>)—was constructed in 1B<sup>4</sup> (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s027" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>). Microscopic analysis of the resulting genotype, 1B<sup>4</sup>-CAP-GFP, revealed a 100% correlation between GFP and capsule expression; Cap<sup>+</sup> 1B<sup>4</sup>-CAP-GFP cells fluoresce, while Cap<sup>-</sup> cells do not (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The growth of single 1B<sup>4</sup>-CAP-GFP cells into microcolonies was observed microscopically. First, the development of microcolonies founded by noncapsulated cells was examined (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). The switch from Cap<sup>-</sup> to Cap<sup>+</sup> was found to be dependent on population size; Cap<sup>-</sup> to Cap<sup>+</sup> switch events were only observed once a population size of 1870 ± 660 cells was exceeded (<italic>n</italic> = 58 microcolonies). In accordance with this, the distribution of the population size at which the first switch event is observed is Gaussian (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). This is in contrast to a Poisson distribution, which would have supported a random process independent of population size. However, once a minimum threshold population size is reached, Cap<sup>-</sup> cells switch to Cap<sup>+</sup> at random, and, thereafter, the expression of CAP genes is heritable (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s029" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Video</xref>). In contrast to Cap<sup>-</sup> founder cells, Cap<sup>+</sup> founder cells were observed to systematically switch to the Cap<sup>-</sup> form within a very short time frame (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s030" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Video</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the cost of capsule production, we measured the growth rate of Cap<sup>-</sup> and Cap<sup>+</sup> cells using image analysis. Using a conservative estimate, Cap<sup>+</sup> cells were found to grow more slowly (growth rate of 0.0113 min<sup>-1</sup> and SE = 2.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, or one division every ~61.3 min; <italic>n</italic> = 39) than Cap<sup>-</sup> cells (growth rate of 0.0116 min<sup>-1</sup> and SE = 6.10 x 10<sup>-5</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, or one division every ~59.8 min; <italic>n</italic> = 17). This demonstrates a cost for capsule synthesis of ~3%.</p>

<title>An Epigenetic Model for Capsule Switching: The Growth-Capsulation Model</title>
<p>While genetic and biochemical data define a minimal set of components involved in capsule switching, specific molecular details remain unknown. Nonetheless, we present a simple mathematical model in order to show that the bifurcation of the UTP pool into CTP and UDP-glucose synthesis can, with a minimal set of plausible assumptions regarding regulation (outlined in <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>), give rise to capsule switching. For simplicity, the model assumes a molecule—hereafter referred to as UXP—whose level is proportional to UTP as the central signal molecule for capsule biosynthesis. In reality, the signal could be any one, or a combination, of many possibilities (e.g., pyrimidine pathway intermediates, biosynthetic enzymes, and transcription factors).</p>
<p>Shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, the growth-capsulation model postulates that capsule bistability arises as a result of differential utilization of the UTP pool at the bifurcation point (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>): Cap<sup>-</sup> prevails when UTP is preferentially channelled by PyrG into DNA metabolism (and ultimately cell division), while Cap<sup>+</sup> results from utilization of UTP by GalU for capsule biosynthesis. The likelihood of a cell entering the Cap<sup>+</sup> state increases as intracellular UXP levels decline. This we model as a positive regulator of CAP biosynthesis whose activity is inversely proportional to the availability of UXP. For example, the regulator may have high affinity for UXP, which ensures that at high UXP concentrations the regulator is inactive. However, as UXP concentrations decline, the regulator becomes free, resulting in high-level expression of CAP biosynthetic genes. As previously noted, the 1B<sup>4</sup> transposon mutagenesis screen identified two genetic loci encoding transcriptional regulators required for maximal CAP biosynthetic gene transcription: <italic>pflu3655-pflu3657</italic> and <italic>barA/gacA</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). It is plausible that the activity of one of these regulators is sensitive to changes in concentrations of pyrimidine intermediates.</p>

<title>The growth-capsulation model for stochastic capsule switching.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic model for capsule switching. Central to the switch is the bifurcation of the UTP pool into nucleotide metabolism (via PyrG) and CAP synthesis (via GalU). When UXP (a signal molecule proportional to UTP) levels are high, cells commit resources to nucleotide metabolism, and expression of the GalU branch is basal. As UXP levels fall, the likelihood that CAP synthesis is activated increases because of the accumulation of a positive regulator sensitive to UXP levels. Once a cell commits to CAP synthesis, nucleotide metabolism slows, and continued CAP synthesis positively feeds back to maintain low UXP levels. To enable a return to Cap<sup>-</sup>, we model negative feedback via a repressor activated concomitantly with CAP synthesis. The length of time cells remain Cap<sup>+</sup> depends on many factors that are each subject to molecular noise. This introduces stochasticity to the system; we model this using the Gillespie algorithm (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">Results</xref> text for more detail). (<bold>B</bold>) A simulation of the model showing that low UXP production can induce switching through changes in CAP expression. Low UXP promotes CAP expression through increased availability of a presumed transcriptional activator of CAP biosynthetic genes. Cap<sup>+</sup> persists until the CAP repressor, induced by CAP, is synthesized and outcompetes the activator. Bound repressor causes CAP mRNA levels to fall because of halted synthesis and degradation. Cap<sup>-</sup> persists until repressor concentration decreases and the DNA binding site is free. UXP is low, and the cycle repeats.

(<bold>C</bold>) Same as B but with elevated UXP production. The positive regulator-repressor system is not utilized; thus, CAP expression remains basal.</p>

<p>Experimental observations show that the Cap<sup>+</sup> state is heritable (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s029" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Video</xref>, [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). This “phenotypic memory” depends on maintenance of low UXP levels, which we model as a positive feedback loop whereby the synthesis of CAP draws UTP into the capsule production. Although UDP from UDP-glucose is recycled back through UMP, commitment to CAP synthesis ensures a reduction of the UXP pool. Duration of the Cap<sup>+</sup> state depends on molecular noise inherent in the mechanism of regulation (e.g., uneven splitting of intracellular molecules upon cell division, strength of positive regulator-promoter binding, and rate of CAP degradation). To model this, interactions among components were simulated using a stochastic simulation algorithm [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For a switch to Cap<sup>-</sup>, UTP utilization must shift from CAP biosynthesis in favour of nucleotide metabolism. The likelihood of this occurring increases with increasing UXP levels. We model this as a time-delayed, autoregulatory feedback loop that restricts the activity period of capsule synthesis. For example, CAP may inhibit its own biosynthesis.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate that the components of the model are capable of generating switching, we used the chemical equations in <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref> to simulate changing concentrations of CAP in a single cell over a 48-h period. Further, to investigate the effect of UXP levels on capsulation state, the simulation was performed with differing UXP production rates. <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> shows that at low UXP production rates, a cell typically has two widely separated levels of CAP expression over 48 h, representing the Cap<sup>+</sup> (higher) and Cap<sup>-</sup> (lower) states. Notably, both the high and low CAP levels are maintained—in a probabilistic manner—over several cell divisions (i.e., are heritable). This phenotypic dichotomy is typically eliminated at higher UXP production rates; <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> shows CAP expression maintained at a relatively constant basal level. Further examples of simulated CAP expression at high, low, and intermediate UXP levels are provided in <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>This simple model demonstrates stochastic capsule switching in which both states persist for a duration that is long enough to allow epigenetic heritability (sufficient to generate colonies that are visibly Cap<sup>+</sup> or Cap<sup>-</sup>) but short enough to enable each state to give rise to the other. Furthermore, UXP concentration in the system determines the probability of switching. While the model relies on stochasticity in biochemical reactions, it is expected that other biological factors—such as cell division, which appears to be linked to GalU (and thus CAP) levels—will also contribute to heterogeneous populations [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to simulating stochastic switching, the model also encompasses a circuitry (of reactions, reaction rates, and number of molecules) that allows the level of stochasticity to be tuned. To demonstrate this, the 23 reaction rates (determined by the equations in <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>) were altered and the resulting time spent in Cap<sup>-</sup> and Cap<sup>+</sup> states determined. The value of each reaction rate, one at a time, was decreased by a factor of ten, and the simulation run ten times. This process was then repeated but with a 10-fold increase in each rate. The fraction of time for which the network exhibited the Cap<sup>-</sup> phenotype was determined under all 47 sets of conditions. The results (shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s025" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>.) reveal phenotypes that are Cap<sup>-</sup> between 11.6% and 90.4% of the time, indicating tuning over a wide range of reaction rates. Thus, while certain specific molecular details of the switch remain to be determined, the growth-capsulation model is consistent with experimental observations to date.</p>

<title>A Test of the Model: Capsule Switching in SBW25 (1A<sup>0</sup>)</title>
<p>The above model postulates that all machinery necessary for switching is present in the ancestral SBW25 genome but that distance from the Cap<sup>+</sup> “threshold”—due to sufficiency of UXP under normal laboratory culture—means that colonies appear uniformly translucent. Upon discovery of a mutation that reduces flux through the pyrimidine pathway, the model predicts that the population comes closer to the Cap<sup>+</sup> “threshold” and thus the possibility that extrinsic noise places more of the population above the threshold. Accordingly, there is reason to expect the occasional occurrence of Cap<sup>+</sup> cells in colonies of the ancestral type that are otherwise visibly translucent. Indeed, a capsule counting assay revealed the proportion of capsulated cells in SBW25 populations to be 0.0016 (~1 capsule per 625 cells) compared with 0.084 (~1 in 12 cells) in 1B<sup>4</sup> populations (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>If the capsulated cells observed in SBW25 and 1B<sup>4</sup> are a result of the same switch mechanism, then it is expected that Cap<sup>+</sup> cells of both genotypes will respond to manipulations of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in a similar manner. Thus, as was done for 1B<sup>4</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), <italic>carB</italic>, <italic>pyrH</italic>, <italic>ndk</italic>, <italic>galU</italic>, and <italic>pyrG</italic> were each sequentially overexpressed in SBW25. A capsule counting assay performed on each genotype (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) revealed that, as seen for 1B<sup>4</sup>, overexpression of <italic>ndk</italic> resulted in a significant reduction in SBW25 capsulation (no capsules observed in 4,500 cells). No statistically significant change in capsulation was observed for any other gene, possibly a result of the low number of capsulated cells assayed. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, as predicted by the growth-capsulation model, the capsule switch machinery is present and functional in SBW25.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Rapid switching of colony morphology is a striking phenotypic innovation. In bacterial pathogens, such behaviour is reflective of phase variation in which mutable (contingency) loci control the expression of epitopes on the surface of bacterial cells that interact with the host immune response [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Variable expression of such epitopes among members of a population allows the risk of elimination by the immune system to be spread among offspring, each of which has some chance of avoiding detection. Similarly, evolution of the capacity in 1B<sup>4</sup> to switch between opaque and translucent colonies enabled this genotype to succeed in the face of fluctuating selection wrought via an experimental regime that mimicked fundamental features of the host immune response [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The ancestral <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic> SBW25 genotype lacks the capacity to switch colony phenotype under standard laboratory conditions. The fact that switching emerged with relative ease (in two independent lines and with few mutations) suggests a predisposition for evolution of this trait. Our initial prediction was to find modification to an existing tract of nucleotides controlling expression of capsule production that increased the likelihood that this tract underwent mutation. We were therefore surprised to find the cause of switching to be a mutation in <italic>carB</italic>. We were further surprised to find that this mutation, when transferred back into the original ancestor (SBW25), was sufficient to generate switching behaviour [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>While the proximate cause of switching in 1B<sup>4</sup> is a mutation in <italic>carB</italic>, the ultimate cause resides in interactions among cellular components (genes, enzymatic products, and metabolic intermediates) surrounding the bifurcation of the UTP pool into CTP and UDP-glucose. At any point in a metabolic pathway where a single, inevitably limiting resource is partitioned into two or more components, there must necessarily be some decision-making mechanism in order to allow cells to match changes in substrate availability with cellular demands [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The pre-existence of such a decision-making mechanism—one that allows cells to partition the UTP pool preferentially towards DNA metabolism or polysaccharides—is central to the emergence of switching. Our data show that such a switch exists, that it is probabilistic, responsive to the level of pyrimidine pathway intermediates, and determines whether or not cells commit to a normal cell cycle or to a phase during which protective CAP is produced. The net effect of the <italic>carB</italic> mutation is to induce a shortage in the supply of pyrimidine intermediates, thus bringing the population closer to the threshold level at which the switch is likely to be “thrown.”</p>
<p>A decision to enter the Cap<sup>+</sup> state and thereby use already scarce pyrimidine resources to synthesize a nonessential polymer may at first appear paradoxical. However, pyrimidine nucleotides are not consumed by the capsule biosynthetic process but instead are recycled back into the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway as UMP (see <xref rid="pbio.1002109.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Further, the channelling of UTP into CAP precursor biosynthesis ensures that levels of core pyrimidine nucleotides (UMP, UDP, and UTP) are kept low, making cells less likely to enter the Cap<sup>-</sup> state (in which pyrimidine resources are diminished by splitting between daughter cells). Thus, CAP biosynthesis might be viewed as a mechanism for conserving scarce pyrimidine resources until such a time that intracellular conditions are optimal for cell division.</p>
<p>Although the 1B<sup>4</sup> <italic>carB</italic> mutation causes visible switching between colony types, it is clear that the underlying switch (and capacity to toggle between capsulation states) exists in the ancestral genotype. Such a cell cycle checkpoint—underpinned by a stochastic switch—is understandable from the perspective of bacterial survival. In natural environments, resources are often limiting. If the supply of essential components (e.g., nucleotides) to complete the cell cycle is insufficient, then it makes little sense to commit to cell division. An alternate strategy would be to reduce growth rate and invest in protective polymers, thus allowing cells to persist with the chance that intracellular nucleotide concentrations might rise, eventually allowing a normal round of cell division. The switch being probabilistic provides organisms with the possibility to hedge their evolutionary bets. This is in line with the fact that a decision to commit to the cell cycle versus polymer production is necessarily based on knowledge of the present state of the environment. However, the present state will not always accurately predict the future state, and the cost of making a wrong decision (i.e., cell division when nucleotides turn out to be insufficient or polymer production when nucleotides turn out to be abundant) is likely to be high. A stochastic switch would ensure that some cells commit to a strategy that is at odds with the current environment on the off chance that in some future state of the environment that strategy is optimal.</p>
<p>In many regards, capsule switching is reminiscent of both the sporulation process in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]—a cell-fate decision that has recently been shown to also be dependent on UDP-glucose levels [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]—and the phenotypic switch to bacterial persister cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Capsule bistability also shares features with the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> lactose switch in which expression of <italic>lacZYA</italic> is either ON or OFF, depending on the presence of a metabolized inducer. Theoretical studies show that at high or low inducer levels the population is uniformly <italic>lacZYA</italic> ON or OFF respectively, while at intermediate inducer levels the population bifurcates, giving rise to both steady states [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In terms of 1B<sup>4</sup> colony switching, high pyrimidine levels result in the CAP OFF state (producing uniform Cap<sup>-</sup> colonies as in SBW25 and 1A<sup>4</sup>), and lower pyrimidine levels result in bistable CAP expression and thus colony bistability. Even lower pyrimidine levels push the population towards a majority CAP ON and opaque colonies (as in the <italic>ndk</italic> transposon mutant, JG176ΔCre).</p>
<p>If our conclusions concerning the existence of a cell cycle checkpoint are correct, then such a checkpoint is likely conserved across many bacteria. Recent work in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> has shown that UDP-glucose and downstream polysaccharide biosynthetic enzymes (OpgH and UgtP, respectively) are part of a signal cascade that influences cell-fate decisions in response to nutrient availability [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. At the molecular level, these enzymes bind to FtsZ, inhibiting assembly of the cell division spindle. Further, it has been noted that disruptions in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> UDP-glucose—through inactivation of <italic>pgm</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.)—alter the timing of cell division, resulting in short cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Disruptions in <italic>pgi</italic>, <italic>pgm</italic>, or <italic>galU</italic> showed a similar, short-cell phenotype in 1B<sup>4</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Further, overexpression of <italic>galU</italic> resulted in long cells in both 1B<sup>4</sup> and SBW25 (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The conservation of these effects on cell division strongly indicates that GalU, UDP-glucose, and/or downstream enzymes influence cell division in SBW25. Thus, we propose that UDP-glucose may act not only as a nutrient sensor but also as a nucleotide sensor during progression through the cell cycle.</p>
<p>Evolution works with the building blocks at its disposal, typically via small modifications [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While the jump in phenotypic space associated with the emergence of colony switching in 1B<sup>4</sup> is large, the innovation is underpinned by a minor genetic change that has resulted in apparent modification of the threshold for flipping an existing epigenetic switch; selection appears to have taken advantage of molecular noise to generate an adaptive phenotype. Whether such a starting position is typical for the emergence of a classical contingency locus is unclear, but it is possible that phenotypic switches with an epigenetic basis [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] are the evolutionary forerunners of genetic switches and possibly even developmentally controlled regulation [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although the molecular bases of 1B<sup>4</sup> colony switching currently reside in a regulatory circuit deep in central metabolism, subsequent fluctuating selection could conceivably result in the switch being accommodated in a more specific part of the capsule machinery.

<p>Bacterial strain details are provided in <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s027" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>. Unless otherwise stated, strains were grown for 16–24 h at 28°C in shaken 30 mL glass microcosms containing 6 mL King’s Medium B (KB) [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], with appropriate supplements. Where stated, uracil, L-arginine hydrochloride, and/or guanine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the medium. Cells were plated on lysogeny broth (LB) containing 1.5% agar. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: tetracycline (10 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, Tc), kanamycin (100 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, Km), gentamicin (liquid medium 10 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, agar plates 20 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>; Gm), and nitrofurantoin (100 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, NF).</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>Cell microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiostar Plus light microscope coupled with fluorescence lighting (HBO 50/AC) where required. Fluorescence microscopy samples were incubated for ~16 h on KB plates containing 10 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> calcofluor (Fluorescent Brightener 28, Sigma-Aldrich). A dissection microscope was used for colony images. Microscopy images were cropped and processed in Preview as indicated in figure legends.</p>

<title>Time-Lapse Microscopy and Image Analysis</title>
<p>1B<sup>4</sup> cultures were grown from glycerol stocks (24 h). Cultures were mixed thoroughly, diluted 100 times in fresh KB, and grown overnight again (24 h). Bacteria were then diluted 10<sup>4</sup> times and plated on a gel pad (1% agarose in KB). The preparation was sealed with a glass coverslip using double-sided tape (Gene Frame, Fischer Scientific). A duct was cut through the pad centre to allow oxygen diffusion. Time-lapse videos of microcolonies were captured in phase contrast with an automated inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus) using a 100x/NA 1.35 objective (Apo-ph1, Olympus). Images were acquired with an Orca-R<sup>2</sup> CCD camera (Hamamatsu). Fluorescence excitation was achieved with a mercury vapour light source (EXFO X-Cite 120Q). GFP was imaged with a 485(20)/520(28)-nm filter set using a dichroic beam splitter at 500 nm (Semrock). The growth rates of Cap<sup>-</sup> and Cap<sup>+</sup> cells were determined by image analysis using MATLAB routines.</p>

<sec id="sec019">
<title>Capsule Counting Assay</title>
<p>For each strain, 3–5 replicate KB microcosms were inoculated from glycerol stocks. After a 24-h incubation and a 1:1000 transfer, the proportion of Cap<sup>+</sup> cells was determined in each. Cells were diluted, transferred to a microscope slide, and stained with 1:10 diluted India ink, and a cover slip was added. After 1 min, each preparation was photographed under phase contrast 40x or 63x magnification. Capsule expression was recorded manually for 500 cells per preparation (≤100 cells assayed per photograph). Average proportions of Cap<sup>+</sup> cells were determined and statistical analyses performed. See also <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s027" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>.</p>

For each sample, single colonies were grown in 16-h glycerol-SA [<xref rid="pbio.1002109.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] cultures (shaking, 26°C), vortexed, diluted 1:100 or 1:1000 in glycerol-SA, and grown for a further 24 h. Cultures were vortexed, diluted in glycerol-SA to give an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 (total volume 10 mL in 100-mL flask). Flask cultures were grown until the midexponential phase, when a 1-mL sample was rapidly collected by centrifugation (15 sec, 16,000 <italic>g</italic>).

<title>SBW25 and 1B<sup>4</sup> growth in minimal (M9) and supplemented media.</title>
<p>Overnight cell cultures of SBW25 (<bold>A</bold>) and 1B<sup>4</sup> (<bold>B</bold>) were produced from glycerol stocks in shaking KB microcosms. A 1-mL aliquot of each was washed and resuspended in M9 medium to a common cell density (based on OD<sub>600</sub> of the KB culture). 2-μL aliquots of resuspension were used to inoculate 148 μL of appropriate fresh medium in wells of a 96-well plate. Four types of media were used: M9 (blue lines on graphs), M9 + arginine (0.6 mM, pink lines), M9 + uracil (1 mM, orange lines), and M9 + arginine + uracil (green lines). Each of the eight genotype-medium combinations was replicated five times, and the 16 wells were used as media controls. The OD<sub>600</sub> of each well was measured at 5-min intervals for 50 h, with 5 sec shaking prior to each read (using a VERSA<sub>max</sub> plate reader). Hourly time-point data was plotted (data points are means of 5 replicates +/- 1 SE). While 1B<sup>4</sup> grows more slowly than SBW25 in M9, 1B<sup>4</sup> is not an auxotroph. The 1B<sup>4</sup> growth rate deficiency is partially alleviated by addition of arginine, an effect that is increased by the addition of both arginine and uracil. The addition of uracil alone results in an even slower 1B<sup>4</sup> growth rate than observed in M9.

<title>Chemical equations defining intracellular processes and conditions surrounding the growth-capsulation model.</title>
<p>The equations describe intracellular conditions influencing the capsule switch decision (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), demonstrating that a minimal set of components can theoretically give rise to switching. All components and interactions could be substituted so long as low UXP (signal molecule) leads to a bias in UTP utilization towards CAP biosynthesis. The system positive regulator (activator) remains constant for simplicity. (<bold>A</bold>) Describes processes affecting concentrations of the signal molecule, UXP. In the actual biological system, UXP production requires a multistep pathway; for simplicity, we model it as a constant rate (Equation A1). There are two branches for UTP utilization (<xref rid="pbio.1002109.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>); in the model, CAP synthesis is regulated solely by CAP (equation A2), and nucleotide synthesis is regulated solely by PyrG (Equation A3). To bias UTP utilization towards CAP under low UXP, the model assumes that UXP sequesters a transcriptional activator for the CAP biosynthetic genes (Equation A4). CA = CAP. (<bold>B</bold>) Encapsulates intracellular processes controlling the transcription of CAP biosynthetic genes. The primary purpose is to enable low UXP to signal CAP production. poly = DNA polymerase, DNA<sub>ca</sub> = CAP biosynthetic gene promoter, mRNA<sub>ca</sub> = CAP biosynthetic gene mRNA. (<bold>C</bold>) Encapsulates the Cap<sup>+</sup> to Cap<sup>-</sup> switch and maintenance of Cap<sup>-</sup>. Since the low UXP signal triggers Cap<sup>+</sup>, we require Cap<sup>+</sup> to induce temporary relief to capsule production. To achieve this, we invoke a repressor triggered by Cap<sup>+</sup>, via direct regulation by CAP. We assume cooperativity and dimerization in the genetic regulation so as to achieve clear delineation between high and low CAP states. (<bold>D</bold>) Defines the turnover of mRNA and protein in the cell. Degradation of the CAP transcriptional repressor allows the Cap<sup>-</sup> state to end. Thus, the time scale of protein degradation determines the length of time before the system can respond to the low UXP signal again. ø = simple molecular by-products.</p>

<title>Growth-capsulation model simulations of CAP expression at high, intermediate, and low pyrimidine pathway flux.</title>
<p>Three example outcomes of simulations of the growth-capsulation model at each of three different UXP levels (a measure of pyrimidine pathway flux) are provided. Each simulation shows how the expression of CAP changes in a single over time (h). At a high UXP level (3; <bold>A</bold>), such as that expected in the ancestral genotype, individual cells mainly express CAP at a basal (intermediate) level but show occasional high (Cap<sup>+</sup>) or low (Cap<sup>-</sup>) expression as indicated. At a low UXP level (0.003; <bold>B</bold>), such as that expected in 1B<sup>4</sup> and other switcher genotypes, CAP expression typically varies stochastically between the high and low states. Stochastic switching between all three expression levels is typical at intermediate UXP level (0.3; <bold>C</bold>).</p>

<title>Altering the model reaction rates allows the frequency of capsule switching to be tuned.</title>
<p>Cumulative distribution plots showing simulation output for the cumulative amount of time spent with a particular level or less of CAP expression, under a variety of model parameter conditions. The simulation was run under 47 sets of conditions (obtained by sequentially increasing or decreasing by a factor of 10 each of the 23 reaction rates listed in <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>, plus the original reaction conditions; see also <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Code</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002109.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Code</xref>). The dark blue line is the simulation output under the original reaction conditions. Each of the lines on the plot constitutes the mean output of ten independent simulations. All sets of parameters tested generated two humped plots (the first hump is at Cap = 0) indicating two states: Cap<sup>-</sup> and Cap<sup>+</sup>. Three reaction rate alterations resulted in Cap production in excess of 100 molecules of CAP.</p>

<title>Transposon mutants in which 1B<sup>4</sup> colony switching is eliminated.</title>
<p>Genotypic and phenotypic details of 157 1B<sup>4</sup> transposon mutants in which the transposon insertion affects bistable capsule expression. Mutants were obtained by screening approximately 68,750 transposon mutants from 41 independent conjugations for loss of colony-level switching. Mutants are classified according to the cellular function likely to be affected by the capsulation-altering insertion. Where available, the precise genomic location of the transposon is indicated as the first base on the genomic forward strand downstream of the 3ʹ transposon terminus. For mutants of particular interest, a Cre-deletion (removing most of the transposon and thus eliminating polar effects) was obtained and analysed.
