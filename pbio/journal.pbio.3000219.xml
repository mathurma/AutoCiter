<abstract>
<p>Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a well-conserved cellular process through which cytoplasmic components are delivered to the vacuole/lysosome for degradation and recycling. Studies have revealed the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related (<italic>ATG</italic>) genes upon nutrient deprivation. However, little is known about their translational regulation. Here, we found that Dhh1, a DExD/H-box RNA helicase, is required for efficient translation of Atg1 and Atg13, two proteins essential for autophagy induction. Dhh1 directly associates with <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs under nitrogen-starvation conditions. The structured regions shortly after the start codons of the two <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs are necessary for their translational regulation by Dhh1. Both the RNA-binding ability and helicase activity of Dhh1 are indispensable to promote Atg1 translation and autophagy. Moreover, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E)-associated protein 1 (Eap1), a target of rapamycin (TOR)-regulated EIF4E binding protein, physically interacts with Dhh1 after nitrogen starvation and facilitates the translation of Atg1 and Atg13. These results suggest a model for how some <italic>ATG</italic> genes bypass the general translational suppression that occurs during nitrogen starvation to maintain a proper level of autophagy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autophagy is a tightly controlled cellular process by which cytosolic proteins, protein aggregates, damaged or surplus organelles, and invading pathogens are sequestered within a double-membrane vesicle (the autophagosome) and then delivered to the vacuole/lysosome for degradation and recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref002">2</xref>]. Autophagy is highly conserved among eukaryotes. Malfunction of autophagy has been associated with many human diseases, including cancer, myopathies, liver, heart and lung disease, and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies in yeasts have identified more than 40 autophagy-related (<italic>ATG</italic>) genes involved in mediating autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref007">7</xref>], and many of the corresponding gene products have homologs or functional counterparts in higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref002">2</xref>]. The expression levels of <italic>ATG</italic> genes are important for maintaining proper levels of autophagy activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref009">9</xref>]. Expression of most <italic>ATG</italic> genes is up-regulated under autophagy-inducing conditions such as nutrient deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref010">10</xref>]. The transcriptional regulation of <italic>ATG</italic> genes has been extensively investigated, and an increasing number of transcriptional activators and repressors involved in autophagy regulation are being characterized in both yeast and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Two recent studies from our lab and collaborators showed that under nutrient-rich conditions, <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs are down-regulated at the posttranscriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref016">16</xref>]. The main mRNA decapping 2 (Dcp2) mediates the decapping of almost all major <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs, whereas the RNA exoribonuclease 1 (Xrn1) is responsible for the degradation of some of them. A subset of <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs is conveyed to the decapping machinery by Dhh1, a DExD/H-box RNA helicase. These studies demonstrated that <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs are degraded by decapping-mediated mRNA decay so that their expression is restricted to maintain autophagy activity at a basal level under nutrient-rich conditions. Our lab recently also reported that the conserved Pat1–Lsm complex protects some <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs from exosome-dependent 3′-5′ degradation under nitrogen-starvation conditions. This allows stabilization of these <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs and efficient expression to induce autophagy during nitrogen starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>However, it is not well known whether and how the expression of <italic>ATG</italic> genes is translationally regulated when nutrients are limited. Under nutrient-deprivation conditions, the translation of most genes across the genome is down-regulated, whereas expression of most <italic>ATG</italic> genes is up-regulated and maintained at relatively high levels to support the increased demands of autophagy activity. This suggests that there is likely to be a specialized regulation mechanism through which the <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs escape the general translation inhibition when nutrients are depleted, conditions under which autophagy becomes essential.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that in contrast to its role as an autophagy inhibitor when nutrients are rich, Dhh1 facilitates translation of <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs under nitrogen-starvation conditions. Dhh1 associates with <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs under this condition. The helicase activity of Dhh1 is necessary to drive Atg protein translation, and the structured regions shortly after the start codons of <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs are required for their Dhh1-dependent translation. Moreover, under nitrogen-starvation conditions when target of rapamycin 1 (TOR1) activity is inhibited, Dhh1 physically interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E)-associated protein 1 (Eap1), an EIF4E binding protein (EIF4EBP), to associate with the translation initiation complex. Despite its well-known roles as a repressor of cap-dependent translation, Eap1 promotes Atg1 and Atg13 translation under nitrogen-starvation conditions. Finally, we show that DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6), the mammalian homolog of Dhh1, is required for translational up-regulation of autophagy related 16 like 1 (<italic>ATG16L1</italic>) during amino acid starvation in human embryonic kidney 293A (HEK293A) cells.</p>

<title>Dhh1 positively regulates autophagy under nitrogen-starvation conditions</title>
<p>The DExD/H-box-containing RCK family RNA helicases are highly conserved in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref018">18</xref>]. These proteins play important roles in regulating mRNA degradation, storage, and translation. Recently, others and we have shown that under nutrient-rich conditions, Dhh1—a DExD/H-box protein—targets several <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs, most significantly <italic>ATG8</italic> transcripts, for degradation through the Dcp2-mediated mRNA decapping pathway to restrict autophagy activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref016">16</xref>]. Consistent with this observation, deletion of the <italic>DHH1</italic> gene in yeast cells led to elevated <italic>ATG8</italic> expression and autophagy activity levels under both nutrient-rich and short-term (0–3 h) nitrogen-starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We noticed that after relatively longer periods of starvation (i.e., 6 h or longer), the Atg8 protein level and the autophagy activity in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells were not significantly different from those of wild-type (WT) cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of Dhh1 on <italic>ATG8</italic> expression and autophagy were released after prolonged nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>However, the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells displayed much lower viability compared to the WT cells after several days of nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). An obvious question then is what contributes to the low viability of the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells after prolonged nitrogen starvation and whether autophagy still plays a role. To answer this, we needed to test autophagy activity in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells under conditions of prolonged nitrogen starvation. However, the commonly used autophagy flux assays in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref019">19</xref>], such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP)–Atg8 processing and Pho8Δ60 assays, are not suitable for this purpose, because the autophagy activity in the WT cells tested with these assays usually becomes saturated after 4 to 6 h of nitrogen starvation. Thus, we developed a phosphoglucoisomerase 1 (Pgi1)–GFP-processing assay to quantitatively monitor autophagy activity during prolonged nitrogen starvation. Pgi1 is a long-lived cytosolic protein that has a relatively stable expression even upon prolonged nitrogen-starvation conditions. As with most cytosolic proteins, we expect that, upon starvation, the cytosolic Pgi1–GFP fusion protein is delivered to the vacuole for degradation through nonselective autophagy. The GFP moiety is relatively resistant to vacuolar degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref020">20</xref>]; thus, consistent with our prediction, we observed an accumulation of the free GFP band in the WT cell lysates by western blot at 1 d after autophagy induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). There was no processing of Pgi1–GFP in the <italic>atg1Δ</italic> cells that are defective for autophagy, demonstrating that the generation of free GFP was dependent on autophagic degradation of the chimera. In the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells, a substantially reduced amount of free GFP was detected starting at 1 d after nitrogen starvation compared to the WT cells, suggesting that long-term autophagy was impaired in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Similar results were observed when we examined the processing of another long-lived cytosolic fusion protein, fructose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase 1 (Fba1)–GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). These data suggest that Dhh1 switches its role as a positive regulator of autophagy after prolonged starvation conditions. The decreased cell survival in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells after prolonged nitrogen starvation may be due to diminished autophagy activity in the mutant.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells already showed significant autophagy defects after 6 h of nitrogen starvation based on the Pgi1–GFP processing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Plasmid-based expression of Dhh1–protein A (PA) in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells significantly suppressed the autophagy defects in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These data suggest that Dhh1 positively regulates autophagy under both short and prolonged nitrogen-starvation conditions, the former being in apparent contradiction with the GFP–Atg8 data.</p>
<p>The observation of decreased Pgi1–GFP processing in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> strain under both short- and long-term starvation led us to wonder whether the accumulated higher GFP–Atg8 expression under nutrient-rich conditions seen in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref016">16</xref>]) led to an inaccurate measure of autophagy activity based on the GFP–Atg8-processing assay following a shift to nitrogen-starvation conditions. That is, <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells express higher levels of several <italic>ATG</italic> genes in nutrient-rich conditions, and the higher levels of the corresponding proteins lead to an apparent increase in autophagy activity shortly after shifting cells to starvation conditions. Thus, examining the constitutive null mutant could temporarily mask any effects due to the absence of Dhh1 shortly after autophagy induction.</p>
<p>To exclude the effects of Dhh1 on autophagy under nutrient-rich conditions, we took advantage of the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system to conditionally knock down <italic>DHH1</italic> expression under starvation conditions. This system is well established in yeast cells to temporally control gene expression by mediating proteasomal degradation of targeted proteins in an auxin-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref021">21</xref>]. To induce efficient and fast degradation of Dhh1–AID, we pretreated the cells with 300 μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) for 30 min under nutrient-rich conditions. The cells were then shifted to nitrogen-starvation medium, and continued IAA treatment in this condition was sufficient to maintain Dhh1–AID protein at a minimal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Compared to the cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), we observed lower autophagy activity after 6-h nitrogen starvation based on the GFP–Atg8 processing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). As a control, IAA treatment in the WT cells did not affect autophagy activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Our observations collectively suggest that Dhh1 is a bidirectional regulator of autophagy, whose role is controlled by nutrient conditions. Dhh1 acts as a negative regulator to direct some <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs for degradation under nutrient-rich conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref016">16</xref>]. Here, our data imply a newly discovered role for Dhh1 to positively regulate autophagy under nitrogen-starvation conditions.</p>

<title>Dhh1 promotes the translation of Atg1 and Atg13 under nitrogen-starvation conditions</title>
<p>Next, we decided to determine how Dhh1 promotes autophagy during nitrogen starvation. A recent genome-wide study suggested that Dhh1 is able to both suppress and promote mRNA translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref022">22</xref>]. However, this study was performed under nutrient-rich conditions when autophagy is not induced, and it did not identify any <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs within the core autophagy molecular machinery being directly translationally regulated by Dhh1. Accordingly, we specifically asked whether Dhh1 regulates mRNA translation under nitrogen-starvation conditions and whether any <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs are direct targets of Dhh1.</p>
<p>The previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref022">22</xref>] suggested that a feature of the mRNAs translationally activated by Dhh1 is that the nucleotides at positions 50–120 after the start codons of these mRNAs show a high intrinsic tendency to form secondary structures. We used Structural Profile Assignment of RNA Coding Sequences (SPARCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref023">23</xref>], a program to analyze structured regions in mRNA coding sequences, to predict if any of the <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs are potential targets of Dhh1. Out of the 18 <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs that constitute the core autophagy molecular machinery analyzed, only <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs showed potential structured regions in the open reading frames (ORFs) shortly after the start codons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s009">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Atg1 and Atg13 proteins are the main components of a kinase complex essential for sensing upstream nutrient signals and initiating the autophagy process.</p>
<p>To test whether <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs are bona fide targets of Dhh1, we first checked their expression when the <italic>DHH1</italic> gene was deleted. The Atg1 and Atg13–PA protein levels were substantially decreased in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells compared to the WT cells after 6 h of nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Under nutrient-rich conditions, a higher Atg1 protein level was observed in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells compared to WT cells, consistent with the suggested role of Dhh1 in promoting decapping of some <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs in this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref016">16</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). As controls, we examined <italic>ATG2</italic> and vacuolar protein sorting 30 (<italic>VPS30</italic>)/<italic>ATG6</italic> mRNAs, which did not contain structured regions shortly after start codons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). We also did not observe decreased Atg2–PA and Vps30/Atg6 protein levels in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells compared to the WT cells after nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>). By quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), we found that there were no significant reductions in the <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNA levels with the deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Moreover, when Dhh1 was conditionally knocked down via the AID system, we also observed a lower Atg1 protein level under nitrogen-starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that Dhh1 may promote Atg1 and Atg13 translation during nitrogen starvation. However, Dhh1 is not essential for translation of the two proteins. Accordingly, compared to WT cells, the strain deleted only for <italic>DHH1</italic> showed partial defects in cell viability after 10 d of nitrogen starvation, whereas the <italic>atg1Δ</italic> and the <italic>atg13Δ</italic> cells displayed complete loss of viability after the same treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s002">S2D Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>DDX6 regulates ATG16L1 translation</title>
<p>Next, we decided to test whether regulation of Atg protein translation by Dhh1 is conserved in more-complex eukaryotes. To find potential targets of DDX6, the mammalian homolog of Dhh1, we analyzed the structures of some core mammalian autophagy-related mRNAs using SPARCS. Although unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (<italic>ULK1</italic>; one of the <italic>ATG1</italic> homologs) was not predicted to have structured regions in its transcript, such regions were predicted for <italic>ATG16L1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether <italic>ATG16L1</italic> is subjected to DDX6-dependent regulation in the context of amino acid starvation.</p>
<p>In WT HEK293A cells, the ATG16L1 protein level, but not the <italic>ATG16L1</italic> mRNA level, increased significantly after 8 and 24 h of amino acid starvation compared to that under normal conditions, suggesting that <italic>ATG16L1</italic> translation is up-regulated during amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s003">S3B–S3D Fig</xref>). In contrast, the ULK1 protein level decreased after amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). In the <italic>DDX6</italic> knockout cells, the basal <italic>ATG16L1</italic> mRNA and ATG16L1 protein levels were higher under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). In contrast to the WT, however, upon amino acid starvation the ATG16L1 protein level in the <italic>DDX6</italic> knockout cells did not display a further increase; instead, there was a significant reduction in the ATG16L1 protein level 24 h after amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s003">S3B and S3C Fig</xref>), implying that the knockout cells could not up-regulate <italic>ATG16L1</italic> mRNA translation. As a control, the ULK1 protein level was not altered in the <italic>DDX6</italic> knockout cells after amino acid starvation relative to the WT. The results collectively suggest that DDX6 is necessary for translational up-regulation of <italic>ATG16L1</italic> during amino acid starvation in HEK293A cells, indicating that some aspects of translational control are conserved.</p>

<title>Dhh1 associates with <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs during nitrogen starvation</title>
<p>To further test our hypothesis that Dhh1 regulates Atg1 and Atg13 translation, we examined whether Dhh1 associates with these two mRNAs under nitrogen-starvation conditions. The RNA immunoprecipitation (IP) assay has been utilized to investigate protein–RNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref024">24</xref>]. We immunoprecipitated Dhh1–PA with immunoglobulin G (IgG)-conjugated Sepharose beads from lysates prepared from cells starved for nitrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As a control, nitrogen-starved lysates from cells in which Dhh1 was not tagged were subjected to the same procedures in parallel. Subsequently, the affinity-isolated RNA fragments were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Through this approach, we found that, relative to the control group, significantly more <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNA fragments were precipitated with Dhh1–PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). In addition, the strain expressing Dhh1–PA showed a higher enrichment at both the 5′-UTR and the 3′-UTR regions of <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs. This latter finding suggests that Dhh1 may bind to these transcripts at both of these regions. Moreover, Dhh1–PA showed no or limited binding to most other <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), implying that Dhh1 specifically interacts with <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs under nitrogen-starvation conditions.</p>

<p>To test whether the 5′-UTR and/or the 3′-UTR regions of <italic>ATG1</italic> mRNA is required for regulation by Dhh1, we constructed strains expressing different versions of <italic>ATG1</italic> mRNAs in which either the 5′-UTR or the 3′-UTR region was exchanged. When the native promoter of <italic>ATG1</italic> on the chromosome was switched to the plasma membrane proteolipid 3 (<italic>PMP3</italic>) promoter (which is not predicted to be affected by Dhh1), deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> did not lead to decreased Atg1 protein levels compared to the control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). We also generated <italic>atg1Δ</italic> strains in which <italic>ATG1</italic> was expressed under its native promoter and with either the <italic>ATG1</italic> or <italic>ATG7</italic> 3′-UTR. Depletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> resulted in decreased Atg1 protein levels in the cells expressing the <italic>ATG1</italic> mRNA with its native 3′-UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Conversely, knocking out the <italic>DHH1</italic> gene did not result in less Atg1 translation in the <italic>atg1Δ</italic> cells complemented with the <italic>ATG1</italic> mRNA having the <italic>ATG7</italic> 3′-UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). These data suggest that both the 5′-UTR and the 3′-UTR regions of <italic>ATG1</italic> mRNA are very likely to be necessary for Dhh1-dependent translational regulation. Similar results were observed when the native 3′-UTR of <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNA was replaced with the <italic>ATG7</italic> 3′-UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s004">S4D Fig</xref>), further demonstrating the importance of the 3′-UTR regions in the <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs in terms of translational regulation by Dhh1.</p>
<p>The residues in Dhh1 that are important for its RNA binding have been identified previously. For example, the Dhh1<sup>H369A</sup> and Dhh1<sup>R370A</sup> mutants bind RNAs less efficiently both in vitro and in yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref025">25</xref>]. To further demonstrate that RNA binding of Dhh1 is required for its role in regulating <italic>ATG</italic> translation and autophagy, we generated a yeast strain that stably expresses the Dhh1<sup>H369A,R370A</sup>–PA mutant (“HRAA” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). After nitrogen starvation, the Atg1 protein level in the mutant cells was significantly lower than that in the cells expressing WT Dhh1–PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). The autophagy activity was also diminished in the Dhh1<sup>H369A,R370A</sup>–PA mutant cells tested by the Pgi1–GFP-processing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that Dhh1 binds to <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs and that the RNA binding is necessary for its role in promoting their translation and autophagy under nitrogen-starvation conditions.</p>

<p>Based on the observation that Dhh1 plays a role in the efficient translation of <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNA, we decided to further investigate whether the predicted structured regions shortly after the start codons of these genes are required for this regulation. We constructed plasmids expressing either WT Atg1 or WT Atg13–PA or their mutant versions by changing the third base of the codons near the structured regions to make them unstructured without modifying the amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s005">S5A Fig</xref>).

<p>As an RNA helicase, Dhh1 was previously hypothesized to modify the structured regions of its target mRNAs so that the translation initiation occurs more efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref022">22</xref>]. The “DExD/H” and “SAT” motifs are residues important for the helicase activity of the proteins in this family, and the motifs are highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref027">27</xref>]. To test the hypothesis with regard to <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic>, we made constructs stably expressing Dhh1<sup>D195A,E196A</sup>–PA, Dhh1<sup>S226A,T228A</sup>–PA, or Dhh1<sup>D195A,E196A,S226A,T228A</sup>–PA, which are expected to display diminished helicase activity. Compared to the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells expressing WT Dhh1–PA, significantly lower Atg1 protein levels were observed in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells with Dhh1<sup>D195A,E196A,S226A,T228A</sup>–PA under nitrogen-starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

<title>Dhh1 interacts with Eap1 under nitrogen-starvation conditions</title>
<p>Dhh1 has recently been shown to associate with the translation initiation machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref022">22</xref>], but it is not known whether Dhh1 directly binds to the translation initiation complex, nor is it clear how the association is regulated after nitrogen starvation. In eukaryotic cells, translation occurs mostly in a cap-dependent manner, which requires the formation of the EIF4F complex, including EIF4A, EIF4E, and EIF4G on the 5′-UTR of mRNAs. EIF4G is a scaffold for the complex and interacts with EIF4E, which directly binds to the 5′ mRNA cap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref028">28</xref>]. When mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1 (MTORC1) kinase activity is inhibited upon nitrogen starvation, EIF4EBPs inhibit translation through competing with EIF4G to bind EIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Although EIF4EBPs generally inhibit translation, they play positive roles in the translation of some mRNAs in breast cancer cells under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref029">29</xref>]. In addition, <italic>Thor/4E-BP1</italic> null flies are more sensitive to starvation compared to WT flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref030">30</xref>]. These studies indicate that EIF4EBPs may function positively on certain mRNAs under specific stress conditions. In yeast, Eap1, an EIF4EBP, physically interacts with Dhh1 when nutrients are rich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref031">31</xref>], leading us to propose that Eap1 plays a role in regulating <italic>ATG</italic> mRNA translation by modulating the interaction between Dhh1 and the translation initiation machinery. In addition, Eap1 is not essential and targets only a subset of mRNAs, making it a good candidate for further analysis.</p>
<p>First, we examined whether Eap1 interacts with Dhh1 under nitrogen-starvation conditions. We immunoprecipitated either endogenous or overexpressed levels of Eap1–PA with IgG-conjugated Sepharose beads from lysates of cells subjected to nitrogen starvation. The Dhh1–3HA protein was affinity-isolated together with Eap1–PA in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). In addition, when Dhh1–MYC from yeast cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with anti-MYC beads, a significant amount of Eap1–GFP protein was also precipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Finally, when the samples were treated with RNase, the amount of Dhh1–3HA affinity isolated by Eap1–PA significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These results collectively demonstrate that Dhh1 interacts with Eap1 in an RNA-dependent manner under nitrogen-starvation conditions.</p>

<p>To further characterize the interaction between Dhh1 and Eap1, we decided to map the regions of the two proteins mediating the interaction. We started the analysis with predictions of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) by IUPred2 and disordered binding regions by ANCHOR2 in Dhh1 and Eap1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref032">32</xref>]. The C terminus of Dhh1 contains a disordered binding region (amino acids 440–506) that may mediate dynamic protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). The Eap1 protein is highly disordered and has several disordered binding regions; only residues 80–150 in Eap1 are predicted to be ordered and/or structured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s006">S6C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the information from the predictions, we constructed yeast strains expressing Eap1–PA, together with either WT Dhh1–3HA or Dhh1[1–425]–3HA, which lacks the predicted disordered binding region. When Eap1–PA was immunoprecipitated with IgG-coated beads, WT Dhh1–3HA, but not Dhh1[1–425]–3HA, was pulled down, suggesting that the C-terminal 81 amino acids of Dhh1 are required for the interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). We also determined that residues 1–270 of Eap1 are sufficient to bind to WT Dhh1–3HA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000219.s006">S6E Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The DExD/H-box RNA helicases Dhh1 and its Vad1 homolog in <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> bind certain <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs and direct them to the decapping enzyme Dcp2 for degradation under nutrient-rich conditions, maintaining autophagy at a basal level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref016">16</xref>]. When autophagy is induced by nutrient deprivation, inhibition of TOR leads to the loss of Dcp2 phosphorylation and a subsequent decrease in decapping activity. However, Vad1 or Dhh1 still show binding affinity toward some <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs after nutrient deprivation, though to a lesser extent than that seen in nutrient-rich conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref016">16</xref>]. Because the <italic>ATG</italic> mRNA levels in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells under starvation conditions are similar to those in WT cells, the binding of Dhh1 to the <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs seen in these conditions may not be related to mRNA stability. Here, we found that Dhh1 promotes autophagy by targeting <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs to the translation initiation machinery after nutrient deprivation, revealing the bidirectional roles of Dhh1 in regulating autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g007">Fig 7</xref>). These observations also suggest that Dhh1 is able to deliver mRNAs to different RNA processing machineries, resulting in distinct fates of the mRNAs—under growing conditions, Dhh1 targets certain <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs for degradation but subsequently acts as a factor that promotes autophagy by facilitating <italic>ATG</italic> mRNA translation during starvation.</p>

<title>A model for the dual roles of Dhh1 in regulating autophagy under different conditions.</title>
<p>(A) Under nutrient-rich conditions, Dhh1 delivers some <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs such as <italic>ATG8</italic> transcripts to the mRNA decapping machinery to mediate their degradation, maintaining <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs and autophagy at basal levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref016">16</xref>]. TOR is active under this condition and phosphorylates Dcp2, the major decapping enzyme, to promote its decapping activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref016">16</xref>]. However, general mRNAs are actively translated when TOR is active. (B) Upon nitrogen starvation, TOR is inhibited and the translation of general mRNAs is repressed. In contrast, Dhh1 associates with <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs and interacts with Eap1, an EIF4E binding protein, facilitating their delivery to the translation initiation complex to promote their translation and thus autophagy activity. <italic>ATG</italic>, autophagy-related; Dcp2, mRNA decapping 2; Eap1, EIF4E–associated protein 1; EIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; TOR, target of rapamycin.</p>

<p>What are the factors determining the outcomes of these mRNAs? Our analysis implicates specific elements within the mRNAs. When the structured regions shortly after the start codons of <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs were mutated to be unstructured or disordered, translation of the mRNAs was no longer promoted by Dhh1 after starvation. The regions that Dhh1 binds may also contribute to determining their fates. We showed that Dhh1 associates with both the 5′-UTR and the 3′-UTR of <italic>ATG1</italic> mRNA. When either the native 5′-UTR or the 3′-UTR of <italic>ATG1</italic> mRNA was replaced by the corresponding elements from genes not affected by Dhh1, the mutant mRNAs were not translationally regulated by Dhh1. In mammalian cells, it was reported that DDX6 binds to the 3′-UTR in the mRNAs of positive regulators of proliferation and/or self-renewal such as cyclin dependent kinase 1 (<italic>CDK1</italic>) and enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (<italic>EZH2</italic>) to facilitate their translation in epidermal progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref035">35</xref>]. In contrast, DDX6 binds to the 5′-UTR of Kruppel like factor 4 (<italic>KLF4</italic>), which encodes a differentiation-inducing transcription factor to mediate its degradation through the decapping pathway. Therefore, some intrinsic feature(s) inside the regions Dhh1 binds may also be critical for deciding what to do with the bound mRNAs. Conversely, regulation of interactions between Dhh1 and the different RNA function machineries may also be indispensable, though this is largely unexplored. Is it possible that posttranslational modifications of Dhh1 are involved? Does the binding to mRNAs induce different conformational changes of Dhh1 that favor distinct protein–protein interactions?</p>
<p>Cap-dependent translation initiation requires formation of an EIF4F complex on mRNAs. The EIF4F complex is composed of three major components: EIF4A, EIF4E, and EIF4G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref036">36</xref>]. EIF4EBPs inhibit translation initiation by competing with EIF4G to bind EIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref037">37</xref>]. TOR, an autophagy inhibitor, positively regulates cap-dependent translation by allowing the replacement of EIF4EBPs with EIF4G under nutrient-rich conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref028">28</xref>]. Upon nutrient deprivation, TOR is inhibited, resulting in translational repression of approximately 98% of the cellular genes. This is partly due to dephosphorylation and activation of EIF4EBPs upon TOR inhibition, which in turn suppresses complex formation between EIF4G and EIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref038">38</xref>]. However, Eap1, a yeast EIF4EBP, unexpectedly promotes <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNA translation under starvation conditions. This function is specific to Eap1 in that the other known EIF4EBP in yeast, Caf20, does not play a role in regulating the translation of these two mRNAs or autophagy activity. Eap1 has a unique long C-terminal region that is absent in both Caf20 and its mammalian homologs. This region may distinguish Eap1 as a positive regulator of <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs. It would be interesting to identify a functional counterpart of the C-terminal part of Eap1 in higher eukaryotes; it is possible that the domain’s function is executed by some uncharacterized protein(s) in mammals.</p>
<p>Eap1 was reported to physically interact with Dhh1, coordinating with the decapping complex to degrade translationally suppressed mRNAs under nutrient-rich conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref031">31</xref>]. However, the Eap1–Dhh1 complex facilitates the translation of <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs upon nutrient deprivation. Nonetheless, the signaling that controls the switch of roles is unknown. The long C-terminal region of Eap1 is not required for its interaction with Dhh1, but it is necessary for promoting Atg protein translation. This region is highly phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref042">42</xref>]. It is very likely that the phosphorylation regulation of Eap1 by TOR and/or other kinases and the potential interaction partners of Eap1 through its C-terminal region are important in regulating the switch of the roles of the Eap1–Dhh1 complex.</p>
<p>We propose that Dhh1 helicase activity is required for its function based on sequence homology and the effect of the D195A E196A S226A T228A quadruple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g004">Fig 4</xref>). However, we have not been able to verify the effect of these mutations on helicase activity in vitro. A previous study demonstrated that WT Dhh1 does not display in vitro helicase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref043">43</xref>]. This apparent lack of activity is likely due to a requirement for accessory factors, as demonstrated for the EIF4A DEAD-box helicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref026">26</xref>], and Dhh1 helicase accessory factors have not yet been identified. Furthermore, the DEAD-box motif mutant is likely defective in ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref044">44</xref>], which is a prerequisite for helicase activity. Based on the crystal structure of Dhh1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref025">25</xref>], however, the DEAD-box motif is located away from residues shown to be required for RNA binding. Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the quadruple mutant generated in this study affects Atg1 and Atg13 translation because of defects in binding the corresponding transcripts, we consider this possibility unlikely.</p>
<p>In summary, our study in yeast shows how under conditions of nitrogen starvation, <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNA translation, which is crucial for maintaining autophagy activity and cell viability, is promoted when general translation is inhibited through a special translation regulatory machinery including structured mRNA, Dhh1, and Eap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000219.g007">Fig 7</xref>). We also demonstrated that in HEK293A cells under conditions of amino acid starvation, DDX6 facilitates the translation of <italic>ATG16L1</italic> mRNA, which also shows potential structured regions shortly after the start codon. This finding suggests that the mechanism of translational regulation of <italic>ATG</italic> genes involving Dhh1 is conserved in more-complex eukaryotes, although the specific genes that are regulated may differ. During preparation of our manuscript, a study showed that EIF5A promotes <italic>ATG3</italic> translation and autophagy in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref045">45</xref>], further demonstrating that specialized molecular mechanisms that underlie the translational up-regulation of autophagy-related genes in stress conditions are critical.</p>

<p>The RNA IP assay was adapted from the protocol described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000219.ref024">24</xref>]. Dhh1–PA and Dhh1 untagged cells were cultured to mid-log phase in YPD and then were starved for 2 h in SD-N medium. The starved cells were subjected to cross-linking with 0.8% formaldehyde for 10 min before being harvested. The cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine. After washing with PBS, the samples were resuspended in FA lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Before vortexing with glass beads to lyse the cells, PMSF (5 mM final concentration), 1 tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and RNasin PLUS RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added into the buffer. The lysates were collected and sonicated at 4 °C with 3 rounds of 15-s pulses with 45% amplitude. After centrifugation at 10,000<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, the supernatants were recovered. An aliquot of each sample was stored at −80 °C as inputs for later use. The remainder of the supernatant fractions were incubated with IgG Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) overnight at 4 °C. IP fractions were washed with FA lysis buffer several times and one time with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA). Then, the proteins and RNAs were eluted in RIP elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) with RNase inhibitor at 70 °C for 10 min. The IP elution and input samples were reverse cross-linked by incubation with proteinase K for 1 h at 42 °C, followed by 1 h at 65 °C. The RNA in these samples was then recovered with acid-phenol:chloroform (pH 4.5) and subsequent ethanol precipitation. Glycogen (20 μg) was added to the samples to facilitate RNA precipitation. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and dried. The samples were next treated using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove residual DNA.

<title>Protein–protein coimmunoprecipitation assay</title>
<p>Yeast cells were cultured in YPD medium to mid-log phase. The cells were washed with sterile water one time before they were shifted to SD-N medium for 2-h starvation. Cells (50 OD units) for each sample were harvested and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed by vortexing them with glass beads in lysis buffer (10×PBS, 200 mM sorbitol, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche Diagnostic, 1 tablet for 500 μl solution], RNasin PLUS RNase inhibitor [Promega]) at 4 °C. After spinning down the cell debris, 50 μl of the supernatant of each sample was saved as total lysate, and 500 μl of the supernatant was subjected to IP. For total lysate, proteins were precipitated by adding 1 ml 10% TCA, and the samples were kept on ice for 30 min before centrifugation. The pellets were washed with acetone once and then air dried. Next, 50 μl MURB (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> [pH 7.0], 2.5 mM MES [pH 7.0], 1% SDS, 3 M urea, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>, 0.2 μg/μl bromophenol blue) was added before the samples were heated at 55 °C for 15 min.
