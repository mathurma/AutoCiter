        <p>Apoptotic cells in animals are engulfed by phagocytic cells and subsequently degraded inside phagosomes. To study the mechanisms controlling the degradation of apoptotic cells, we developed time-lapse imaging protocols in developing  <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos and established the temporal order of multiple events during engulfment and phagosome maturation. These include sequential enrichment on phagocytic membranes of phagocytic receptor cell death abnormal 1 (CED-1), large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), and the small GTPase RAB-7, as well as the incorporation of endosomes and lysosomes to phagosomes. Two parallel genetic pathways are known to control the engulfment of apoptotic cells in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>. We found that null mutations in each pathway not only delay or block engulfment, but also delay the degradation of engulfed apoptotic cells. One of the pathways, composed of CED-1, the adaptor protein CED-6, and DYN-1, controls the rate of enrichment of PI(3)P and RAB-7 on phagosomal surfaces and the formation of phagolysosomes. We further identified an essential role of RAB-7 in promoting the recruitment and fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes. We propose that RAB-7 functions as a downstream effector of the CED-1 pathway to mediate phagolysosome formation. Our work suggests that phagocytic receptors, which were thought to act specifically in initiating engulfment, also control phagosome maturation through the sequential activation of multiple effectors such as dynamin, PI(3)P, and Rab GTPases.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>Cells undergoing programmed cell death, or apoptosis, within an animal are swiftly engulfed by phagocytes and degraded inside phagosomes, vesicles in which the apoptotic cell is bounded by the engulfing cell's membrane. Little is known about how the degradation process is triggered and controlled. We studied the degradation of apoptotic cells during the development of the nematode <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content>. Aided by a newly developed live-cell imaging technique, we identified multiple cellular events occurring on phagosomal surfaces and tracked the initiation signal to CED-1, a phagocytic receptor known to recognize apoptotic cells and to initiate their engulfment. CED-1 activates DYN-1, a large GTPase, which further activates downstream events, leading intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes to deliver to phagosomes various molecules essential for the degradation of apoptotic cells. As well as establishing a temporal order of events that lead to the degradation of apoptotic cells, the results suggest that phagocytic receptors, in addition to initiating phagocytosis, promote phagosome maturation through the sequential activation of multiple effector molecules.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>An engulfing cell recognizes an apoptotic cell through phagocytic receptor(s) and extends thin pseudopods around it to generate a phagocytic cup. The fusion of growing pseudopods and scission of a vacuole containing the apoptotic cell from the plasmalemma generate a phagosome inside the host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. The swift engulfment (phagocytosis) and subsequent degradation of apoptotic cells inside phagosomes eliminate dying cells before they release any potentially harmful contents, and actively prevent tissue injury, inflammatory responses, and autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b002">2</xref>]. Inefficient degradation of the components of engulfed apoptotic cells, such as nuclear DNA, similar to inefficient engulfment, results in severe inflammatory and autoimmune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b004">4</xref>].</p>

      <p>Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms driving the degradation of apoptotic cells remain largely unknown. Our current knowledge of phagosome maturation, the process that results in the complete degradation of phagosomal contents, is primarily obtained through the studies of phagosomes containing opsonized foreign pathogens or undigestible latex beads. Early during phagosomal maturation, signaling molecules such as Rab5 and PI(3)P are observed to be enriched on nascent phagosomes and act to recruit multiple downstream factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b005">5</xref>]. Early and late endosomes and lysosomes continue to fuse with phagosomes, and provide necessary lipids and proteins for phagosome maturation. Phagosome lumen is gradually acidified. The final state, known as a phagolysosome, is characterized by its abundance of acid hydrolases and an acidic pH environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b006">6</xref>]. The maturation of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells, by contrast, is less characterized, and may display distinct mechanistic features. Macrophages that internalize foreign pathogens secrete proinflammatory cytokines that induce inflammatory responses, whereas those engulfing apoptotic cells secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, indicating that the same type of phagocytes elicit different responses to different phagocytic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b007">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Rab GTPases are important regulators of many vesicle trafficking events. Rab7 has been implicated in the endocytic pathway, lysosomes biogenesis, and phagosomal maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b005">5</xref>]. In both mammalian and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells that ingest latex beads, the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Rab7 (Rab7(DN)) blocks the phagosomal acquisition of lysosomal contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b009">9</xref>]. It remains to be elucidated, however, whether the defect in phagolysosome formation is a secondary consequence of the defects in lysosomal biogenesis and/or functions. In addition, although the enrichment of Rab7 was observed on phagosomes containing apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b010">10</xref>], whether Rab7 is required for the processing of engulfed apoptotic cells and how Rab7 is activated by upstream signals remain unknown.</p>
      <p>During the development of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> hermaphrodites, 131 somatic cells and 300–500 germ cells undergo programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b011">11</xref>]. These apoptotic cells (referred to as cell corpses) are distinguishable from living cells as highly refractile discs under a Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b012">12</xref>]. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>, cell corpses are removed by their neighboring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b011">11</xref>]. Genetic screens have identified two parallel and partially redundant pathways that regulate the engulfment of cell corpses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b014">14</xref>]. In one pathway, the phagocytic receptor cell death abnormal 1 (CED-1) is an engulfing cell-specific, single-pass transmembrane protein that recognizes neighboring cell corpses, clusters to the growing phagocytic cups, and initiates pseudopod extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b015">15</xref>]. The large GTPase DYN-1 (dynamin) acts downstream of CED-1 and CED-6, a candidate adaptor for CED-1, to control the delivery of intracellular vesicles to both phagocytic cups and phagosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. In the other pathway, CED-5/Dock180, CED-2/CrkII, and CED-12/ELMO1 act together to regulate CED-10/Rac1 GTPase and promote cell surface extension during engulfment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b011">11</xref>]. CED-10 may also mediate certain activities for the CED-1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b016">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>Previously, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses indicated that those cell corpses that persisted for hours in <italic>ced-1</italic>, <italic>-6</italic>, <italic>-7</italic>, <italic>-2</italic>, <italic>-5</italic>, <italic>-10</italic>, and <italic>-12</italic> mutants were mostly unengulfed. It was thus proposed that these <italic>ced</italic> genes specifically control the engulfment of cell corpses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b018">18</xref>]. However, none of the corresponding <italic>ced</italic> mutants completely block engulfment, since even in the strongest single engulfment mutants, such as <italic>ced-1</italic> or <italic>ced-5</italic> mutants, only approximately 25% of embryonic apoptotic cells persist for longer than 5 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. Previous TEM analyses, which only characterized the terminal mutant phenotypes hours after the apoptosis events, were unable to determine whether the rest of cell corpses are engulfed, or to detect defects in the kinetics of engulfment and/or phagosome maturation.</p>
      <p>Recently, we developed a time-lapse imaging protocol and used it to characterize the function of DYN-1 in developing embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. We found that in engulfing cells, DYN-1 was recruited to the surface of phagocytic cups and phagosomes in a CED-1–, CED-6–, and CED-7–dependent manner. DYN-1 promoted the recruitment and fusion of endosomes to phagocytic membranes, events that provide lipid and protein material to support pseudopod extension and phagosome maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. These results suggest that the engulfment and degradation of apoptotic cells may share common regulatory mechanisms. Like <italic>dyn-1</italic> mutants, <italic>ced-1</italic> null mutant embryos display defects in the incorporation of early endosomes to phagocytic cups and phagosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>], suggesting that CED-1, and perhaps other pathway components, may also control phagosome maturation in addition to engulfment.</p>
      <p>To test the above hypothesis and to further identify the mechanism controlling the degradation of cell corpses, we developed multiple markers and further expanded the scope of our time-lapse imaging assays to monitor the processes of engulfment and phagosome maturation as well as the cellular events occurring during these processes in living embryos. We identified novel functions of both engulfment pathways in regulating the degradation of engulfed cell corpses. We further elucidate that the signaling pathway led by CED-1 promotes phagolysosome formation through activating RAB-7, whose function is essential for promoting the recruitment and fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes.</p>

        <title>PI(3)P and RAB-7 Are Sequentially Enriched on Phagosomal Surfaces</title>
        <p>We examined the maturation process of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>. Previously, we reported the transient recruitment of DYN-1 and the incorporation of early endosomes, which are labeled with HGRS-1, the worm homolog of mammalian endosomal protein Hrs, to the surface of phagosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. Here, we examined two additional molecular events on phagosomal surfaces: the accumulation of PI(3)P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b020">20</xref>] and the recruitment of small GTPase Rab7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b008">8</xref>]. We monitored both events in developing embryos using modified versions of an established protocol (Materials and Methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. In all time-lapse experiments described below, we chose to follow the engulfment and degradation of three particular apoptotic somatic cells, C1, C2, and C3, which are located near each other on the ventral side of an embryo and die almost simultaneously during embryogenesis, at approximately 330 min past the first cell division (the first cleavage) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>C(l) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>D(a)). ABplaapppa, ABpraapppa, and ABplaapppp, three ventral hypodermal cells, engulf C1, C2, and C3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>C(f) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>D(a)), during their extension to the ventral midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. In addition, all green fluorescent protein (GFP) or monomeric red fluorescence protein (mRFP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b021">21</xref>] tagged reporters were expressed specifically in engulfing cells under the control of P<italic><sub>ced-1</sub></italic>, the <italic>ced-1</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b015">15</xref>].</p>
        <p>The FYVE domain of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> EEA-1, in a tandem repeat, specifically associates with PI(3)P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b022">22</xref>]. The FYVE-FYVE::mRFP1 reporter was detected primarily in cytoplasm as bright puncta, consistent with its endosomal localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. The 2xFYVE markers were also evenly distributed in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>D(d)). In engulfing cells, we observed bright mRFP1 circles surrounding cell corpses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>D).

In embryos that coexpressed P<italic><sub>ced-1</sub> ced-1::gfp</italic> and P<italic><sub>ced-1</sub> 2xFYVE::mrfp1</italic>, CED-1::GFP, but not 2xFYVE::mRFP1, was enriched on extending pseudopods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Strikingly, bright mRFP1 circles appeared on phagosomal surfaces within 4.1 ± 1.0 min (<italic>n</italic> = 16) after the closure of pseudopods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>C(d), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>C(j), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>E), indicating that PI(3)P is specifically presented on the surface of nascent phagosomes. Whereas the CED-1::GFP signal rapidly disappeared from phagosomal surface after the enclosure of the phagocytic cup (within 8.4 ± 2.0 min, <italic>n</italic> = 17) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>E), PI(3)P remained on a phagosome until its content was completely degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>E). PI(3)P thus labels the surface of phagosomes for almost their entire duration.</p>
        <p><italic>C. elegans rab-7</italic> encodes RAB-7, a likely ortholog of human Rab7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-se001">Text S1</xref>). In wild-type animals expressing P<italic><sub>ced-1</sub> gfp::rab-7</italic>, a functional GFP::RAB-7 was detected in the cytoplasm, and a portion of it is enriched on cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg001">Figures S1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg003">S3</xref>D). This punctate localization pattern is consistent with previous reports indicating that RAB-7 is localized to late endosomes and lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b025">25</xref>]. In both embryos and adult hermaphrodite gonads, we observed robust GFP::RAB-7 signals around cell corpses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg001">Figure S1</xref>C). Quantitative measurements of time-lapse images (Materials and Methods) indicated that the intensity of the GFP signal on phagosomal surfaces could reach as high as 2.5 times that in the cytosol of the same engulfing cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>D(o)). In a time-lapse recording of embryos that coexpress GFP::RAB-7 and 2xFYVE::mRFP1, RAB-7 was recruited to the surface of a phagosome approximately 3 min after PI(3)P appeared on the same phagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>E). After the completion of engulfment, yet prior to the recruitment of RAB-7, a nascent phagosome appeared as a dark hole surrounded by evenly distributed GFP::RAB-7 in the engulfing cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>D(h) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>D(i)). Like 2xFYVE::mRFP1, GFP::RAB-7 persisted on the surface of a phagosome until the phagosome disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">1</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sv001">Video S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine whether the enrichment of RAB-7 and PI(3)P was restricted to phagosomes containing C1, C2, and C3, we examined wild-type 1.5-fold to 2-fold stage embryos, which were at 420–460 min after first cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. We found that 91% and 73% of cell corpses distinguished under DIC optics are labeled with GFP::RAB-7 and 2xFYVE::GFP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g002">Figures 2</xref>C). These results indicate that both PI(3)P and RAB-7 are enriched on the surface of all phagosomes, and suggest that they may play important roles during phagosome maturation.</p>

During embryogenesis, 113 cells undergo apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b012">12</xref>].

        <title><italic>rab-7</italic> Mutant Animals Are Defective in the Removal of Cell Corpses, Not the Execution of Programmed Cell Death</title>
        <p>Accumulation of cell corpses may be caused by excessive apoptosis or defects in the removal of cell corpses. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we monitored the generation and duration of germ-cell corpses induced by γ-ray irradiation in <italic>rab-7</italic> (m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) adults (Materials and Methods). We chose a 2-h recording period starting at 3 h after irradiation, since in the wild-type germline, the number of cell corpses reaches its peak 4 h after irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b028">28</xref>]. Within this period, we observed similar numbers of germ cells undergoing apoptosis in wild-type and <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> animals (average ten and nine apoptotic cells, respectively). This result suggests that <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> mutants are no more susceptible to apoptosis stimuli than wild-type animals. On the other hand, we observed that in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants, all germ-cell corpses analyzed persisted for a significantly longer period of time than those in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), indicating that <italic>rab-7</italic> mutant gonads are defective in the prompt removal of germ-cell corpses.</p>

        <title>Loss of <italic>rab-7</italic> Function Results in Specific Defects in the Degradation of Engulfed Cell Corpses</title>
        <p>To further distinguish whether the persistent germ-cell corpses observed in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants are results of defects in engulfment or degradation, we analyzed germ-cell corpses and their surroundings using TEM (Materials and Methods). Apoptotic germ cells cellularize from the germline syncytium and are quickly engulfed by gonadal sheath cells, a single layer of somatic cells that wrap around germline syncytium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b027">27</xref>]. We analyzed serial sections that span the entire diameter of each cell corpse to determine whether a cell corpse is totally inside a sheath cell. In <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> mutants, all germ-cell corpses observed in three different gonad arms were engulfed by gonadal sheath cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). The accumulation of engulfed germ-cell corpses suggests that the degradation, and not the engulfment, of cell corpses is blocked. In addition, in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants, 90% of excessive germ-cell corpses are labeled with 2xFYVE::GFP from engulfing cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g002">2</xref>C), again indicating that they persist inside phagosomes.</p>
        <p>Under TEM, in 59% of corpses in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants, the nuclear envelope and plasma membrane were readily distinguishable, and the nucleolus appeared as a distinct patch with high electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g003">Figure 3</xref>F(c) and 3F(e)). These well-preserved cellular characteristics suggest a defect in the initiation of cell-corpse degradation. In the rest of cell corpses, the electron density of osmium tetroxide–stained sections was greatly enhanced, and it was impossible to distinguish nucleoli or any intracellular membranous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g003">Figure 3</xref>F(e) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g003">3</xref>F(g)), suggesting that a certain degree of phagosome maturation had occurred.</p>
        <p>In 1.5- and 2-fold stage <italic>rab-7</italic> (m<sup>−</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) embryos, 78% of cell corpses are labeled with the PI(3)P marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g002">2</xref>C), indicating that they are inside phagosomes. Thus, somatic cell corpses in <italic>rab-7</italic> embryos, like germ-cell corpses, appear to be engulfed efficiently yet remain undegraded inside engulfing cells. We refer to the accumulation of engulfed cell corpses as a cell-corpse degradation defective (Ded) phenotype.</p>

        <title>The <italic>rab-7</italic> (m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) Adults Are Relatively Normal in Endocytosis and Lysosomal Functions</title>
        <p>To examine whether the defects in the degradation of germ-cell corpses are an indirect consequence of defects in endocytosis, lysosome biogenesis and function, and/or other vesicle transport events that might be affected by the loss of <italic>rab-7</italic> function, we analyzed a number of relevant aspects in <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> (m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) adult hermaphrodites, which display a strong Ded phenotype, but develop normally and appear normal in general morphology (see above). To examine possible defects in exocytosis and endocytosis, we first characterized the delivery of yolk to oocytes. In adults, yolk, a lipoprotein complex, is secreted from intestinal cells and transported to the gonad where it is internalized by oocytes through receptor-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b029">29</xref>]. By monitoring YP170 (a yolk component)::GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b029">29</xref>], we observed that just as in wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>], 100% of fertilized embryos inside <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> (m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) adult hermaphrodite gonads contain internalized YP170::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

        <p>To detect lysosomes in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants, we developed a specific fluorescent lysosomal marker, CTNS-1, tagged with GFP or mRFP1 at its C-terminus. CTNS-1 is the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> homolog of human lysosomal cystine transporter cystinosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b031">31</xref>]. CTNS-1 colocalized to cytoplasmic puncta with RAB-7 and LMP-1, two proteins reported to localize to lysosomes, indicating that CTNS-1 was primarily localized to lysosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-se001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>We compared the number and morphology of CTNS-1::GFP(+) particles in several tissues in wild-type and <italic>rab-7</italic> (m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) adult hermaphrodites and did not observe any obvious difference between these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Recently, it was reported that in <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> (m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) adult hermaphrodites, the acidification of lysosomal compartments in coelomocytes, special scavenger cells that are highly active in endocytosis, was normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b032">32</xref>]. These lines of evidence suggest that the biogenesis and functions of lysosomes in <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> (m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) adult animals are relatively normal, probably owing to the residual wild-type maternal gene activity. By contrast, in <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> (m<sup>−</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) embryos that lack both maternal and zygotic gene activity, we detected severe defects in lysosomal functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-se001">Text S1</xref>).

        <p>We observed that in <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> (m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) hermaphrodites, coelomocyte vacuoles, which represent endocytic compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b033">33</xref>], appeared the same size as in wild type, although they accumulated in a larger number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). This is in sharp contrast to the phenotypes observed in typical lysosome biogenesis mutants, such as <italic>cup-5</italic> or <italic>ppk-3</italic> mutants, on which coelomocyte vacuoles are enlarged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b033">33</xref>].

These results imply that in addition to its function in regulating lysosome biogenesis, RAB-7 mediates an independent function related to phagosome maturation.</p>

During phase I, which started after the formation of nascent phagosomes and lasted approximately 20 min, a weak and punctate CTNS-1::GFP signal was observed on the surface of phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">Figure 6</xref>B(g–i), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">6</xref>C(a–d), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">6</xref>C(o)). During the following phase II, CTNS-1::GFP rapidly accumulated on a phagosome, and gradually evolved from multiple punctate spots to a smooth, continuous circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">Figure 6</xref>B(i–l) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">6</xref>C(d–g)). Following the rapid enrichment of CTNS::GFP signal, the volume of a phagosome quickly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">6</xref>C(o), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">6</xref>C(p)), indicating degradation of phagosomal contents.

The accumulation of the CTNS-1::GFP signal is indicative of the recruitment of lysosomes to phagosomal surfaces, whereas the subsequent transition from punctate to continuous circles may represent the fusion of lysosomes to phagosomal membranes. The recruitment of RAB-7 to phagosomes took place earlier than the phase II CTNS-1 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figures 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">6</xref>B), with an average interval of 13.4 ± 5.8 min (<italic>n</italic> = 9).</p>

        <p>We further monitored individual CTNS-1::GFP(+) puncta over time and observed that in wild-type embryos, the CTNS-1(+) puncta were delivered to the surfaces of phagosomes through either direct encounters with phagosomes or attachment to membrane tubules originating from phagosomes. Tubules extending from phagosomal surfaces were frequently observed; these tubules were labeled with RAB-7 and CTNS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">Figures 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g007">7</xref>A), but not with PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).

The lack of extended tubules presumably leads to the decreased targeting of lysosomes to phagosomes, which subsequently results in insufficient delivery of lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, on the surface of 43% of phagosomes that we monitored in <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> embryos, no CTNS-1(+) particles were ever observed to be attached during the entire 100-min observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sv004">Video S4</xref>).

        <p>We monitored the engulfment of cell corpses C3 in <italic>ced-1(e1735)</italic>, <italic>dyn-1(n4039)</italic>, and <italic>ced-5(n1812)</italic> null mutant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b040">40</xref>] that express P<italic><sub>ced-1</sub> gfp::rab-7</italic>. We demonstrated that these three mutants displayed distinct and severe defects in the initiation and/or the extension of pseudopods around cell corpses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg004">S4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-se001">Text S1</xref>), consistent with the well-characterized functions of these proteins in initiation of engulfment. Interestingly, in only 19%–25% of single-mutant embryos, C3 remained unengulfed for longer than 100 min; in the other embryos, C3 were eventually engulfed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg004">Figure S4</xref>E). In addition, in 1.5-fold stage <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>ced-5</italic> mutant embryos, approximately 20%–30% of DIC(+) cell corpses appeared as either dark holes or GFP-labeled phagosomes inside engulfing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg004">Figure S4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg004">S4</xref>G), indicating that these cell corpses were engulfed, but not yet degraded.</p>
        <p>The partial defects in engulfment allowed us to monitor the degradation of those cell corpses that were engulfed in <italic>ced-1</italic>, <italic>dyn-1</italic>, and <italic>ced-5</italic> embryos. In wild-type embryos, the duration of a phagosome, which was the total time period that it existed as a dark hole (nascent phagosome) and then as a GFP::RAB-7(+) circle, was 30–70 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">Figure 8</xref>A(a–e) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">8</xref>B). In <italic>ced-1</italic>, <italic>dyn-1</italic>, and <italic>ced-5</italic> mutants, however, the duration varied within a wider range, with a distinct population of phagosomes that lasted longer than 90–100 min, the time limit of our time-lapse recording due to the vigorous body movement of embryos occurring after reaching approximately 440 min after first cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). The volume of the phagosomes belonging to this population did not reduce throughout the observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">Figure 8</xref>A(v)), indicating a severe defect in the degradation of phagosomal content. This defect is further confirmed using CED-1C (the intracellular domain of CED-1)::GFP, another reporter that is evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of engulfing cells and allows the recognition of phagosomes as GFP(−) holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">Figures 8</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg005">S5</xref>). The above observations confirm the defects of <italic>dyn-1</italic> mutants in phagosome maturation, which was observed before using different assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>], and further reveal novel functions for <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>ced-5</italic> in the degradation of apoptotic cells, a step downstream of engulfment.</p>

        <title><italic>ced-1</italic>, <italic>dyn-1</italic>, and <italic>ced-5</italic> Mutants Are Defective in the Recruitment of Lysosomes to Phagosomes</title>
        <p>Since the formation of phagolysosomes is an essential step in the digestion of phagosomal contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we first analyzed the incorporation of lysosomes to maturing phagosomes containing C1, C2, and C3 in <italic>ced-1</italic>, <italic>dyn-1</italic>, and <italic>ced-5</italic> embryos by monitoring CTNS-1::GFP. We observed that although the initial localization of weak CTNS-1::GFP(+) signal on phagosomal surfaces in phase I was relatively normal; the enrichment of CTNS-1::GFP signal expected for phase II was delayed or absent on the majority of phagosomes in all three mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g009">Figure 9</xref>). In many cases, the weak CTNS-1::GFP signal on phagosomal surfaces was unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g009">Figure 9</xref>A). The defects of lysosomes incorporation in <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>dyn-1</italic> mutant embryos are more severe than that in <italic>ced-5</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g009">Figure 9</xref>D(a)), correlating with the levels of degradation defects displayed by the corresponding mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Although the recruitment of CTNS-1(+) particles was severely delayed, once recruitment was complete, in most cases, the corresponding phagosome would disappear within 50 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g009">Figure 9</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g009">9</xref>D(b)). For instance, we observed different fates of two phagosomes in one <italic>dyn-1(n4039)</italic> embryo: the weak, initial CTNS-1 signal labeling the phagosome containing C3 failed to increase over time, and C3 remained undegraded after 65 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g009">Figure 9</xref>A), whereas the phagosome containing C1 was eventually degraded after a delayed enrichment of CTNS-1 signal (at 31 min) on its surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). These results suggest that the inefficient incorporation of lysosomes into phagosomes is one of the major causes for the cell-corpse degradation defects observed in <italic>ced-1</italic>, <italic>dyn-1</italic>, and <italic>ced-5</italic> mutants.</p>

        <title>The Accumulation of RAB-7 on the Surface of Phagosomes Is Delayed or Blocked in <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>dyn-1</italic>, but Not <italic>ced-5</italic>, Mutants</title>
        <p>Since RAB-7 activity is essential for the incorporation of lysosomes to phagosomes, we monitored the dynamic association of RAB-7 with phagosomes in <italic>ced-1</italic>, <italic>dyn-1</italic>, and <italic>ced-5</italic> mutants. In both wild-type and <italic>ced-5</italic> embryos, greater than 70% of phagosomes are labeled with a GFP::RAB-7 circle within 10 min after the completion of engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">Figure 8</xref>D). By contrast, in <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>dyn-1</italic> embryos, the recruitment of RAB-7 to phagosomal surfaces is delayed or blocked. The majority of phagosomes in <italic>ced-1</italic> (82%) and <italic>dyn-1</italic> (79%) mutants remained RAB-7(−) (detected as dark holes) for greater than 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">Figure 8</xref>A(f–t) and 8D, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sv005">Videos S5</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sv007">S7</xref>). In particular, 35% and 17% of phagosomes in <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>dyn-1</italic> mutant embryos, respectively, remained RAB-7(−) for greater than 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">Figure 8</xref>A(k–t) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">8</xref>D); all 11 such phagosomes failed to reduce in size throughout the recording period (for instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g008">Figure 8</xref>A(p–t)). These phenotypes indicate that (1) the recruitment of RAB-7 to phagosomal surfaces is essential for phagosome maturation, and (2) the recruitment is inefficient in <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>dyn-1</italic> mutants but relatively normal in <italic>ced-5</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>We examined the localization of RAB-7(Q68L) in <italic>ced-1(e1735)</italic> mutant embryos and found that the recruitment of RAB-7(Q68L) to phagosome surface is also delayed. However, the defect is less severe: whereas greater than 30% of phagosomes took more than 60 min to recruit RAB-7 after engulfment completes, all phagosomes recruit RAB-7(Q68L) within 50 min, with the majority within 30 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).

        <title><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> as a Genetic System for Studying the Mechanisms Controlling the Degradation of Apoptotic Cells</title>
        <p>Previously, due to the lack of cellular markers, whether a cell corpse was engulfed could not be easily distinguishable in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> embryos. We have developed a series of live-cell imaging–based assays and have provided the first real-time observation of the entire cell-corpse removal process in the context of a developing embryo. Using these assays, we also established the temporal sequence of multiple phagosome maturation events. These in vivo assays have revealed that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> RAB-7 plays essential roles in the formation of phagolysosomes. Our study indicates that the degradation of apoptotic cells in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> shares certain mechanistic features with that of opsonized foreign objects in mammalian macrophages.</p>
        <p>Unlike TEM, which only detects the terminal phenotypes, the time-lapse recording system allows us to observe previously unknown defects in the dynamic process of phagosome maturation. We thus identified distinct roles of four <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteins, CED-1, CED-6, DYN-1, and CED-5, in the degradation of engulfed apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g011">Figure 11</xref>). CED-1, CED-6, and CED-5 were only known for their functions in engulfment (see Introduction). Whether the mammalian homologs of these proteins are similarly involved in the maturation of phagosomes remains to be examined. Our findings suggest that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> is a powerful model system for identifying additional genes and new mechanisms regulating phagosome maturation.</p>

        <p>Mammalian macrophages elicit pro- or anti-inflammatory responses after engulfing pathogens, which are considered “foreign,” or apoptotic cells, which are considered “self,” respectively (see Introduction). The mechanisms behind these distinct responses remain largely unknown, and phagosomal surfaces are possible sites where these immune responses could be initiated. By studying the removal of apoptotic cells in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>, we may find clues to those unknown mechanisms. For example, we observed that PI(3)P was enriched on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> nascent phagosomes and persisted there until the complete digestion of phagosomal content. On the contrary, PI(3)P was reported to be transiently present on the surface of mammalian phagosomes containing opsonized objects, disappearing well before the completion of phagosome maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b020">20</xref>]. These observations may reflect differences in the maturation of phagosomes with different contents.</p>

        <title>The Specific and Direct Functions of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> RAB-7 for the Degradation of Apoptotic Cells</title>
        <p><italic>C. elegans rab-7</italic> was implicated in controlling cell survival based on the observation that <italic>rab-7</italic> (RNA interference [RNAi]) resulted in excessive germ-cell corpses in the adult hermaphrodite gonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b042">42</xref>]. Here, we report multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that the excessive germ-cell corpses observed in <italic>rab-7</italic> null mutants are unlikely caused by excessive cell death; rather, they are the result of defects in the degradation of engulfed apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Mammalian Rab7 is involved in endocytic pathway and lysosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b045">45</xref>]. Consistently, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> RAB-7 is essential for endosomal trafficking and yolk consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g011">Figure 11</xref>C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b032">32</xref>]. Our research provides several lines of evidence to suggest that the Ded phenotype of <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants is not merely a secondary consequence of the defects in the aforementioned functions, rather, RAB-7 plays a direct and independent role in phagosome maturation by acting on the surface of phagosomes. In adult <italic>rab-7</italic> (m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>−</sup>) mutant hermaphrodites, whereas intracellular trafficking and lysosome biogenesis are relatively normal due to the activity of <italic>rab-7</italic> maternal product, the degradation of engulfed cell corpses is severely impaired. In addition, mutations in <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>dyn-1</italic> cause strong and correlated defects in the recruitment of RAB-7 to phagosomal surfaces and in the formation of phagolysosomes, further supporting an independent role of RAB-7 on phagosomal surfaces.</p>
        <p>Studies of the mammalian phagosomes containing infectious bacteria indicate that the functions and regulation of host-cell Rab7 during phagosome maturation are complex and diverse, and depend on the ingested bacteria species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b048">48</xref>]. We found that regarding the degradation of apoptotic cells, which are distinct from latex beads, which are not degradable, and from infectious bacteria, which are foreign objects, RAB-7 displays both conserved and unique features. Mammalian Rab7 and its effector RILP were implicated in the extension of tubular structures from phagosomal surfaces, which attract late endosomes and lysosomes to phagosomes containing latex beads, based on the effects of the overexpressed dominant-negative forms of Rab7 and RILP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b008">8</xref>]. We observed a similar extension of tubular structures from phagosomes and the recruitment of CTNS-1(+) lysosomal particles along those tubules in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, by analyzing <italic>rab-7</italic> null mutant embryos, we discovered that one of the functions of endogenous RAB-7 is to promote the extension of these tubules and the recruitment of lysosomes to phagosomes. We have also identified another function of RAB-7 in promoting the fusion of lysosomes to phagosomal surfaces. This fusion activity is consistent with the reported activity of Ypt7, the yeast counterpart of Rab7, in promoting the physical contact of vacuoles during homotypic vacuole fusion (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b049">49</xref>]), and indicates that RAB-7 is capable of mediating the fusion of organelles of different origins. In addition, dominant-negative Rab7 inhibits acidification of mammalian phagosomes that contain latex beads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b008">8</xref>]. In contrast, we found that the null mutation of <italic>rab-7</italic> did not significantly affect the acidification of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg008">Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-se001">Text S1</xref>). Phagosomes containing apoptotic cells thus provide a new experimental system for further studying the mechanisms behind the functions and regulation of Rab7.</p>

        <title>How Is RAB-7 Recruited to the Phagosomal Surface—A Novel Signaling Pathway That Initiates the Formation of Phagolysosomes</title>
        <p>In engulfing cells, RAB-7 exists in the cytoplasm both in a diffused form and in association with intracellular organelles, in particular lysosomes. The initial phagosomal appearance of RAB-7 occurs prior to the phagosomal acquirement of lysosomes, suggesting that free, cytosolic RAB-7 molecules are likely the primary source for phagosome-associated RAB-7. The GTP-bound form of RAB-7 is the active form recruited to and stably associated with phagosome, perhaps through a particular protein or protein complex that that mediates this association.</p>
        <p>We have identified the novel functions of at least two genes, <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>dyn-1</italic>, for the timely recruitment of RAB-7 to phagosomes. This finding, together with the finding that RAB-7 is essential for the recruitment and fusion of lysosomes into phagosomes, indicate that the CED-1 pathway controls phagolysosome formation through regulating RAB-7 recruitment and function. Previously, we have reported that the phagocytic receptor CED-1 acts upstream of DYN-1 in the signaling pathway for engulfment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. We have also established that the transient localization of DYN-1 on the surface of phagocytic cups and phagosomes are both dependent on CED-1 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. Thus we propose that CED-1 acts upstream of DYN-1 to control RAB-7 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g011">Figure 11</xref>B).</p>
        <p>The molecular mechanism for the recruitment of RAB-7 remains to be investigated. The observation that the recruitment of a GTP-bound, constitutively active form of RAB-7 to phagosomal surface was less affected than that of RAB-7 by the <italic>ced-1</italic> null mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060061-sg006">Figure S6</xref>) may indicate that the CED-1 pathway may induce the formation of GTP-RAB-7 around phagosomal surfaces and the subsequent RAB-7/phagosome association. Alternatively, the CED-1 pathway may act in a more indirect manner, by recruiting or activating early signaling molecules that will further recruit RAB-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g011">Figure 11</xref>A). We observed that PI(3)P was dramatically enriched on phagosomal surfaces prior to RAB-7. Furthermore, in <italic>dyn-1</italic>, <italic>ced-6</italic>, and <italic>ced-1</italic> mutants, the enrichment of PI(3)P on phagosomal surfaces was delayed. These observations suggest that PI(3)P might be related to the recruitment of RAB-7.</p>

        <title>The CED-1 Pathway Controls Multiple Important Events for Phagosome Maturation</title>
        <p>The enrichment of RAB-7 on phagosomes is not the only phagosome maturation event regulated by the CED-1 signaling pathway. For instance, the recruitment of early endosomes to phagosomes, which is independent of RAB-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g002">Figure 2</xref>), is dependent on CED-1, CED-6, and DYN-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>]. In addition, we observed that the rate of enrichment of PI(3)P on phagosomal surfaces is under the control of <italic>ced-1</italic>, <italic>ced-6</italic>, and <italic>dyn-1</italic>. PI(3)P attracts FYVE or PX domain–containing effectors, some of which play diverse roles during phagosome maturation, to phagosomal surfaces (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b050">50</xref>]). CED-1::GFP was observed to transiently cluster on nascent phagosomal surfaces for merely 9 min, in a time period that barely overlaps with that of PI(3)P and RAB-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). However, DYN-1 remains on phagosomal surfaces for a longer period (18 min). CED-1 thus may establish an active state of phagosomal surfaces through the activation of DYN-1. The rapid accumulation of PI(3)P on the surfaces of nascent phagosomes is likely to reflect the local activation of a Class III PI(3) kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b020">20</xref>], whose activity and/or localization on phagosomal surfaces may be controlled by the CED-1 pathway.</p>
        <p>We thus propose that CED-1, CED-6, and DYN-1 act in a signaling pathway to control both the engulfment and the degradation of engulfed apoptotic cells, through regulating different downstream effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g011">Figure 11</xref>B). On nascent phagosomes, or perhaps even before the phagocytic cup is enclosed, this pathway may actively prime the phagosomal membrane for the reception of multiple signaling molecules and sequential incorporation of intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g011">Figure 11</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Although extensive studies suggest that nascent phagosomes possess multiple signaling molecules on their surfaces, the identity of the ultimate initial signal that triggers phagosome maturation remains unclear. An activated phagocytic receptor may well be the source of this signal. When in complex with extracellular ligands, phagocytic receptors were known to undergo certain conformational changes that lead to the activation of their intracellular domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b051">51</xref>], which in turn may act on the cytoplasmic side of phagocytic cups and phagosomes to recruit cytosolic factors. Our report that CED-1 initiates phagosomal maturation through activating downstream effectors suggests that phagocytic receptors for apoptotic cells in different organisms, including mEGF10, the human CED-1 homolog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b052">52</xref>], and perhaps even phagocytic receptors for foreign pathogens, may act to regulate the downstream phagosome maturation events. Furthermore, by activating different phagocytic receptors, phagocytic targets that are “self” or “foreign” might thus initiate differential phagosome maturation processes.</p>

        <title>CED-5 Controls Phagosome Maturation through a Distinct Pathway</title>
        <p><italic>ced-5</italic> null mutants are defective in the recruitment of lysosomes to phagosomes. However, unlike <italic>ced-1</italic> or <italic>dyn-1</italic> mutations, null mutation in <italic>ced-5</italic> does not seem to affect the recruitment of RAB-7 on phagosomal surfaces, nor does it cause any severe defect in the presentation of PI(3)P on phagosomal surfaces. These results imply that CED-5 acts in a distinct pathway to control phagolysosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g011">Figure 11</xref>B), just like in engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). During engulfment, the pathway led by CED-5 was shown to regulate cytoskeletal reorganization (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b011">11</xref>]). Recently, it was reported that cytoskeletal reorganization also plays an active role in phagosome maturation in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b053">53</xref>]. It would be interesting to know whether CED-5 and other members of its pathway contribute to phagosome maturation through remodeling the cytoskeleton.</p>

          <p>DIC images were recorded starting at the first cleavage. The first image of this movie is at 400 min after first cleavage. The interval between two consecutive frames is 2 min. Anterior is to the left. Judging by morphology at 400 min after first cleavage, the embryonic development before that stage was delayed. The movie also shows that this embryo failed to continue elongation after reaching 2-fold of body length. In addition, hypodermal cells failed to fully enclose at the head region and as a result, the head tissue leaked out of the soma.</p>
