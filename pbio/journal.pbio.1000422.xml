<p>Cell transformation arises from the activation of oncoproteins and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins. During the initial stage of carcinogenesis, transformation occurs in a single epithelial cell that grows within an epithelial monolayer. However, it remains unclear what happens at the interface between normal and transformed epithelial cells during this process. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it has been shown that normal and transformed cells often compete with each other for survival in an epithelial tissue, in a process called “cell competition.” Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) is a tumor suppressor protein in flies and mammals. Using biochemical methods, we identified Mahjong as a novel binding partner of Lgl in flies and mammals. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Mahjong is involved in cell competition in both flies and mammals. In particular, we found that canine kidney epithelial cells depleted for Mahjong undergo apoptosis, but only when surrounded by non-transformed cells. This represents the first evidence that cell competition can occur in a mammalian cell culture system. Although it is not clear at present what molecules/signaling pathways are regulated by Lgl/Mahjong during cell competition, future studies might reveal important pathway components that could be targeted therapeutically to prevent tumor cells from “winning” in their race against normal tissue cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell transformation arises from the activation of oncoproteins and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Hanahan1">[1]</xref>. During the initial stage of carcinogenesis, transformation occurs in a single epithelial cell that grows within an epithelial monolayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Nowell1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Fialkow1">[3]</xref>. However, it remains unclear what happens at the interface between normal and transformed epithelial cells during this process. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it has been recently reported that normal and transformed cells compete with each other for survival in a monolayer of epithelial cells, in a process called “cell competition” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Johnston1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Moreno1">[5]</xref>. For example, when dMyc-overexpressing cells are surrounded by wild-type cells in an epithelial cell sheet, the surrounding wild-type cells die by apoptosis, and the dMyc-overexpressing cells proliferate to fill the vacated space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-delaCova1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Moreno2">[7]</xref>. In contrast, when <italic>scribble</italic> mutant cells are surrounded by wild-type cells, <italic>scribble</italic> mutant cells undergo apoptosis and are eliminated from the wild-type epithelial monolayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Brumby1">[8]</xref>. In most of the previous reports of cell competition, slowly proliferating cells undergo apoptosis when they are surrounded by fast proliferating cells. However, activation of cyclin D/Cdk4 or the Insulin/Insulin-like growth factor receptor pathway does not cause cell competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-delaCova1">[6]</xref>, suggesting that a difference in cell growth speed alone does not always trigger cell competition. Molecular mechanisms whereby “loser cells” undergo apoptosis therefore remain largely unknown. Furthermore, it is not known whether comparable phenomena are also observed in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) was originally identified as a tumor suppressor protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Mechler1">[9]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs, mutation of <italic>lgl</italic> causes loss of apicobasal polarity and uncontrolled proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Mechler1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Bilder1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Agrawal1">[11]</xref>, leading to neoplastic tumor formation. In mice, knockout of Lgl1, a mammalian homologue of Lgl, was reported to result in severe brain dysplasia characterized by hyperproliferation and loss of cell polarity of neuroepithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Klezovitch1">[12]</xref>. These data indicate that Lgl plays an important role in cell polarity and cell proliferation. Involvement of Lgl in cell competition was also recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Grzeschik1">[13]</xref>; in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye discs bearing <italic>lgl</italic> mutant clones (<italic>lgl</italic><sup>−</sup>) in a mosaic manner, some <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−</sup> and wild-type cells at the clone boundary undergo apoptosis and are excluded from the epithelia.</p>
<p>Lgl has the characteristics of a molecular scaffold, with WD protein-protein interaction motifs and no known enzymatic activity. Its functional roles are therefore likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. Lgl binds to atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and Par6, and this interaction has been shown to regulate the function of Lgl in cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Yamanaka1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Plant1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Betschinger1">[16]</xref>. However, Lgl-binding partners that are involved in Lgl-mediated cell competition have not yet been identified. In this study, we have identified viral protein R-binding protein (VprBP)/Mahjong as a novel Lgl-binding protein and have demonstrated that Lgl and VprBP/Mahjong are involved in cell competition.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<p>To identify novel interacting proteins of mammalian Lgl (mLgl), we performed immunoprecipitation using MCF-7 epithelial cells stably expressing GFP-tagged mLgl2. We found two proteins (arrowhead and asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) that were coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-mLgl2 (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody suggested that one of the two proteins was a cleavage product of GFP-mLgl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; asterisk). Mass spectrometric analysis identified the other protein, which was 180 kD in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; arrowhead), as VprBP. VprBP was originally identified as interacting with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral protein R (Vpr) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Zhang1">[17]</xref>. VprBP interacts with the Cullin4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex and regulates a Vpr-mediated induction of G2 arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-LeRouzic1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Wen1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Tan1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Belzile1">[21]</xref>, but the endogenous function of VprBP is not clearly understood. By Western blotting with anti-VprBP antibody, we confirmed the coimmunoprecipitation of VprBP with GFP-mLgl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We also detected an interaction between endogenous VprBP and mLgl2 proteins in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-VprBP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). VprBP contains a centrally located Lis1 homology motif (LisH) as well as WD40-like domains in the C-terminal half (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The LisH motif is proposed to play a role in protein dimerization or microtubule dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Emes1">[22]</xref>, whereas WD40-like domains are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Smith1">[23]</xref>. Using truncated mutants, we showed that the C-terminus of mLgl2 (amino acids 544–1027) and the C-terminus of VprBP (amino acids 614–1058) are responsible for the interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s001">Figure S1B and S1C</xref>).</p>

<p>The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome encodes a protein (CG10080) with high amino acid sequence identity (38%) with human VprBP. The CG10080 protein also contains LisH and WD40-like domains. We have named this protein Mahjong, the name of a table game in which winners and losers are determined through strong competition. First, we showed that Mahjong interacts with Lgl when the two proteins are coexpressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). Next, to isolate mutant alleles of <italic>mahjong</italic> (<italic>mahj</italic>), we induced imprecise excision of a P-element that was inserted in the region adjacent to the <italic>Drosophila mahj</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). By examining the genomic sequence in these excision mutants, we confirmed that one mutant had a deletion in the <italic>Drosophila mahj</italic>-coding region. The mutant lost exons 10 and 11, part of exon 9, and the 3′-UTR of the <italic>mahj</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). The homozygous mutant animals developed more slowly than wild-type flies and died at a late pupal stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). The mutation failed to complement <italic>Df(2R)XE-2900</italic>, a chromosomal deficiency in which the entire coding region of <italic>mahj</italic> is deleted, and larvae trans-heterozygous for the mutation and <italic>Df(2R)XE-2900</italic> exhibited the same retarded development phenotype as did the homozygous excision mutant. Expression of exogenous Mahj protein alleviated both the growth defect and lethality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). These results indicate that the phenotype of the <italic>mahj</italic> excision mutant is indeed caused by a loss-of-function of <italic>mahj</italic>. The homozygous mutant larvae did not, however, have any detectable morphological defects (unpublished data). In their imaginal discs, compartmentalization pattern was properly maintained as observed with the antibody staining for Ci155 (full-length Cubitus interruptus) and Engrailed, which confer anterior and posterior compartmental identities, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of wing discs with antibodies against DE-Cadherin and Discs large (Dlg) revealed no obvious cell polarity defect in the epithelium of the <italic>mahj</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Compared with wild-type or homozygous mutants, apoptosis was not altered in homozygous mutant wing discs (unpublished data).</p>

<p>To explore the function of Mahjong, we used the mitotic recombination technique with the flipase (FLP)–flipase recombination target (FRT) system to generate mosaic tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figure S2E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Xu1">[24]</xref>. Using this approach, the same numbers of <italic>mahj</italic> homozygous mutant (<italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) and sibling wild-type cells were initially produced. In the mosaic wing discs, 72 h after clone induction, both <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and sibling wild-type clones were readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, at 96 h, the size of the <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones was clearly smaller than that of sibling wild-type clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), and at 120 h, most of the <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones had disappeared from the wing disc epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Immunofluorescence with anti-active Caspase 3 antibody revealed that <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones adjacent to wild-type or <italic>mahj<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> cells frequently underwent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g002">Figure 2E–G</xref>), whereas <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones that were not adjacent to wild-type or <italic>mahj<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> cells rarely did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). These observations suggest that the abutting or near-by wild-type or <italic>mahj<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> cells trigger the <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells to undergo apoptosis. Although the majority of apoptotic cells were basally extruded from the disc epithelium, we found some apoptotic <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells remaining within the epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figures S2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s007">S7B</xref>, arrows), suggesting that apoptosis was not caused by extrusion.</p>
<p>This type of competition between wild-type and mutant cells was first reported in <italic>Minute</italic> mutant flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Morata1">[25]</xref>. <italic>Minute</italic> is a generic name given to genes encoding ribosomal proteins or other protein-synthesis components. Heterozygous <italic>Minute</italic> flies are viable but develop slowly, though their final body size is similar to that of wild-type flies. When surrounded by wild-type cells, however, <italic>Minute</italic> heterozygous mutant cells (<italic>M/+</italic>) undergo apoptosis and are eliminated from the epithelial monolayer. A similar competition for cell survival, termed cell competition, has also been reported between wild-type and other types of mutant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-delaCova1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Moreno2">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Brumby1">[8]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells did not undergo apoptosis when they were surrounded by <italic>M/+</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figure S2G</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones are eliminated from the wild-type disc epithelium through the process of cell competition.</p>
<p>To examine the functional role of Mahjong/VprBP (hereafter referred to as Mahjong) in mammalian cells, we established MDCK cell lines that stably express Mahjong shRNA in a tetracycline-inducible manner (MDCK pTR Mahjong shRNA). At 48 h after tetracycline addition, 80%–90% of Mahjong was knocked down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). When Mahjong expression was knocked down, cells became slightly flattened but maintained their epithelial morphology and tight cell-cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Knockdown of Mahjong did not affect the expression level of mLgl2 or PKCζ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). When MDCK pTR Mahjong shRNA cells were cultured with tetracycline in a 3D culture system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Bialucha1">[26]</xref>, they formed cysts with a regular lumen and well-defined F-actin-rich apical membrane domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s003">Figure S3D</xref>), and other cell polarity marker proteins, including PKCζ, β-catenin, and ZO-1, were properly localized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s003">Figure S3D and S3E</xref>). These findings are consistent with the fly data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figure S2D</xref>) and confirm that Mahjong does not play a crucial role in the establishment or maintenance of epithelial cell polarity.</p>
<p>Next, we tested for involvement of Mahjong in cell competition in this cell culture system. MDCK pTR Mahjong shRNA cells were labeled with green fluorescent dye (CMFDA) and mixed with normal MDCK cells at a ratio of 1∶10. The mixture of cells was then cultured in the absence of tetracycline until the cells formed a monolayer. We then induced the expression of Mahjong shRNA with tetracycline and observed the fate of Mahjong-knockdown cells surrounded by normal cells using time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s012">Vidoes S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s013">S2</xref>). To monitor cell death, we added ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1), which passes through the damaged plasma membrane of dead cells, binds to nucleic acids, and produces a red fluorescence. After 24–52 h of tetracycline addition, ∼45% of Mahjong shRNA cells died and were extruded from the apical surface of the monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g003">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>). Addition of a caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) significantly suppressed both cell death and extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that apical extrusion of Mahjong-knockdown cells resulted from apoptosis. This result is consistent with that from a previous report that apoptotic cells are apically extruded from a monolayer of MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Rosenblatt1">[27]</xref>. Overexpression of exogenous Mahjong protein in Mahjong shRNA cells prevented their apical extrusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s004">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>), suggesting that apoptosis of Mahjong shRNA cells is indeed attributed to Mahjong-knockdown. In the absence of tetracycline, Mahjong shRNA cells did not die and were not extruded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s014">Video S3</xref>). Moreover, fluorescently labeled Mahjong-knockdown cells were not extruded when they were mixed with unlabeled Mahjong-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s005">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting that the apoptosis of Mahjong-knockdown cells depends on the presence of surrounding normal cells. Similarly, fluorescently labeled normal MDCK cells did not undergo apoptosis when surrounded by normal MDCK cells (unpublished data) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Hogan1">[28]</xref>. Taken together, these results indicate that the death of Mahjong-knockdown cells occurs only when they are surrounded by normal cells. As far as we are aware, this is the first evidence showing that cell competition can occur in a mammalian cell culture system.</p>

<p>Mammals harbor two Lgl homologues, mLgl1 and mLgl2. We observed that Mahjong was coimmunoprecipitated with mLgl1 as well as with mLgl2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Because of potential functional redundancy between mLgl1 and mLgl2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Klezovitch1">[12]</xref>, investigating the functional linkage between Lgl and Mahjong in mammalian cells is technically very difficult. We therefore examined wing imaginal discs of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where the function of Lgl has been intensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Mechler1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Bilder1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Grzeschik1">[13]</xref>. First, we used the FLP-FRT system to generate mosaic wing discs bearing <italic>lgl<sup>4</sup></italic> (null mutant allele of <italic>lgl</italic>) homozygous mutant clones. By 96 h after clone induction, a number of <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells abutting wild-type cells had become apoptotic and were basally extruded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), as previously reported for eye discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Grzeschik1">[13]</xref>. Some apoptotic cells stayed in the epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s007">Figure S7C</xref>, arrows), however, suggesting that the apoptosis was not caused by basal extrusion.

<p>We then further analyzed the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis of <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells using the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), which allowed us to express genes of interest in the mutant cells. We first confirmed that apoptosis of <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells occurred in this system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s007">Figure S7B and S7C</xref>), as it did in the FLP-FRT system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g002">Figures 2E, 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g004">4A, and 4B</xref>).

Indeed, we observed that JNK was ectopically activated in both <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g005">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>, arrows, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s007">S7F</xref>). <italic>puckered</italic> (<italic>puc</italic>) is a gene encoding a protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates activated JNK.

<p>In addition to these cell competition phenotypes, we also observed apoptosis-independent basal extrusion of <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells. In the wing disc epithelium, when mutations of <italic>mahj</italic> or <italic>lgl</italic> were induced in a mosaic manner, some basally extruded <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> or <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells were not stained with anti-active Caspase 3 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s007">Figure S7B and S7C</xref>, arrowheads), though the majority of basally extruded cells were stained. Comparable basal extrusion of <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> or <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells was not seen in the epithelium of <italic>mahj</italic> or <italic>lgl</italic> homozygous animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s002">Figure S2D</xref>, and unpublished data), indicating that the apoptosis-independent basal extrusion occurs only when mutant clones are surrounded by wild-type cells. In addition, although overexpression of <italic>puc</italic> or p35 suppressed the apoptosis of <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> or <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g005">Figure 5C–E</xref>), it did not fully block basal extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g005">Figure 5C–F</xref>). These findings indicate that <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> <italic>and lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones can be basally extruded in either an apoptosis-dependent or -independent manner. However, at present it is not clearly understood how the fate of the clones, whether they die or not prior to basal extrusion, is determined.</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated the epistatic relationship between <italic>lgl</italic> and <italic>mahjong</italic>. We generated <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MARCM clones overexpressing Lgl and Mahj, respectively. Overexpression of Lgl did not affect the phenotype of <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones; the cells underwent apoptosis and were basally extruded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of Mahj strongly suppressed both the apoptosis and basal extrusion of <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g006">Figure 6B–D</xref>); the cells remained within the epithelial layer with normal apicobasal polarity. Mahj overexpression allowed survival of <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones to adulthood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s009">Figure S9</xref>). We also found that overexpression of Mahj suppressed the JNK activation in <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000422-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Overexpression of Mahj in wild-type clones did not induce apoptosis nor affect cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000422.s010">Figure S10A–C</xref>). Scribble is another tumor suppressor protein involved in cell competition; <italic>scribble</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells undergo apoptosis when surrounded by wild-type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000422-Brumby1">[8]</xref>.

These data suggest that the effect of Mahj overexpression on apoptosis is specific to <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones.

<p>In this study, we have identified Mahjong as an evolutionarily conserved Lgl-binding protein. We have demonstrated that <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> or <italic>mahj</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells undergo apoptosis when surrounded by wild-type cells and that apoptosis of <italic>lgl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells is alleviated by overexpression of Mahj. Loss of Mahjong function does not induce detectable cell polarity defects, suggesting that Mahjong does not function with Lgl in the establishment of cell polarity. It is plausible that Lgl positively regulates the function of Mahjong affecting molecules or signaling pathways that set the competitiveness of cells. However, at present, it is not clear how Lgl interacts with Mahjong in cell competition and what molecules/signaling pathways are regulated by Lgl/Mahjong. Answers to these questions would increase our understanding of the interactions between normal and transformed cells and might lead to novel cancer therapies.</p>
