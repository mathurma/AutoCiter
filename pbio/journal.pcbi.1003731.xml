<abstract>
<p>Identifying master regulators of biological processes and mapping their downstream gene networks are key challenges in systems biology. We developed a computational method, called iRegulon, to reverse-engineer the transcriptional regulatory network underlying a co-expressed gene set using <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence analysis. iRegulon implements a genome-wide ranking-and-recovery approach to detect enriched transcription factor motifs and their optimal sets of direct targets. We increase the accuracy of network inference by using very large motif collections of up to ten thousand position weight matrices collected from various species, and linking these to candidate human TFs via a <italic>motif2TF</italic> procedure. We validate iRegulon on gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data with increasing levels of noise, and we compare iRegulon with existing motif discovery methods. Next, we use iRegulon on more challenging types of gene lists, including microRNA target sets, protein-protein interaction networks, and genetic perturbation data. In particular, we over-activate p53 in breast cancer cells, followed by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, and could identify an extensive up-regulated network controlled directly by p53. Similarly we map a repressive network with no indication of direct p53 regulation but rather an indirect effect via E2F and NFY. Finally, we generalize our computational framework to include regulatory tracks such as ChIP-seq data and show how motif and track discovery can be combined to map functional regulatory interactions among co-expressed genes. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iregulon.aertslab.org" xlink:type="simple">http://iregulon.aertslab.org</ext-link>.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Gene regulatory networks control developmental, homeostatic, and disease processes by governing precise levels and spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression. Determining their topology can provide mechanistic insight into these processes. Gene regulatory networks consist of interactions between transcription factors and their direct target genes. Each regulatory interaction represents the binding of the transcription factor to a specific DNA binding site near its target gene. Here we present a computational method, called iRegulon, to identify master regulators and direct target genes in a human gene signature, i.e. a set of co-expressed genes. iRegulon relies on the analysis of the regulatory sequences around each gene in the gene set to detect enriched TF motifs or ChIP-seq peaks, using databases of nearly 10.000 TF motifs and 1000 ChIP-seq data sets or “<italic>tracks</italic>”. Next, it associates enriched motifs and tracks with candidate transcription factors and determines the optimal subset of direct target genes. We validate iRegulon on ENCODE data, and use it in combination with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data to map a p53 downstream network with new predicted co-factors and targets. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin, supporting human, mouse, and Drosophila genes, and provides access to hundreds of cancer-related TF-target subnetworks or “<italic>regulons</italic>”.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Precise regulation of gene expression is imperative for all biological processes. Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) bind to their DNA recognition sites within <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and thereby contribute to the control of the transcriptional initiation rate of their target genes through an interplay with other transcription factors, co-factors, chromatin modifiers, and transcription factories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Dunham1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Li1">[3]</xref>. The human genome encodes for about 1800 sequence-specific TFs, each of which regulates hundreds of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Dunham1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Vaquerizas1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Matys1">[5]</xref>. Because TFs play key roles in gene expression, they are often considered the master regulators of cellular processes. Thus, the mapping and characterization of their <italic>regulon</italic> (all the target genes of a TF) can provide crucial insight into the biological processes they control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Luscombe1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Bandyopadhyay1">[7]</xref>. For example, in cancer, ∼40% of the driver mutations affect TFs, and many of the key oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such as p53, MYC, E2F, and NF-κB, are transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Futreal1">[8]</xref>. Identification of the TFs that operate a perturbed gene network, and detecting their target genes, are instrumental steps in uncovering key insights into oncogenic programs, including the discovery of therapeutic targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Riley1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Pahl1">[12]</xref>. For example, although many target genes have been described for the tumor suppressor p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Riley1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Horvath1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Menendez1">[14]</xref>, several aspects of the gene regulatory network (GRN) downstream of p53 remain unknown. For example, it is still unclear whether p53 also directly represses target genes; whether p53 cooperatively regulates target genes with particular co-factors; and whether different target genes are regulated depending on the cancer type, or depending on the context of p53 activation. The situation is obviously worse for less studied TFs for which often none or only few target genes are known.</p>
<p>The targets of a known TF can be identified experimentally with relatively high accuracy through chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Park1">[15]</xref>. However, ChIP-Seq has limitations because it is usually applied to cells in culture rather than to the actual biological sample (e.g., a tumor); and it focuses on a single TF at a time, that has to be chosen <italic>a priori</italic>. When the TF is not known in advance, or when only gene expression profiling can be performed, regulatory relationships can be uncovered by reverse-engineering a gene regulatory network starting from the expression data. One approach to solve this problem is by exploiting the fact that genes that are co-regulated by the same TF commonly share binding sites for this TF. However, detecting these short and variable TF binding sites (TFBS) within large non-coding regions represents a computational challenge when working with human or mouse genomes. Although a lot of progress has been made over the last decade and many motif discovery methods have been developed and refined (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Frith1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Bulyk1">[19]</xref>), motif discovery methods alone are not sufficient to map a gene regulatory network, nor can they be applied to noisy gene sets containing mixtures of targets of multiple TFs. This is true for both motif discovery methods relying on <italic>de novo</italic> detection and those relying on the enrichment of known position weight matrices (PWM). Additionally, many tools have a motif-oriented output, making it difficult to identify the possible upstream TF. A further limiting factor is that many methods are restricted to using human annotated PWMs (e.g. TRANSFAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Wingender1">[20]</xref>, JASPAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-PortalesCasamar1">[21]</xref> or UNIPROBE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Robasky1">[22]</xref>), limiting the number of TFs that can be identified as candidate network regulators based on motif enrichment. Therefore, although <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence analysis has great potential in resolving direct TF-target interactions, it has until today seen limited applications towards gene regulatory network mapping.</p>
<p>Finally, the recent availability of thousands of ChIP-Seq datasets, both from ENCODE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Gerstein1">[23]</xref>, and other resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Yan1">[24]</xref>, yields new opportunities to discover master regulators from co-expressed gene sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Auerbach1">[25]</xref>, while at the same time pose challenges on how to integrate these data with motif discovery.</p>
<p>Here, we aim to tackle some of these challenges by increasing the performance of motif detection to yield high-confidence results, even in noisy gene sets. Motif detection is followed by the annotation of the discovered motifs with associated TFs and direct targets. To this end, we have collected more than nine thousand PWMs from various sources and from different species and link them to candidate binding TFs using a “motif2TF” procedure. This will allow the user to link hitherto anonymous motifs, and motifs of TFs from other species, to candidate human TFs. Furthermore we developed a user-friendly Cytoscape plugin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Smoot1">[26]</xref>, called iRegulon, allowing the integration of predicted <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory binding sites directly into a biological network. Finally, we extend and generalize this framework towards combined motif and track discovery on a co-expressed gene set, incorporating more than 1000 ChIP-Seq tracks. The iRegulon Cytoscape plugin is available via the Cytoscape App Store <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Saito1">[27]</xref> and can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iregulon.aertslab.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://iregulon.aertslab.org/</ext-link>.</p>

<title>The iRegulon framework</title>
<p>The goal of iRegulon is to enable gene regulatory network mapping directly based on motif enrichment in a co-expressed gene set. As motif discovery method we have chosen to elaborate on the recent <italic>ranking-and-recovery</italic> methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Herrmann1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Roider1">[32]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In the <italic>ranking step</italic> we generate whole-genome rankings of 22284 human RefSeq genes for a library of PWMs where a PWM is a matrix representation of a regulatory motif (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003731-t001">Table 1</xref>). For each gene, a regulatory search space (500 bp, 10 kb or 20 kb around the Transcription Start Site (TSS), see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) is scanned for homotypic cis-regulatory modules (CRM) using a Hidden Markov Model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Frith2">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Starting from a library with <italic>N</italic> PWMs, <italic>N</italic> ranked lists of genes are generated, each with the most likely genomic targets of a particular motif at the top of the ranking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Herrmann1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Aerts2">[29]</xref>. Next, orthologous search spaces in ten other vertebrate genomes are determined by UCSC <italic>liftover</italic> tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Meyer1">[34]</xref> and are subsequently scanned with the same PWMs. The rankings for different species are combined by rank aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Aerts3">[35]</xref> into one final ranking for each PWM in our library. For the PWM libraries we have collected and reformatted most of the available libraries into a “6K collection” (<italic>N</italic> = 6383 PWMs) and a “10K collection” (<italic>N</italic> = 9713 PWMs) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003731-t001">Table 1</xref>). These libraries contain PWMs from different species and also include candidate PWMs for unknown TFs. The results of the ranking step are <italic>N</italic> human gene rankings stored in an SQLite database. We also generated similar databases using mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> as reference species, in case the input gene set is derived from mouse or fruit fly.</p>

<title>Regulon detection by rank-based motif discovery and motif2TF.</title>
<p>Motif enrichment in iRegulon is measured using a <italic>ranking-and-recovery</italic> procedure using a large collection of position weight matrices (PWM). In the <italic>ranking step</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) all human genes are ranked for each motif by scoring for homotypic motif clusters across ten vertebrate species. In the <italic>recovery step</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) each of these gene rankings is tested against the set of input genes by calculating the Area Under the cumulative Recovery Curve (AUC, in pink). The example shown is for the top enriched motif, motif M2. The AUC score is normalized, based on the AUC scores of all motif rankings (distribution is shown as inset), to a normalized enrichment score (NES). A high NES score (≥3.0) indicates a motif that recovers a large proportion of the input genes within the top of its ranking. In parallel, the leading edge of the recovery curve is used to determine the optimal subset of genes that are likely controlled by this motif. In the last step (<bold>C</bold>) Motif2TF associates the candidate motif with (a number of) TFs by finding possible paths from a motif to a TF, in a motif-TF network based on direct evidence, orthology, and motif-motif similarity. The enriched TF can be from the input genes (e.g. TG5 encoding for TF2).

<p>The <italic>recovery step</italic> uses as input any set of co-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The enrichment of these genes is determined in each of the <italic>N</italic> motif-based rankings using the Area Under the cumulative Recovery Curve (AUC), whereby the AUC is computed in the top of the ranking (default set to 3%, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s002">Fig. S2</xref> for validation). The AUC values are normalized into a Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) on which we set a default cutoff of 3.0, corresponding to a False Discovery Rate (FDR) between 3% and 9% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s003">Fig. S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The leading edge of candidate targets is selected as the optimal subset of highly ranked genes compared to the genomic background and compared to the entire motif collection as background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously successfully applied the <italic>ranking-and-recovery</italic> method for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, namely in cisTargetX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Aerts2">[29]</xref> and i-cisTarget <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Herrmann1">[28]</xref>. These methods have been proven successful in identifying upstream regulators and direct target genes from co-expressed gene sets for Atonal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Aerts2">[29]</xref>, Shavenbaby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Menoret1">[36]</xref>, Fruitless <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Neville1">[37]</xref>, EcR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-VandenBroeck1">[38]</xref>, Dichaete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Shen1">[39]</xref>, Glass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-NavalSnchez1">[40]</xref>, dJun/Vri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Monnier1">[41]</xref>, and Rfx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-ZurLage1">[42]</xref>. Here, we apply this framework for the first time to human and mouse and we add two novelties to facilitate GRN mapping. The first is a <italic>motif2TF</italic> procedure that links an enriched motif (PWM) to a candidate binding TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). For this step we constructed a database of motif-TF direct annotations, TF-TF edges as defined by gene homology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Edgar1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Vilella1">[44]</xref>, and motif-motif edges as defined by motif similarity (using Tomtom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Gupta1">[45]</xref>). The database links 6031 motifs from the “10K” collection to 1191 human TFs. The advantage of this method is that it allows discovery of motif-TF links based on orthology and based on similarities between annotated and “unknown” motifs in the collection. Application of this method adds 247 more TFs to be identified than the 944 directly annotated TFs in human, and vastly increases the number of different motifs per TF (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for more detailed description). The second novelty is the availability of the method as a Cytoscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Smoot1">[26]</xref> plugin, called <italic>iRegulon</italic>. The plugin works on any input network and returns a combination of regulators, their direct targets within the input network, and their binding motifs. A detailed description on the use of the plugin is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s004">Fig. S4</xref>. This is, to our knowledge, the first method that brings <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence analysis into Cytoscape. This dramatically changes the way motif discovery is performed, because instead of a list of promoter sequences used as input, now any set, network, or pathway of genes can be used as input. Instead of a list of enriched motifs, <italic>regulons</italic>, are the output, containing the candidate TFs along with their optimal direct target subsets. iRegulon results can be immediately used to map (or annotate) gene regulatory networks and be integrated with the extensive array of regulatory, expression, and annotation tools available within Cytoscape.</p>
<p>To evaluate the performance of iRegulon, we derived direct target gene sets for 115 sequence-specific TFs from the ENCODE ChIP-Seq data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Wang1">[46]</xref>, and for each target set we investigate whether the ChIP'ped TF can be correctly recovered (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Out of 115 tested TFs, iRegulon correctly identifies up to 94 TFs (82.6%) with Normalized Enrichment Scores (NES) above 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We found iRegulon to be robust to noisy gene sets by adding increasing levels of noise (negative genes) to each set of targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The <italic>motif2TF</italic> step is crucial to link an enriched motif to a candidate TF; and including motifs from other species and unknown motifs allow detecting many more correct regulators compared to using only known human motifs from TRANSFAC or JASPAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). After optimizing the parameters of iRegulon and <italic>motif2TF</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), we compared iRegulon with eight other motif discovery methods that use a similar input (a set of co-expressed genes) and generate a similar output (candidate regulators) using a non-ambiguous subset from Factorbook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Wang1">[46]</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). iRegulon identifies the correct TF at the first position in 17/30 cases while the other tools on average detect only 5.1/30 TFs at the first position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s009">Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, the improved performances of iRegulon are not only due to the large PWM collection and the <italic>motif2TF</italic> mapping. Indeed, iRegulon still outperforms the other methods when using only the JASPAR collection and disabling the <italic>motif2TF</italic> step (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>) or <italic>vice versa</italic>, when manually promoting similar motifs in the other tools to the correct TF (dashed bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). As expected, the true positive target gene recovery is significantly higher when iRegulon uses a 20 kb search space around TSS compared to using only the proximal promoter (Wilcoxon rank-sum paired test, p-value = 0.004) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s002">Fig. S2D</xref>). We conclude that the core motif discovery framework of iRegulon is better than other tools, and that the large motif collection and the <italic>motif2TF</italic> step deliver a marked step forward in TF identification performance.</p>

<p>The TF recovery (y-axis) corresponds to the fraction of TFs correctly detected among all TFs for which a motif from our library can be associated. <bold>A.</bold> Positive sets consist of the top 200 genes ranked by the maximum signal value of the ChIP-Seq peak in the corresponding search space. Control sets are negatives from ENCODE (genes without a ChIP-Seq peak); TF neighborhoods (TFNB; all TFs within 5 Mb around a query TF); and random signatures (RND). The color (from red to yellow) and order of stacked bars indicate the number of times the queried TF was identified in the 1<sup>st</sup> rank (top1), 2<sup>nd</sup> rank (top2), 3<sup>rd</sup> rank (top3), 4<sup>th</sup> rank (top4), 5<sup>th</sup> rank (top5) and 6<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> rank (top10). White color indicates the number of detected TFs (motif enrichment ≥3) but with rank &gt;10. <bold>B.</bold> Positives are mixed with negative genes (noise) from 0% to 100% of noise.

The number of times the queried TF was identified in the top1 (red) and top5 (yellow) is recorded. The dashed boxes represent top 5 recoveries if similar motifs are manually re-associated to the query TF.

<title>Regulons can be discovered from various types of noisy and heterogeneous gene sets</title>
<p>In the validation and benchmark analyses above we used gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-Seq data as input for iRegulon. In this section, we explore more realistic types of inputs, such as co-expressed genes downstream of a TF perturbation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Liberzon1">[47]</xref>; genes involved in the same signaling pathway (e.g., KEGG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Kanehisa1">[48]</xref>, Reactome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Matthews1">[49]</xref> or Gene Ontology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Ashburner1">[50]</xref>); highly connected genes in a biological network (e.g., GeneMania <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-WardeFarley1">[51]</xref> or STRING <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Franceschini1">[52]</xref>); shared targets of a common microRNA. In the first example, we applied iRegulon to a set of 171 genes that are significantly up-regulated under hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Elvidge1">[53]</xref>. iRegulon yields a top-scoring regulon that contains HIF1A as master regulator, along with 94 predicted direct target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>). The predicted HIF1A targets are likely functional targets because they overlap much more (41%) with known HIF1A targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-OrtizBarahona1">[54]</xref> than the non predicted targets (15%). More systematically, when applied to 76 co-expressed gene sets obtained after a genetic perturbation of the TF (gene sets from MSigDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Liberzon1">[47]</xref>), the perturbed TF is recovered in 38 cases (50%) and as the top ranked master regulator in 18 cases (24%). The lower recall to detect the correct upstream TF compared to ChIP-derived gene sets is expected because not all TF perturbation experiments successfully result in significant gene expression changes of the direct target genes.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed a set of 161 genes involved in the NOTCH signaling pathway and identified the top two regulons to be controlled by <italic>HEY1/HEY2/HES1</italic> and <italic>RBPJ</italic>, two major players involved in NOTCH signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s005">Fig. S5B</xref>). We also analyzed 1198 genes involved in immune response (GO:0006955), and as expected we found the <italic>IRF</italic> and REL/NF-κB regulons, with 806 and 711 direct target genes respectively, highlighting their role as master regulators of the immune response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s005">Fig. S5C</xref>). We also analyzed all 2233 TF-centered subnetworks within protein association networks and found enrichment of direct targets for 151 (13.2%) and 159 TFs (14.6%) for GeneMania and STRING networks, respectively, indicating that transcriptional interactions are partially represented in protein-protein interaction networks as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s005">Fig. S5D</xref>). Finally, we analyzed 159 sets of known microRNA targets, for which iRegulon identified significant cross-talks (feed-forward loops) between the predicted TF and microRNA regulons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s005">Fig. S5E</xref>). While previous methods have thus far been validated and applied to co-expressed gene sets derived from gene expression profiling, here we show that motif discovery with iRegulon can quickly identify master regulons on diverse types of gene sets, as long as a small fraction of the input set is directly co-regulated by the same TF.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Mapping a gene regulatory network downstream of p53</title>
<p>We now applied iRegulon to study the gene regulatory network downstream of the p53 tumor suppressor. p53 functions mainly, if not exclusively, as a TF which regulates the expression of hundreds of genes that in turn mediate its biological activities including induction of cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Vousden1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Morachis1">[56]</xref>. Although p53 is one of the most-studied transcription factor and hundreds of target genes have already been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Menendez1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Vousden1">[55]</xref>, many aspects of its downstream network remain unresolved and a more comprehensive understanding of the p53 downstream signaling network is crucial given its importance in oncogenesis.</p>
<p>We first determined a p53-dependent gene signature in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line by RNA-seq upon stabilization of p53 by the non-genotoxic small molecule Nutlin-3a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Vassilev1">[57]</xref>. This treatment resulted in significant up-regulation of 801 genes and down-regulation of 790 genes. Both up- and down-regulated gene sets were subsequently analyzed with iRegulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The top-scoring regulon in the list of up-regulated genes is confirmed as the p53 regulon, with 307 genes predicted to be direct targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s010">Table S2</xref>). This indicates that p53 itself is the master regulator of the downstream network and directly controls many up-regulated genes, but not all of them (at least 38%). A Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the 307 predicted direct targets identifies p53-related processes and pathways, such as “p53 signaling pathway” (adjusted pvalue = 3.18e-21) or “Apoptosis” (adjusted p-value = 6.76e-07), while the set with the remaining 494 up-regulated genes show no significant GO term enrichment (data not shown).</p>

Yet, even under such circumstances there are two important advantages of using a computational regulatory analysis with iRegulon. First, the explicit finding of the p53 motif as top ranked indicates that p53 <italic>directly</italic> controls a large portion of the up-regulated genes but not all, creating two clearly distinct subsets. Second, we discover potential p53 co-factors and secondary regulons downstream of p53. Particularly, among the 801 genes that are activated downstream of p53, we found three other regulons, one operated by activator protein 1 (AP-1, heterodimer composed of JUN/FOS/FOSL1/FOSL2), another by a Forkhead TF (FOX), and another by NF-Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s011">Table S3A</xref>). These secondary regulons show extensive overlap with the primary p53 regulon, indicating that these TFs may be important contributors in gene regulation downstream of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The AP-1 regulon, sharing 136 genes (59% of its regulon) with the p53 regulon might indicate a prevalent co-factorship between the two proteins, something that has been reported before but never on such an extended scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Menendez2">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Nikulenkov1">[59]</xref>. In addition, one of the shared p53-AP1 targets is <italic>GADD45A</italic>, a gene involved in DNA damage repair, that has been shown to be a <italic>bona fide</italic> target of both p53 and AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Daino1">[60]</xref>. Interestingly, two subcomponents of the AP-1 complex, <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>FOSL1</italic>, are themselves up-regulated upon p53 stabilization, and are among the predicted direct p53 targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s012">Table S4</xref>). These results, together with the fact that the AP-1 motif was not enriched among the down-regulated genes indicate a positive, synergistic effect of the p53 and AP-1 regulons.</p>
<p>Nutlin-3a treatment also resulted in 790 significantly down-regulated genes. Interestingly, the analysis of this set with iRegulon does not detect the p53 motif as enriched. It does however identify E2F as master regulator with an astounding 653 (82.7%) predicted direct targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s011">Table S3B</xref>). Moreover, three E2F family members, namely E2F1, E2F2, and E2F8 are all strongly and significantly down-regulated upon Nutlin-3a treatment (around 10-fold down with p-value&lt;1.0E-64), indicating the marked involvement of this protein family in the repressive mechanisms of p53. Similarly, iRegulon points towards NF-Y as an important second master regulator of a large number of down-regulated genes (493 genes). Both E2F and NF-Y have been reported as important players for p53-mediated down-regulation of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Benatti1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Gatta1">[62]</xref>. This may happen through p21 regulated cyclin dependent kinases, resulting in a lack of phosphorylation of NF-Y and Rb which ultimately renders both NF-Y and E2F (through Rb) inactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Benson1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Yun1">[64]</xref>. Interestingly, the majority of NF-Y's predicted regulon overlaps with that of E2F, with only a very small number of genes predicted as NF-Y only targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The enriched Gene Ontology terms of these overlapping target genes are related to cell-cycle processes, an expected result since both E2F and NF-Y have been established to regulated cell cycle-related genes, often in a cooperative manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Bolognese1">[65]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Zhou1">[67]</xref>. In contrast to E2F, NF-Y itself is not down-regulated as a gene by p53 activation. However, it is possible that NF-Y is regulated at the protein level rather than at the transcriptional level in response to p53 activation. All together, these findings support the notion of an indirect rather than a direct p53 repressive process largely working through the p53-p21 axis, which affects both E2F and NF-Y <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Benson1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Schlereth1">[68]</xref>. All together, iRegulon generates marked ideas concerning p53, which are further elaborated upon in the next section.</p>

<title>ChIP-Seq on p53 and E2F confirm their predicted regulons</title>
<p>To test the predicted p53 regulon we determined the genome-wide chromatin occupancy by p53 in Nutlin-3a stimulated MCF-7 cells using high-coverage ChIP-Seq (∼30 Million uniquely mapped reads). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> shows the raw ChIP-Seq data for the known p53 target <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, with a very strong peak overlapping the known p53 binding site in the promoter of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-elDeiry1">[69]</xref>. To avoid arbitrary thresholds on peak calling we used lenient peak calling settings to rank all genes in the genome according to their likelihood of being a p53 target based on ChIP peaks only (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). To assess whether this ranking yields true p53 targets on top, we curated 223 <italic>bona fide</italic> p53 targets from the literature and public databases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s013">Table S5</xref>), and indeed found these targets to be significantly enriched in the top of this ranking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, p-value = 1.40E-24). Within the same ranking, the 307 predicted p53 targets by iRegulon are nearly as significantly enriched in the top as the curated targets (p-value = 2.60E-24), while the 494 remaining up-regulated genes are not significantly correlated with the ChIP peak data (p-value = 0.096). Importantly, this result shows that iRegulon is not only able to identify the master regulator, but is also able to correctly distinguish between direct and indirect targets from a set of co-expressed genes. Only two up-regulated genes with a high ChIP peak, namely <italic>PLK3</italic> and <italic>DDB2</italic>, were missed by iRegulon. About 100 up-regulated genes have a small ChIP peak but have not been predicted by iRegulon as target genes. These peaks are likely false positive ChIP peaks because they do not show p53 motif enrichment when analyzed separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s006">Fig. S6A–C</xref>). Finally, to compare how many targets are missed by iRegulon, and how many by ChIP-Seq, we again used the set of curated targets, and found comparable numbers of false negatives, namely six for iRegulon and five for ChIP-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In the previous section we had also found that gene repression downstream of p53 is indirect through E2F, which has been shown recently to be mediated by p21 and RB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Benson1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Schlereth1">[68]</xref>. If this is true, then the down-regulated genes should not contain p53 ChIP peaks. To test this, we plotted the recovery of the 790 down-regulated genes along the p53 ChIP-peak-based gene ranking generated above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Similar to the indirect up-regulated genes, the down-regulated genes are completely depleted of p53 ChIP peaks (p-value = 1.0). On the other hand, the down-regulated genes are positively correlated with E2F1 ChIP-Seq data in MCF-7 from ENCODE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s006">Fig. S6D</xref>). When combining all the small p53 ChIP-Seq peaks that are detected amongst the down-regulated genes, the p53 motif is not found by <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery, while the ChIP peaks of direct up-regulated targets are strongly enriched for <italic>de novo</italic> p53 motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s006">Fig. S6A–C</xref>). From the ChIP-Seq validation data, we conclude that iRegulon predicts the correct master regulators (p53 and E2F) and that predicted target genes of these TFs significantly overlap with ChIP-Seq derived targets. By combining iRegulon and ChIP-Seq data, we propose a set of 110 “top targets” of p53 in MCF-7 that are directly and positively regulated. When further comparing these predicted targets to recent reports of several p53 targetomes based on combining gene expression profiles with p53 ChIP-Seq data under different experimental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Menendez2">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Nikulenkov1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Schlereth1">[68]</xref>, we could confirm many common targets, but also uncovered 56 new direct p53 target genes with our analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s014">Table S6</xref>).</p>

<title>New p53 targets are confirmed by meta-analysis across human cancers and by enhancer-reporter assays</title>
<p>To explore the relevance of the newly identified p53 targets in other tumor types, we applied iRegulon in a meta-analysis to about twenty thousand cancer gene signatures, i.e. differentially expressed genes obtained from cancer specific experiments. We reasoned that those target genes that are recurrently predicted across cancer gene signatures, might contribute to the tumor suppressor role of p53. We used gene signatures from GeneSigDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Culhane1">[70]</xref>, MSigDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Subramanian1">[71]</xref> and from gene modules generated across 91 large cancer microarray data sets (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Out of 23172 signatures, p53 is found as regulator in 709 signatures. We merged the direct p53 targets across all these signatures into a network and weighted the edges according to the recurrence of this p53-target interaction across all signatures. Many previously known p53 targets and many ChIP-Seq derived targets are recovered using this analysis (GSEA NES = 3.01, FDR&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). Of the 110 predicted p53 targets in MCF-7 cells (as defined above), 44 are also predicted as p53 target in cancer gene signatures (grey area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). These genes are predicted as p53 targets by iRegulon <italic>and</italic> show a significant ChIP peak <italic>and</italic> are represented in the p53 cancer-related meta-regulon. Amongst these 44 genes, 20 were previously indicated as well established p53 targets (genes in squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). When extending the analysis and including target genes recently reported in literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Menendez2">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Nikulenkov1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Schlereth1">[68]</xref>, it becomes clear that most overlap coincides within this metatargetome (34/44) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s014">Table S6</xref>). Keeping in mind that many of the p53 targets reported by others were found using different cell lines, the enriched overlap within this metatargetome can be interpreted as a sign that these genes represent a core set targeted by p53 regardless of the cell type. Interestingly, when looking at targets like <italic>RAP2B</italic>, <italic>NHLH2</italic>, <italic>SLC12A4</italic>, and <italic>ALDH3A1</italic>, they could not have been identified through motif discovery in proximal promoters only, because the p53 binding sites are located either further upstream (∼1 kb for <italic>RAP2B</italic> and ∼5 kb for <italic>ALDH3A1</italic>) or in introns (<italic>NHLH2</italic> and <italic>SLC12A4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>Next we confirmed experimentally whether these four targets are <italic>bona fide</italic> p53 transcriptional targets. They are all induced in a p53-dependent manner in various cellular model systems including normal diploid human fibroblasts (BJ cells) and various cancer cell lines (i.e. HCT116 and MCF-7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Except <italic>ALDH3A1</italic>, they are also all significantly induced upon exposure to the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin, a well-established p53 inducer (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05). Their kinetic of induction both in response to Nutlin-3a and DNA damage is comparable to the one seen with known direct p53 targets such as <italic>CDKN1A</italic> further supporting a direct role for p53 in their regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). Finally, for all except one we could confirm luciferase reporter activity of the predicted p53 enhancer region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). Enhancer-reporters for <italic>ALDH3A1</italic>, <italic>NHLH2</italic> and <italic>RAP2B</italic> show a significant induction after Nutlin-3a treatment in wild type but not in a p53 knock-down (KD) cell line (p-value&lt;0.05). <italic>SLC12A4</italic> does not have a significant induction in either cell-type. Note that our positive control enhancer, namely the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter, is a very responsive p53 target and likely responds to low levels of p53, which could explain the induction that is still observed even under p53 KD conditions. Functionally, these validated p53 target genes have been implicated in p53-regulated processes such as the control of cell volume, growth and movement (SLC12A4 and RAP2B) and metabolism (ALDH3A1 and NHLH2).</p>

<title>Motif and track discovery join forces</title>
<p>We extended our <italic>motif discovery</italic> approach to allow the discovery of significantly enriched ChIP-Seq tracks in a set of co-expressed genes. We created a database with track-based gene rankings from a collection of 1118 ChIP-Seq experiments against 246 human sequence-specific TFs across 40 cell types and apply the same “ranking-and-recovery” enrichment calculation as employed earlier (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These and other recent resources further enlarged our motif collection to 9713 distinct PWMs (“10K collection”) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003731-t001">Table 1</xref>). To test whether motif and track discovery can be performed simultaneously, we combined the motif-based rankings and the track-based rankings into one enrichment analysis, although each AUC score distribution is kept separate for normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g006">Fig. 6A–B</xref>). Applied to the 801 p53-dependent up-regulated gene set, the combined approach still detects p53, AP-1, NFY, and FOX in the top motifs. Both for p53 and AP-1, enriched ChIP-Seq tracks are found by the track discovery, being our in-house performed p53 ChIP-Seq in MCF-7 after Nutlin-3a (ranked first of all tracks, NES = 5.18) and the FOSL2 ChIP-Seq tracks in MCF-7 from ENCODE (NES = 3.30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g006">Fig. 6C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s015">Table S7</xref>). In addition, we found five more candidate TFs with a putative role in the network downstream of p53 that were not detectable using the 6K motif collection only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Three of these additional candidates, namely RFX5, NR2F2, and NFI have both their ChIP-seq track and motif enriched while two more candidates, namely p300 and TCF12 only show track enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). To our knowledge, no interaction of these TFs with p53 has been reported in the literature. Although the targetomes of the co-factors overlap to some extent (20–42%) with p53 targets, they have a considerably large set of target genes independent of p53. Hence, with these additional TFs added downstream of p53, we can once more explain an additional fraction of the up-regulated gene set, with all the ChIP-Seq track-derived interactions together regulating 542 of the 801 genes. RFX5 is of particular interest since the gene itself is strongly up-regulated by p53 and is in fact among the core set of 801 up-regulated genes (log2FC = 1.9 and adjusted p-value = 1.05E-15). RFX5 is mainly known as a regulator of MHC-II genes, and indeed, among the top predicted RFX5 target genes downstream of p53 we find HLA-F, MR1, and other genes involved in antigen and interferon-related processes. Interestingly, RFX5 has recently also been shown to act as a DNA mismatch repair stimulatory factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Zhang1">[72]</xref>, and several p53-shared RFX5 targets, such as DDB2 and BBC3, are in fact related to DNA damage response (adjusted p-value = 6.99E-5, Wikipathway ID:WP707) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). Hence, RFX5 can be considered as a new candidate co-factor to modulate certain aspects of the p53-regulated response, and may explain why MHC-II genes are up-regulated in a p53-dependent manner. This proof-of-principle of combined motif and track enrichment paves the way towards further integration of regulatory track data and enhancer prediction data to map gene regulatory networks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have optimized and expanded motif discovery methods and used large collections of up to 10.000 candidate motifs to facilitate translation of motif detection results into a network biology framework. By adding this network-layer on top of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motifs, we could generate direct insight into a biological process, rather than producing a mere list of enriched motifs from a gene set. iRegulon outperformed existing methods at detecting the correct upstream regulator. We found that using PWMs from other species than human greatly helps motif detection in human data sets. Many TFs are conserved from human to mouse, and even from human to fly or yeast, and sometimes the yeast or fly PWM is of higher quality or better captures the specificity of DNA binding. In addition, we found that using multiple PWMs for the same TF is an advantage and leads to higher performance of TF recovery compared to using non-redundant motif collections. Our motif collection also contains an important fraction of “novel” motifs for unknown TFs. These motifs are mostly derived from whole-genome computational predictions. In some cases these unknown motifs are clustered together in the output of iRegulon alongside a known motif, and can thereby lead to candidate TF predictions, while in other cases they may represent orphan motifs (with unidentified TFs). The mixture of known and unknown motifs creates a hybrid motif detection approach, combining <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery and pattern matching approaches.</p>
<p>Large-scale analyses of co-expressed gene sets of different origins, including co-expression, TF binding (ChIP), protein-protein association networks and microRNA targets, suggest that by exploiting the genome sequence, together with other species' genomes and collections of consensus TF binding sites, the most relevant sub-networks that underlie observed changes in gene expression or observed genetic interactions can be reconstructed. In up to 70% of the cases, the upstream regulatory factor can be identified, along with a set of direct targets. Therefore iRegulon provides an alternative approach to probe a particular biological process when gene expression data is available but the TF is not known in advance and/or ChIP-Seq is not feasible. By combining iRegulon with RNA-Seq, the resolution of gene expression profiling and gene regulatory network mapping can be increased, allowing the characterization of any cell type, cellular response, or tumor sample, up to the single cell level.</p>
<p>Multiple regulons are often discovered from one co-regulated gene set. This is expected because in higher vertebrates gene regulation is combinatorial, where multiple TFs cooperate, either through binding in the same CRM (called heterotypic CRMs), or in separate CRMs of the same target gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Wasserman1">[17]</xref>. In addition, the targets of a TF can be TFs themselves, and in turn activate or repress their own targets. For example, in the p53-dependent gene set iRegulon identified not only p53 as regulator, but also a previously known co-factor AP-1 and new regulators downstream of p53 such as RFX5. Interestingly, <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>FOSL1</italic>, important members of the AP-1 complex, and <italic>RFX5</italic>, were all identified in this study as targets of p53. These regulators can explain a large proportion of the possible target genes of p53 as being indirect and regulated by another TF. When we extended our <italic>ranking-and-recovery</italic> framework to include more than one thousand ChIP-Seq data tracks, we also found the respective ChIP-Seq peaks for AP-1, RFX5, and several other co-factors as significantly enriched in the p53 downstream network. The joint finding of both a motif and a track for the same transcription factor strongly increases the confidence for these factors to play a role in the network as master regulator (i.e., directly controlling many target genes). Nevertheless, we envision that in most cases the motif enrichment alone, without any track enrichment, can directly lead to candidate master regulators, because ChIP-Seq data is condition-specific and is currently available for relatively few transcription factors.</p>
<p>The absence of a regulator in the output of iRegulon, when neither a motif nor a track is enriched, can also be informative. For instance, neither the p53 motif nor its ChIP-Seq track are found enriched among the down-regulated genes, leading to the hypothesis that p53 does not act as a direct repressor, but only as an activator. Rather, iRegulon points to E2F as the master regulator of the down-regulated genes, both by its motif and track. This finding can be explained as indirect down-regulation of E2F targets and has recently been experimentally established: p21 controls RB1-mediated repression of E2F targets, including E2F family members themselves, thereby reinforcing this signal further <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Benson1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Schlereth1">[68]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our experimental findings on the p53 regulon were obtained in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Usually, one iRegulon analysis is focused on one biological process, and predicts transcriptional targets that are relevant in that particular cell type or condition under study. We show that it is also possible to apply iRegulon more systematically on multiple signatures to identify cancer-related ‘meta-regulons’. They often represent the canonical, high-confidence target genes and agree well with ENCODE ChIP-Seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). This shows that relevant TF-target interactions can be identified purely from the genome sequence, thereby creating a valuable resource for less studied TFs.</p>

<title>Sequence search spaces</title>
<p>Three predefined regulatory search spaces are used in this manuscript from small to large regions: 500 bp upstream of TSS [TSS−500 bp,TSS]; 10 kb around TSS [TSS−5 kb,TSS+5 kb]; 20 kb around TSS [TSS−10 kb,TSS+10 kb]. If another gene is located within the upstream region, then the region is cut where this neighboring gene begins or ends (depending on which strand this gene is located on). Coding exons are excluded from the search space to avoid bias towards these exons through conservation. Notice that there can be multiple regions per gene (various upstream regions for alternative transcripts, and multiple introns) (see example in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). When multiple regions are scored for a given gene, the rank of the highest ranked region is taken into account as the final rank of the gene.</p>

<title>3) Motif scoring</title>
<p>TFBS are often organized in homotypic clusters in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Gotea1">[80]</xref>. We used Cluster-Buster as CRM prediction method based on previous benchmark results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Aerts4">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Su1">[82]</xref>, although other Hidden Markov Model implementations would yield similar results, as shown for SWAN in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Aerts2">[29]</xref>. The parameters used for Cluster-Buster are the default parameters, except the –c parameter is set to zero to allow a score for every region. The Cluster-Buster score is a log likelihood ratio corresponding to log [prob(sequence given that it is a cluster of real sites)/prob(cluster sequence given that it is random DNA)]. All regions are ranked according to the Cluster-Buster score, for each species separately. These rankings are combined by rank aggregation using a probabilistic method, <italic>OrderStatistics</italic>, to evaluate the probability (q-value) of observing a particular configuration of ranks across the different related species by chance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Aerts3">[35]</xref>. This results in a q-value for each region based on the species specific ranks and thus effectively integrates all comparative genomics information in a single ranking for each PWM in our library, thereby allowing for motif movement within each region. The final rank of a gene is determined by the highest rank of its best region in the cross-species ranking. Genes with a score of zero are randomly queued. Note that this motif scoring strategy has been validated and used successfully in previous implementations designed for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, namely cisTargetX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Aerts2">[29]</xref> and i-cisTarget <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Herrmann1">[28]</xref>.</p>

<title>Calculating motif and track enrichment on a gene set</title>
<p>Our motif enrichment analysis differs from standard gene set enrichment methods such as GSEA, which uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Subramanian1">[71]</xref>. In our method, we calculate the top enrichment of a single gene set over N<sub>motif</sub> genomic rankings while gene set enrichment methods assess the significance of many gene sets for one genomic ranking. Enrichment is determined by the Area Under the Recovery Curve (AUC) of the cumulative recovery curve for the input set, along the whole-genome ranking. As we are mostly interested in highly ranked genes, the AUC is computed in the top of the ranking (default set to 3%, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s002">Fig. S2B</xref> for validation) for all PWMs or tracks of the collection. A Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) for a given motif/track is computed as the AUC value of the motif/track minus the mean of all AUCs for all motifs (or tracks), and divided by the standard deviation of all AUCs. When the distribution of AUCs follows a normal distribution then the NES score is a z-score indicative of the significance. The default NES cutoff in iRegulon is 3.0, corresponding to FDR between 3% and 9% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s4e">
<title>Detection of the target genes</title>
<p>For each enriched motif, the candidate targets are selected as the optimal subset of highly ranked genes compared to the genomic background and to the entire motif collection as background. This step is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>. The target gene recovery is plotted along the whole-genome ranking for a given motif (blue curve) and compared to the average recovery + (2× standard deviation) (red curve) for all motifs in the collection. Similarly to the GSEA approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Subramanian1">[71]</xref>, the leading edge corresponds to the rank where the difference between the signal (blue curve) and the background (red curve) is maximal within the top ranked genes (the latter is defined by the Rank Threshold parameter). The input genes that have a better ranking than the rank at the leading edge are predicted as target genes for the given motif or track.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4f">
<title>Detection of TFs using Motif2TF mapping</title>
<p>Enriched motifs are linked to candidate TFs, which could potentially bind to the motif. If we use only the direct annotations, only a small fraction of motifs (20%) can be associated to human TFs (521 TFs with “6K” collection, 944 TFs with “10K” collection). We developed a database, which we term the <italic>motif2TF</italic> database, corresponding to a network of associations between motifs and TFs where motif-TF edges correspond to all motif-TF direct annotations (from different species), TF-TF edges are defined by homology (using Ensembl Gene Trees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Edgar1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Vilella1">[44]</xref>), and motif-motif edges are defined by motif similarity, defined by the Tomtom p-value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Gupta1">[45]</xref>. For each motif all possible TFs are associated following different paths in the motif2TF network. In the plugin at the client side, these TFs are ranked, prioritizing directly annotated TFs, then the TF present in the input set, then the ones that are found by gene homology and finally the TFs found using motif similarity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003731-g001">Figure 1C</xref> illustrates the different possible paths on a motif2TF subnetwork. Motif M1 is not directly annotated to any TF (so it can be part of the unknown motif collections), but is similar to two other motifs, namely M3 and M4, both of which are directly annotated. Motif M4 is directly annotated to a human TF (TF1), while M3 is a motif annotated for a TF from another species (TF7). Three TFs in human (TF1, TF8, TF6) are possible orthologs of TF7. In this example, the link between M1 and TF1 would go via the path through M4, which is the shortest and best path (rather than via M3 and TF7). For M1, motif2TF returns TF1, TF6, and TF8 as candidate TFs, which are subsequently ranked. The second example is for motif M2 which is annotated for TF5 in another species. Three human transcription factors (TF2, TF3, TF4) are possible orthologs of TF5, which may represent for example a family of homologous TFs such as GATA factors, E2F factors, or ETS factors. In such a TF family, the consensus motif may indeed be shared by multiple family members and therefore iRegulon may return multiple or all family members as candidates. When multiple TFs are returned, we give priority to a TF when it is part of the input genes. In this example, TF2 will be preferentially associated to M2 as it belongs to the input genes (encoded by TG5 in the Figure).</p>

Almost one thousand files (999) were downloaded corresponding to 160 sequence-specific TFs (TFSS): 672 files for HAIB (Hudson Alpha Institute), 323 for SYDH (Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard) and 6 files for Uchicago. Files corresponding to Input and RNA Polymerase 2 (“Pol2”/“Pol2(phosphoS2)”) were not downloaded. 115 TFs are detectable in iRegulon (i.e., at least one motif in the collection of 6383 motifs can be connected to the TF), corresponding to 786 ENCODE datasets. Each query set consists of the top 200 target genes presenting a ChIP peak in a predefined search space, i.e., for each search space tested (500 bp upstream of TSS; 10 kb around TSS; 20 kb around TSS), we define a different set of target genes, so that each target gene contains a ChIP peak within the chosen motif search space. The ChIP-Seq scoring of the genes has been done as mentioned earlier in the <italic>Track-based rankings</italic> section. Finally, note that our motif collection does not contain PWMs derived from these datasets (so we rely on other, previously curated PWMs to identify the correct TF).

We selected these tools because they mostly take as input a set of human co-expressed genes, and they all return, at least to some extent, information on which TF could be regulating the input genes. For this reason, it not feasible to compare iRegulon with classical <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery methods (e.g., MEME-like methods) because such methods are intractable on large human gene sets (e.g., 200 genes×20 kb×10 species represents a sequence set of 40 Mb), and they result in new motifs rather than candidate TFs. We also attempted to use SMART <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Veerla1">[119]</xref> but we did not succeed in running the software. For tools that require regulatory sequences as input (AME and Clover) we used the same sequences as used by iRegulon. For some tools like Clover, it is theoretically possible to use a large search space but one run on one dataset takes too long (∼17 hours), and therefore we limited the analysis to 500 bp promoter sequences. In the case of AME, we found no positive results with a large search space (data not shown), so we show the results with the default search space. For comparison, we used the number of motifs/TFs found in top 1 and within top 5 positions. The total number of detected motifs was not reported for comparison, because some tools use more stringent thresholds than others. All these tools rely on the available motif annotation to identify the candidate TF such as Jaspar (J) or Transfac (T). However, we also manually re-associated the detected motifs to candidate TFs (mainly by comparison of the detected motif with the FactorBook motif) (see column “USING SIMILARITY” in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s011">Table S3</xref>). For Homer2, 14 motifs that are derived from ENCODE ChIP-Seq data matching the actual Factorbook ChIP-Seq data were discarded from their in-house PWM collection to avoid over-fitting (indeed, iRegulon does not include FactorBook PWMs either, nor do any of the other tools).

The user can browse through the motif discovery results, select a TF among the prioritized list of TFs, and add upstream regulators and direct regulator-target ‘edges’ to the input gene set or network under study. A detailed description on the use of the plugin is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003731.s004">Figure S4</xref>. In addition, the plugin allows querying <italic>cisTargetDB</italic> to obtain the meta-regulon for a given TF, i.e. targets found recurrently predicted for this TF by iRegulon across thousands of signatures/gene sets. iRegulon results were obtained by running the Cytoscape plugin v0.97 on Cytoscape 2.8.1. The current version of iRegulon (1.2) supports the “10K” motif collection and the track discovery. The source code of the iRegulon plugin is also available from the iRegulon website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iregulon.aertslab.org" xlink:type="simple">http://iregulon.aertslab.org</ext-link>).</p>

<title>A database with meta-regulons</title>
<p>iRegulon was applied in batch (i.e., using the GMT file format as input for the command line version of iRegulon) to 3447 signatures in GeneSigDB (version 4), 6753 signatures from MSigDB (version v3 collection 2) and 12972 bi-clusters we obtained in-house.

<p>p53-Wild-Type MCF-7 cells were plated onto 24-well plates (60000 cells/well). The next day, cells were either stimulated with 5 µM Nutlin-3a or left untreated. After 24 h, cells were washed in PBS (Gibco) and prepared for RNA extraction according to the RNeasy protocol (Qiagen), yielding around 2 µg of total RNA per sample. The quality of the RNA samples were checked using a Bioanalyzer 1000 DNA chip (Agilent) after which libraries were constructed according to the Illumina TruSeqTM RNA Sample preparation guide. Final libraries were pooled and sequenced on the HISeq 2000 (Illumina), generating approximately 30 million reads of 50 bp length. After removing adapter sequences reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using TopHat v1.3.3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003731-Trapnell1">[127]</xref> with default settings.

The top tracks show our different delineations: in green (500 bp upstream of the TSS, named “500 bp”), in pink (TSS+−5 kb, named “5 kb”) and in blue (TSS+−10 kb, named “10 kb”). The screenshot also shows different tracks (from top to bottom): the Refseq genes annotations, the mark of active chromatin (H3K27Ac) from ENCODE, the density of DNaseI Clusters from ENCODE, the density of Transcription Factor ChIP-Seq from ENCODE, the CpG islands, the regulatory elements annotated in OregAnno, and vertebrate basewise conservation by PhyloP. The promoter (and sequences further upstream and downstream of TSS) of each alternative transcript is used. This can be seen when we consider the delineation of the 500 bp promoters, depicted as green track in the figure. In the RefSeq annotation there are two major TSSs, and each has its own promoter. However, in the large search spaces the respective upstream and downstream regions of both TSSs overlap, and become one large merged region (pink and blue for 5 kb and 10 kb respectively).</p>

The proportion of genes with proximal peaks have been calculated for each TF by the overlap between the inferred gene sets with peaks found within the proximal search space (all genes) and the large search space (top 200 genes). Overall, when iRegulon is applied on a 20 kb search space (TSS+−10 kb), more true target genes are identified (i.e., higher sensitivity shown as green bars), compared to iRegulon on 500 bp promoter only.</p>
