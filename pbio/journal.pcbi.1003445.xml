<abstract>
<p>The convergence of corticostriatal glutamate and dopamine from the midbrain in the striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) triggers synaptic plasticity that underlies reinforcement learning and pathological conditions such as psychostimulant addiction. The increase in striatal dopamine produced by the acute administration of psychostimulants has been found to activate not only effectors of the AC5/cAMP/PKA signaling cascade such as GluR1, but also effectors of the NMDAR/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/RAS cascade such as ERK. The dopamine-triggered effects on both these cascades are mediated by D1R coupled to Golf but while the phosphorylation of GluR1 is affected by reductions in the available amount of Golf but not of D1R, the activation of ERK follows the opposite pattern. This segregation is puzzling considering that D1R-induced Golf activation monotonically increases with DA and that there is crosstalk from the AC5/cAMP/PKA cascade to the NMDAR/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/RAS cascade via a STEP (a tyrosine phosphatase). In this work, we developed a signaling model which accounts for this segregation based on the assumption that a common pool of D1R and Golf is distributed in two D1R/Golf signaling compartments. This model integrates a relatively large amount of experimental data for neurons in vivo and in vitro. We used it to explore the crosstalk topologies under which the sensitivities of the AC5/cAMP/PKA signaling cascade to reductions in D1R or Golf are transferred or not to the activation of ERK. We found that the sequestration of STEP by its substrate ERK together with the insensitivity of STEP activity on targets upstream of ERK (i.e. Fyn and NR2B) to PKA phosphorylation are able to explain the experimentally observed segregation. This model provides a quantitative framework for simulation based experiments to study signaling required for long term potentiation in MSNs.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The molecular mechanisms by which a dog learns to associate a bell ring with incoming food and by which addiction to cocaine is developed have many things in common. In both cases, glutamate-mediated inputs from the cortex converge on striatal neurons with the neuromodulator dopamine whose level increases upon food delivery or cocaine administration. This convergence triggers intracellular reaction cascades that end up modifying the basal state of these neurons into what is currently considered the cellular correlate of learning and its overblown variant: addiction. Understanding these signaling cascades is required to design interventions for the enhancement of cognitive capacities and the prevention/cure of addiction. With this in mind, we developed a model of the dynamics of these reaction cascades upon the administration of cocaine. We did this by gathering the cascades' molecular components and interactions discovered by experimentalist so far and then setting the reaction parameters so that the model reproduces the timing of the molecular changes that lead to the discovery of those components and interactions. With this integrationist endeavor we disclosed some inconsistencies and provided a rationale for experimental observations that were unexplained. Our predictions are readily challengeable with future experiments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The interplay between dopamine and glutamate in the striatum is considered to mediate the role of this basal ganglia structure in reinforcement learning and action selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-KravitzA1">[1]</xref>. Glutamatergic projections arising from the cortex carry environmental information (a context, a cue or an action) into the striatum where dopamine is released by afferents from the midbrain. This dopamine signal occurs in response to salient events such as unexpected rewards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Schultz1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Redgrave1">[3]</xref>. The glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs converge on striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) where they trigger neuronal plasticity mechanisms that allow the animal to associate the salient event and the environment that preceded it. This system is hijacked by psychostimulants like cocaine and amphetamines, which acting directly on the dopaminergic terminals generate an increase in the striatal dopamine levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Sulzer1">[4]</xref> so that the context paired with the administration of the drug is actively sought by the animal even after just a single trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent1">[5]</xref>. This behavior is considered to be a correlate of addiction in humans.</p>
<p>The elucidation of the receptor-induced signaling cascades taking place in the neurons of the circuitry integrating dopaminergic and glutamatergic inputs is considered a natural requirement for the design of effective pharmacological treatments for preventing/curing addiction. In this regard, it has been found that acute psychostimulant administration (<bold>APA</bold>) to naïve animals produces conspicuous molecular phenotypes in dopamine type 1 receptor (D1R) expressing MSNs (D1R+MSN) which constitute half of striatal MSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Bateup1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-BertranGonzalez1">[8]</xref> (throughout this work we use a broad definition of phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Bellahcne1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Caie1">[11]</xref> that comprises not only macroscopic observables in mutant and wild type living animals upon some treatment like APA, but also traits in samples from these animals like immunoblot bands from striatal slices, microscopy images and membrane currents).The co-stimulation with dopamine and glutamate has been found to be required for the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase ERK2 (hereafter just ERK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent2">[12]</xref>. Classically, this convergence is also required for the mobilization of GluR1-containing AMPAR (2-Amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-Methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)Propanoic Acid Receptor) to the postsynaptic density through the dual phosphorylation of GluR1 by PKA and PKC/CaMKII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Snyder1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Lee1">[14]</xref> but just the PKA site has been found to be modified in the psychostimulant paradigms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Snyder1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Ferrario1">[15]</xref>. The phosphorylation of ERK and GluR1 are part of plasticity mechanisms which result in measurable behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Herv1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Surmeier1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The effects of APA in D1R+MSNs are mediated through two signaling cascades, the AC5 (Adenylyl Cyclase type 5)/cAMP/PKA axis (AC5 axis) and the NMDAR (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor)/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/RAS (NMDAR axis). These are both activated by dopamine signaling via D1R coupled to Golf. The AC5 axis is activated by the Golf α subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Herv2">[18]</xref> and the NMDAR axis is sensitized to glutamatergic input by the Golf βγ dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In order to study this system, mice with single copies of the genes encoding D1R (<italic>Drd1a</italic><sup>+/−</sup>) and Gαolf (<italic>GnaI<sup>+/−</sup></italic>) have been used. In both cases these animals have shown clear signs of haploinsufficiency (reduced amount of the gene product), with 20% and 40% of the wild type (WT) striatal levels of D1R and Gαolf (and thereafter the Golf heterotrimer)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Corvol1">[20]</xref>, respectively. APA experiments with these mutant mice have shown that the phosphorylation of GluR1 and ERK are associated to different sets of behaviors and that both the phosphorylation and the associated behaviors are <italic>segregated</italic> as explained in more detail below.</p>

<p>The AC5 axis comprises the classical generation of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase (AC5) with the consequent activation of PKA and inhibition of its counteracting PP1 via DARPP32 (D32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The PKA phosphorylation of GluR1 results in the exocytosis of GluR1-containing AMPA to the membrane and increases in single channel currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Lee1">[14]</xref>. While no changes in the membrane levels of GluR1 has been found in the APA paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Ferrario1">[15]</xref>, the PKA phosphorylation of GluR1 <italic>correlates</italic> with the locomotor activation observed upon APA.

<p>In the NMDAR axis dopamine enhances NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry which results in the downstream activation of ERK through the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade. The activation of ERK, which triggers the expression of several genes, has been found to be essential for the development of conditioned place preference and locomotor sensitization which are considered behavioral signatures of addiction to psychostimulants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent3">[21]</xref>.

<p>The AC5 and the NMDAR signaling axes have several crosstalking edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through NMDAR activates serine/threonine phosphatases regulating the phosphorylation of D32 and inhibits AC5 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Lindskog1">[23]</xref>. On the other hand, the broadcast from the AC5 axis to the NMDAR axis is mediated by the tyrosine phosphatase STEP (Striatal Enriched tyrosine Phosphatase) which exists in two forms and is claimed to be inactivated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation which is counteracted by PP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-BlancoAparicio1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Fitzpatrick1">[26]</xref>. The phosphatase activity of STEP counteract the activation of Fyn, NMDAR and ERK in the NMDAR axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Fitzpatrick1">[26]</xref>. The significantly lower activation of not only GluR1 but also ERK upon APA in D32KO mice, where PP1 is not inhibited and the STEP phosphorylation by PKA is affected, has been interpreted as an evidence of the PKA-sensitive crosstalk mediated by STEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent2">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>The segregation of the effects in <italic>GnaI<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Drd1a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice into the AC5 and the NMDAR axes is puzzling for at least two reasons. One is that as the D1R-catalyzed Golf activation monotonically increases with dopamine levels, thus the effectors that are changed in one mutant should be the same or a subset of the effectors that are changed in the other mutant. The other is that the crosstalk between the axes is expected to have a homogenizing effect by transferring the sensitivities from one axis to the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Endres1">[27]</xref>. How can the segregation arise in the first place? Then, how is it maintained in the face of crosstalk? In this work, we have developed a quantitative signaling model which explains this data pattern. In this model the segregation arises from the distribution of a common pool of D1R and Golf in two D1R/Golf signaling compartments according to the affinity and capacity of compartment anchors. Each D1R/Golf compartment is dedicated to only one signaling axis. The segregation is kept in the face of crosstalk if the latter involves just a single pool of STEP whose activity is affected by PKA phosphorylation in a substrate dependent manner. These assumptions are backed by an increasing body of experimental support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-BlancoAparicio1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Saxena1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Voulalas1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Zhang1">[32]</xref>.</p>

<title>Network building</title>
<p>The model developed in this work integrates a substantial portion of the intracellular signaling triggered in MSNs by dopamine acting on D1R and glutamate on NMDAR. Two main signaling axes with several crosstalking edges are considered both of which are modulated upstream by dopamine via D1R coupled to Golf. One is the classical generation of cAMP by AC5 with the consequent activation of PKA and inhibition of its counteracting PP1 via D32. The other is the enhancement of NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry which results in the downstream activation of ERK. A detailed description follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This signaling cascade is triggered in dendritic spines and most of the processes occur there. The entire reaction network is modeled in a single well-stirred volume using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe species concentration changes over time. However, the model includes the representation (through the indexing of species) of a few reaction compartments which stand for segregated reaction sites located in the spine such as the post-synaptic density (PSD), an internal NMDAR reservoir and two D1R/Golf signaling compartments. A few others processes which are part of the DUSP (dual specificity phosphatases)-mediated negative feedback loop inactivating ERK occur in other locations like the dendritic shaft, the soma and the nucleus and but these locations were not considered explicitly.</p>

<title>DA/D1R enhancement of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents</title>
<p>Dopamine acting through D1R has long been known to stimulate NMDAR currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Cepeda1">[59]</xref> in a process mediated by serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of different subunits of NMDAR. In this model three different mechanism of DA/D1R enhancement of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were considered. In all cases NMDAR was represented by a single species with different phosphorylation states and two different localizations, synaptic and intracellular. We have assumed that the different phosphorylations are independent of each other and also independent of the location of the receptor. These modifications, which are triggered by DA/D1R/Golf signaling, result in increased NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents according to a factor that scales up the amplitude of basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (see below). While the signaling networks underlying each of these three mechanisms are operating concomitantly, the contribution of each of them to the dynamics of downstream effectors is probed independently. The absolute value of the scaling factor (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003445.e001">Equations 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003445.e002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003445.e003">3</xref> below) for each of these three mechanisms is arbitrary, thus the scaling factors were normalized to 1 in basal conditions (t = 0). Furthermore, the maximum amplitude of the scaling factors achieved by dopamine stimulation in this work is set to 2.5 in the three cases. The normalization and the common maximum amplitude allow comparison among the three different mechanisms of NMDAR enhancement in terms of time course. The selection of 2.5 as the maximum amplitude carries a dose of uncertainty. The scaling produced by the Fyn-mediated traffic-based mechanism has been found to be around 1.5 for EPSPs amplitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Wang1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Li1">[61]</xref>. However, electrophysiological measurements can underestimate increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by enhancement of NMDAR function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Skeberdis1">[62]</xref>. Higher values of maximum scaling factor amplitude are easily accommodated by the model, with no changes in the conclusion of this work.</p>

<p>Fyn-mediated increase of NR2B-containing synaptic NMDAR (yTrf): This is a relatively slower traffic-based mechanism were DA acting through D1R promotes an increase in NR2B-dependent synaptic NMDAR currents.

Fyn and STEP act on both the intracellular and the synaptic NMDAR. The activity of Fyn is regulated by the phosphorylation state of two of its tyrosine residues, Y420 and Y527 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>).

For the analysis of the contribution of these purportedly PKA-sensitive crosstalking edges via STEP to the dynamics of the system, we considered all combinations between three factors which were expressed using a three membered binary vector: PKA-sensitive crosstalk via STEP at the level of Fyn and NR2B (0 no, 1 yes), PKA-sensitive crosstalk via STEP at the level of ERK (0 no, 1 yes) and the number of STEP pools acting at these two points (0 one, 1 two) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s006">Table S1</xref>). For example, 010 means no crosstalk at Fyn&amp;NR2B, crosstalk at ERK and a single shared STEP pool operating at both points. The Fyn and NR2B nodes were lumped together to reduce the number of combination and because they both control the level of NR2B phosphorylation. A second naming scheme was used to graphically identify the crosstalking scheme. In this case, each crosstalking edge is numbered and a crosstalking scheme is identified by a sequence of numbers representing the edges involved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s006">Table S1</xref>). The number of STEP pools involved was considered an important factor in the face of sequestration effects or retroactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Alexander1">[84]</xref>. That is, if the STEP acting on different substrates comes from a single pool, the sequestration in the form of Michaelis-Menten complex by one substrate affects the availability of STEP to others. In the simulations, the implementation of each crosstalking scheme was achieved by selectively turning on/off the forward rate constant of the interaction of the phosphorylated substrates with different forms/pools of STEP (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s006">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>D1R/Golf signaling compartments</title>
<p>One of the most consequential modifications introduced to the previous model is that D1R and Golf are distributed in two signaling compartments with slow redistribution between them: an AC5 axis-linked compartment and a NMDAR axis-linked compartment. This redistribution occurs through a non-signaling reservoir. The distribution of D1R and Golf each of the two compartments is determined by the affinity and the total amounts (or capacity) of anchors or adaptors for these molecules present in each compartment. There are several lines of evidence motivating this assumption (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref>). The estimation of the amounts and affinities of the anchors in each compartment for D1R and Golf is an optimization problem. The optimal values should be such that, without being extreme, allow the model to reproduce the phenotypic data. This problem has multiple solutions and we show one obtained by manual fitting. For example, we assumed the capacity of the AC5-compartment to be at most 20% of the total amount of D1R in the system, just as the total D1R in the <italic>Drd1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> is 20% of the total D1R in the WT. Furthermore, the affinity for D1R in this compartment (or more precisely the ratio between the amount of anchor and its affinity for D1R) is higher than in the NMDAR compartment. This implies that in the WT the AC5 compartment will be saturated of D1R. Furthermore, in the competition between both compartments for D1R, the AC5 compartment will prevail over the NMDAR comportment up to the point that in <italic>Drd1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice the amount of D1R in the AC5 compartment will be at WT levels (because the anchor was set to 20% of WT D1R and the affinity is high) while the NMDAR compartment will be almost emptied of D1R. Interestingly, there is evidence of a D1R reserve in D1R+MSN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Cumming1">[85]</xref> measured. An earlier study of D1R levels in the striatum of mice with a single copy of <italic>Drd1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> reported 40% of the WT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Drago1">[86]</xref> instead of the 20% used in this work. As the results about phosphorylation of GluR1 and ERK in <italic>Drd1a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice were obtained in a C57B1/6 background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Corvol1">[20]</xref> where a 20% of WT D1R level was measured we have chosen this number over the 40% measured in the hybrid 129 and C57B1/6 background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Drago1">[86]</xref>. We have used this 40% in a second version of the model and the conclusions of this work remained unaltered (see below).</p>
<p>The distribution of Golf is just the opposite of D1R: it is loosely attached to the AC5 compartment but strongly bound to the NMDAR compartment where the amount of its anchor is at most 40% of the total amount of Golf in the WT.</p>

<title>Target phenotypes</title>
<p>The model was constrained with several quantitative molecular phenotypes gathered from the literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003445-t001">Table 1</xref>). These phenotypes can be classified as APA and non-APA phenotypes depending on whether they were obtained with the APA protocol. There are 10 phenotypes several of them with more than one phenotypic variable. The names of the phenotypic variables result from the merge of the phenotype name and the marker name.</p>
<p>Some of these phenotypic variables are measurements of protein markers by immunohistochemistry and/or immunoblotting. Whenever possible, the measured values of protein levels by immunoblotting were corrected if, i) the samples have a relevant cellular heterogeneity such as those from the striatum, but ii) the effect is cell specific and iii) other cells types in the sample contribute to the basal levels of the protein of interest. The correction performed was,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003445.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003445.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>FC is the cell-specific fold change over the basal, W is the fold change quantified with Western blots in the heterogeneous sample and f<sup>c</sup> and f<sup>t</sup> are the fraction of positive cells for the marker as measured by immunohistochemistry for the control and the treatment, respectively. The derivation of this equation is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s008">Text S1</xref> (Supporting Information).</p>
<p>Time series and dose-response phenotypic data was compressed by parameterization with the fitting of simple parametric models. For example, the dose-response data of phenotypes <underline>activeRAS</underline> and <underline>sensitizedNMDAR</underline> was parameterized with a Hill model.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003445.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003445.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>C<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>C<sub>max</sub></italic> are the minimal and maximal levels of the response (<italic>C<sub>x</sub></italic>), respectively. <italic>K</italic> and <italic>h</italic> are the dosage for half of the total response change and the Hill coefficient. In the case of <italic>sensitizedNMDAR</italic>, where two dose-response data series were fitted, it is reported the ratio between the half-activating concentrations without and with dopamine.</p>
<p>The time series of <italic>trafficNMDAR</italic> was parameterized with a single exponential.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003445.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003445.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic> is the rate constant.</p>
<p>Thus, the quality of the fit of the ODE model to the experimental data was represented and evaluated in these cases through the comparison of optimal parameters for the experimental data versus those of the simulated model. No simple parametric model was found to fit the time series of APAib and they were represented independently. After these transformations and excluding the phenotype ‘sensitizedNMDAR’ which was matched just qualitatively, there are a total of 17 phenotypic variables to constrain the model.</p>

<title>Model simulation and input functions</title>
<p>The reactions in the model were divided into three non-overlapping groups: i) enzymatic reactions, ii) reversible reactions and iii) irreversible reactions, which include transport reactions.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003445.e007"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003445.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>In all cases, the reaction rate was expressed according to the law of mass action. No steady-state approximation was used for any species. The resulting system of ODEs was set and solved deterministically with the ode15s solver in the SimBiology environment, a MatLab toolbox. Values of rate constants were taken from the literature whenever possible, either directly (mainly k<sub>cat</sub> for enzymatic reactions) or constrained by published dissociation constants for binding reactions (K<sub>d</sub> = k<sub>r</sub>/k<sub>f</sub>) and Michaelis constants (K<sub>M</sub> = (k<sub>cat</sub>+k<sub>r</sub>)/k<sub>f</sub>, k<sub>r</sub> = 4•k<sub>cat</sub>) for enzymatic reactions. However, very little data of this kind is found in the literature and then the quantitative molecular phenotypes are the most important source of constrains for some critical rate constants. Most of the rate constants, either first order (s<sup>−1</sup>) or second order (uM<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), are in the range 10<sup>−3</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> in the model. The lower bound of this range was further reduced in highly lumped sections of the model, like the ERK-DUSP negative feedback where transport to the nucleus, transcription and translation are lumped. Similarly, the total amounts of the species in the network were taken from the literature whenever possible (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s007">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>For the simulation of APA phenotypes, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is modeled as random Poisson spike train with a rate of 0.1 s<sup>−1</sup> and the psychostimulant-induced dopamine as a transient increase in this neuromodulator.

<p>The simulated time course of GluR1 and ERK activation upon APA was noisy due to the random Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike train and the mean of replicated runs converged to the simulated time course obtained with a train of regularly spaced Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes with the same frequency (0.1 s<sup>−1</sup>).

<p>The time constants of the dopamine transient are a consensus of different measurements of psychostimulant induced DA overflow in the striatum : C<sup>11</sup>-cocaine levels in the brain after i.v. administration in humans, the DA mediated psychostimulant effects follows the same kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Volkow1">[89]</xref>; nomifensine-evoked DA measured by FSCV (Fast Scanning Cyclic Voltammetry)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Borland1">[90]</xref> and amplitude of electrically evoked DA by FSCV after cocaine administration. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003445.e008">Eq.7</xref> fit these three experimental datasets with r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.96 in all cases.

<p>Considerable system insights can be retrieved by analyzing how the output (corresponding to different phenotypic variables) depends on the model parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Hlavacek1">[92]</xref>.

It has for example been observed that biological models tend to have a “sloppy” spectra of parameter sensitivities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Gutenkunst1">[96]</xref>, meaning that there are many parameters that has minor or no effect on the model output when perturbed slightly.

The comparison between subgroups of sensitive parameters was done by considering all pairs of phenotypic variables. For each pair we calculated the overlap between the respective sensitive parameters, i.e. the number of sensitive parameters that the two phenotypic variables have in common. This was next divided by the number of sensitive parameters in the larger of the two subgroups to get a relative measure. This means that totally overlapping groups have an overlapping measure of one, whereas non-overlapping groups get zero.</p>
<p>Even though during the modelling process the enzymatic reactions was modelled directly with mass action kinetics with no steady-state assumption (using forward and backward rate constants k<sub>f</sub>, k<sub>r</sub> and catalytic efficiency k<sub>cat</sub>) for the sensitivity analysis only k<sub>cat</sub> and Michaelis constant K<sub>M</sub> were considered. This was motivated from the realization that for enzymatic reactions, k<sub>f</sub> and k<sub>r</sub> could be changed considerably, but as long as the relation was kept so that K<sub>M</sub> ( = (k<sub>r</sub>+k<sub>cat</sub>)/k<sub>f</sub>) was not changed this had no effect on the model fitting (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). K<sub>M</sub> was perturbed through k<sub>f</sub> (i.e. a perturbation of k<sub>f</sub> with the factor (1±0.005)<sup>−1</sup>) and when k<sub>cat</sub> was perturbed we introduced a balancing change in k<sub>f</sub> and k<sub>r</sub> to keep K<sub>M</sub> constant so that the relevance of k<sub>cat</sub> were probed independent of its contribution to K<sub>M</sub> (i.e. when perturbing k<sub>cat</sub> with a factor 1±0.005, k<sub>f</sub> and k<sub>r</sub> were also both perturbed with the same factor).</p>
<p>Overall, each of the 316 parameters (all 276 kinetic rate constants, as well as the total amounts of all 40 species) was varied one-at-a-time and each of the 17 different phenotypic variables was recorded.</p>

<p>The validity of this simple correction is illustrated through the correspondence between the estimated fold-change for D32p34 in the DAsliceD32 phenotype (11×) and the value measured experimentally with a novel cell-type specific technique (12×) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Bateup1">[6]</xref>. This is relevant because the capacity to sequester PP1 is doubled, thus generating a larger boost to PKA-mediated phosphorylation. However, while this procedure alleviates the underestimation of fold changes characteristic of immunoblot measurements of cell-type specific events in heterogeneous samples, the reported data seldom have all the elements required for the estimation. For example, an important part of the experiments with mutant mice lacks immunohistochemistry analysis so that estimations are not possible in a simple way. Thus, when comparing the activation of relevant effectors upon APA in mutant versus wild type mice, the ratio of changes in the APA relative to saline was used.</p>

<p>The remaining non-APA phenotype, <italic>sensitizedNMDAR</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref>, was reproduced qualitatively by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The model shows that a fast rise in dopamine concentration does produce a sudden sensitization of the NMDAR response as measured by the increase of the scaling factor of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level. This results in the left-shift of the dose-response curve for ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In the model, this increase in the scaling factor operates on a simulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation that reproduces the one described in experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g003">Fig. 3A1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref> making it more effective activating ERK. Comparing the three mechanisms of DA/D1R triggered enhancement of NMDAR-Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, the sensitization was seen for single channel enhancement triggered by tyrosine phosphorylation and not for PKA-mediated single channel or Fyn-mediated traffic-based enhancements as these two were too slow to match the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g003">Fig. 3A1 and A2</xref>). Similar to what is seen in the experimental data, the dose-response curves for measurements at 8 minutes show a non-monotonic behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref>. The maximum ERK activation at different Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes shows a typical monotonic behavior, but the higher the level of the maximum the faster the decay and then the time courses intersect and produce the non-monotonic at longer times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g003">Fig. 3B and 3C</xref>). The removal of the negative-feedback loop (DUSP-mediated) partially uncouples maximum ERK activation levels from faster decays thus displacing the intersection of time courses curved toward longer times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The model also qualitatively reproduced another result obtained in cultures of striatal neurons treated with high concentration of glutamate (100 uM), this is, the inhibition of PP2B with Cyclosporin A increased the level of phosphorylated STEP and reduced the activation of ERK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s003">Fig. S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Paul2">[83]</xref>.</p>

<title>The acute psychostimulant administration paradigm. Input signals and monitored effectors</title>
<p>The psychostimulant induced dopamine increase in the striatum was modeled according to experimental measurements.

<p>Then, the model was challenged with the DA increase generated by APA together with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike train whose basal amplitude of 500 nM was scaled up with each of the three modeled mechanisms of DA-triggered NMDAR function enhancement: single channel enhancement through serine/threonine phosphorylation by PKA or tyrosine phosphorylation by Src-like kinases, and Fyn-mediated traffic based enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The traffic-based mechanism matches very closely what has been measured experimentally in immunoblots from APA-treated mice (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.87) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) but the two single channel mechanisms reach maximum ERK activation far earlier than what has been reported experimentally with this technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent2">[12]</xref>. Importantly, both dopamine increase and NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry are required for the activation of ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>), reproducing previous findings of ERK as an AND gate which is opened (activated) upon APA by the convergence of both inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent2">[12]</xref>.

<title>Phosphorylation of GluR1 and ERK upon APA in the D1R/Golf compartments model. Probing PKA-sensitive STEP-mediated crosstalking schemes</title>
<p>The haploinsufficiency of D1R and Gαolf and the effects of D32 knock-out on the psychostimulant induced phosphorylation of GluR1 and ERK has been studied experimentally with quantitative detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Corvol1">[20]</xref>. In order to explain the opposing patterns of activation of GluR1 and ERK in haploinsufficient mice for D1R and Gαolf, we have assumed that the total pool of these elements is distributed in two compartments for D1R/Golf mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) with the amount of Golf (heterotrimer) equal to the amount of Gαolf. One of these compartments is associated with the production of cAMP via AC5 and the other with the Fyn-mediated increase of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. The distribution of the total amounts of D1R and Golf in each of these compartments depends on anchors that differ in affinity and capacity for D1R and Gαolf. Haploinsufficiency was simulated by reducing the total amount of D1R or Gαolf to the fraction reported experimentally (0.2 and 0.4 respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Corvol1">[20]</xref>), then equilibrating the system and finally running the simulation of the APA paradigm.

All these crosstalking schemes were successful reproducing the non-APA phenotypes and the APA induced transient activation of ERK and GluR1 in the wild type. They also reproduced changes in GluR1 phosphorylation for the mutants. However, there were clear differences between them in the activation level of ERK in the mutants and just the scheme with a single STEP pool mediating the PKA-sensitive crosstalk just at the level of ERK (010) was able to reproduce all mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).

<p>In the case of <italic>Drd1a</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, the amount of D1R in the AC5 compartment was at wild type levels but the amount in the NMDAR compartment was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Upon simulated APA, model versions with PKA-sensitive crosstalk via STEP at Fyn and NMDAR (1**) did not show reductions in ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). This crosstalking scheme is the one where just the non-phosphorylated form of STEP is active against Fyn and NMDAR (i.e. edges 5 and 7 but not 6 and 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

Upon simulated APA, there was a reduction in GluR1 phosphorylation in all schemes but this reduced flow in the AC5 axis affected the activation of ERK in all schemes with crosstalk at the level of ERK (*1*) (i.e. edges 1 and/or 3 but not 2 and/or 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>) except the one with a single STEP pool (010) (i.e. edges 15678 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). The schemes with no crosstalk at all (00*) (i.e. all forms of STEP are equally active on each substrate) and with crosstalk just at Fyn and NMDAR (10*) did not show reduction in ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). For the remaining mutant, D32KO, where the phosphorylation of both GluR1 and ERK has been reported to be significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>) the schemes with crosstalk at ERK (*1*) reproduced the reduction in ERK activation, while the rest were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>All the results presented so far can also be reproduced with an alternative version of the model where some assumptions were varied in order to meet some reported values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). Considering that there are at least 25 GPCR in D1R+MSN which are annotated to signal via Gs, as estimated from the IUPHAR receptor database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Alexander2">[99]</xref> and a D1R+MSN transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Heiman1">[100]</xref>, it seems likely that Golf and possibly also D1R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Lee3">[101]</xref> are coupled to other signaling partners as well. Thus, in this alternative version of the model it was explicitly introduced a third compartment.

<p>The rate constants and the total amount of model species (conserved moieties) in the updated model (two D1R/Golf compartments and crosstalking scheme 010) were perturbed ±0.5% and for each perturbation the value of the 17 phenotypic variables was recorded.</p>
<p>The distribution of the maximum value of the sensitivity to each parameter across all phenotypic variables appeared multimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Considering the median of this distribution (0.26) as the demarcation between insensitive and sensitive parameters, it was clear that each phenotypic variable was sensitive to a varying number of parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). The activation of ERK in <italic>Drd1a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice upon APA was the most sensitive phenotypic variable with twice as many parameters with a large influence on the phenotype as the next in rank. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of GluR1 in the same conditions was not sensitive to any parameter. The phenotypic variables were compared pairwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>) to evaluate the extent of overlap of sensitive parameters. The fraction of sensitive parameters that phenotypic variable pairs had in common covered all the range from 0 to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). There were several pairs of phenotypic variables with no sensitive parameters in common (e.g. trafficNMDAR-k and DAslice-D32p34) and a few pairs where the sensitive parameters of one of the phenotypic variables could all be found among the sensitive parameters of the other phenotypic variable (e.g. D32KO-GluR1 and D32KO-ERKpp). Thus, as described for quantitative signaling models for other cell types and signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Chen1">[95]</xref>, the parameter sensitivity profile depends on which phenotypic variable that are observed. As an example of this, phenotypic variables referring to the same marker (e.g. ERK) measured for different mutants have significantly different number and identity of sensitive parameters. In particular, we have yet to explore the origin of hypersensitivity of the activation of ERK in <italic>Drd1a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice upon APA (haploD1R-ERKpp).</p>

<p>Considering the detailed sensitivity profile of the parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>), total amounts (conserved moieties) are significantly enriched in the first 60 most globally sensitive parameters (50%, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>). The total amount of AC5 and the k<sub>cat</sub> of its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free, Golf activated form are the two most sensitive parameters, being around 25% higher than the following in the rank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). These two parameters as well as many others within the 60 most sensitive parameters are mostly related to generation and degradation of cAMP, in correspondence with the widespread effects of this second messenger in the modeled network.</p>
<p>In accordance with earlier studies of parameter sensitivities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Gutenkunst1">[96]</xref> we also find that a large part of the parameters have only a minute effect on the output.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we have developed a quantitative signaling model for striatal D1R+MSN comprising two inputs, dopamine and glutamate, operating through D1R and NMDAR receptors and regulating the activation of GluR1 and ERK. The model is constrained by a relatively large amount of phenotypic data. Furthermore, this model provides a mechanistic explanation for patterns in the data which have not been interpreted so far.</p>

<title>ERK as an AND gate</title>
<p>Neither the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike train alone nor the psychostimulant induced dopamine in the absence of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes are able to activate ERK in the simulations. This matches the experimental observations of ERK as an AND gate which is opened (activated) upon APA by the convergence of glutamatergic <italic>AND</italic> dopaminergic inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Girault1">[104]</xref>. The D1R-triggered signaling operates on both ends of the MAPK cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref>. Upstream, D1R activation triggers the enhancement of NMDAR mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. In the simulations, just the D1R-triggered traffic-based mechanism of NMDAR enhancement generates a time course of APA-induced ERK activation that matches the immunoblot-based observations. The single-channel mechanisms operate too fast. A faster APA-induced ERK activation has been measured by immunohistochemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-BertranGonzalez1">[8]</xref> which is more in line with the single-channel mechanism. However, the activation is expressed as the percentage of positive cells and this will clearly produce a faster kinetics than immunoblots as the latter track total levels of active ERK. On the other hand, in vivo measurements with Ca<sup>+2</sup> indicators in D1R+MSNs upon APA have shown an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels that matches the time scale of the slow traffic-based mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003445-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Luo1">[105]</xref>. Thus, the fast D1R-triggered sensitization of NMDAR to glutamate seen for MSNs in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref> may not be the one underlying the transient activation of ERK upon APA.</p>
<p>If a slow acting mechanism of ERK activation underlies the development of conditioned place preference, this may impose a minimum required residence time of the animal in the drug-paired site just after the injection for the correct association to be established. In this regard, it is worth noting that previous models of signaling triggered by convergent glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs on D1R+MSN have failed to reproduce the effective time windows between conditioning stimulus and reward in reinforcement learning paradigms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Lindskog1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>ERK has been reported to be activated in cultures of striatal neurons treated only with a D1R agonist (SKF81297) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Fiorentini1">[106]</xref>. This effect was sensitive to PKA and Src inhibition and involves the tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 which forms a complex with D1R. However, the activation level of ERK achieved with D1R agonist alone is significantly lower than the level obtained in co-treatment with NMDAR agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref> in similar cultures which in turns operates in a cAMP-independent way but also relies on a Src-like kinase Fyn. We did not include in our model this NMDAR-independent activation of ERK by D1R agonists because still little is known about the mechanism of this interesting possibility which was suggested by the authors to be location dependent in the striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Fiorentini1">[106]</xref>. Furthermore, its contribution to ERK activation is partial and the potential role of background glutamate has not been probed with, for example, NMDAR antagonists. On the other hand, the cAMP-independence of ERK activation upon co-stimulation with D1R and NMDAR in these cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref> seems contradictory under the light of the conclusions of this paper. However, the phosphorylation level of STEP in these cultures in basal conditions is rather high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Paul2">[83]</xref> so that D1R stimulation has little room to operate through this locus and is then mostly confined to the sensitization of glutamatergic input through NMDAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pascoli1">[19]</xref>.</p>

<title>Parameter sensitivities</title>

<title>The distribution of D1R/Golf in two signaling compartments explains the segregation of effects in D1R and Gαolf haploinsufficient mice</title>
<p>The model with a single D1R/Golf signaling compartment reproduces the non-APA phenotypes as well as the APA paradigm time course data (APAib phenotype) in wild type animals. However, despite several fitting attempts this model fails to explain the opposed sensitivities of GluR1 and ERK phosphorylation under the APA paradigm to reductions in the total amounts of D1R and Gαolf seen in haploinsufficient animals. This pattern is in turn explained by assuming the existence of two D1R/Golf signaling compartments, one coupled to cAMP production by AC5 and the other to the enhancement of NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents with both connected through a non-signaling pool. The compartmentalization of GPCR/G-protein signaling has been suggested before for explaining diverse experimental observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Brinkerhoff1">[107]</xref>. In the case discussed here, this compartmentalization is a necessary but insufficient condition. It should be complemented with a differential affinity and capacity of the anchors in each compartment for D1R and Gαolf. That is, while D1R is strongly bound to the AC5 compartment it is loosely attached to the NMDAR compartment and the opposite holds for Golf. In this way it is explained that a decrease in the total amount of D1R preferentially affects the amount of D1R in the NMDAR compartment while reductions in Gαolf preferentially affect the content Golf in the AC5 compartment. The sensitivity of the cAMP signaling to reductions of 60% in Golf but not of 80% in D1R total amounts is puzzling since it has been measured that the amount of Golf in MSNs is more than 10X higher that D1R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Herv1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Cumming1">[85]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Schwindinger1">[102]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Zalduegui1">[103]</xref>. Similarly curious is that in Parkinsonian patients and animal models of Parkinson disease, Golf is upregulated while D1R is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Alcacer1">[108]</xref>. These estimates lack spatial resolution so that it is not known which fraction of both D1R and Golf is present in the plasma membrane. We used similar total amounts of D1R and Golf in this model because even if this 10X ratio were kept in the plasma membrane, a significant portion of Gαolf may be pre-coupled to several other Gs-coupled GPCR provided that D1R+MSN have negligible amounts of Gαs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Herv2">[18]</xref>. Thus, it is significant that the conclusions of this work were the same with an alternative version of the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s005">Fig. S5</xref>) where i) the existence of D1R and Golf coupled to other signaling partners is considered explicitly with the introduction of a third compartment, ii) the total Golf is 10 times the total D1R and iii) the level of D1R in <italic>Drd1a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> is 40% that of the WT.</p>
<p>The nature of the AC5-linked compartment is possibly a cholesterol rich membrane domain containing caveolin-1, a cholesterol binding protein known to interact with D1R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Kong1">[29]</xref> and expressed in striatal MSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Trushina1">[30]</xref>. AC5 has been found to be enriched in lipid rafts in several systems and it also interacts with caveolin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Beazely1">[109]</xref>. The NMDAR-linked compartment is possibly located in the postsynaptic density (PSD) or its vicinity. D1R has a direct physical interaction with NR1 and NR2A subunits of NMDAR which is located preferentially in the post-synaptic density (PSD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Lee2">[31]</xref>. This interaction have been found to be functional in MSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Lee2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Zhang1">[32]</xref> and this location is a potential candidate for the D1R-mediated sensitization of NMDAR to glutamate. D1R has been also found to interact with PSD-95 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Bjrk1">[110]</xref>. Importantly, evidence of D1R distribution in these two compartments has been found in prefrontal cortex neurons, which like the striatum receive midbrain dopaminergic innervation. In these cells, D1R was found enriched in the detergent-resistant membrane fraction usually associated to lipid rafts and also in the dense fraction associated with PSD proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Voulalas1">[28]</xref>. The identity of the anchors of G-proteins in general and Gαolf in particular to each compartment is less clear. There are several reports of GPCR coupled to different signaling cascades depending on the compartmentalization of the receptor within a cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Chini1">[111]</xref>. For example, in HEK293 cells it was found that A2aR in lipid rafts were associated to adenylyl cyclase activation while A2aR outside the rafts were linked to ERK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Charalambous1">[112]</xref>. The effect of reducing the total amounts of the receptor on the signaling strength of <italic>each</italic> signaling cascade in these systems has not been studied.</p>
<p>While the evidence makes plausible the segregation of the D1R/Golf pair into two compartments, there are other alternatives especially for the coupling of Golf to the D1R in the NMDAR compartment. PKC has been found by some to be mediating the DA-induced enhancement of NMDAR currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Chergui1">[113]</xref>. This enzyme can be activated via Gq by D1R-D2R heteromers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Lee3">[101]</xref> which have been found to be functional in the striatum albeit just in a reduced fraction of MSNs of adult mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-BertranGonzalez1">[8]</xref>. There are also reports of some D1R-like agonists (e.g. SKF83959) activating Gq signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Undieh1">[114]</xref>.</p>

<title>Are the effects of PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of STEP substrate-dependent?</title>
<p>In the face of unidirectional crosstalk from the AC5 axis to the NMDAR axis, it is reasonable to expect a transmission of the sensitivity to reductions in the total amount of Gαolf from the AC5 axis to effectors in the NMDAR axis like ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Endres1">[27]</xref>. In fact, the knock-out of D32, or its T34A mutation, decreases the phosphorylation of both GluR1 and ERK upon APA showing that an insufficient increase in the PKA/PP1 activity ratio upon dopaminergic signaling do have a negative impact on ERK phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent2">[12]</xref>. However, as mentioned before, a strong segregation of the effects of D1R and Gαolf haploinsufficiency on the phosphorylation of GluR1 and ERK has been observed experimentally. How can the PKA-sensitive crosstalk via STEP accommodate these apparently contradicting experimental observations?</p>
<p>The premise for the crosstalk is that just the non-phosphorylated form of STEP is able to act on the targets in the NMDAR axis. If both the phosphorylated (STEPp) and non-phosphorylated forms of STEP are catalytically equivalent toward a given target there is no crosstalk because changes in the PKA/PP1 activity ratio upon dopaminergic action have no effect on overall STEP activity toward this target. While the evidence of STEP phosphorylation by PKA upon dopaminergic stimulation is abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Valjent2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-BlancoAparicio1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Paul1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Sun3">[115]</xref>, there is no direct experimental evidence of the effects of this modification on the tyrosine phosphatase activity of STEPp toward each of its three targets in the NMDAR axis: Fyn, NR2B and ERK. First, STEPp has been found to have a two-fold increase of Km toward a model substrate, myelin basic protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Paul1">[53]</xref>, but its activity on these targets has not been measured in biochemical experiments. For ERK as substrate, it has been found that STEP dephosphorylates it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Pulido1">[116]</xref> but the evidence of STEPp inactivity comes from homologous tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL and HePTP that upon phosphorylation by PKA in the KIM domain lose almost all activity against ERK and/or the ERK homologous p38a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-BlancoAparicio1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Saxena1">[25]</xref>. The dephosphorylation of STEPp by PP1 is also an extrapolation from this homologous phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Nika1">[82]</xref>. For Fyn it was found that its interaction with STEP is lost if the KIM domain is removed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Nguyen1">[76]</xref>, but the activity of STEPp toward this substrate has not been measured. Finally, for NR2B far less is known about the activity of STEPp towards its intrinsically disordered cytoplasmatic tail where Y1472 lies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Choi1">[117]</xref>. Another issue of relevance is whether or not the STEP/STEPp operating on different substrates belongs to the same or different STEP pools. Sequestration effects seem to be pervasive in biochemical systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Alexander1">[84]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-DellVecchio1">[118]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Jiang1">[119]</xref> and if the phosphatase operating on different substrates comes from a single pool, its sequestration by one substrate in the Michaelis-Menten complex would reduce the dephosphorylation pressure on the others. It has been found that substrates of ERK control the activity of this kinase against other substrates through a sequestration-based retroactive mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Kim1">[120]</xref>. At least two variants of catalytically competent STEP have been detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Paul1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>Clearly, the PKA-sensitive STEP-mediated crosstalking scheme is still an open question and the reproduction of this non-trivial data pattern, i.e. segregation despite crosstalk, is an interesting challenge. The fitting of the model with different crosstalking schemes provided some insights and <italic>one</italic> possible solution to this conundrum. After several attempts to fit the model with each of these 8 crosstalking schemes, the scheme with a single STEP pool mediating a crosstalk just at the ERK node was successfully fitted.</p>
<p>With the parameters from the fitting of the model with the 010 scheme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003445.s007">Table S2</xref>), the model with each of the other 7 schemes was run and the fitting recorded in order to gain insight about their failure. Each of these 7 schemes failed to reproduce at least one of the APA induced ERK activation phenotypes in the mutant mice:</p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item>
<p>In the absence of crosstalk at any level disregarding the number of STEP pools (00*), the model reproduced the segregation but then D32KO had no impact on ERK activation because there is no information flow from the AC5 axis to the NMDAR axis.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>With crosstalk at the level of Fyn&amp;NR2B irrespective of the status at ERK and the number of STEP pools (1**), D1R haploinsufficiency did not affect the activation of ERK because the deficit in D1R/Golf mediated activation of <email xlink:type="simple">Fyn-p@527</email> is balanced by the inactivation of STEP through PKA mediated phosphorylation.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>With crosstalk just at the level of ERK but 2 STEP pools (011), the segregation is affected as the activation of ERK in <italic>Gnal<sup>+/−</sup></italic> is reduced in the same extent than GluR1 phosphorylation. This contrasts with the effectiveness of a single STEP pool in the 010 scheme. A single STEP pool is a pre-requisite for the sequestration of STEP by ERKpp to alleviate the tonic inhibition that STEP and STEPp has on NMDAR currents thus compensating the reduction in the inhibition of STEP by PKA taking place in <italic>Gnal<sup>+/−</sup></italic> upon APA. In fact, the effectiveness of 010 is lost with a 10 fold increase in the K<sub>M</sub> of STEP on ERKpp, which implies a reduction in complex formation between STEP and ERKpp and thus in the extent of the sequestration. This effect was not due to a reduction in enzymatic activity because we kept the k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> ratio constant by increasing the k<sub>cat</sub>.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>From this we predict that the effect of the phosphorylation of STEP by PKA on its activity is substrate-dependent with only little changes for Fyn and NR2B and significant inhibition for ERK. Furthermore, the STEP/STEPp operating on the three nodes of the NMDAR axis comes from a single pool, as this enables a sequestration or retroactive compensatory mechanism that operates as a positive feedback loop. This alleviates the coupling between the axes so that the segregation of the effects of D1R and Golf haploinsufficiency is kept despite the existence of cr osstalk. The claim that the PKA-phosphorylated form of STEP is inactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Fitzpatrick1">[26]</xref>, is based on the observations of homologous enzymes like PTP-SL and HePTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-BlancoAparicio1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003445-Saxena1">[25]</xref> with ERK as substrate. The validity of this extrapolation requires further analysis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, with a model for the dynamics of the intracellular signaling triggered by dopamine and glutamate, which integrates a relatively high amount of quantitative data, we have been able to provide a rationale for some previously unexplained experimental results. Two critical assumptions were required: i) the existence of at least two D1R/Golf signaling compartments each of them coupled to a different cascade and ii) that the multiple STEP-mediated interactions between these cascades are differentially affected by the PKA phosphorylation of this phosphatase. The existence of compartmentalized upstream signaling modules coupled to different signaling axes with segregated functional implications opens up the possibility of designing drugs targeting these elements in a compartment specific fashion. A clear requirement for this strategy is that the pharmacological profile of the receptor differs between compartments which might be plausible provided the differing composition of each of them.</p>
