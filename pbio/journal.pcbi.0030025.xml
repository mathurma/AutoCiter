				<article-title>Correction: Specificity and Evolvability in Eukaryotic Protein Interaction Networks</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract><p>Progress in uncovering the protein interaction networks of several species has led to questions of what underlying principles might govern their organization. Few studies have tried to determine the impact of protein interaction network evolution on the observed physiological differences between species. Using comparative genomics and structural information, we show here that eukaryotic species have rewired their interactomes at a fast rate of approximately 10<sup>−5</sup> interactions changed per protein pair, per million years of divergence. For <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Homo sapiens</named-content> this corresponds to 10<sup>3</sup> interactions changed per million years. Additionally we find that the specificity of binding strongly determines the interaction turnover and that different biological processes show significantly different link dynamics. In particular, human proteins involved in immune response, transport, and establishment of localization show signs of positive selection for change of interactions. Our analysis suggests that a small degree of molecular divergence can give rise to important changes at the network level. We propose that the power law distribution observed in protein interaction networks could be partly explained by the cell's requirement for different degrees of protein binding specificity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>To understand how the cell performs the required biological functions and reacts to changes in the environment, scientists have been studying how cellular components interact. In recent years, new experimental methods have immensely increased our ability to map out these connections. However, it is important to keep in mind that biological systems are constantly evolving to cope with environmental changes. What then is the impact of the genomic variability brought by point mutations, segmental duplications, etc., on these interaction networks? We have tried here to quantify the rate by which protein interactions changed during the evolution of eukaryotic cells. According to the authors, about 0.5% to 3% of the interactions can change every million years. Also, protein properties, such as binding specificity (defined as the number of binding surfaces or binding partners) and protein function, help determine the rate of interaction turnover. This work suggests that protein interactions are evolutionarily plastic and the fact that a group of proteins has been conserved in different genomes does not mean that their interaction repertoire and functions are necessarily conserved. This work emphasizes the importance of studying biological systems in the context of evolutionary change.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Beltrao P, Serrano L (2007) Specificity and evolvability in eukaryotic protein interaction networks.

The massive data produced by sequencing efforts has allowed for comparison of different genomes, giving us much more information about their organization and evolution than what would be possible by the analysis of individual genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b021">21</xref>]. By analogy, to obtain a similar insight into the structure and evolution of interactomes, different protein networks would need to be compared, a procedure one could call “comparative interactomics.” This could be achieved by studying the conserved interactions between groups of ortholog proteins in different species, defined as interologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b023">23</xref>]. Recent attempts to compare protein interactions networks of different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b025">25</xref>] suggested that, at the moment, the current data are poorly suited for direct comparison; the overlap between datasets is small and this is most likely due to insufficient data quantity and quality. An alternative approach has been to look for conservation of network modules between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b027">27</xref>]. This has lead to the development of several network alignment tools and has largely been more successful at finding conserved interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b028">28</xref>].</p><p>These studies have not, however, taken into account the large evolutionary distance separating the species under study. In fact, the four eukaryotic species for which we currently have the most interaction data (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Homo sapiens</named-content>) shared a common ancestor more than 900 million years (My) ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b029">29</xref>]. This raises the intriguing hypothesis that this evolutionary distance is too large for these species to have retained many similarities in their interaction networks. In fact, the relative success of the network alignment approaches hints that evolutionary pressures do not constrain the exact cellular interactions, but instead constrain the required functional complexes that emerge. Hence, the lack of overlap would correspond in part to divergence and not merely to poor coverage.</p><p>Even without the ability to compare interactomes directly, one could try to obtain estimates for the rate of change in interactomes by mining existing data with comparative genomics. Previously, Wagner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b030">30</xref>] used paralogous protein pairs from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> to estimate that 2 × 10<sup>−6</sup> new interactions are added to the yeast interactome per protein pair per My, suggesting that, on average, about 50 to 100 new interactions have arisen every 1 My. The method relied on very few interactions between paralogous protein pairs, making it impossible to dissect the different contributions to the average value. Also, in the last three years, we have more data available from a greater number of species, allowing us to compare how interactomes have changed in more recent evolutionary time and to draw more general conclusions about these processes.</p><p>We have attempted to evaluate the rate of change of interactions in the interactomes of several eukaryotic species (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>, <italic>H. sapiens,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>). We have determined that, in all species tested, interactions change at a rate on the order of 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> interactions per protein pair per My. The approach used allowed us to explore different protein properties influencing interaction turnover. We have observed that specificity in protein binding and protein function can determine link dynamics during the evolution of cellular networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Recently Duplicated Proteins of Eukaryotic Species Have a Fast Rate of Interaction Change</title><p>To calculate the rate of interaction change, we have established for each protein, in all species studied here, an approximate age of origin, according to the presence or absence of an identifiable ortholog in several other reference species (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We assumed that any interaction observed today with a recently duplicated protein was either inherited in the process of duplication or created after the process of gene duplication. It has been estimated that for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> the fraction of gene duplicates with at least one shared interaction is below 20% after 50 My [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b013">13</xref>]. For each species, we calculated the fraction of interactions that were also observed with the closest homolog of the recently duplicated protein. Within the time frame studied (20 to 100 My), the fraction of observed conserved interactions after gene duplication was low (1% to 20%, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030025-t001">Tables 1</xref> and S1). Eliminating the interactions likely inherited by duplication, we were left with protein interactions that were either gained in the copy we are considering or they were inherited by duplication and subsequently lost in the homolog. Either of these cases represents an event of interaction change that occurred after gene duplication, and we can thus calculate the rate at which interactions change (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This rate for all species was approximately on the order of 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> interactions changed per protein pair per My (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030025-t001">Table 1</xref>) and ranged from 5.36 × 10<sup>−6</sup> in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">H. sapiens</named-content> to 2.45 × 10<sup>−5</sup> in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisia</named-content>e.

To study the impact of coverage on the values mentioned above, we have mimicked the effect of lowering the coverage of the current datasets by randomly sampling the interactomes in two ways: randomly removing protein interactions or randomly removing proteins (and their interactions).</p><p>The percentage of inherited interactions increased with increasing coverage; approximately linearly in the case of random node removal and nonlinearly in the case of random protein removal (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030025-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, the percentage of inherited interactions is a measure that depends on the size of the network and is therefore likely to change as more data is added.</p><p>The rate of change of interactions, on the other hand, appears to be independent of network size. There was no significant change in the rate in the case of random removal of proteins. In the case of random removal of interactions, only when more than 80% of the interactions were removed was there a significant increase of the rate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030025-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). It is important to note that the trend points to a stabilization of the value, indicating that further increases in coverage will not likely change it. We deduce from this result that the rate of change of interactions is a measure that is mostly independent of network size and can be used to study the evolution of protein interaction networks.</p><p>To test the robustness of our method for variations in accuracy of the data, the human interactome was separated into three subsets, as defined in the Human Protein Reference Database: (1) yeast two-hybrid (including the two recent high-throughput studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b004">4</xref>]); (2) in vitro studies, such as GST pull-down; and (3) in vivo studies, such as co-immunoprecipitation. The in vivo and in vitro subsets contain only literature-derived interactions and should therefore be of higher accuracy. The rate of change of interactions for these three datasets was 1.09 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, 7.23 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, and 7.12 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030025-st001">Table S1</xref>). The calculated rate using the high accuracy datasets was very similar to the values from the human yeast two-hybrid data and the data from the other species. We conclude that the order of magnitude reported is a good approximation for the rate of change of eukaryotic protein interactions networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Rate of Change of Interactions Correlates with the Number of Binding Partners of a Protein in All Eukaryotic Species Studied</title><p>Topological analysis of protein interaction networks has shown previously that the distribution of the number of interactions follows a power law, such that the frequency of proteins with n interactions falls off as n<sup>−α</sup> (where alpha is the exponent of the power law) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b015">15</xref>]. It has been proposed that the observed power law distributions could arise by network growth and preferential attachment, where newly created nodes would preferentially link to already highly connected nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b031">31</xref>]. Two independent studies have shown, for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, preferential attachment in the protein interaction network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b030">30</xref>], supporting the model proposed for the emergence of the power law distribution (at least in the case of protein interaction networks).</p><p>We asked if there was also a correlation between the number of partners of a protein and the rate of change of its interactions. Given that the rate of change was calculated as the number of changed interactions per protein pair per My, no bias was expected for proteins having different degrees of connectivity. Using the data for different species, we observed a linear correlation between the number of binding partners and the link turnover for all species studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030025-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The correlation in all cases is strong with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.94 for <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> 0.97 for <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> 0.96 for <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and 0.93 for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">H. sapiens</named-content>.

Wagner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b030">30</xref>] suggested that there is no need to invoke natural selection to explain the network topology, since the local preferential attachment and network growth observed in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> interactome suffice to create power law networks. We showed above that preferential turnover is a property of the protein interactions networks of all species studied, but what might determine this behavior at a molecular level?</p><p>It is known that interfaces of transient protein–protein interactions are less restricted in evolution than the binding surfaces of permanent complexes. Also, interacting residues of transient complexes are less likely to co-evolve than interaction residues of permanent complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b033">33</xref>]. It is plausible that different types of interactions have different likelihoods of changing their interactions over a given evolutionary period. To test this in an unbiased fashion, we first aimed to determine the protein domains that contribute more to the fast rate of change. We considered only domains that conferred a rate of change to a group of proteins that was larger than average in at least three of the four species studied (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). All of the domains selected by this criteria (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030025-t002">Table 2</xref>) are currently known to mediate protein–protein interactions. Interestingly, five of the eight domains are known to form domain–peptide interactions, as opposed to domain–domain interactions, suggesting that proteins containing peptide-binding domains are more likely to change their interactions faster over the same evolutionary time than other types of domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b034">34</xref>].</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0030025-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030025.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Domains Found to Contribute to the Fast Rate of Change of Interactions in at Least Three of the Four Species Studied</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030025.t002" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb2col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Domain Name</td><td><hr/>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BTB/POZ</td><td>The BTB (for BR-C, ttk, and bab) or POZ (for Pox virus and Zinc finger) domain mediates homodimerisation and in some instances heterodimerisation</td></tr><tr><td>Band 4.1</td><td>(Contains Pleckstrin homology-type and FERM domains).

Here, we define a “specific protein” as one that has few ligands and few interaction surfaces, while an “unspecific protein” is one that has many potential ligands and/or many different interaction surfaces. Therefore, promiscuous protein-binding domains are those that have been observed in close physical contact with a high number of other types of domains.

In fact, in the 30 years following, a considerable amount of evidence has surfaced to support this view (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b040">40</xref>]). However, as we have shown above, it is quite possible that in the time since the divergence of these two species, a significant change in protein interactions could have taken place, and, therefore, changes in protein interaction networks can have a similar important role in species evolution.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Calculation of the Rate of Change and Potential Caveats</title><p>Extending on the work of Wagner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b030">30</xref>] for <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> we have shown here that the interactomes of several eukaryotic species have high rates of change of their interactions. According to our calculations, 100 to 1,000 interactions might change every My in eukaryotic interactomes. Estimating that in the current interactomes proteins have on average four to ten interactions, then the link turnover would change 0.5% to 3% of the interactions every My. This estimate clearly points to an important effect of link dynamics in the evolution of cellular interactions.</p><p>Some caveats to our estimated rate should be noted. Namely, we have focused our attention on the evolution of protein interactions of single gene duplicates. The effects of single gene duplication could be considerably different from large segment or whole-genome duplication events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b041">41</xref>]. If a protein that is part of a complex duplicates, the changes in gene dosage might unbalance the complex stoichiometry and cause a reduction in fitness to the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b042">42</xref>]. On the contrary, if the whole complex is duplicated, as would occur in a full-genome duplication event, the balance between the complex components would be maintained. We can speculate that a single-gene duplicate might have a stronger pressure to diverge in its interactions to avoid a gene imbalance effect, when compared with proteins originated from a full-complex duplication. However, it is also known that living systems have mechanisms to guarantee the right expression level when dealing with important complexes. A good example is the case of tubulin where the stability of the mRNA depends on the existence of unpaired α or β subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b043">43</xref>]. In fact, it is almost impossible to keep the right stoichiometry in a complex simply due to noise fluctuations, unless there are mechanisms that control possible imbalances. Thus, although it is intuitive that whole-genome duplication could exert less pressure for divergence, this does not necessarily need to be true.</p><p>Also, it has been proposed that duplicate genes pass through a period of relaxed selection after gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b021">21</xref>] possibly accompanied by a relaxation in the selection for maintenance of their interactions. As a result of this, the link dynamics are likely higher for recently duplicated genes than for proteins with established functions. However, experimental studies estimated that 69% to 84% of interactions between ancient proteins have diverged when comparing <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b022">22</xref>]. The authors tested 216 interactions that were known from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> among 282 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteins (that are conserved in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content>). Of these, 35 interactions were experimentally observed in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>. We can estimate that approximately 5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> interactions have changed per protein pair per My among these ancient proteins. This is roughly half of what we proposed as an estimate for the rate of change for eukaryotic interactomes, but it considers only removal of interactions and not addition. Due to the reasons mentioned above, we think that the rate that we have calculated might be an overestimate of the rate for the whole interactome, but currently available data suggests that even among ancient proteins there is considerable change of their interactions.</p><p>Other studies also point to the importance of change of interactions after gene duplication. In studies of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> complexes, it was observed that 7% to 20% of those complexes arose by duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b045">45</xref>]. However, in most of the instances (67% to 90%), only partial duplication was observed. Detailed studies of some of the duplicated complexes have shown that even in the case where general function and localization is maintained, it is possible that the specific activity of the complex has changed. These results suggest that, at least in the case of protein complexes, there is a very significant gain and loss of single interactions that can lead to the formation of new complexes with different specificities.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Binding Properties and Function Determine the Rate of Change</title><p>In a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b034">34</xref>], Neduva and Russell postulated that linear motifs might act as “evolutionary interactions switches.” The authors claimed that, due to binding to a linear peptide stretch and due to the small number of determinants for binding, a random mutation in the proteome can easily create or destroy such binding sites. We have shown that specificity of binding is a key factor determining the evolvability of the interaction networks. More promiscuous domains, such as peptide binding domains and domains able to interact with common structural elements, are more likely to change interactions faster over a given evolutionary period. This implies that some biological processes where these binding domains are involved (such as signal transduction) will also have a higher link turnover than others (such as metabolism). In fact, proteins related to intracellular signaling cascades are two times more likely to interact with recently duplicated proteins than proteins involved in primary metabolism. If protein properties impact on how they add and lose interactions, then the power law distribution observed in protein interaction networks is in part determined by the cell's use of different degrees of binding specificity.</p><p>We reported that proteins involved in the immune response, responses to external stimuli, transport, establishment of localization, and organismal physiological processes show signs of such positive selection for new interactions. Interestingly, most of these biological processes are known to have an excess of proteins under positive selection as shown by sequence studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b047">47</xref>]. Our results suggest that positive selection for sequence change in proteins is propagated to faster rates of change at the network level. Alternatively, it is possible that the preferential fixation of duplicated proteins involved in these biological functions might partly explain this observation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Link Dynamics and Cellular Evolution</title><p>This study opens up interesting questions regarding the evolution of cellular functions. Some challenges faced by the cells require the interaction of several components to integrate information and provide a solution. One example would be the decision to divide or differentiate given a set of external conditions. It could be said that these challenges require a network solution as opposed to some metabolic problems, such as adapting an enzyme to do a required metabolic step.</p><p>In network challenges as defined above, selection forces would not restrain the exact binary interactions, but rather the functional complexes arising from them. It is plausible that the fast link dynamics are then advantageous to the cell, given that it allows for exploration of different network conformations from where innovation might arise.</p><p>If there is indeed a fast turnover of interactions that are material for selection to act upon, then we expect to see convergent network motifs that are optimal for solving particular cellular problems. An example of what might be an optimal network solution is the coupling of slow and fast positive feedbacks in cell decision processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b048">48</xref>].</p><p>If fast link dynamics is important for the cell to search for optimal solutions to network problems, then is it also likely that the rate of change itself might be under constraint and therefore under natural selection. Hence, during cellular evolution, the selection of different degrees of specificity is not only important for the functional role of the proteins but it also has direct consequences with regard to the evolvability of the whole cellular network.</p><p>Further work on protein interaction maps will help us understand to what extent evolvability constrains the differential usage of protein domains in cellular networks. As was the case for comparative genomics, the availability of more and complete interactomes for different species will vastly increase our understanding of how the cell's complexity arises from the interactions of its components and evolves to cope with changing environments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Estimating protein time of origin.</title><p>For each protein of <italic>S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, C elegans,</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens,</italic> we have established a likely time of origin by looking for putative orthologs in several other fully sequenced genomes (that we refer to here as reference species) using the orthologs defined in the Inparanoid database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se" xlink:type="simple">http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b049">49</xref>]).

For proteins with k interactions, the rate of change, r, can be calculated by:

For each protein domain, we retrieved all proteins in P<sub>old</sub> where this domain was observed and calculated the rate of change of interactions as above. To select protein domains that conferred an above-average rate in most species, we selected bins with at least 20 proteins (to increase the reliability of the calculated rate) and with a rate greater than average in at least three of the four species. There are 96 protein domains that are represented by 20 or more proteins in at least three species. Of these, eight have an above average rate of change in at least three of the four species studied. The effect of both constrains (number of proteins and average rate) is detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030025-st002">Table S2</xref>.
				</p><p>To study protein domains with different binding specificity, we binned proteins containing domains with increasing number of interactions with other domains (extracted from the iPfam database) and calculated for each bin the rate of change. We considered bins of proteins in P<sub>old</sub> having proteins domains with i to i + 10 iPfam interactions with i ranging from one to 15. We calculated the rate of change<sub> (bin)</sub> as above.</p><p>We have used the iPfam database to search for plausible binding interfaces in all human interactions derived from the human protein reference database. We could assign a possible binding interface to ~20% of the human interactome. We then built two groups of proteins according to the number of binding interactions per domain. We selected a group of proteins that had three or more interactions through one domain (likely more promiscuous domains), and a second group of proteins that interacted with three or more partners via multiple domains (likely more selective domains). We then further subdivided the two groups into bins protein with i to i + 5 interactions with i ranging from five to 15 and calculated the rate<sub> (bin)</sub> as above (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030025-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>To study the different biological processes, we have binned proteins in P<sub>old</sub> according to the biological processes defined in Gene Ontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030025-b037">37</xref>] (downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.geneontology.org</ext-link> on 29 January 2006).
