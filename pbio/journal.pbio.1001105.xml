        <p>Phenotypic plasticity is common in development. For <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, the most common cause of invasive fungal infections in humans, morphological plasticity is its defining feature and is critical for its pathogenesis. Unlike other fungal pathogens that exist primarily in either yeast or hyphal forms, <italic>C. albicans</italic> is able to switch reversibly between yeast and hyphal growth forms in response to environmental cues. Although many regulators have been found involved in hyphal development, the mechanisms of regulating hyphal development and plasticity of dimorphism remain unclear. Here we show that hyphal development involves two sequential regulations of the promoter chromatin of hypha-specific genes. Initiation requires a rapid but temporary disappearance of the Nrg1 transcriptional repressor of hyphal morphogenesis via activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway. Maintenance requires promoter recruitment of Hda1 histone deacetylase under reduced Tor1 (target of rapamycin) signaling. Hda1 deacetylates a subunit of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase module, leading to eviction of the NuA4 acetyltransferase module and blockage of Nrg1 access to promoters of hypha-specific genes. Promoter recruitment of Hda1 for hyphal maintenance happens only during the period when Nrg1 is gone. The sequential regulation of hyphal development by the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway and reduced Tor1 signaling provides a molecular mechanism for plasticity of dimorphism and how <italic>C. albicans</italic> adapts to the varied host environments in pathogenesis.

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Many organisms are able to change their phenotype in response to changes in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as plasticity. <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, a major opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans, can undergo reversible morphological changes between yeast (spherical) and hyphal (filamentous) forms of growth in response to environmental cues. This morphological plasticity is essential for its pathogenesis and survival in its hosts. In this study, we show that hyphal development is initiated and maintained by two major nutrient-sensing cellular growth pathways that act by removing the inhibition provided by the transcriptional repressor Nrg1. While initiation requires a rapid but temporary disappearance of Nrg1 via activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway, maintenance requires the recruitment to promoters of the Hda1 histone deacetylase under conditions of reduced signaling by the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase, leading to chromatin remodeling that blocks Nrg1 access to the promoters of hypha-specific genes. We observed that recruitment of Hda1 to promoters happens only during the time window when Nrg1 is absent. Such temporally linked regulation of promoter chromatin by different signaling pathways provides a unique mechanism for integrating multiple signals in the regulation of gene expression and phenotypic plasticity during development and cell fate specification.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many organisms or cells are able to alter their phenotype or developmental fate in response to changes in their environment, a phenomenon referred to as plasticity. Plasticity is seen in a broad range of biological systems from embryo development to memory formation where long-lasting effects on gene expression outlive an initial transient signal. The dynamic process of cell fate specification is determined by a network of regulatory genes. The architecture of the network defines the temporal order of specification events. Therefore, understanding temporal dynamic regulation of gene expression in response to extracellular signals is critical for our comprehension of cell fate specification and plasticity.</p>
      <p>Morphological plasticity is a defining feature of <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, a major opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Odds1">[1]</xref>. <italic>C. albicans</italic> resides as harmless commensal flora in the gastrointestinal tract and mucosal membranes of healthy individuals, but when the host immune system is suppressed, the fungus can disseminate and cause systemic infections. Unlike many other pathogenic fungi that exist primarily in either yeast or hyphal forms and infect a specific organ, <italic>C. albicans</italic> is able to undergo reversible morphological changes between yeast, pseudohyphal, and hyphal forms of growth in response to environmental cues and can successfully infect many different anatomical sites of the human host. Its morphological plasticity is the most important virulence attribute of <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Kumamoto1">[2]</xref>. Hyphae have invasive properties that can promote tissue penetration and escape from immune cells, whereas yeast cells are suited for dissemination in the bloodstream. Several of the genes that are specifically expressed in hyphae encode virulence factors. For example, <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>ALS3</italic>, and <italic>RBT5</italic> encode cell wall proteins that are important for adhesion to host cells and iron acquisition from the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Staab1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Weissman1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several signal transduction pathways are involved in the regulation of hyphal development. Among them, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway plays an essential role in hyphal morphogenesis and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Hogan1">[7]</xref>. The adenylate cyclase Cyr1 and its associated protein are indispensable for hyphal growth under all conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Rocha1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Zou1">[10]</xref>. Tpk1 and Tpk2 are catalytic subunits of PKA; each plays distinct functions in hyphal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Cassola1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Sonneborn1">[13]</xref>. Efg1 and Flo8, two transcription regulators essential for hyphal development and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lo1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Cao1">[16]</xref>, are implicated to function downstream of the cAMP-PKA pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Bockmuhl2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Harcus1">[18]</xref>. The hyphal transcriptional program is repressed by Tup1 through sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Braun1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Bauer1">[27]</xref>, of which Nrg1 plays a major role. <italic>nrg1</italic> mutant cells are constitutively filamentous under all conditions, similar to <italic>tup1</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Murad2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Braun2">[26]</xref>. Ectopic expression of <italic>NRG1</italic> inhibits hyphal filamentation in all growth conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Park1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Saville1">[29]</xref>. Although molecular genetic analyses have identified a number of key transcriptional regulators of hyphal morphogenesis, our understanding of the transcriptional regulation that governs the yeast-to-hypha transition remains rudimentary.</p>
      <p>The yeast-to-hypha transition can be induced by a wide range of media and environmental conditions in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Odds1">[1]</xref>. Serum in combination with a rise in temperature to 37°C gives the most robust induction of hyphae. Simple inoculation of stationary cells into fresh medium at 37°C is also a powerful but transient inducer of hyphae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Enjalbert1">[30]</xref>. Several induction signals are transmitted through Cyr1, including CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><italic><sup>−</sup></italic> and peptidoglycan found in serum, as well as a rise in temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Klengel1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Shapiro1">[33]</xref>. Cyr1 is also regulated by Ras1, Ras2, and Gpa2 in response to nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Maidan1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Zhu1">[38]</xref>. Farnesol, a quorum-sensing molecule secreted to the medium by <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells as a cell density signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Hornby1">[39]</xref>, exerts its inhibitory effects on germ-tube formation through Ras1-Cyr1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-DavisHanna1">[40]</xref>. However, many widely used hyphal-inducing media are poor in nitrogen and carbon sources that are not favorable for the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway, raising the question of how <italic>C. albicans</italic> can undergo hyphal development in both rich and poor media. The target of rapamycin (TOR) protein kinase pathway is another major nutrient-sensing pathway conserved in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Bastidas1">[41]</xref>. Rapamycin can both inhibit hyphal formation on solid medium and promote cell aggregation in liquid medium in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Bastidas1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Cutler1">[42]</xref>, but it does not induce yeast-to-hyphal development.</p>
      <p>Transcriptional activation or repression in response to external stimuli is often mediated through dynamic changes in promoter chromatin structure. This regulation occurs at many different levels, including posttranslational modification of histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Peterson1">[43]</xref>, chromatin remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Cairns1">[44]</xref>, incorporation of histone variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Sarma1">[45]</xref>, and cotranscriptional chromatin disassembly and assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Adkins1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Adkins2">[47]</xref>. All of these dynamic processes work in concert to establish or alter the local properties of chromatin, although the relative importance and order of these processes vary at each individual promoter. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in regulating chromatin structure and transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Millar1">[48]</xref>. Histone acetylation is a dynamic reversible process, and the balance of histone acetylation is important for proper cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lee1">[49]</xref>. We have previously shown a dynamic nucleosomal H4 acetylation at the promoters of hypha-specific genes during hyphal induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lu1">[50]</xref>. H4 histone acetyltransferase complex NuA4 is recruited to promoters in both yeast and hyphal forms and is required for the induction of hyphal genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lu1">[50]</xref>. Here we show that the dynamic increase and decrease in H4 acetylation at the promoters during hyphal induction correlates with the sequential dissociation and association of two different HDACs, Rpd3 and Hda1, respectively. Concomitant with the dissociation of Rpd3 upon hyphal initiation, Nrg1 protein disappears from cells in response to the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway, a step essential for hyphal initiation. Although Nrg1 protein returns after hyphal initiation, promoter recruitment of Hda1 under reduced Tor1 signaling leads to deacetylation and eviction of the NuA4 HAT module, nucleosome reassembly, and inhibition of Nrg1 access to the promoters of hypha-specific genes, a step essential for sustained hyphal development. Importantly, disappearance of Nrg1 during hyphal initiation is a prerequisite for promoter recruitment of Hda1. The sequential regulation of hyphal development by the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway and reduced Tor1 signaling provides a molecular mechanism for the plasticity of dimorphism and how <italic>C. albicans</italic> adapts to the varied host environments in pathogenesis.</p>

        <title>Yeast-to-Hyphal Development Involves Two Temporally Related Phases of Removing Nrg1 Inhibition</title>
        <p>The transcription factor Nrg1 plays an essential role in repressing hyphal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Kadosh1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Murad2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Braun2">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Saville2">[51]</xref>. The significance of Nrg1 is underscored by recent phenotypic profiling of 143 transcriptional regulator knockout mutants, where only <italic>nrg1</italic> and <italic>tup1</italic> mutants are filamentous under all conditions examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Homann1">[52]</xref>. Relief of the transcriptional repression by Nrg1-Tup1 may be the essential and regulated step for the activation of the hyphal transcriptional program under all conditions. Indeed, <italic>NRG1</italic> transcript level has been shown to be reduced in hyphae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Kadosh1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Murad2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Braun2">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Banerjee1">[53]</xref>. However, how Nrg1 is regulated at the protein level and whether Nrg1 directly binds to the promoters of hypha-specific genes is not clear. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of C-terminal Myc-tagged Nrg1, we found that Nrg1 was at the promoters of hypha-specific genes <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>ALS3</italic>, and <italic>ECE1</italic> during yeast growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We next analyzed the levels of promoter-bound Nrg1 during yeast to hyphal morphological development under four related conditions in YPD medium that induce three distinctive developmental responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells inoculated to YPD with or without serum at 30°C remain in the yeast growth form. Cells inoculated into YPD at 37°C in the absence of serum show normal germ tube formation, but are unable to maintain hyphal development. Serum, in combination with a shift in temperature to 37°C, induces robust and sustained hyphal growth. By a time course ChIP, we found that, upon hyphal induction, Nrg1 dissociated rapidly from the promoters and remained at low levels during hyphal elongation in YPD with serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, levels of promoter-associated Nrg1 recovered after the initial decrease under the condition of YPD without serum, which correlated with the conversion to the yeast growth phase around 3 h after the induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Unexpectedly, Western analyses indicated that Nrg1 protein levels decreased sharply at 15 and 30 min upon hyphal induction at 37°C coinciding with germ tube formation. However, the Nrg1 level recovered after 1 h of hyphal induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Serum was not required for the disappearance of Nrg1, but was critical for sustained hyphal development and excluding Nrg1 from  promoters during hyphal elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The Western analysis of cells after 3 h of hyphal induction could not discriminate Nrg1 protein from apical cells and subapical cells. It is possible that Nrg1 protein was absent in the apical cell of each hypha and, therefore, allowed sustained hyphal growth from the apical cells. We determined Nrg1 localization by immunofluorescence in hyphal cells after 5 h of growth in YPD with serum at 37°C and found Nrg1 in the nucleus of both apical and subapical cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001105.s001">Figure S1</xref>), excluding this possibility. Our data suggest that hyphal development involves two phases of releasing Nrg1 inhibition: the first for initiation and the second for maintenance. We suggest that initiation requires a transient down-regulation of Nrg1 protein level, while maintenance requires a regulation that prevents Nrg1 from binding at the promoters of hypha-specific genes.</p>

        <title>The cAMP-PKA Pathway Is Required for the Down-Regulation of Nrg1 for Hyphal Initiation</title>
        <p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the rapid and temporary disappearance of Nrg1 protein upon hyphal induction is regulated by the cAMP-PKA pathway. First, we found that Nrg1 disappearance required the cAMP-PKA pathway as Nrg1 protein level did not show an obvious reduction in <italic>cyr1</italic> and <italic>tpk2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, no obvious change in Nrg1 level was observed in an <italic>efg1</italic> or <italic>flo8</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Second, the shift to 37°C during hyphal induction was critical for the observed Nrg1 disappearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This is consistent with the report that Hsp90 regulates hyphal development via Cyr1 in response to a shift in temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Shapiro1">[33]</xref>. Third, the major quorum-sensing molecule farnesol, at a physiological concentration, completely blocked the down-regulation of Nrg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Farnesol is reported to exert its inhibitory effects on hyphal initiation through Cyr1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Hornby1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-DavisHanna1">[40]</xref>. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of farnesol on the down-regulation of Nrg1, different folds of dilution during inoculation could lead to different durations of Nrg1 down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g001">Figure 1C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We also observed that hyphal initiation correlated with Nrg1 disappearance in all liquid media, including nutrient-poor media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, hyphal initiation in a poor medium required inoculation of cells from a saturated overnight culture. This result is consistent with the report that release from quorum-sensing molecules, such as farnesol, triggers the yeast-to-hypha transition at 37°C independent of the inoculation media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Enjalbert1">[30]</xref>. The timing of hyphal initiation was slower in medium with mannitol than that with glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with the activation of the cAMP pathway by glucose in addition to the release of inhibition from farnesol. Together, our observations suggest that hyphal initiation involves a down-regulation of Nrg1 protein in response to the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway by a combination of temperature shift, release from inhibition by farnesol, and nutrients in rich media.</p>

However, the decrease in <italic>NRG1</italic> transcript alone is not sufficient to provide the temporal dynamic change in Nrg1 protein level during hyphal development. We observed that, by promoter shut-down experiments, Nrg1 was unstable when cells were inoculated into fresh medium at 30°C either from an overnight culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) or a logarithmic growing culture (unpublished data). Adding farnesol inhibited Nrg1 degradation, suggesting that release from farnesol inhibition during inoculation is important in triggering the degradation of Nrg1. Therefore, the rapid and temporary disappearance of Nrg1 protein is the combined result of a cAMP-PKA dependent down-regulation of <italic>NRG1</italic> expression and a burst of Nrg1 degradation upon release from farnesol during inoculation. This temporary removal of Nrg1 is essential for hyphal induction.</p>

        <title>Promoter-Recruitment of Hda1 Is Required for Sustained Hyphal Development by Limiting Promoter Access to Nrg1</title>
        <p>One possible mechanism for the reduced promoter access by Nrg1 during hyphal elongation is a change in promoter chromatin. <italic>C. albicans</italic> has one class II HDAC Hda1 that functions as a repressor for phenotypic switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Srikantha1">[54]</xref>. We found that cells deleted of <italic>HDA1</italic> were unable to maintain hyphal growth.

Furthermore, levels of promoter-bound Nrg1 increased dramatically in the <italic>hda1</italic> mutant after hyphal initiation, suggesting that Hda1 is required to prevent Nrg1 binding to the promoters for sustained hyphal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001105.s002">S2B</xref>).

To determine whether Hda1 functions directly on the promoters of hypha-specific genes, we performed a time course ChIP of Hda1. We found that Hda1 was recruited to the promoters during hyphal induction in a serum-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g003">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001105.s002">S2C</xref>).

        <p>In contrast to Hda1, we found that the Rpd3 HDAC preferentially associated with hypha-specific promoters in yeast cells and dissociated rapidly from the promoters upon hyphal induction, similar to the dynamic dissociation of Nrg1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001105.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

        <title>The Promoter-Associated Hda1 Deacetylates the Yng2 Subunit of NuA4 Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) module, Leading to the Reduction of Yng2 and NuA4 HAT at the Promoters of Hypha-Specific Genes</title>
        <p>How does promoter-associated Hda1 prevent Nrg1 from binding to the promoters of hypha-specific genes during hyphal elongation? One potential mechanism is chromatin remodeling. We have previously shown nucleosome reassembly and a decrease in H4 acetylation at the UAS regions of hypha-specific genes during hyphal elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lu1">[50]</xref>. The decrease in H4 acetylation could be a result of H4 deacetylation by promoter-associated Hda1 or eviction of NuA4 from the promoters. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Hda1 is a histone deacetylase specific for H3 and H2B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Wu1">[55]</xref>. Therefore, H4 may not be a substrate of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hda1. Yng2, a subunit of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase HAT complex essential for HAT activity, is acetylated at lysine 170 by NuA4 and deacetylated by Rpd3 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lin1">[56]</xref>. Deacetylation of Yng2 leads to its degradation and eviction of chromatin-bound Yng2 with Esa1, the catalytic subunit of NuA4. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the NuA4 HAT complex is recruited to the promoters of hypha-specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lu1">[50]</xref>. By immunoprecipitation with anti-acetylated-lysine antibodies, we detected acetylated Yng2 in wild-type cells, but observed a dramatic increase in the level of acetylated Yng2 in the <italic>hda1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggests that deacetylation of Yng2 in vivo depends on Hda1 activity. K175 was identified as a candidate lysine residue for acetylation by sequence alignment with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Yng2. This was confirmed by the loss of acetylation of Yng2 when we substituted K175 with arginine (K175R), a mutation that blocks acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The loss of acetylation of Yng2<sup>K175R</sup> also suggests that K175 is the major acetylated lysine residue of Yng2 in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The K175R mutation led to a reduced level of Yng2, whereas substituting K175 with glutamine (K175Q, a mutation mimicking constitutive acetylation) did not cause a detectable change of protein abundance relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Unlike the <italic>yng2</italic> deletion mutant, neither <italic>yng2<sup>K175R</sup></italic> nor <italic>yng2<sup>K175Q</sup></italic> has any detectable growth defect (unpublished data). We then examined whether Yng2 acetylation affects hyphal development. Both wild-type and <italic>yng2<sup>K175R</sup></italic> cells developed long hyphae, whereas <italic>yng2<sup>K175Q</sup></italic> cells were defective in sustained hyphal development and transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g004">Figures 4D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001105.s004">S4A</xref>), a phenotype similar to that of the <italic>hda1</italic> mutant. Therefore, Yng2 deacetylation at K175 is important for sustained hyphal transcription. Conversely, constitutively acetylated Yng2 blocks hyphal filament extension.</p>

        <p>To determine whether the deacetylation of Yng2 is the major function of Hda1 in hyphal development, we generated an <italic>hda1 yng2</italic> double mutant and introduced the <italic>yng2<sup>K175R</sup></italic> mutation into the double mutant. The <italic>hda1 yng2<sup>K175R</sup></italic> mutant behaved like <italic>yng2<sup>K175R</sup></italic> or wild-type cells with no defect in hyphal filament extension and transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). Furthermore, Hda1 is required for the reduction of promoter-associated Yng2, and the <italic>yng2<sup>K175R</sup></italic> mutant completely bypassed this requirement of Hda1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g005">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001105.s005">S5</xref>). Therefore, the function of Hda1 in sustained hyphal transcription is mediated completely through the deacetylation of Yng2 at K175. In addition, the level of promoter-associated Yng2<sup>K175R</sup> decreased in the <italic>hda1</italic> mutant as did Yng2 in wild-type cells during hyphal elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g005">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001105.s005">S5</xref>), suggesting that Hda1 deacetylation of Yng2 at the promoters led to the eviction of Yng2 and Esa1 from the promoters of hypha-specific genes.</p>
        <p>To understand the effect of Yng2 K175 deacetylation on promoter chromatin, we determined temporal changes in histone levels and H4 acetylation at the UAS regions of hypha-specific promoters during hyphal induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g004">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001105.s004">S4D</xref>). Changes in H3 levels indicated rapid nucleosome disassembly during hyphal initiation and nucleosome reassembly during hyphal maintenance. The observed decrease in H3 occupancy and transcriptional induction within 30 min of hyphal induction is consistent with the notion that transcriptional activation correlates with reduced nucleosome occupancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Pokholok1">[57]</xref>. In contrast, nucleosome reassembly during hyphal elongation seemed important for sustained hyphal transcription, as <italic>yng2<sup>K175Q</sup></italic> cells showed a specific defect in nucleosome reassembly without any detectable impairment in initial nucleosome disassembly. Our data suggest that nucleosome reassembly during hyphal maintenance may function in preventing Nrg1 from binding to the promoters.</p>

This suggested that the Hda1-mediated deacetylation of Yng2 was required for hyphal maintenance in those media.

Interestingly, those media tend to be nutrient-poor. One commonly used synthetic nutrient-poor medium for hyphal growth is Lee's medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lee2">[58]</xref>.

As predicted, treatment of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells with a sublethal concentration of rapamycin after hyphal initiation at 37°C led to sustained hyphal filamentation in rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). A higher concentration of rapamycin, however, slowed cell growth and hyphal elongation (unpublished data), consistent with the finding that rapamycin inhibits filamentation on nutrient-poor media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Bastidas1">[41]</xref>. Sustained hyphal filamentation was also observed at 30°C with sublethal levels of rapamycin after cells were first grown at 37°C for hyphal initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The effect of rapamycin on hyphal maintenance was only observed after hyphal initiation. Cells treated with rapamycin at 30°C did not form hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). We further showed that the effect of Tor1 on hyphal maintenance was mediated through the promoter-recruitment of Hda1, as <italic>yng2<sup>K175Q</sup></italic> cells were defective in sustained hyphal filamentation in rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, Hda1 was recruited to the promoters of hypha-specific genes in cells treated with rapamycin in rich medium, whereas Nrg1 was excluded from the promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). The phenotypes of the <italic>yng2<sup>K175Q</sup></italic> cells and patterns of promoter association for Hda1 and Nrg1 are similar between poor medium and rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g007">7</xref>). Furthermore, a mutant with a hyperactive TOR pathway in <italic>C. albicans</italic> has recently been shown to be unable to form hyphae in a nutrient-poor medium, and rapamycin can rescue the filamentation defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Zacchi1">[60]</xref>. Therefore, maintenance of hyphal development requires reduced Tor1 signaling in response to nutrient-poor media and growth conditions. The reduced Tor1 signaling leads to the recruitment of Hda1 to the promoters of hypha-specific genes for promoter remodeling that prevents Nrg1 from binding.</p>

        <title>Temporal Connection between Hyphal Initiation and Maintenance</title>
        <p>To uncover potential molecular connections between the initiation phase and elongation phase of hyphal development, we asked whether serum could induce the promoter recruitment of Hda1 without the initiation phase. We found that Hda1 did not bind the promoters of hypha-specific genes when cells were grown at 30°C in the presence of serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Therefore, serum is not sufficient to induce the promoter recruitment of Hda1 without the initiation step. We further showed that raising the temperature to 37°C during inoculation was a prerequisite for subsequent recruitment of Hda1 to the promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Since Nrg1 was temporally cleared when cells were inoculated into fresh medium at 37°C, a requirement for hyphal initiation, we then examined whether serum could induce promoter recruitment of Hda1 independent of temperature in the <italic>nrg1</italic> deletion mutant by a time course ChIP experiment. Hda1 was found to bind the <italic>HWP1</italic> promoter in the presence of serum in <italic>nrg1</italic> mutants in either 25°C or 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). This result suggests that Nrg1 removal is required and sufficient for serum-induced Hda1 promoter recruitment for the sustained hyphal transcriptional program. This also predicts that the sustained hyphal transcriptional program could only be established within the time window of reduced Nrg1 when cells had just been inoculated into fresh media at 37°C. Indeed, addition of serum after 2 h of hyphal induction at 37°C in YPD could not sustain hyphal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Similar to serum, rapamycin could sustain hyphal growth only when added during hyphal initiation. Adding rapamycin after 2 h of hyphal induction showed no effect on hyphal maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Together, our data show a clear temporal connection between hyphal initiation and maintenance: Hda1 can be recruited to the promoters of the hypha-specific genes only when Nrg1 level is low. The time period of reduced Nrg1 during hyphal initiation can be viewed as a window of opportunity for establishing the hyphal transcription program. The strength and duration of the cAMP signal in each cell is expected to affect the commitment to the hyphal transcriptional program; once committed, the cAMP-PKA pathway activation is no longer needed. This is consistent with the observation that farnesol only inhibits germ-tube formation and has no effect on hyphal elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Hornby1">[39]</xref>. The duration of hyphal development is determined by nutrient conditions through the TOR pathway.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study shows that the yeast to hyphae morphogenetic switch consists of two temporally related phases of regulation of the promoter chromatin of hypha-specific genes: the first for initiation and the second for maintenance of hyphal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Initiation requires the cAMP-PKA pathway and maintenance requires reduced Tor1 signaling. A spike of cAMP-PKA activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Zou1">[10]</xref> and release from the inhibition of quorum sensing molecules, such as farnesol, initiate hyphal development by transiently clearing Nrg1 protein. The duration of hyphal development is under the regulation of Tor1 by controlling promoter access to Nrg1 through promoter recruitment of Hda1. Therefore, hyphal maintenance requires active sensing of growth environments. Hyphal cells convert to yeast when nutrients are replete. This provides an underlying mechanism for the plasticity of dimorphism. Importantly, the sustained transcriptional program, as measured by promoter recruitment of Hda1, can only be established during the time period when Nrg1 is absent. This provides a temporal link at the molecular level between the two phases of hyphal development. This is the first example of a temporal integration of two major nutrient-sensing cell growth pathways in development. Temporal restriction in development of multicellular organisms is common. For example, nutritional control of the reproductive status in honeybees is restricted by a critical “decision-making” period in larval development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Kucharski1">[61]</xref>. Our study also provides a mechanism for how a transient signal, such as a cAMP spike, can make a long-lasting impact in transcriptional reprogramming during development. Such control of cellular development by a burst of proliferating signal, followed with sustained action of reduced TOR signaling has been observed for memory T-cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Araki1">[62]</xref>. The TOR level is also critical for maintaining stem cell homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Yilmaz1">[63]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Castilho1">[65]</xref>. Temporal regulation of cell fate by different signaling pathways is likely common in development of multicellular organisms. Coupling two signaling pathways through the regulation of promoter chromatin provides a unique mechanism.</p>

      <p>Initiation of the hyphal transcriptional program requires temporary removal of Nrg1 protein. The timing, duration, and extent of the Nrg1 down-regulation are well correlated with timing and efficiency of hyphal initiation and are sensitive to multiple factors, including the state of inoculating cells (e.g., stationary cells), fold of dilution at inoculation, media, and temperature. Of those, a rise in temperature to 37°C and release from farnesol inhibition are essential for the clearance of Nrg1 and hyphal initiation. The cAMP-PKA pathway is required for the down-regulation of Nrg1, consistent with the concept that Cyr1 is a hub that integrates many of the hyphal inducing signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Klengel1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Shapiro1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-DavisHanna1">[40]</xref>. Efg1 and Flo8 are both required for the down-regulation of Nrg1, but a T→A or T→E mutation at the sole conserved PKA site in Efg1 (T206) does not reduce or enhance hyphal gene expression (our unpublished data). If Efg1 activity is directly regulated by PKA phosphorylation, the regulation is not essential or sufficient for the induction of hypha-specific genes. Efg1 and Flo8 also function directly on the promoters of hypha-specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Cao1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lu1">[50]</xref>, and the <italic>tup1</italic> mutant cannot bypass the requirement of Efg1 for hyphal transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Braun3">[66]</xref>. Our finding that Nrg1 is negatively regulated by the cAMP-PKA pathway and by farnesol is intriguing. The <italic>nrg1</italic> mutant produces 19-fold more farnesol than the parent wild-type strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Kebaara1">[67]</xref>, and farnesol in turn impacts activity of the Cyr1 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-DavisHanna1">[40]</xref>. Together, these findings provide a loop of three negative feedback regulations from farnesol to Cyr1, to Nrg1, and then back to farnesol. Removal of farnesol during inoculation will lead to activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway and clearance of Nrg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001105-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Lack of Nrg1 in turn is expected to lead to increased production of farnesol, and a new balance among the components in the feedback loop will be achieved. Another intriguing finding is that the sustained hyphal transcriptional program can only be established during the time window of low Nrg1. Commitment to the hyphal program is therefore determined by the strength and duration of Nrg1 down-regulation in each cell. If the duration is not long enough to establish the Hda1-mediated chromatin remodeling, the cell will be in the yeast growth phase. This explains the cell-to-cell variation and experiment-to-experiment variation in hyphal induction in a given culture, and why yeast and hyphal cells can exist in the same culture. Our model explains a widely accepted observation that the quality of the initial hyphal induction is important for the fate of hyphal development. It also provides a molecular mechanism for why farnesol only inhibits germ-tube formation and has no effect on hyphal elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Hornby1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our finding of temporally coupled chromatin remodeling under reduced Tor1 signaling for sustained hyphal transcription provides a molecular mechanism for why nutrient-poor media are typical media for sustained hyphal development. It has been puzzling how <italic>C. albicans</italic> can respond to both rich and poor media and undergo hyphal development. Rich medium with serum is the most robust medium for hyphal induction, and this is consistent with the requirement of the cAMP-PKA pathway for hyphal growth. Hyphal induction in nutrient-poor media also requires an activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway, mostly through the release from farnesol inhibition. But sustained hyphal growth requires a nutrient limitation. Considering the conserved functions of Tor1 in nutrient sensing and growth regulation from yeast to human, involvement of Tor1 in hyphal development has been studied and implicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Bastidas1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Zacchi1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Cruz1">[68]</xref>. However, rapamycin cannot induce hyphal development, making it hard to reconcile if the cAMP-PKA and Tor1 pathways function in parallel. We find that rapamycin can lead to the promoter recruitment of Hda1 only during hyphal initiation in the absence of Nrg1. The temporal coupling of the two pathways through the regulation of the promoter chromatin of hypha-specific genes explains why rapamycin by itself cannot induce hyphae. Since serum can sustain hyphal development in YPD, we suspect it may contain certain components that are inhibitory to the Tor1 pathway. The nuclear localization and the activity of several nutrient-responsive transcription factors are regulated by Tor1-mediated phosphorylation in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Crespo1">[69]</xref>. It is possible that a Tor1-regulated transcription factor is necessary for the recruitment of Hda1 to the promoters of hypha-specific genes. Further studies are needed to address this. In addition to Hda1-mediated chromatin remodeling for sustained hyphal transcription, there is a built-in positive feedback on the hyphal transcriptional program that is also important for sustained hyphal development. The transcription factor Ume6, specifically expressed during hyphal development, controls the level and duration of hypha-specific genes and is important for hyphal elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Banerjee1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Carlisle1">[70]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Zeidler1">[71]</xref>. The strength of the cAMP and Tor1 signaling determines the level and duration of <italic>UME6</italic> expression, which in turn dictates the extent of hyphal morphogenesis. Hyphal morphogenesis and cell chain formation is under the control of another hypha-specific gene that encodes the G<sub>1</sub> cyclin-related protein Hgc1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Zheng1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Bishop1">[76]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our study should provide insights into understanding <italic>C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis. Hyphal initiation is tightly linked to release from quorum-sensing molecules, a condition parallel to dispersion of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells from biofilms in human hosts, which is a major cause of disseminated candidiasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Uppuluri1">[77]</xref>. Invasive candidiasis is the most common invasive fungal infection among organ transplant recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Pappas1">[78]</xref>. Rapamycin is given to transplant patients, especially renal transplant patients, to prevent organ rejection. One speculation from our finding is that rapamycin, known for its antifungal activity, may also facilitate hyphal development and invasive infections. The existence of extensive hyphae in various deep-seeded infection sites also suggests that those host environments may be perceived as stressful or starvation conditions by <italic>Candida</italic>. Our findings provide molecular mechanisms for how <italic>C. albicans</italic> adapts to varied host environments and develops from a benign commensal into a disseminated invasive disease.</p>
      <p>We have previously noticed the dynamic increase and decrease in H4 acetylation concomitant with nucleosome disassembly and reassembly at the promoters of hypha-specific genes during hyphal induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lu1">[50]</xref>. The significance of the temporal dynamic regulation in promoter chromatin is not clear. Here we find the sequential dissociation of Rpd3 and association of Hda1 to the promoters is concomitant with the dynamic changes in H4 acetylation. Importantly, we show that promoter-associated Hda1 decreases H4 acetylation level by deacetylating Yng2 and evicting Yng2 and Esa1 of the NuA4 HAT module from the promoters, leading to nucleosome reassembly, inhibition of Nrg1 binding, and sustained hyphal transcription. This provides an example for Hda1 in gene activation and NuA4 in gene repression. The function of NuA4 in repression here is revealed by the use of <italic>yng2<sup>K175Q</sup></italic> and <italic>yng2<sup>K175R</sup></italic> mutations. Temporal analysis of promoter chromatin also delineates different functions of HDACs and NuA4 in transcription. It shows that nucleosome reassembly does not necessarily correlate with transcriptional repression; it can also be used for gene activation by restricting access of repressors. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Yng2 is deacetylated by Rpd3 and a similar temporal dynamic H4 acetylation is observed at DNA double-stranded breaks concomitant with the sequential recruitment of NuA4 and Rpd3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lin1">[56]</xref>. Such temporal dynamic regulation of chromatin is likely also used in transcription in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Indeed Rpd3 is required for the expression of several environment-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-DeNadal1">[79]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Wang2">[82]</xref>. Active functions of HDACs in gene expression are not limited to yeast. A recent genome-wide mapping of HAT and HDAC binding sites in human T cells shows that all HDACs analyzed are associated with active genes and positively correlated with transcription, with some HDACs mainly in the promoter regions and other HDACs in both the promoter and gene body regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Wang3">[83]</xref>. Inhibition of HDAC activity with HDAC inhibitor treatment causes increases in acetylation in the active genes, suggesting that the majority of HDACs function to reset chromatin by removing acetylation at active genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Wang3">[83]</xref>. The temporal dynamic NuA4 regulation by HDACs shown in this study provides an attractive mechanism likely used for temporal integration of different signals in transcriptional reprogramming during development.</p>

        <p>A 0.9-kb PCR product (primers 1 and 2) containing the C-terminal <italic>NRG1</italic> coding region and a 1.3-kb PCR product (primers 9 and 10) containing the C-terminal <italic>RPD3</italic> coding region were inserted into the <italic>BamH</italic>I<italic>-Mlu</italic>I sites of pPR673 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lu1">[50]</xref>. The resulting plasmids were digested with <italic>Sac</italic>I to target integration into their own loci to express Nrg1-13Myc and Rpd3-13Myc. A 1.3-kb PCR product (primers 5 and 6) containing the C-terminal <italic>HDA1</italic> coding region and a 0.8-kb PCR product (primers 7 and 8) containing the C-terminal <italic>YNG2</italic> coding region were digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Mlu</italic>I and cloned into the <italic>BamH</italic>I-<italic>Mlu</italic>I sites of pPR673. The resulting plasmids were digested with <italic>BamH</italic>I to target the integration of the plasmid into its own locus to express Hda1-13Myc and Yng2-13Myc. The pMAL2-NRG1-13Myc plasmid was constructed by amplifying <italic>NRG1-13MYC</italic> (primers 3 and 4) from pACT1-NRG1-13MYC plasmid (our unpublished data). The PCR product was digested with <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Kpn</italic>I to replace <italic>WOR1-HA</italic> from pMAL2-WOR1-HA plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Huang1">[86]</xref>. The resulting plasmids were digested with <italic>Asc</italic>I to target integration into the <italic>ADE2</italic> locus to express Nrg1-13Myc.</p>
        <p>The <italic>YNG2</italic> coding sequence was amplified using primers 13 and 14. The resulting 0.9-kb PCR product was digested with <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Mlu</italic>I and inserted into the <italic>Not</italic>I-<italic>Mlu</italic>I site of pPR673 to create pACT1-YNG2-13MYC. A 1.6-kb <italic>YNG2</italic> promoter fragment upstream of the START site of <italic>YNG2</italic> (from −1 to −1,600) was PCR amplified using primers 11 and 12. The resulting purified PCR product was digested with <italic>Stu</italic>I and <italic>BamH</italic>I and cloned into the <italic>Stu</italic>I-<italic>BamH</italic>I site of pACT1-YNG2-13MYC, displacing the 1-kb <italic>ACT1</italic> promoter region to generate pYNG2-YNG2-13MYC. Two-step PCR was used to create pYNG2-YNG2<sup>K175R</sup>-13MYC. Two pairs of primers (primers 13 and 15, 16 and 14) were used to PCR amplify overlapping <italic>YNG2</italic> fragments with the mutation in the overlapping region. The resulting PCR products were purified and mixed as templates for another round of PCR amplification using the primers 13 and 14, which produced the full-length <italic>YNG2<sup>K175R</sup></italic> sequence. The resulting mutant, <italic>YNG2<sup>K175R</sup></italic>, was cloned into the <italic>Not</italic>I-<italic>Mlu</italic>I site of the plasmid pYNG2-YNG2-13MYC, replacing the wild-type copy, and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Two-step PCR was used to create pYNG2-YNG2<sup>K175Q</sup>-13MYC. Two pairs of primers (primers 13 and 17, and 18 and 14) were used to PCR amplify overlapping <italic>YNG2</italic> fragments with the mutation in the overlapping region. Subsequent steps were done by using the same methods as pYNG2-YNG2<sup>K175R</sup>-13MYC. These plasmids were digested with the <italic>Pml</italic>I within the <italic>YNG2</italic> promoter region for integration into the endogenous <italic>YNG2</italic> locus in <italic>yng2/yng2</italic> and <italic>hda1/hda1 yng2/yng2</italic> mutant strains.</p>

        <title>Northern and Quantitative RT-PCR Expression Analysis</title>
        <p>Methods for RNA isolation and Northern blot hybridization were carried out as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lane1">[87]</xref>. Probes for <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>ALS3</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, and <italic>ACT1</italic> were made by PCR amplification of ∼500-bp fragments from coding regions of each gene from SC5314 genomic DNA. The primers used were as follows: <italic>HWP1</italic>, primers 19 and 20; <italic>ALS3</italic>, primers 21 and 22; <italic>ECE1</italic>, primers 23 and 24; and <italic>ACT1</italic>, primers 25 and 26. For quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT -PCR) analysis, 10 µg of total RNA was DNase-treated at 37°C for 1 h using the DNA-free kit (Qiagen), cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen), and qPCR was done using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) using the primers 27 and 28 for <italic>HWP1</italic>, primers 29 and 30 for <italic>ALS3</italic>, primers 31 and 32 for <italic>ECE1</italic>, primers 33 and 34 for <italic>ACT1</italic>, and primers 35 and 36 for <italic>NRG1</italic>. The iCycler iQ detection system (Bio-Rad) was used with the following program: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 20 s. Amplification specificity was determined by melting curve analysis.</p>

        <title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</title>
        <p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described with modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Lu1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Pokholok1">[57]</xref>. Cells were formaldehyde cross-linked by adding formaldehyde (37%) to a 1% final concentration. Treated cultures were mixed by shaking and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 2.5 M glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mM, and treated cultures were mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were pelleted at 3,000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C, washed four times with 20 ml PBS, and resuspended in 400 µl of 4°C lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.5],140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) with protease inhibitors. All subsequent ChIP and wash steps were done at 4°C. Cells were lysed using a Fast-Prep system (FP120; Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA). DNA was sheared by sonication six times for 20 s at high power on a Bioruptor (diagenode) with 40 s intervals on ice.</p>
        <p>For the IP, 10 µl of anti-Myc (SC-789, Santa Cruz), 4 µl of anti-H3 (ab1791; Abcam) or anti-acetylated-H4 (06-866; Millipore) antibodies were used for ∼4 mg of chromatin proteins in an immunoprecipitation volume of 200 µl. The IP was incubated O/N at 4°C, with agitation. Then 50 µl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, 17-0974) in lysis buffer was added to the IP and incubated 2 h at 4°C with agitation. The beads were pelleted for 1 min at 3,000 g. After removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed with a series of buffers for 5 min each wash: twice in lysis buffer, twice in high-salt lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.5], 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), twice in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA), and once in TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]). After the last wash, 75 µl of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) was added to each sample, and the beads were incubated at 65°C for 10 min. The beads were spun for 1 min at 5000 g, and the supernatant was removed and retained. A second elution was carried out with 75 µl of elution buffer 2 (TE, 1% SDS) and eluates from the two elution steps were combined. For the ChIP input material set aside, 140 µl elution buffer 2 (TE, 1% SDS) was added to 10 µl WCE. ChIP and input samples were incubated overnight at 65°C to reverse the formaldehyde crosslinks. 150 µl of proteinase K solution (TE, 60 µg/ml glycogen, 500 µg/ml proteinase K) was added to each sample, and samples were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Samples were extracted twice with 400 µl Tris buffer-saturated phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol solution (25∶24∶1). 15 µl of 5 M NaCl and 0.8 ml of 100% ethanol (4°C) were added and the DNA was precipitated for 20 min at −20°C, then pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, washed once with cold 70% ethanol, and allowed to air dry. The samples were resuspended in 30 µl of TE containing 100 µg/ml RNaseA and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. DNA derived from the whole cell extracts and immunoprecipitation (IP) eluate was analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Plotted are the average and standard error of the mean of three independent qPCR reactions for each experiment.</p>

          <p>Yng2 deacetylation by Hda1 is not required for germ tube formation. (A) Germ tube formation of wild type and <italic>hda1/hda1</italic>. Cells of wild type (TS3.3+pBES116) and <italic>hda1/hda1</italic> (HLY4032+pBES116) were diluted 1∶100 into indicated medium at 37°C. The percentage of cells forming germ tubes in YPD+10% serum medium, Spider medium, and M199 pH 8 medium at 60 min or in Lee's medium at 180 min was determined by counting at least 300 cells/sample, in triplicate. The samples from Spider medium were gently sonicated to disrupt clumping. Mean (% germ tube formation) ± SE (standard error) of two independent experiments. The <italic>hda1/hda1</italic> mutant is able to form germ tube in YPD with serum and Spider media but shows a dramatically reduced level of germ tube formation in M199 and Lee's media. This is likely due to impaired growth of the mutant in the media. The doubling time of the wild type (TS3.3+pBES116) and <italic>hda1/hda1</italic> (HLY4032+pBES116) in YPD medium at 30°C is 105 min and 135 min, respectively, and in M199 PH 8 medium at 30°C is 150 min and over 18 h, respectively. The defect of <italic>hda1/hda1</italic> cells in germ tube formation in M199 is consistent with the report by Zacchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001105-Zacchi2">[89]</xref>.
