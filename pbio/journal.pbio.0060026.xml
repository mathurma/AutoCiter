        <p>A lysosomal storage disease (LSD) results from deficient lysosomal enzyme activity, thus the substrate of the mutant enzyme accumulates in the lysosome, leading to pathology. In many but not all LSDs, the clinically most important mutations compromise the cellular folding of the enzyme, subjecting it to endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation instead of proper folding and lysosomal trafficking. A small molecule that restores partial mutant enzyme folding, trafficking, and activity would be highly desirable, particularly if one molecule could ameliorate multiple distinct LSDs by virtue of its mechanism of action. Inhibition of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, using either diltiazem or verapamil—both US Food and Drug Administration–approved hypertension drugs—partially restores N370S and L444P glucocerebrosidase homeostasis in Gaucher patient–derived fibroblasts; the latter mutation is associated with refractory neuropathic disease. Diltiazem structure-activity studies suggest that it is its Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker activity that enhances the capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum to fold misfolding-prone proteins, likely by modest up-regulation of a subset of molecular chaperones, including BiP and Hsp40. Importantly, diltiazem and verapamil also partially restore mutant enzyme homeostasis in two other distinct LSDs involving enzymes essential for glycoprotein and heparan sulfate degradation, namely α-mannosidosis and type IIIA mucopolysaccharidosis, respectively. Manipulation of calcium homeostasis may represent a general strategy to restore protein homeostasis in multiple LSDs. However, further efforts are required to demonstrate clinical utility and safety.</p>

          <p>Lysosomes are organelles that contain more than 50 hydrolytic enzymes that break down macromolecules in a cell. A lysosomal storage disease results from deficient activity of one or more of these enzymes, leading to the accumulation of corresponding substrate(s). Currently, lysosomal storage diseases are treated by enzyme replacement therapy, which can be challenging because the enzyme has to enter the cell and the lysosome to function; in neuropathic diseases, enzyme replacement is not useful because recombinant enzymes do not enter the brain. We have shown that diltiazem and verapamil, potent US Food and Drug Administration–approved L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker drugs, increased the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding capacity, trafficking, and activity of mutant lysosomal enzymes associated with three distinct lysosomal storage diseases. These compounds appear to function through a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion–mediated up-regulation of a subset of cytoplasmic and ER lumenal chaperones, possibly by activating signaling pathways that mitigate cellular stress. We have shown that increasing ER calcium levels appears to be a relatively selective strategy to partially restore mutant lysosomal enzyme homeostasis in diseases caused by the misfolding and degradation of nonhomologous mutant enzymes. Because diltiazem crosses the blood–brain barrier, it may be useful for the treatment of neuropathic lysosomal storage diseases, and possibly other loss-of-function diseases, although efficacy needs to be demonstrated.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cells usually maintain a balance between protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, aggregation, and degradation—which is referred to as protein homeostasis—by using sensors and networks of pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b002">2</xref>]. Human loss-of-function diseases are often the result of a disruption of normal protein homeostasis, which is typically caused by a mutation in a given protein that compromises its cellular folding, leading to efficient degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b003">3</xref>]. Thus, there is insufficient function, because the concentration of the mutant protein is exceedingly low.</p>
      <p>There are at least 40 distinct lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) resulting from the deficient function of a single mutated enzyme in the lysosome, leading to accumulation of corresponding substrate(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b005">5</xref>]. Currently, LSDs are treated by enzyme replacement therapy, which can be challenging because the endocytic system has to be used to get the recombinant enzyme into the lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b006">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>The most prevalent LSD is Gaucher disease (GD), which is caused by a deficiency in the activity of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GC), a glycolipid hydrolase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b007">7</xref>]. Glucosylceramide accumulation in Gaucher monocyte-macrophage cells leads to hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone lesions, and in severe cases, central nervous system (CNS) involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b008">8</xref>]. Patients without CNS involvement are classified as type I (mild adult onset), whereas those with CNS involvement are classified as type II (acute infantile onset) or type III (subacute juvenile or early adult onset). The clinically most important GC mutations, such as N370S, the most common mutation associated with type I GD, and L444P, the most prevalent mutation resulting in CNS involvement, predispose GC to misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), subjecting these variants to ER-associated degradation (ERAD), reducing the normal amount of mutant GC trafficking to the lysosome. Thus, the mutant GC concentration in the lysosome is substantially reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b010">10</xref>]. Many of the folding-deficient GC variants exhibit fractional specific activity when properly folded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b011">11</xref>], demonstrating that if folding and trafficking of the mutated enzymes could be enhanced, it is likely that the disease would be ameliorated.</p>
      <p>The US Food and Drug Adminidtration (FDA) has approved enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy to treat type I GD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b012">12</xref>]. There is currently no effective treatment for neuropathic GD (types II and III); the recombinant GC enzyme does not cross the blood–brain barrier and the efficacy of the substrate reduction drug in the CNS remains unclear, hence a novel strategy for neuropathic GD would be welcomed. Pharmacological chaperoning is an emerging therapeutic strategy that uses ER-permeable small molecules that bind to and stabilize the folded state of a given enzyme, enabling its trafficking to the Golgi and onward to the lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b023">23</xref>]. Whereas patient-derived cells harboring most GD-associated mutations appear to be amenable to pharmacological chaperoning, cell lines harboring the L444P GC mutation have thus far proven refractory, although alternative dosing regimens could ultimately be useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b017">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>α-Mannosidosis and type IIIA mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) are neuropathic LSDs caused by the inability of the lysosome to degrade glycoproteins and heparan sulfate, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b025">25</xref>]. The P356R mutation in lysosomal α -mannosidase alters the folding energy landscape resulting in severe infantile α-mannosidosis associated with rapid mental deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b026">26</xref>]. The prevalent S66W or R245H heparan sulfate sulfamidase (SGSH) mutations in type IIIA MPS reduce mutant enzyme concentrations in the lysosome, most likely due to impaired folding and ERAD in lieu of efficient folding and trafficking of sulfamidase, leading to the accumulation of heparan sulfate and severe CNS degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b027">27</xref>]. Currently no effective therapy is available for α-mannosidosis or type IIIA MPS, hence new strategies for these neuropathic LSDs would be welcomed.</p>
      <p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is a universal and extremely important signaling ion in the cell. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling affects numerous cellular functions by diverse pathways and is a primary regulator of ER function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b030">30</xref>]. Emerging evidence indicates that calcium signaling may influence diseases associated with deficiencies in protein homeostasis, including many LSDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b032">32</xref>]. This hypothesis is supported by observations that manipulation of calcium homeostasis by sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitors, such as thapsigargin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b033">33</xref>] and curcumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b034">34</xref>], enhances folding and trafficking of the ΔF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).</p>
      <p>The hypothesis that manipulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis might improve defects in mutant enzyme homeostasis that lead to LSDs was scrutinized. Small molecules were sought that enhance the folding, trafficking, and function of endogenous mutant lysosomal enzymes in multiple cell lines associated with different LSDs, thus restoring function by repairing instead of replacing the damaged enzyme through altering calcium homeostasis. In this quest, we discovered that the FDA-approved drugs diltiazem and verapamil, both L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b035">35</xref>], partially restored mutant lysosomal enzyme function in three distinct LSDs caused by folding defects in nonhomologous enzymes. These results suggest that calcium channel blockers are promising candidates to enhance lysosomal enzyme homeostasis in a variety of LSDs, although more investigation is necessary to demonstrate clinical utility and safety.</p>

        <title>The L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> Channel Blockers Diltiazem and Verapamil Enhance Lysosomal GC Activity in Gaucher Patient-Derived Fibroblast Cell Lines</title>
        <p>Several type I, II, and III Gaucher fibroblast cell lines were evaluated to discern the relative activity of the mutant GC harbored by equal numbers of cells reflected by an equal amount of total protein in the cell lysate. The residual enzymatic activities of the GC variants were measured using the lysed cell activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Under the assay conditions used, L444P GC exhibits 12% of the activity of wild-type (WT) GC; N370S GC, 32%; N370S/V394L GC, 28%; N370S/84GG GC, 19%; and G202R GC, 10% of the activity of WT GC. The exact enzyme activity measured is highly dependent on the assay conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b017">17</xref>]. The enzyme activities displayed were normalized to the activity of untreated cells of the same type and expressed as fold changes. In addition, mutant GC activity before and after treatment was also expressed as the percentage of WT GC activity to calibrate the reader.</p>

        <p>Gaucher patient–derived fibroblasts harboring the L444P GC mutation grown at 30 °C, instead of at 37 °C, exhibit enhanced folding, trafficking, lysosomal localization, and activity of L444P GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b010">10</xref>]. Because a change in temperature alters both the physical chemistry of the L444P protein and the cellular protein homeostasis machinery, the hypothesis that cells were readjusting their protein homeostasis capacity through their thermosensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels was tested. Fifteen thermosensitive TRP channel modulators (capsaicin, resiniferatoxin, piperine, olvanil, anandamide, 2-APB, camphor, 4α-PDD, menthol, eucalyptol, icilin, cinnamaldehyde, allylisothiocyanate, capsazepine, and ruthenium red) were administered to homozygous L444P GC patient–derived fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b037">37</xref>]. Enhanced L444P GC folding and trafficking could be inferred from increased lysosomal L444P GC activity measured using the intact cell GC enzyme assay. Only ruthenium red notably increased L444P GC activity after a 5-d incubation period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060026-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Because the only TRP channel modulator that enhanced lysosomal L444P GC activity was also a nonspecific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, the observed increase might be a consequence of a lowered intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration, and thus it seemed unlikely that TRP channel modulation is the means by which temperature regulates the intracellular protein homeostasis capacity.</p>
        <p>The hypothesis that ruthenium red was lowering the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration and enhancing GC folding fidelity by that means was scrutinized experimentally by blocking calcium entry into the cell through its calcium channels, including voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and ionotropic glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b039">39</xref>]. Lysosomal L444P GC activity was evaluated after the separate application of nine representative VGCC blockers—namely diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, nimodipine, loperamide, mibefradil, ethosuximide, flunarizine, and bepridil—five representative ionotropic glutamate receptor inhibitors—namely CGP 39551, 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, DNQX, Evans blue, and felbamate—and other calcium channel blockers—such as amiodarone, cinnarizine, and SKF 96365—to L444P GC patient-derived fibroblasts. The intact cell GC activity assay revealed that only diltiazem and verapamil (chemical structures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) increased L444P GC activity significantly. Diltiazem increased L444P GC activity a maximum of 2.0-fold (to ≈24% of normal cellular WT GC activity) after a 5-d incubation period, and 2.3-fold after a 7-d incubation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, left panel) at a 10 μM concentration (all concentrations mentioned are cell culture concentrations unless otherwise stated), implying an increased lysosomal L444P GC concentration. The temporal dependence of the diltiazem-mediated cellular L444P GC activity increase is very similar to the time dependence of the cellular N370S GC activity increase observed upon pharmacological chaperone treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b017">17</xref>]. The slow gain in activity of the GC variants is partially a result of the slower folding and trafficking of the variants as revealed by prior pulse chase experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b040">40</xref>] and partially for other reasons, including the apparent requirement for the transcription and translation of selected chaperones (vide infra). This slow mutant GC activity increase upon pharmacological chaperone or diltiazem administration is also observed upon pharmacological chaperone administration in different LSDs such as Fabry disease, Tay-Sachs disease, and Pompe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b041">41</xref>].</p>
        <p>To confirm that the effect of diltiazem was not restricted to one L444P GC patient-derived cell line, two additional patient-derived homozygous L444P GC fibroblast cell lines were treated with diltiazem. In a type II cell line, diltiazem (15 μM) increased the GC activity up to 2.0-fold after an incubation period of 5 d and up to 2.5-fold after 7 d of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, middle panel). Diltiazem (10 μM) treatment of a type III Gaucher patient-derived cell line increased L444P GC activity to a maximum of 2.1-fold after a 5-d incubation period and up to 2.3-fold after a 7-d incubation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, right panel). Lysosomal L444P GC activity was improved in all the neuropathic fibroblast cell lines evaluated.</p>
        <p>If diltiazem regulates mutant GC homeostasis by a general mechanism, such as a cellular chaperone–mediated mechanism, and not by binding induced pharmacological chaperoning, it should also be able to enhance the folding, trafficking and activity of other misfolding-prone GC variants in homozygous and compound heterozygous Gaucher patient-derived cell lines. Diltiazem (10 μM) increased N370S GC activity up to 2.0-fold (to ≈64% of untreated WT GC activity) after a 5-d incubation period and up to 2.5-fold after a 7-d incubation period in N370S GC fibroblasts from a homozygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, left panel), analogous to the best results obtained with optimized pharmacological chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b022">22</xref>]. In the case of a compound heterozygous N370S/V394L GC cell line, diltiazem (10 μM) increased the GC activity up to 3.2-fold (to ≈89% of cellular WT GC activity) after an incubation period of 5 d and up to 3.7-fold after 7 d of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, middle panel). In the analogous N370S/84GG GC cell line, diltiazem (10 μM) increased the GC activity up to 1.9-fold (to ≈36% of cellular WT GC activity) after a 5-d treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, right panel). Diltiazem (20 μM) increased G202R GC activity up to 4.6-fold (to ≈46% of cellular WT GC activity) after a 5-d incubation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>E, green line), demonstrating the generality of diltiazem to regulate GC protein homeostasis. Notably, diltiazem (20 μM) increases WT GC activity up to 2.6-fold after 5 d of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>E, pink line), suggesting that the folding and trafficking of WT GC is inefficient, as is the case for other proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b042">42</xref>] and ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b043">43</xref>].</p>
        <p>The influence of diltiazem on the cellular activity of other WT lysosomal hydrolases, namely α-mannosidase, α-glucosidase, β-galactosidase, α-galactosidase, and β-glucuronidase was evaluated. WT fibroblasts and L444P GC fibroblasts were incubated with diltiazem (10 μM) for 5 d before the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060026-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). While diltiazem treatment increased GC activity, it did not significantly increase the activity of other WT lysosomal enzymes, implying that the folding and trafficking of these enzymes is near optimal.</p>
        <p>A second L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, verapamil (3 μM), increased L444P GC activity up to 1.5-fold (to ≈18% of cellular WT GC activity) and N370S/V394L GC activity up to 1.9-fold (to ≈53% of cellular WT GC activity) after a 7-d incubation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>F; lysed cell activity assay). That both diltiazem and verapamil, which are Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers with distinct chemical structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), enhance cellular mutant GC folding, trafficking, and activity supports the hypothesis that altering intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis influences lysosomal enzyme homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Ruling out a Pharmacological Chaperoning Mechanism and a Direct Lysosomal GC Activation Mechanism</title>
        <p>All of the GC pharmacological chaperones discovered to date are active-site–directed stabilizers and are thus enzyme inhibitors; therefore we evaluated whether diltiazem binds to the active site and inhibits GC. Lysed L444P fibroblasts and lysed N370S/V394L cells were incubated with diltiazem (0.01 to 1000 μM) and assayed. No significant GC inhibition was observed in either case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, pink and green lines). Cerezyme, a recombinant version of WT GC, was also incubated with diltiazem (0.01–1000 μM), revealing lack of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, black line). As a positive control, an established GC pharmacological chaperone—N-(<italic>n</italic>-nonyl)deoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ), exhibiting a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value of 1.08 μM toward Cerezyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, blue line)—exhibited inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b014">14</xref>]. Collectively, these results demonstrate that diltiazem does not bind to the active site of GC ex vivo and is unlikely to function as a pharmacological chaperone.</p>
        <p>To evaluate whether diltiazem could directly activate the existing lysosomal GC pool, L444P and N370S/V394L GC fibroblasts were incubated with diltiazem (1–100 μM) for 1 h, and the GC activity was measured using the intact cell assay. No activity increase was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060026-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), demonstrating that the GC activity increase could not be achieved on this short time scale, a result inconsistent with direct diltiazem-induced, saposin-mediated activation of GC. A relatively long incubation period (5 d) is required to maximally increase intralysosomal L444P GC activity 2.0-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, left panel) and N370S/V394L GC activity 3.2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, middle panel), suggesting that diltiazem likely requires new GC synthesis to achieve enhanced GC activity, consistent with the nearly identical rates of GC activity increases mediated by diltiazem treatment and pharmacological chaperone treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b017">17</xref>].</p>

        <title>Diltiazem Enhances Proper GC Folding and Trafficking</title>
        <p>Cellular trafficking of L444P and N370S/V394L GC appears to be reduced because of ERAD outcompeting folding and trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b009">9</xref>]. Fluorescence microscopy was previously used to demonstrate that active-site–directed pharmacological chaperones enhance the folding and trafficking of G202R GC to the lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b010">10</xref>]. Strictly analogous immunofluorescence microscopy methods were used to demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers increase L444P and N370S/V394L GC trafficking to the lysosome. L444P GC harboring fibroblasts were cultured without or with 10 μM diltiazem for 14 d before plating for microscopy. WT GC fibroblasts were also studied analogously as a positive control. A properly folded and trafficked GC protein will colocalize with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b010">10</xref>]. WT GC distributed in a punctate manner, and colocalized with LAMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g002">Figure 2</xref>F, column 3, row 3, GC in green, LAMP2 in red, and overlap artificially colored white). This color scheme is used only for the colocalization row; for single staining experiments (the first two rows), the fluorescence images are artificially colored white to improve contrast. While the L444P GC variant was not visible without diltiazem treatment, due to extensive ERAD, it was easily detected and was distributed in a punctate manner after diltiazem treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g002">Figure 2</xref>G, column 1). L444P GC colocalized with LAMP2 after diltiazem treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g002">Figure 2</xref>G, column 3, GC in green, LAMP2 in red, and overlap artificially colored white), indicating increased lysosomal trafficking, consistent with the increase in cellular GC concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) and the increase in enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Previous experiments demonstrate that the N370S GC distribution is partially lysosomal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b010">10</xref>].

N370S/V394L GC fibroblasts were incubated without and with 5 μM diltiazem for 7 d before plating for microscopy. WT GC fibroblasts served as a control. While measurable N370S/V394L GC colocalizes with the lysosome, there is substantially less N370S/V394L GC in the lysosome in comparison to WT GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g002">Figure 2</xref>F, compare column 2 with column 3), consistent with significant ERAD.

        <p>L444P GC fibroblasts were cultured with compounds <bold>1–6</bold> (0.3–100 μM) for 7 d, and dose-response curves were recorded using the intact cell GC activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Compounds <bold>1</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.98 μM) and <bold>2</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.46 μM) are potent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists and exhibit notable L444P lysosomal GC activity increases to a maximum of 2.3-fold for <bold>1</bold> and 2.1-fold for <bold>2</bold> at 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, black lines). Compounds <bold>3</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 45.5 μM) and <bold>4</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 126.7 μM) are both weak Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists and weak L444P GC activity enhancers. Notably, only at much higher concentrations (30 μM) do these low-potency analogs exhibit a maximum increase in L444P GC activity of 1.3-fold for <bold>3</bold> and 1.2-fold for <bold>4</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, pink lines). Compounds <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold> are not Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists, and, as such, these closely related analogs do not increase L444P GC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, green lines). These data demonstrate that the more potent the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channel blocker, the higher the lysosomal GC activity enhancement observed. Diltiazem and its analogs reveal analogous results in N370S/V394L fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). Compound <bold>1</bold> (10 μM) increased N370S/V394L GC activity to a maximum of 3.6-fold, whereas compound <bold>2</bold> (10 μM) afforded a 2.8-fold increase, more than the increases observed with L444P cells. High concentrations of compounds <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold> (&gt;10 μM) are toxic to both L444P and N370S/V394L fibroblasts. At 100 μM, compounds <bold>1–4</bold> also lower GC activity due to cytotoxicity.</p>
        <p>To further investigate the idea that diltiazem enhances GC activity by blocking plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channels, thus lowering intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, thapsigargin—a potent SERCA inhibitor—was applied to L444P GC cells without or with 10 μM diltiazem for 7 d. Thapsigargin inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the ER from the cytosol, presumably leading to an increase in intracytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b033">33</xref>]. Therefore, diltiazem and thapsigargin have opposite effects on regulating cytosolic calcium homeostasis. Thapsigargin alone had no influence on GC activity until a concentration of 1 nM was reached; above this concentration, thapsigargin decreased L444P GC activity significantly after 7-d incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060026-sg004">Figure S4</xref>, pink line). Co-application of varying concentrations of thapsigargin with 10 μM diltiazem revealed a thapsigargin dose-dependent decrease of GC activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060026-sg004">Figure S4</xref>, blue line), consistent with the hypothesis that these compounds have opposite influences on cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion levels and that lower rather than higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels enhance mutant GC homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Diltiazem Treatment Up-Regulates the Expression of Chaperones</title>
        <p>Molecular chaperones are known to be essential for the maintenance of cellular protein homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b049">49</xref>]; hence it is possible that elevated chaperone expression levels could be responsible for the observed diltiazem-mediated enhancement in lysosomal enzyme homeostasis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed on L444P GC fibroblasts incubated without and with 10 μM diltiazem for 1 d and 7 d. The relative mRNA expression levels of representative cytoplasmic and ER lumenal chaperones—including Hsp40, Hsp70, BiP, Hsp90, GRP94, calnexin, calreticulin, HIP, and HOP—were probed and normalized to the levels found in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The large ribosomal protein (RiboP) was monitored as a control. All the primer pairs used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060026-st001">Table S1</xref>. The mRNA expression levels of BiP, Hsp40, and Hsp90 were increased up to 1.8-fold, 1.8-fold, and 1.9-fold, respectively, after a 7-d treatment with diltiazem, whereas the mRNA expression levels of Hsp70, GRP94, calnexin, and calreticulin were not changed significantly. A strictly analogous RT-PCR analysis of N370S/V394L GC fibroblasts reveals similarly increased mRNA expression levels of Hsp40, however BiP and Hsp90 exhibit less of an increase after 7 d of diltiazem treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060026-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Western blot analysis was also performed on L444P GC fibroblasts incubated without and with diltiazem (10 μM) for 4 d and 7 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). The increased protein expression levels of BiP, Hsp40, and Hsp90 were confirmed after a 7-d treatment with diltiazem. That the expression levels of GRP94, Hsp70, calnexin, and calreticulin were not changed significantly was also confirmed at the protein level. These increases in molecular chaperone expression levels, especially the cytoplasmic Hsp40 levels, seem to account for the increased GC folding capacity of the ER, and the requirement for new transcription may also contribute to the relatively slow increases in lysosomal enzyme levels upon calcium channel blocker treatment. Given the highly dynamic nature of the ER, it is envisioned that the cytosolic chaperones play a role in creating an ER optimized for protein folding and trafficking.</p>

        <p>Lysosomal α-mannosidase is a broad-specificity exoglycosidase involved in the ordered degradation of glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b024">24</xref>]. The P356R mutation in the α-mannosidase enzyme appears to compromise folding and trafficking, leading to very low lysosomal α-mannosidase activity and severe α-mannosidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b026">26</xref>]. The activity of cells harboring P356R α-mannosidase is approximately 18% of that of WT α-mannosidase, under the assay conditions used. Incubation of these cells with a range of diltiazem or verapamil concentrations for 1, 4, 7, and 10 d enabled lysed cell enzyme activity analysis to be performed. Diltiazem (35 μM) increased the P356R α-mannosidase activity up to 2.0-fold after 7-d incubation period (≈36% the activity of WT α-mannosidase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

        <p>The MPS type IIIA LSD is caused by a deficiency of SGSH, resulting in the defective degradation and storage of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b025">25</xref>]. The common S66W and R245H mutations in type IIIA MPS lead to reduced specific activity (15% and 83% of normal specific activity for S66W and R245H, respectively) and lower cellular concentrations, likely a result of compromised folding and trafficking of the sulfamidase variants to the lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b027">27</xref>]. Two compound heterozygous MPS cell lines were used to evaluate the effect of diltiazem or verapamil, using an intact cell enzyme activity assay. In the case of the S66W/V131M MPS cells, diltiazem (50 μM) or verapamil (10 μM) treatment increased S66W/V131M sulfamidase activity up to 2.1-fold and 1.9-fold (≈30 % of WT sulfamidase activity), respectively, after a 5-d treatment, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report the discovery that the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil restore partial folding, trafficking, and enzyme function to patient-derived fibroblasts in three distinct LSDs, disorders involving deficiencies in nonhomologous lysosomal enzymes that perform distinct chemical reactions. That these Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers are both FDA-approved drugs provides the incentive to conduct further necessary efficacy and safety experiments to discern whether they are promising candidates to ultimately treat neuropathic GD and related LSDs. Fortunately, diltiazem crosses the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b050">50</xref>] and is bioavailable in the μM concentration range in blood plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b051">51</xref>].</p>
      <p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channel blocker potency of diltiazem and its analogs correlates with their efficiency to enhance GC folding in the ER, enabling trafficking and the lysosomal localization of mutant GC in patient-derived fibroblast cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b052">52</xref>]. But how is the blockage of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels on the plasma membrane by diltiazem coupled to enhanced mutant GC homeostasis? Activation of these channels allows extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter the cytosol, which subsequently induces further Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion release from intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, such as the ER, by activating ryanodine receptors, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channels within the ER membrane. Inhibiting this calcium-induced calcium release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b053">53</xref>] pathway minimizes depletion of the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store, a process that appears to up-regulate the expression of a subset of cytosolic and ER chaperones, especially Hsp40. How blockage of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels on the plasma membrane by diltiazem and verapamil influences gene transcription in the nucleus is unclear, and this signaling cascade merits further investigation.</p>
      <p>Others have reported that the reduction in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentrations by SERCA inhibitors, such as curcumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b034">34</xref>] and thapsigargin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b033">33</xref>], enhance folding and trafficking of ΔF508 CFTR. However, thapsigargin does not enhance L444P GC folding, trafficking, or lysosomal activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060026-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Nor does diltiazem treatment increase the trafficking of ΔF508 CFTR to the plasma membrane (William E. Balch, personal communication). Diltiazem blocks calcium entry into the cytosol, whereas thapsigargin inhibits calcium movement from the cytosol into the ER. Therefore, diltiazem and thapsigargin regulate calcium homeostasis oppositely, presumably explaining why diltiazem and thapsigargin partially correct defective protein homeostasis in GD and cystic fibrosis, respectively.</p>
      <p>Diltiazem is an FDA-approved small molecule used to treat angina and hypertension marketed under names including Cardizem, Dilacor, and Tiazec. Unlike pharmacological chaperones that directly bind to GC, thus stabilizing the folded enzyme in the ER for trafficking to the Golgi and on to the lysosome, diltiazem treatment of fibroblasts derived from patients with GD appears to alter the biological folding capacity of the ER. Diltiazem is well-tolerated, and the incidence of side effects is low. Its pharmacological properties have been extensively studied and reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b055">55</xref>]. Whereas diltiazem exhibited its best efficacy at increasing GC activity in patient-derived fibroblasts when used at a culture concentration of 10 μM, its lowest effective cell culture media concentration is in the range of 0.1–1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060026-g003">3</xref>), equivalent to human plasma levels achieved by oral dosing.</p>

        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Diltiazem and verapamil, potent FDA-approved L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker drugs, increased the ER folding capacity, trafficking, and activity of mutant lysosmal enzymes associated with three distinct LSDs. These compounds likely act through a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion mediated up-regulation of a subset of cytoplasmic and ER lumenal chaperones. Increasing ER calcium levels appears to be a relatively selective strategy to partially restore mutant lysosomal enzyme homeostasis in patient-derived cells, as ΔF508 CFTR folding efficiency and the folding efficiency of several other cellular WT enzymes was unaffected by these Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers.</p>

        <p>The intact cell GC activity assay has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b014">14</xref>]. Briefly, cells were plated into 48-well assay plates (500 μl per well). After cell attachment, the media was replaced by media containing small molecules. Media was changed every 3 d. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated amount of time, the intact cell GC activity assay was performed. The monolayers were washed by DPBS. The reaction was started by the addition of 150 μl of 3 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside in 0.2 M acetate buffer (pH 4.0) to each well, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1–7 h. CBE was used as a control to evaluate the extent of nonspecific GC activity. The reaction was stopped by lysing the cells with 750 μl of 0.2 M glycine buffer (pH 10.8). Liberated 4-methylumbelliferone was measured (excitation 365 nm, emission 445 nm) with a SpectraMax Gemini plate reader (Molecular Devices). The lysed cell GC activity assay has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060026-b014">14</xref>].

Total cell protein was measured using the Micro BCA assay reagent (Pierce #23235). Thirty μg of total cell protein was assayed for the GC activity in 100 μl of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 3 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside in the presence of 0.15% Triton X-100 (v/v, Fisher) and 0.15% taurodeoxycholate (w/v, Calbiochem).

        <p>The cells were incubated with 10 μM diltiazem at 37 °C for the indicated amount of time. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen #74104). cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen #205311). Quantitative PCR reactions were performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen #204143) and corresponding primers in the ABI PRISM 7900 system (Applied Biosystems). The forward and reverse primers for GC, Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsp90, HIP, HOP, BiP, GRP94, calnexin (CNX), and calreticulin (CRT), and an endogenous housekeeping gene large ribosomal protein (RiboP) are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060026-st001">Table S1</xref>. Samples were heated for 15 min at 95 °C and amplified in 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 59 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Analysis was done using SDS2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). Threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) was extracted from the PCR amplification plot. The ΔC<sub>T</sub> value was used to describe the difference between the C<sub>T</sub> of a target gene and the C<sub>T</sub> of the housekeeping gene: ΔC<sub>T</sub> = C<sub>T</sub> (target gene) – C<sub>T</sub> (housekeeping gene). The relative mRNA expression level of a target gene of diltiazem-treated cells was normalized to that of untreated cells: Relative mRNA expression level = 2 exp [–(ΔC<sub>T</sub> (treated cells) – ΔC<sub>T</sub> (untreated cells))].</p>
