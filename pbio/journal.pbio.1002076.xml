<abstract>
<p>Gene expression dynamics have provided foundational insight into almost all biological processes. Here, we analyze expression of environmentally responsive genes and transcription factor genes to infer signals and pathways that drive pathogen gene regulation during invasive <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infection of a mammalian host. Environmentally responsive gene expression shows that there are early and late phases of infection. The early phase includes induction of zinc and iron limitation genes, genes that respond to transcription factor Rim101, and genes characteristic of invasive hyphal cells. The late phase includes responses related to phagocytosis by macrophages. Transcription factor gene expression also reflects early and late phases. Transcription factor genes that are required for virulence or proliferation in vivo are enriched among highly expressed transcription factor genes. Mutants defective in six transcription factor genes, three previously studied in detail (Rim101, Efg1, Zap1) and three less extensively studied (Rob1, Rpn4, Sut1), are profiled during infection. Most of these mutants have distinct gene expression profiles during infection as compared to in vitro growth. Infection profiles suggest that Sut1 acts in the same pathway as Zap1, and we verify that functional relationship with the finding that overexpression of either <italic>ZAP1</italic> or the Zap1-dependent zinc transporter gene <italic>ZRT2</italic> restores pathogenicity to a <italic>sut1</italic> mutant. Perturbation with the cell wall inhibitor caspofungin also has distinct gene expression impact in vivo and in vitro. Unexpectedly, caspofungin induces many of the same genes that are repressed early during infection, a phenomenon that we suggest may contribute to drug efficacy. The pathogen response circuitry is tailored uniquely during infection, with many relevant regulatory relationships that are not evident during growth in vitro. Our findings support the principle that virulence is a property that is manifested only in the distinct environment in which host–pathogen interaction occurs.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>We have a limited understanding of how the expression of pathogens’ genes changes during infection of humans or other animal hosts, in contrast to <italic>in vitro</italic> models of infection. Here we profile the alteration in gene expression over time as a predictor of functional consequences during invasive growth of <italic>Candida</italic> in the kidney; a situation in which the limited number of pathogen cells makes gene expression challenging to assay. Our findings reveal that there are distinct early and late phases of infection, and identify new genes that govern the early zinc acquisition response necessary for proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>—and thus required for infection. We also find that the response to drug treatment that manifests during infection can be distinct from that detected <italic>in vitro</italic>. We show that a well-known gene expression response to the antifungal drug caspofungin is naturally down-regulated in infecting cells, suggesting that the efficacy of the drug may be enhanced by a susceptible state of the pathogen during invasive proliferation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Which genes does a pathogen express during infection? Which regulatory pathways govern expression of those genes in vivo? These questions are central to the study of microbial pathogenesis, and they have been addressed by diverse approaches [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite those efforts, we have a limited understanding of gene expression dynamics during infection of humans or animals by most pathogens. Even new genome-wide technologies on the horizon face several well-acknowledged technical hurdles before they can be implemented in tissues of infected animals [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Here, we have used an exquisitely sensitive technology to elucidate gene regulation during tissue invasion by the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is a human commensal that lives on mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Deep tissue infection begins when the organism gains access to the bloodstream due to disruption of mucosal surfaces or biofilm growth on an implanted device. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> disseminates via the bloodstream and can infect almost any tissue [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A mouse hematogenously disseminated candidiasis (HDC) infection model, in which <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> yeast cells are inoculated into the lateral tail vein, has been widely used to study invasive candidiasis [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> invades and infects virtually all tissues, the kidney is the principal target organ. In the kidney, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> proliferates as hyphae [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which are long tubular cells attached end to end. During the first 12 hr postinfection, relatively few fungal cells are present in the kidney. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα and IL-1β, are detected in the kidney and in circulation by this time [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. By 24 hr, the fungal burden increases by a factor of 100, and leukocyte infiltration begins. By 48 hr, the fungal burden increases by another factor of 10, and leukocyte infiltration is extensive [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Prior studies have profiled gene expression in the kidney during invasive <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection using microarray technology [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These pioneering studies established several basic principles that have shaped the thinking in <italic>Candida</italic> infection biology. Specifically, examination of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> gene expression revealed the induction of stress response genes, adhesins, and fatty acid utilization genes during infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. One study, which used yeast-form cell RNA for comparison, detected induction of hyphal genes, as expected from the extensive hyphal growth observed in infected kidney [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These findings argued that adaptation ability is central for proliferation in a novel niche like the kidney, and that hyphal morphogenesis during infection is accompanied by the hyphal gene expression program that has been characterized during growth in vitro. Host gene expression in the kidney is also broadly affected at 24 hr postinfection [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There is extensive induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, including IL-6, Kc/Cxcl1, Cxcl10, Cxcl11, Cxcl13, IL-1β, and Tnfα [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, there is substantial induction of host pattern recognition receptor genes and their signaling pathway components, including TLR2, Dectin-2,DC-Sign, and Myd88 [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These profiling studies paint a picture of kidney invasion in which <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> proliferates in hyphal form, adapting to such stresses as the need to use alternative carbon sources, and induces a pro-inflammatory response in the host that ultimately leads to leukocyte trafficking into the kidney.</p>
<p>While prior profiling studies have provided foundational insight into mammalian infection, the dynamic range and sensitivity of microarray signals [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] may have limited detection of key regulatory genes that govern the infection process. In addition, while reliable gene expression signals were recorded for infection with wild-type <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> strains, it was unclear whether those profiling approaches could be applied under conditions in which organ fungal burden was diminished, such as with attenuated mutants or after drug therapy. We have recently implemented nanoString technology for analysis of pathogen gene expression during infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For oral and abdominal <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection models, in which pathogen cells are relatively numerous, we have been able to collect a snapshot of infection samples and elucidate the roles of two well-established virulence regulators, Bcr1 and Rim101 [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Here we turn our attention to the most widely used <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection model to capture the first time-course analysis, to our knowledge, of large-scale gene expression during invasive <italic>Candida</italic> infection. Our findings elucidate the unique functional interactions among virulence regulators that are manifested during infection and document an unexpected relationship between genes that respond to the infection environment and to antifungal therapy.</p>

<title>Environmentally Responsive Gene Expression during Invasive Infection</title>
<p>We used a nanoString n-counter [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to quantify selected <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> gene transcripts in whole kidney lysates at 12, 24, and 48 hr postinfection. We first tested our methodology using a probe set that contained 248 environmentally responsive genes chosen from previously described genome-wide datasets (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>). Expression levels of these genes are known to respond to a range of signals, such as nutrient limitation and cell morphogenesis. Also, many of the response pathways that govern their expression are known to impact virulence, as inferred from mutant analysis and comparisons to other pathogens [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. NanoString probe background signals were assessed by comparing uninfected and infected tissue samples. Signal-to-noise ratios for the majority of probes in all samples fell into the range of 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.). Agreement among independent samples was excellent (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.; R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.94 to &gt;0.99), and induction ratios were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) for all eight genes examined (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>.). Probe signals from infected tissue samples varied over a range of three orders of magnitude, and comparison with pure <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cultures indicated that pathogen RNA makes up 0.2% or less of the total RNA in the infected kidney over the 48 hr time frame examined. These results show that this approach can reliably detect <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> RNAs of low abundance in invasive infection samples.</p>
<p>To assess changes in gene expression during infection, we compared the infected tissue samples to each other and to inoculum samples (stationary phase in yeast extract peptone dextrose medium [YPD]). The results revealed that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> undergoes both early and late infection responses (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>). The early gene expression response comprises genes with RNA levels significantly different from the inoculum at 12 hr postinfection (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and ≥2-fold change in expression; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We found 65 up-regulated early genes and 74 down-regulated early genes. The late gene expression response comprises genes with RNA levels that are significantly different from the 12 hr time point at 48 hr postinfection (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>). We found 79 up-regulated late genes and 13 down-regulated late genes. These results indicate that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> gene expression is dynamically regulated during invasive infection of a mammalian host.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> environmentally responsive genes during invasive infection.</title>
<p>Changes in expression levels during mouse kidney invasion for 248 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> genes (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>) are presented in a heat map format. Mean values of biological triplicates are shown for up-regulation (yellow) and down-regulation (blue) of genes at 12, 24, and 48 hr postinfection relative to mean inoculum levels (0 hr). Color saturation represents the extent of the expression change, with full saturation at 10-fold up- or down-regulation. (All heat maps in this article follow the same color scale.) Portions of the heat map are expanded to illustrate representative early up-regulated genes (top), late genes (middle), and early down-regulated genes (bottom). In these portions, individual samples are presented separately to illustrate reproducibility. We define early expression changes as significant differences between the inoculum and 12 hr sample. We define late expression changes as significant differences between the 12 and 48 hr samples. Significance refers to changes of ≥2-fold and a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05. The data for each sample were normalized to RNA levels from control gene <italic>TDH3</italic> before mean values were calculated. Our assignment criteria allow some dynamically regulated genes to fall into both the early and late expression classes. All numerical data for this figure are in <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Data</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>To interpret the early and late gene expression changes, we compared our data to 166 published gene expression studies (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Data</xref>). We identified significant correlations among genes with expression changes of 2-fold or greater between datasets, as assessed with Fisher's exact test (FET). The most significant correlations were with genes up-regulated during invasive infection (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Early up-regulated genes correlated well with genes expressed during the yeast-to-hyphal transition, including growth at 37° in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (RPMI), Lee's medium, Spider medium, or serum, all compared to growth at 30° in YPD. This correlation extended to the profiles of mutants defective in regulation of hyphal formation. For example, early up-regulated genes correlated with those up-regulated in a hyperfilamentous <italic>tup1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant (“tup1/wild type [WT]” dataset in <xref rid="pbio.1002076.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and with those down-regulated in a nonfilamentous <italic>tec1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant (“WT/tec1” dataset in <xref rid="pbio.1002076.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Early up-regulated genes also correlated well with genes that are repressed by iron acquisition gene repressor Sfu1 (“sfu1/WT” dataset) or activated by zinc acquisition gene activator Zap1/Csr1 (“WT/zap1” dataset). There was also a strong correlation with genes that depend upon transcription factor Rim101 for expression ("WT/rim101" dataset). Although Rim101-dependent genes overlap with yeast-to-hyphal genes, the correlation was significant with Rim101-dependent genes from an <italic>nrg1Δ/Δ</italic> background, in which hyphal gene expression changes were minimized [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There was also significant similarity to genes that were up-regulated mid-way through a zebrafish infection (“8 hr postinfection [PI]” dataset [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), a point we return to in the Discussion. These correlations suggest the hypothesis that hyphal formation, iron limitation, zinc limitation, and Rim101 activation may be driving forces that govern early gene expression responses. We tested several of those inferences through the profiling of mutant strains presented below.</p>

<title>Comparison of gene expression profiles during invasive infection to other profiling datasets.</title>
<p>Dataset comparisons were carried out with one sided Fisher's Exact Test (FET), using query gene sets from in vivo profiling data (applying a cutoff at 2-fold expression changes), and the entire set of nanoString probes (i.e., 248 environmental response genes) as a background set. Queries were matched to a database we assembled from 166 published expression datasets (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Data</xref>). (A). Representative matches to early up-regulated genes are shown with their respective <italic>p</italic>-values (top; higher bars indicate smaller <italic>p</italic>-values from FET, hence greater similarity between the two datasets), and in a heat map (bottom; same color scale as in <xref rid="pbio.1002076.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; grey color indicates that no significant expression difference was reported and expression ratios were not readily available). (B). Representative matches to late up-regulated genes are shown with their respective <italic>p</italic>-values and in a heat map. Comprehensive FET results are available in <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Data</xref>. Early and late gene sets are as defined in the <xref rid="pbio.1002076.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> legend.

</fig>
<p>The late up-regulated genes correlated significantly with a distinct spectrum of gene expression responses (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The late up-regulated genes correlated with genes up-regulated at late times during zebrafish infection. In addition, they correlated with genes induced by growth on acetate as carbon source, compared to glucose. The acetate response was assayed by Lorenz et al. [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to model the metabolic state induced after phagocytosis by macrophages, and indeed the late infection response we describe here correlates with the response to co-culture with macrophages and to peroxide stress (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Interestingly, we note that the zinc- and iron-limitation responses that were prominent early in infection begin to subside. This point is illustrated by the fact that early genes correlated with the "WT/zap1" dataset, while late genes correlate with its inverse, designated "zap1/WT." This reversal of iron and zinc responses may reflect a release of nutrients from damaged tissue, a phenomenon documented by Potrykus et al. with respect to iron levels [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results suggest that the early and late infection environments are substantially different. The late gene expression responses may be driven by tissue damage and an inflammatory cell influx.</p>
<p>Two phases of host gene expression were also discernible (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Data</xref>). RNA levels for 46 mouse genes associated with fungal infection responses were assayed in each kidney sample. One set of genes was induced early in infection, reaching peak levels by 24 hr postinfection. This set included genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as Tnfα and IL-6) and pattern recognition receptors (such as Mincle and Dectin-2), in keeping with the study by MacCallum at 24 hr postinfection [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These rapid responses are likely to be mediated by cells that are resident in the kidney. A second set of genes was induced late in infection, with significant expression increases between 24 and 48 hr (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This second set included the neutrophil marker NOX (NADPH oxidase 1) and the inflammatory macrophage marker CCR2. The set also included genes whose expression is associated with T cells, such as interferon γ and IL-17a. These late responses probably reflect leukocyte migration into the kidney. Thus, both pathogen and host display distinct early and late temporal gene expression responses during invasive infection.</p>

<title>Mouse immune response gene expression during <italic>Candida</italic> infection.</title>
<p>(A). RNA levels for 46 mouse immune response genes were assayed at 12, 24, and 48 hr postinfection in biological triplicates and were compared to uninfected kidney controls (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Data</xref>). Mouse genes that represent early and late expression classes are presented. We define early genes as those with significantly higher expression in 12 hr postinfection samples compared to uninfected samples. We define late genes as those with no significant difference in expression between uninfected and 12 hr postinfection samples, but with significantly higher expression in 48 hr postinfection samples compared to 24 hr postinfection samples. An asterisk indicates significant differences (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) between successive time-course samples (uninfected samples versus 12 hr, 24 hr versus 12 hr, 48 hr versus 24 hr). (B). Mice were infected with the indicated transcription factor mutants and respective complemented strains; RNA levels for 46 mouse immune response genes were determined by nanoString at 24h postinfection (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Data</xref>). Induction of four early genes (the same genes shown in panel A for the wild-type strain) are shown here. All four genes were induced significantly more strongly by complemented strains than the respective mutants (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05), as indicated by the bracket and asterisk. <italic>P</italic>-values for expression of each gene are included in <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Data</xref>.

<title>Regulation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> Transcription during Infection</title>
<p>In order to identify regulators that govern gene expression during infection, we employed a probe set that included all 231 known or predicted <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> transcription factor genes. Early and late gene expression phases were evident among these genes (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Data</xref>). Early up-regulated transcription factor genes included regulators of hyphal formation (Ume6, Tec1), zinc acquisition (Zap1), and iron acquisition (Hap43, Sef1). The late response included many transcription factors whose function has not been analyzed in detail previously. Functions of the early class of transcription factor genes that are known are consistent with the properties of environmentally responsive genes presented above.</p>

<p>Transcription factors that are expressed at high levels or significantly up-regulated during infection may govern pathogen proliferation and virulence. An analysis of previously studied transcription factors supports this idea (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Expression level was an excellent predictor of function. Specifically, among the 30 most highly expressed transcription factor genes at 48 hr postinfection, 18 have been found to be required for proliferation or virulence among 24 tested previously (75%). Among the 30 most weakly expressed transcription factor genes at this time point, one is required for proliferation or virulence among 12 tested previously (8%). This difference is highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 by FET). The up- or down-regulation of expression was a weaker predictor of function. Among the 30 most highly up-regulated transcription factor genes (comparing 48 hr postinfection to the inoculum samples), 15 are required for proliferation or virulence among 20 tested previously (75%). Among the 30 most down-regulated transcription factor genes, seven are required for proliferation or virulence among 16 tested previously (44%). There is no significant difference between these expression classes (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.08 by FET). Therefore, the transcription factor gene expression level, rather than its regulatory response, is the most discerning predictor of function in this infection model. However, transcription factors that are most highly up-regulated or most highly expressed are equally likely to have clear roles in proliferation and virulence (<italic>p</italic> = 1.0 by FET).</p>

<title>Profile of the Attenuated <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> Transcription Factor Mutant</title>
<p>We sought to understand regulatory relationships during infection, and we began this analysis with the transcription factor Rim101. We chose <italic>RIM101</italic> because it is the most highly expressed transcription factor gene at 48 hr postinfection; its RNA levels comprise over 3% of the total RNA levels for all 231 transcription factor genes (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Data</xref>). Rim101 clearly functions during infection: early up-regulated genes correlate with known Rim101-dependent genes, and prior studies show that it is required for virulence in the mouse disseminated infection model, where it promotes both hyphal formation and proliferation [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In order to define the gene expression basis for the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant virulence defect, we assayed expression of 148 environmentally responsive genes by the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant and <italic>rim101Δ/Δ+pRIM101</italic> complemented strain at 24 hr postinfection (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Data</xref>). The <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant presented significantly reduced accumulation of 33 RNAs (≥2-fold change and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, including <italic>RIM101</italic> itself), and increased expression of 14 RNAs, compared to the wild-type strain (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Data</xref>). RNA accumulation in the complemented strain closely mirrored that of the wild type (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Specifically, RNA accumulation levels were restored by the complementing <italic>RIM101</italic> allele for all genes except <italic>GAP2</italic>, <italic>PHR1</italic>, and <italic>HYR1</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the complemented strain, expression of <italic>GAP2</italic> and <italic>PHR1</italic> trended toward the wild-type level, thus suggesting that these few gene expression differences from the wild type are the result of reduced gene dosage of <italic>RIM101</italic> alleles in the complemented strain compared to the wild type, as documented previously for these strains [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

<p>Genes that were down-regulated in the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant included many that are induced during hyphal growth (such as <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>SOD5</italic>, and <italic>SAP5</italic>). Their reduced expression in the mutant is consistent with its deficiency in hyphal growth in vivo [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Two transcription factor genes that are required for hyphal growth, <italic>EFG1</italic> and <italic>TEC1</italic>, were also down-regulated in the mutant and may account for its failure to form hyphae and express hyphal genes. We note that the few direct Rim101 target genes assayed have altered RNA levels in the mutant, including Rim101-activated genes <italic>PHR1</italic> and <italic>PRA1</italic>, as well as Rim101-repressed gene <italic>PHR2</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Overall, these in vivo profiling data are consistent with known features of the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> pathogenicity defect and the molecular data about the Rim101 protein.</p>
<p>The gene expression impact of the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutation has been characterized extensively in vitro, and we noted several differences between published in vitro profiles and our in vivo data. Such differences can arise from the assay platform, and we thus examined the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant and <italic>rim101Δ/Δ+pRIM101</italic> complemented strain under hypha-inducing conditions in vitro (Spider medium at 37°C) with the nanoString platform. We examined expression of 144 environmentally responsive genes (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Data</xref>). In this set, 37 genes responded significantly (≥2-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) to Rim101 in vivo, 11 genes responded significantly to Rim101 in vitro, and only eight responded significantly to Rim101 under both conditions (compare blue and green bars in <xref rid="pbio.1002076.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002076.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The genes that responded significantly to Rim101 only in vivo include several with roles in pathogenicity (<italic>EFG1</italic>, <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>SAP6</italic>, and <italic>TEC1</italic>). These results emphasize that the invasive infection environment can alter the spectrum of genes that respond to a transcription factor, and they suggest that such alterations have the potential to influence virulence.</p>
<p>We have recently analyzed the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant and <italic>rim101Δ/Δ+pRIM101</italic> complemented strain on the nanoString platform during abdominal infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Among 144 genes assayed in both infection models, we found 46 genes that responded significantly to Rim101 during abdominal infection, and only 15 responded similarly in both infection models (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002076.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, blue and red bars). Notably, the hyphal regulatory genes <italic>EFG1</italic> and <italic>TEC1</italic> did not require Rim101 for expression during abdominal infection. Therefore, the site of infection can affect the relationship between a transcription factor and its target genes.</p>

<title>Profile of the Attenuated <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> Transcription Factor Mutant</title>
<p>We also examined the gene expression impact of a defect in the transcription factor Efg1. An <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant was among the first attenuated <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> strains characterized [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Efg1 governs numerous pathogenicity-related phenotypes, including adherence to diverse cells and substrates, formation of hyphae at 37°C, colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, and antifungal drug susceptibility [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The impact of <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> mutations has been assessed on the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> transcriptome during growth in vitro [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but never in vivo.</p>
<p>We confirmed that the proliferation of an <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant was severely defective in the mouse disseminated infection model, yielding overall RNA levels too low to detect expression of many <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> genes at 24 hr postinfection (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) and a greatly diminished host response (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Therefore, we assayed <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> gene expression in an <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant and <italic>efg1Δ/Δ+pEFG1</italic> complemented strain at 48 hr postinfection. Among 148 environmentally responsive genes assayed, we found 26 genes that were significantly down-regulated (including <italic>EFG1</italic> itself) and 63 genes that were significantly up-regulated (≥2-fold and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), compared to the wild-type strain (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Data</xref>). Presence of one <italic>EFG1</italic> allele in the complemented strain increased <italic>EFG1</italic> expression to 26% of the wild-type level, and permitted partial or complete restoration of environmentally responsive gene expression levels (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Data</xref>). This dosage effect is consistent with prior studies that document haploinsufficiency for <italic>EFG1</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The 26 down-regulated genes included many hyphal genes (for example, <italic>ALS3</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>IHD1</italic>, and <italic>SOD5</italic>), as expected from profiling of an in vitro–grown <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Among the 63 up-regulated genes, only four were up-regulated in the in vitro <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> characterization [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and their fold-change was much greater in vivo than in vitro. These results indicate that the <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant is defective in expression of hyphal genes during proliferation in vivo, as expected from its previous phenotypic characterization. In addition, the <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant, like the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant, has impact on gene expression during proliferation in vivo that is distinct from what is observed in vitro.</p>

<title>Functional Relationships among Virulence Regulators</title>
<p>In order to visualize gene expression alterations associated with virulence defects in a broader context, we profiled a panel of mutants that are defective in proliferation in vivo. We selected a <italic>zap1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant because many known Zap1-dependent genes are up-regulated during infection, as discussed above. The <italic>zap1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant has been shown to be defective in proliferation previously [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], a phenotype that was confirmed by its reduced RNA levels in infected tissue (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) and a diminished host response (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). We also made mutations in three highly expressed or up-regulated transcription factor genes that had not been studied previously in a disseminated infection model: <italic>ROB1</italic> (orf19.4998), <italic>RPN4</italic> (orf19.1069), and <italic>SUT1</italic> (orf19.4342). Each mutation caused reduced proliferation in vivo, as indicated by a decreased fungal RNA yield (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) and host response (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Histopathology examination of kidney sections at 24 hr postinfection showed that the attenuated mutants were able to invade the kidney parenchyma, though fungal cells were much less abundant than observed in mice infected with the wild-type strain (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Complementation with a wild-type copy of each gene led to increased fungal RNA yield and host response gene expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002076.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Therefore, defects in <italic>ROB1</italic>, <italic>RPN4</italic>, and <italic>SUT1</italic> cause defects in proliferation in vivo.</p>
<p>In order to identify the virulence pathways that are governed by these transcription factors, we assayed expression of 148 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> environmentally responsive genes at 24 hr postinfection in the wild type and the attenuated transcription factor mutant strains (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Data</xref>), and compared the results to the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> and <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> data presented above. Gene expression alterations in each mutant were largely restored in the respective complemented strains (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Data</xref>), thus indicating that the mutation introduced into each strain was the cause of the gene expression alteration. Only three genes had significantly altered expression (≥2-fold, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in all mutants, the up-regulated cell wall or secreted protein genes <italic>GCA2</italic>, <italic>RBR1</italic>, and <italic>RBR2</italic>. Although no firm conclusion can be drawn from so few genes, the results suggest that attenuated mutants may undergo a common cell surface alteration. Prior and current studies indicate that Rim101, Rob1, and Efg1 are required for hyphal formation, so we looked for common gene expression alterations in those three strains. Common down-regulated genes included <italic>CRH11</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>FAV2</italic>, <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>IFD6</italic>, <italic>SAP5</italic>, and <italic>SAP6</italic>, most of which are associated with hyphal morphogenesis. Therefore, this feature of the in vivo gene expression profile is consistent with prior in vitro analysis of the hyphal morphogenesis program and the mutant phenotypes observed in vivo.</p>
<p>Three of the mutants, <italic>rpn4Δ/Δ</italic>, <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic>, and <italic>zap1Δ/Δ</italic>, had extremely similar gene expression profiles (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> top right; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Data</xref>). These results were unexpected because these three <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> mutants have distinct phenotypes in vitro. For example, on low-zinc medium, the <italic>zap1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant fails to grow, while the <italic>rpn4Δ/Δ</italic> and <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutants grow well (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>.). Also, during growth in vitro, the gene expression alterations of the three mutants have little similarity (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>.). We considered two explanations for our observations. One possibility is that Rpn4, Sut1, and Zap1 act in a pathway that operates in the invasive infection environment to govern proliferation; in vitro growth conditions may alter their spectra of target genes. A second possibility is that Rpn4, Sut1, and Zap1 are functionally unrelated, and the in vivo gene expression profiles of the three mutants represent general proliferation-defective responses.</p>
<p>We focused on Sut1 and Zap1 to determine whether there may be a functional relationship in vivo. We chose those two transcription factors because, during proliferation in vivo, the <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant had reduced RNA levels for <italic>ZAP1</italic> and the Zap1-dependent genes <italic>PRA1</italic>, <italic>ZRT1</italic>, and <italic>ZRT2</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Therefore, we considered the specific hypothesis that the <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> phenotypic defect during infection arises from its <italic>ZAP1</italic> expression defect. This model predicts that overexpression of <italic>ZAP1</italic> will suppress the defects of a <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant. We created a <italic>ZAP1</italic> overexpression allele by fusing the <italic>ZAP1</italic> coding region to a strong <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter in a <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> strain. The <italic>sut1Δ/Δ TDH3-ZAP1</italic> strain expressed zinc acquisition genes <italic>PRA1</italic>, <italic>ZRT1</italic>, and <italic>ZRT2</italic> during infection at higher levels than the <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). In order to assess the biological significance of the Sut1-Zap1 relationship, we made use of the finding that the <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant is defective in virulence (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Specifically, mice infected with the <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant survived substantially longer than those infected with the wild type or complemented strain. The <italic>sut1Δ/Δ TDH3-ZAP1</italic> strain displayed much greater virulence than the <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant, causing host lethality with nearly wild-type kinetics (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). We considered the possibility that <italic>ZAP1</italic> overexpression may cause a nonspecific increase in virulence. However, an otherwise wild-type strain that carried the <italic>TDH3-ZAP1</italic> allele had reduced virulence rather than increased virulence (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). These findings are consistent with the model that Sut1 is necessary for pathogenicity because it is required for <italic>ZAP1</italic> expression during infection. To test the specific hypothesis that the <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant is attenuated because it is defective in zinc uptake, we assayed virulence of strains that express the zinc transporter gene <italic>ZRT2</italic> from the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter. The <italic>TDH3-ZRT2</italic> allele did not alter virulence in a wild-type background, but fully restored virulence of a <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). This finding proves that the zinc transporter expression defect of the <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant is the cause of its virulence defect. Therefore, Sut1 is required for zinc acquisition in the invasive infection environment.</p>

<title>In Vivo Response to Antifungal Therapy</title>
<p>Caspofungin, a cell wall inhibitor, is an extremely effective antifungal drug [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The gene expression response to caspofungin treatment has been assayed during growth in vitro [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but not under infection conditions. We reasoned that the response to caspofungin may be different in vivo. Therefore, we assayed expression of the 248 environmentally responsive genes 2 hr after caspofungin administration in mice that had already been infected for 24 hr. There was no detectable decline in fungal cell number after this brief treatment time, but an extensive gene expression response was manifested (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Data</xref>). A much broader set of genes was induced by caspofungin in vivo than had been detected through previous in vitro studies (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Specifically, 44 of the genes assayed showed significantly increased RNA accumulation (≥2-fold, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) after caspofungin treatment in vivo compared to untreated infection samples. Several induced genes specify cell wall or secreted proteins (<italic>ALS4</italic>, <italic>ALS9</italic>, <italic>GCA2</italic>, <italic>PGA13</italic>, <italic>PGA26</italic>, <italic>PGA31</italic>, <italic>PGA37</italic>, <italic>PHR2</italic>, <italic>PIR1</italic>, <italic>RBR2</italic>, <italic>SAP1</italic>, and <italic>SAP9</italic>), and others specify enzymes that function in glucose generation (<italic>PCK1</italic>, <italic>GPM2</italic>, and <italic>DAK2</italic>). Thus, the in vivo response suggests that the cell wall is restructured in response to the drug through an alteration of cell wall protein composition and an increase in β-glucan synthesis.</p>

<p>The gene expression response to caspofungin during infection showed little similarity to the previously characterized response during growth in vitro (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Among significantly regulated genes from one previous in vitro study [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], 32 could be detected by our nanoString probes, and only four were regulated in parallel (up-regulated: <italic>PHR2</italic>, <italic>RTA4</italic>, <italic>SAP9</italic>; down-regulated: <italic>FGR41</italic>). Previous studies had been carried out with yeast-form cells and with a microarray platform, both of which may contribute to the divergence of results. Therefore, we assayed the gene expression response to caspofungin during hyphal growth conditions (RPMI, 37°C) with the same 248 nanoString probes used for in vivo profiling. We found a broad response to caspofungin under these in vitro conditions, with 19 down-regulated genes and 32 up-regulated genes (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Data</xref>). The up-regulated genes included numerous cell wall or secreted protein genes (<italic>ALS1</italic>, <italic>CHT2</italic>, <italic>CRH11</italic>, <italic>DFG5</italic>, <italic>ECM331</italic>, <italic>KRE1</italic>, <italic>PGA17</italic>, <italic>PGA26</italic>, <italic>PHR1</italic>, <italic>RBR1</italic>, and <italic>SOD4</italic>) as well as glucose generation genes (<italic>FBP1</italic>, <italic>ICL1</italic>, and <italic>PCK1</italic>). Surprisingly, though, there was still limited similarity to the in vivo response to caspofungin: seven genes were regulated in parallel (up-regulated: <italic>PGA26</italic>, <italic>PCK1</italic>, <italic>MET3</italic>, and <italic>YHB1</italic>; down-regulated: <italic>ATO2</italic>, <italic>CIP1</italic>, and <italic>LAP3</italic>). These results indicate that the infection environment has considerable impact on the gene expression response to caspofungin antifungal treatment.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether any previously characterized gene expression responses resemble the in vivo caspofungin response, we compared in vivo caspofungin-responsive genes to our database of gene expression data. We found striking overlap between caspofungin up-regulated genes and those genes that are repressed at 12 hr postinfection (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 by FET). Specifically, among 44 genes that were up-regulated in vivo in response to caspofungin, 35 genes had been repressed within 12 hr postinfection (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). These 35 genes include several with roles in cell wall biogenesis and integrity, such as <italic>PGA31</italic>, <italic>PHR2</italic>, <italic>PIR1</italic>, and <italic>SAP9</italic>. Down-regulation of these genes at an early time during infection may render infecting cells more vulnerable to cell wall inhibitors than in vitro-grown cells.</p>
<p>The gene expression responses to caspofungin may differ in vivo and in vitro because of a difference in the transcription factors that mediate the response under each condition. Therefore, we examined the transcription factor genes that are induced by caspofungin under the two conditions (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002076.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Data</xref>). Under infection conditions, we detected induction of 18 transcription factor genes (≥2-fold induction, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Under in vitro conditions (RPMI, 37°C), we detected induction of 13 transcription factor genes. The two sets of induced genes had minimal overlap; only iron regulator <italic>SFU1</italic> was induced under both conditions. However, the caspofungin up-regulated transcription factor genes included 11 genes that were down-regulated within 12 hr postinfection. It seems reasonable that the different gene expression responses to caspofungin treatment in vivo and in vitro reflect the difference in transcription factor gene responses that we have discovered here.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our knowledge of many pathogens comes primarily from in vitro analyses, though their behavior during interaction with the host is what we hope to understand. Here we have captured a slice of pathogen gene expression during invasive infection, thus providing a window into pathogen behavior in the infection environment. Our results show that there are two clear phases of infection, and that the gene expression features of each phase agree well with current thinking about the infection environment. However, we find that regulatory relationships defined through in vitro experiments are modified in the environment of invasive infection, and that those modifications can have functional impact. In addition, we have identified an unanticipated feature of drug-responsive gene expression that may be a useful consideration in future therapeutic development.</p>

<title>Infection Portrait from Gene Expression Dynamics</title>
<p>The expression profile reported here is, to our knowledge, the largest time-course analysis of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection of a mammalian host. The results indicate that there are both early and late gene expression changes during infection. Early genes underscore the importance of many driving forces in infection that have been deduced from previous studies of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and other invasive pathogens: hyphal formation and limitation for iron and zinc [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Late genes reflect responses that have been logically inferred from interactions with innate immune cells: oxidative stress and the consequences of phagocytosis by macrophages [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, late responses suggest that iron and zinc limitation become less severe as infection proceeds, as reported for iron availability by Potrykus et al. [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the overall features of gene expression during infection that we describe here fit well with the current understanding of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection biology.</p>
<p>The changes in carbon metabolic gene expression we observe during infection suggest that invasive cells shift from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis. Early up-regulated genes included four genes that specify subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is needed for carbon flux from glycolysis into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Early down-regulated genes included the glycerol biosynthetic genes <italic>GPD2</italic> and <italic>RHR2</italic>, a likely reflection of metabolic feedback from high levels of the kidney osmoprotectant glycero-phosphocholine [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which is utilized by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> during infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Also down-regulated early was the <italic>PCK1</italic> gene, which specifies the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. This observation is consistent with the idea that carbon is metabolized through glycolysis, perhaps augmented by catabolism of glycerol, at early times in infection. Late gene expression changes suggest that carbon metabolism shifts toward gluconeogenesis as infection progresses; the glyoxylate cycle genes <italic>ICL1</italic> and <italic>MLS2</italic> were up-regulated, as was the gluconeogenic gene <italic>PCK1</italic>. These changes may reflect increased lipid catabolism for carbon because the β-oxidation gene <italic>FOX2</italic> is up-regulated as well. Interestingly, up-regulation of <italic>ICL1</italic>, <italic>MLS2</italic>, <italic>PCK1</italic>, and <italic>FOX2</italic> occurs upon internalization by macrophages [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our results are consistent with an analysis of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion gene expression during infection by Barelle et al. [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], who detected higher expression of <italic>PCK1</italic> and <italic>ICL1</italic> in infecting cells than in glucose-grown cells, which are arguably equivalent to our inoculum. Our interpretation that cells shift from glycoloysis to gluconeogenesis during infection is consistent with the finding by Barelle et al. that a defect in glycolysis blocks establishment of infection, whereas defects in the glyoxylate cycle or gluconeogenesis impair later events in infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, the gene expression data reported here are consistent with the observation that glycolysis is required early in infection and that invasive <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells respond to phagocytosis at later times during infection.</p>
<p>Our gene expression data correlate with a recent gene expression profile by Chen et al. of whole zebrafish through a time-course of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The study normalized samples to the mean expression level over the time-course for each gene. Our early up-regulated genes correlated with genes that Chen et al. detected as up-regulated at 8 hr postinfection (roughly the midpoint of the time-course) and as down-regulated at 0.5 hr postinfection. Because of the normalization procedure, it is reasonable that both of these zebrafish samples would correlate with our early class. Our late up-regulated genes correlate with genes that Chen et al. detected as up-regulated at 16 hr postinfection, close to the end of the time-course. These correlations suggest that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> carries out similar biological processes in both infection models. Many matches among both early and late genes map to metal ion homeostasis GO terms. This correlation is consistent with the idea that nutritional immunity is used broadly as a defense mechanism [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Does <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> express different sets of genes at different infection sites? We can begin to address that question by comparison of the kidney infection profile reported here with infection profiles of other mouse infection models: oropharyngeal candidiasis [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and abdominal infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Expression levels for 115 genes were assayed in all three models, and we converted the data to expression ratios relative to the inoculum samples used here (<xref rid="pbio.1002076.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Thirty-two genes are up-regulated in all infection models, and they include many genes related to hyphal formation (<italic>ALS3</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>SOD5</italic>, <italic>TEC1</italic>, <italic>UME6</italic>), zinc limitation (<italic>PRA1</italic>, <italic>ZRT1</italic>, <italic>ZRT2</italic>) and iron limitation (<italic>PGA7</italic>, <italic>RBT5</italic>). Therefore, with the qualification that the dataset is small, there seem to be common driving forces in all three infection models. There are some examples of genes up-regulated only during oral infection, though too few to allow an inference about relevant regulatory or functional relationships. There are also genes up-regulated only during abdominal infection, which include the adhesin genes <italic>ALS5</italic>, <italic>ALS6</italic>, and <italic>ALS9</italic>. These adhesins may be involved in the abscess formation that characterizes this model [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The most striking conclusion, though, is that we see no examples of genes that are expressed only during kidney infection. We have sampled only 2% of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> genome, and it seems likely that kidney-specific genes will be found. The genes we have sampled are enriched for stress response genes, though, and we speculate that the kidney may be a common target organ for disseminated infection because it is a relatively hospitable environment.</p>

<title>Gene Regulation during Infection</title>
<p>The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> transcription factors that govern infection have been extensively studied through both single gene analyses and large scale competitive growth assays [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We find that strong in vivo expression or up-regulation are excellent predictors of function during invasive infection. Expression level seems to be the most discerning predictor; highly expressed transcription factor genes are much more likely to have measurable impact on infection than the weakly expressed. Such considerations may offer useful prioritization of prospective virulence regulators in pathogens that lack the wealth of prior analysis of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.</p>
<p>The infection environment modifies the gene expression impact of the majority of transcription factors that we examined, compared to what is observed under in vitro conditions. The gene expression impact of a mutation in vivo may reflect an amalgam of the direct effects of the transcription factor bound to its target genes, along with input from a spectrum of stress response pathways activated in each mutant when it is unable to proliferate. This explanation seems especially compelling for the <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant. The profile of this strain in vivo displayed a good correlation among down-regulated hyphal genes but little correlation among up-regulated genes, when compared with in vitro <italic>efg1Δ/Δ</italic> expression data [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The genes up-regulated in vivo were diverse, with many annotated to the GO term Response to Stress (e.g., <italic>CAP1</italic>, <italic>CAT1</italic>, <italic>HSP104</italic>, <italic>HSP70</italic>, and <italic>YHB1</italic>). Our data suggest that the kidney environment encountered by each mutant is similar, in that host gene expression response is essentially proportional to the fungal burden assessed by fungal RNA level; we see no evidence for qualitative alteration of the host response by individual mutant strains. Therefore, we would expect to see a common set of genes with altered expression in many different attenuated mutants. We see some evidence of a shared gene expression response among all of the mutants assayed. We believe that genome-wide analysis combined with additional replicates, given the low mutant titers, will document a more extensive shared gene expression response among attenuated strains.</p>
<p>Are in vivo mutant profiles informative? In the case of Rim101, comparison of the mutant profiles from two different infection sites offers a simple explanation for niche-specific <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant phenotypes. During invasive growth in the kidney, the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant is defective in hyphal formation [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our results here provide a simple explanation that was not understood previously (see [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for recent reviews): the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant has reduced expression of two hyphal regulatory genes, <italic>EFG1</italic> and <italic>TEC1</italic>, during kidney invasion. In contrast, during growth in an abdominal infection model, the <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> mutant is not defective in hyphal formation, nor in <italic>EFG1</italic> or <italic>TEC1</italic> expression [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many mutant strains are attenuated in multiple infection models, and we often infer that the same pathways or functions are thus required for infection in multiple contexts. Interestingly, though, if the gene expression impact of a mutant defect is tailored differently in distinct infection environments, then the same genetic lesion may lead to different causes for attenuation.</p>
<p>If regulatory relationships are modified during infection, then it seems possible that some regulatory pathways may be more prominent during growth in vivo than in vitro. Here, we have identified such a pathway relationship, in which transcription factor Sut1 is required for Zap1 expression, and Zap1 in turn activates zinc acquisition genes that are necessary for proliferation in vivo. The <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> and <italic>zap1Δ/Δ</italic> mutants have very similar gene expression alterations in vivo, an observation that led us to hypothesize that they function in the same pathway. Interestingly, the two mutants have little similarity between their gene expression alterations during growth in vitro, and only the <italic>zap1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant has a zinc acquisition deficiency in vitro. In addition, there is no indication of a functional interrelationship between the orthologous genes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In other words, the traditionally sought indications that two genes are functionally related were negative. We demonstrated that Sut1 and Zap1 are functionally related in vivo with the demonstration that <italic>ZAP1</italic> overexpression restores zinc acquisition gene expression and virulence to a <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant. This conclusion was strengthened by the finding that overexpression of the zinc transporter gene <italic>ZRT2</italic> also restores virulence to a <italic>sut1Δ/Δ</italic> mutant. Therefore, in vivo profiling data can define biologically relevant functional relationships that are not evident from in vitro analysis.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is that Rpn4 is functionally related to Sut1 and Zap1, given the similarity of the three mutant gene expression profiles during infection. Rpn4 is not required for zinc acquisition gene expression, so Rpn4 may govern a response to zinc limitation. There are many alternative hypotheses, though, and the issue may be resolved by future functional studies.</p>

<title>Response to Drug Treatment In Vivo</title>
<p>It seems logical that pharmacological perturbations, like genetic perturbations, may have distinct effects in vivo and in vitro. The gene expression response to the cell wall inhibitor caspofungin is a clear example. The functional spectrum of caspofungin-induced genes seems similar under all conditions and includes many cell wall–modification genes. However, the particular genes that are induced in infecting cells are quite different from those induced in cells grown in vitro. Our finding that a different selection of transcription factor genes is induced by caspofungin in vivo and in vitro helps to explain the overall difference in transcriptional responses.</p>
<p>An unanticipated finding from our caspofungin response profiling is that caspofungin induces many of the same genes that are repressed early in infection. It is not clear why caspofungin reverses the repression of many genes that occurs early in infection; perhaps the high osmolarity of the kidney relieves the need for cell wall reinforcement by eliminating turgor, thus repressing cell wall reinforcing functions early in infection. Alternatively, the sequestration of nutrients in tissue may cause repression of genes early in infection, and perhaps lysis of the first drug-exposed <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells relieves nutrient limitation and thus repression. What we find exciting is that the correlation may mean that infecting cells, by virtue of repressing genes that help survive drug treatment, may be in a more drug-susceptible state than in vitro–grown cells. This inference fits well with the study of Wheeler et al. [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], who observed that cell wall β-glucan is more exposed on the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cell surface of infecting cells than of in vitro–grown cells. Thus the Wheeler study indicates that cell wall structure is different in vitro and in vivo; our data argue that one source of this difference is the transcriptional regulation of cell wall biogenesis genes.</p>

<title>Perspective</title>
<p>Many of the key regulatory and environmental signals that have been deduced to govern <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> behavior during infection are indeed manifested at the level of gene expression. Regulatory relationships are modified during infection though, with two main consequences that we have reported. First, some regulatory relationships are more evident in vivo than in vitro, and the in vivo relationships can reveal pathways that are relevant to pathogenicity. Our analysis of <italic>SUT1</italic>, <italic>ZAP1</italic>, and <italic>ZRT2</italic> stands as an example. Second, the response to drug treatment manifested during infection can be distinct from that detected in vitro, as revealed by our analysis of caspofungin treatment. The drug response during infection includes induction of many infection-repressed genes, a relationship that may contribute to drug efficacy. Casadevall and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.1002076.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] have argued that virulence is an emergent property, a unique state manifested only when host and pathogen interact. Our results provide support for this concept by illustrating that unique regulatory relationships emerge in the environment of invasive infection.</p>

<title>NanoString Codeset Design</title>
<p>Because nanoString technology is not genome-wide, we developed strategies to select high-priority fungal and host genes for investigation. First, we selected 248 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> genes that play important roles in environmental responses, such as iron/zinc acquisition, oxidative/nitrosative stress, pH response, hyphal growth, and general stress responses. We reasoned that these environmental response gene probes (ER codeset) should give us clues about what environmental challenges <italic>Candida</italic> cells face during infection and which pathways are employed to cope with such challenges. Secondly, we designed a codeset to include 231 <italic>Candida</italic> genes that specify known and predicted transcription factors (TF codeset). Finally, we selected 46 mouse genes that are critical in host responses (HR codeset) to microbial infection, including genes encoding for fungal pattern recognition receptors, chemokines and chemokine receptors, interleukins and interleukin receptors, interferons and antimicrobial peptides. All the <italic>Candida</italic> gene codesets also include control genes TDH3 and YRA1, and the mouse gene codeset includes control genes ACTB, GAPDH, and PPIA.

<title>NanoString Sample Preparation and Data Analysis</title>
<p>For each nanoString assay, 10 μg of total tissue RNA isolated from a mouse kidney or 100 ng of pure <italic>Candida</italic> RNA isolated from an in vitro culture was mixed with a nanoString codeset mix and incubated at 65°C overnight (16–18 hr). The reaction mixes were loaded on the nanoString nCounter Prep Station for binding and washing, and the resultant cartridge was transferred to the nanoString nCounter digital analyzer for scanning and data collection. A total of 600 fields were captured per sample. The raw data were first adjusted for binding efficiency and background subtraction, following nCounter data analysis guidelines. The total adjusted counts (i.e., before normalization using the internal control genes) for genes on the same codeset were used to estimate relative fungal RNA abundance in each sample. For example, 10 ug RNA isolated from kidney 24 hr postinfection by wild-type strain SC5314 generated 324,648 total counts for 150 genes (mean of six determinations), while that from <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> infected kidney generated 49,083 counts (mean of three determinations). We estimated that at 24 hr postinfection, the relative fungal RNA abundance for <italic>rim101Δ/Δ</italic> infected kidney is roughly 15% (49,083/324,648) of that of the wild type. Following the same logic, we estimated that fungal RNA consists approximately 0.1% of total RNA isolated from kidney infected by the wild-type strain SC5314 at the 24 hr time point (by comparing to total counts from in vitro samples).</p>
<p>To calculate gene expression ratios among different samples, we normalized adjusted raw counts using internal control genes. For the ER codeset, data were normalized using the control gene <italic>TDH3</italic>. For the TF codeset, data were normalized by total counts of 231 genes. We tested a number of methods for normalization, including using another control gene <italic>YRA1</italic>, using total counts for all genes, and using geometric mean of robustly expressed genes. We found that the normalization factors resulting from these methods are similar and will not affect our main conclusions should we use a different method for normalization. For the HR codeset, data were normalized using the geometric mean of three internal control genes: ACTB, GAPDH, and PPIA. All expression ratios were calculated using mean values of three independent biological samples, and statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>n</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, unless specified otherwise).

Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate using an iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The program for amplification had an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 58°C for 30 s.
