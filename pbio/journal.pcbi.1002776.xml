      <abstract>
        <p>Energetic frustration in protein folding is minimized by evolution to create a smooth and robust energy landscape. As a result the geometry of the native structure provides key constraints that shape protein folding mechanisms. Chain connectivity in particular has been identified as an essential component for realistic behavior of protein folding models. We study the quantitative balance of energetic and geometrical influences on the folding of SH3 in a structure-based model with minimal energetic frustration. A decomposition of the two-dimensional free energy landscape for the folding reaction into relevant energy and entropy contributions reveals that the entropy of the chain is not responsible for the folding mechanism. Instead the preferred folding route through the transition state arises from a cooperative energetic effect. Off-pathway structures are penalized by excess distortion in local backbone configurations and contact pair distances. This energy cost is a new ingredient in the malleable balance of interactions that controls the choice of routes during protein folding.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Proteins are involved in all aspects of life. To perform their biological function, each protein chain has to fold into a unique three-dimensional structure. This conformational search can only succeed because all interactions are optimized by evolution to create a smooth funnel-shaped energy landscape with a consistent native bias. With the energetics thus leveled, geometrical constraints come to dominate the folding mechanism. But the same interactions that shape the folding mechanism also shape the functional dynamics of the folded protein. Specific functional requirements can thus introduce frustrated interactions that will show up in turn as anomalies in the folding process. In order to extract this functional information a quantitative understanding of the minimally frustrated folding landscape is required. We have devised a method to quantify the contributions from entropy and energy terms that determine the folding mechanism in a model with a perfectly funneled energy landscape. We find for an SH3 domain that its folding mechanism is determined by the energy cost for distortions of the backbone, a term that is usually disregarded in qualitative discussions of protein folding. In general, by counterbalancing the expected dominance of the configurational entropy, the backbone potential should facilitate functional adjustments of the folding mechanism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Energy landscape theory explains how the various interactions in a protein are organized in order to achieve efficient and robust folding capability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Frauenfelder1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Onuchic1">[3]</xref>. Protein energy landscapes possess a smooth funnel shape that avoids trapping in non-native states and that guides the folding process to the native structure. These funneled landscapes arise from interactions that are optimized according to the principle of minimal frustration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Bryngelson1">[2]</xref>, such that the native state is uniquely stabilized by mutually compatible and favorable interactions, while interactions that would favor non-native competing structures are eliminated. The dominance of native interactions indicates that the folding mechanisms are primarily determined by the geometry of the protein's native structure.</p>
      <p>Analytical calculations have confirmed the viability of this scenario and helped to understand its wide implications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Shoemaker1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Suzuki1">[10]</xref>. The funneled landscape has been realized in minimalist protein models called <italic>structure-based models</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Clementi1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Noel1">[14]</xref>, which define completely unfrustrated interactions based on a known native structure. Simulations with structure-based models reproduce both experimental trends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Chavez1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Kouza1">[16]</xref> and the observed folding mechanisms of many individual proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Clementi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Whitford1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Clementi2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Sulkowska1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, functional protein dynamics in the native state explore the same funneled energy landscape that controls folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Tsai1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Cheung1">[22]</xref>. Minimally-frustrated models should therefore also describe protein function, especially if the scale of relevant motions is not too small compared to the remaining roughness of the natural landscape. Indeed, structure-based models have been adapted to study signalling in the native state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Nechushtai1">[23]</xref>, limited rearrangements like the opening of the binding pocket in adenylate kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Whitford2">[24]</xref>, and entire molecular machines, like motor proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Hyeon1">[25]</xref> and the ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Whitford3">[26]</xref>. These models show that large-scale conformational changes supported by the native folding landscape are facilitated by local unfolding, or cracking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Whitford2">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Known exceptions from a perfect funnel, where native interactions alone cannot explain experimentally observed folding mechanisms, have been identified in proteins with analogous structures that fold by different mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Gosavi1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Ferguson1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Wensley1">[28]</xref>. Such departures from a minimally frustrated mechanism have received special attention because they suggest the presence of conflicting functional demands on the protein sequence. In the proteins Im7 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, specific functional roles related to ligand binding and receptor signalling have been traced to the frustrated regions that are perturbing their folding mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Gosavi1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Sutto1">[29]</xref>. Although proteins are susceptible to such functional perturbations of their folding behavior, energetic frustration in general appears to be sufficiently small to let geometrical effects dominate the folding mechanism and functional dynamics. These alternative routes are still consistent with the native geometry, but are suppressed by a few kcal/mol. Subtle changes in perfectly funneled models, like adding side chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Clementi2">[17]</xref>, can switch the dominant route through the transition state ensemble. But since these models are based on effective interactions, it is quite difficult to specify the particular factors that determine the <italic>dominant</italic> folding mechanism of a minimally frustrated protein.</p>
      <p>While individual folding paths on a funneled landscape are highly diverse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Wang1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Wang2">[31]</xref>, the observed average folding mechanism of a protein is typically well constrained compared to the vast combinatorial number of possible routes. The order of events cannot be unique at the level of individual contacts because of thermal fluctuations, and the multitude of accessible chain conformations in the unfolded state introduces substantial diversity early in the folding process. But structural preferences have been identified already in molten globule states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Dolgikh1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Raschke1">[35]</xref>, and the mechanism becomes more constrained as folding progresses. In the simplest case the protein folds directly through a transition state ensemble that also contains specific features of the native structure. More complex mechanisms may involve specific intermediates. Elements of the native structure that are missing in the transition state finally form to complete the folding process. In a structure-based model the folding mechanism can be specified by the order in which groups of native contacts are formed as the protein folds. In particular, the pattern of formed contacts in the transition state ensemble can be related to experimentally determined <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Itzhaki1">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Folding mechanisms in structure-based models are not directly encoded in the contact potentials, because they assign exactly the same stabilization to each contact. Instead, chain connectivity and excluded volume are the most conspicuous features of a structure-based model that can impose geometrical constraints on a folding protein, and their relevance for the folding mechanism is supported by numerical calculations. Chain connectivity influences the order of contact formation via differences in loop entropy. To minimize the loss of configurational entropy at each stage of folding, contacts should form in order of sequence separation, starting with the contacts that close the shortest loops. Such a mechanism is observed for the very simple case of CI2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Clementi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Itzhaki1">[36]</xref>. When effective loop lengths are considered, which take into account the effect of previously formed contacts, loop entropy can in principle also lead to more complex mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Plotkin1">[5]</xref>. Excluded volume is also often considered as an entropic term, because the steep repulsive potential used to enforce it makes conflicting configurations essentially unavailable.</p>
      <p>While it is straightforward to understand qualitatively how each of these geometrical factors, as well as specific interactions, can affect protein folding mechanisms, in this study we try to directly compare the influence of geometrical factors and energetic frustration to the folding of an actual protein and determine their contributions in a quantitative way. We focus on the folding of the SH3 domain, a small protein with a simple, but non-trivial, folding mechanism that is successfully reproduced by structure-based models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Clementi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Riddle1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Martinez1">[38]</xref>. The transition state ensemble is not obviously dominated by loop entropy like that of CI2, instead structure formation proceeds unevenly (<italic>i.e.</italic> polarized) along the protein chain. The folding mechanism of SH3 though must be determined by the geometry of its fold, because SH3 domains with dissimilar sequences are known experimentally to fold by the same mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Martinez1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The paper is organized as follows: We outline a structure-based model for SH3, and describe the folding process on a two dimensional free energy landscape with coordinates chosen to reflect the folding mechanism. We then introduce a decomposition of the landscape that extracts the entropy and energy contributions that are relevant for the mechanism. This analysis reveals that the mechanism is determined not by entropic effects but by energetic factors. We will demonstrate how this energetic effect arises from distortions of the backbone and imperfections in contact formation, which are only present in an explicit protein model with a direct representation of the chain.</p>

        <p>We apply this simple model to the folding of the SH3 domain of tyrosine kinase c-Src. The folding mechanism of SH3 is experimentally well characterized, and it has often been used as a test case for folding simulations with structure-based models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Clementi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Lammert1">[13]</xref>. The structure of c-src SH3 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g001">Fig. 1 <bold>A</bold></xref> consists of five beta strands joined in a beta barrel. Our systems comprises 57 residues, numbered 84 to 140 in the PDB structure 1FMK. The model is stabilized by 140 native contacts. The native contacts are organized into four antiparallel beta sheets with additional packing contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g001">Fig. 1 <bold>B</bold></xref>). Each contact in the figure is colored according to the probability that it is formed in the transition state ensemble observed with the structure-based model. The pattern agrees qualitatively with the result determined experimentally via mutation studies.

      <p>To characterize the agreement of observed partially folded structures with the WT-dominant mechanism we focus on the unequal formation of the four groups of beta sheet contacts in the contact map. We assign the contacts of the central three-stranded beta sheet to a group of contacts forming ‘early’, and the contacts of the N- and C-terminal sheets into a second group that is forming ‘late’ in the native mechanism. The quantity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is defined to reflect the difference in folding progress between the two groups in a given configuration,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002776.e035"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e035" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>It is basically the difference between the numbers of formed contacts from the early and late groups, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p>Separate plots of the energy and entropy contributions to the free energy landscape should, in principle, reveal directly if the structure in the barrier region that controls the folding mechanism can be traced to either the entropy or the energy term alone. However, in a structure-based protein model both energy and entropy are, by construction, dominated by a strong overall decrease along the main folding coordinate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This effect is caused by the progressive formation of native interactions and by the corresponding loss of configurational entropy during folding. The free energy barrier for folding arises from the imperfect cancellation of these terms. Thus, this barrier is much smaller in magnitude than the total change in either energy or entropy. The preference for a particular folding mechanism is determined by a free energy difference that is similarly small compared to the global trends along <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In order to isolate these small features in both contributions that are relevant for the shape of the barrier and for the folding mechanism, the global trend has to be removed. For this purpose we rewrite both the energy and entropy terms <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that give rise to the full free energy landscape <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p>The observed differences in contact energy between different states compared in the analysis must arise from differences in the stabilization of formed contacts, because the number of contacts itself is identical in all selected structures. Such differences can arise because the number of formed contacts is counted using a sharp distance cutoff, while the stabilization is determined by a differentiable potential. The stabilization of a contact is already reduced by deviations from the native pair distance that are too small to consider the contact as broken. Average extra deviations of less than 0.2 Å per contact are sufficient to explain the observed destabilization of the contact potential in off-pathway transition states by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> distributed over 70 formed contacts. The increased dihedral and also angular energies found in off-pathway structures correspond in the same way to small additional distortions in their local backbone configurations compared to the WT-dominant transition state.</p>
        <p>Backbone configurations and contact distances are mutually dependent, and distortions of the backbone translate necessarily into distortions of contact distances and vice versa. But this geometrical relationship between distortions of the backbone and of the contacts cannot explain either one of them. The unfrustrated construction of the native-centered potential means that both terms could be relaxed simultaneously, if no additional force opposes this relaxation. The increased repulsive energies observed in the off-pathway structures suggest that more favorable configurations are not reached because of excluded volume. Numerically, the contribution from repulsive energies to the observed penalty for off-pathway structures is weak, but as the only unspecific and potentially non-native term in the system, the repulsive interactions have a unique capacity to maintain distortions and thus trigger penalties from other interactions.</p>
        <p>To ascertain the role of different interaction terms in shaping the transition state structure we have repeated the analysis of the free energy landscape for models with perturbed interactions. To reduce the extent of excluded volume we have created a system with smaller beads, designated V25, where the chain occupies only 25% of the volume that it has in the original model. To reduce the energy cost for distorted structures we have built systems with weakened dihedral potentials, named D50 and D0, where the dihedral term has 50% of its original strength, or is removed entirely. Free energy landscapes for these perturbed systems together with the residual energy and entropy contributions, analogous to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. The landscape for system D50 is qualitatively similar to that for the original system. Its unfolded and folded basins are connected by a curved folding route with a transition state characterized by positive <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The bias in the transition region arises again from a peak in the energy contribution, while the entropy provides no corresponding feature. But both the free energy barrier and the underlying peak in the energy contribution are smaller than in the original model. In the system D0 without dihedral interactions the energy peak in the off-pathway transition region is lost, and the system folds along a heterogeneous reaction path over a very low barrier of the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> A very similar free energy landscape with a suppressed barrier and a straight folding path also results for the system V25 with smaller chain volume. Unlike in the previous case without dihedral interactions, the peak in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at negative <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is preserved, with similar strength to the original system. A neutral free energy landscape arises because the entropy landscape now possesses a pronounced corresponding basin that compensates the effect of the energy peak.</p>

        <title>Structural characterization of competing pathways</title>
        <p>We return to the original model in order to study the structural basis for the energy bias in favor of the WT-dominant transition state. From our simulation trajectories with the original model we have identified all structures in the transition region, defined by a total number of formed contacts <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and classified them according to their pattern of contact formation measured by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The trajectories contain 28509 on-pathway structures with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and 537 off-pathway structures with an inverted pattern of contact formation characterized by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In between these two extreme alternatives we also collected 1672 structures with an unpolarized contact map described by values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>The average structures for each group, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, reflect the structural preferences of the chosen contact maps. Regions of the chain that are supported by formed contacts adopt consistently native-like local structures, while the rest of the chain remains flexible and takes on various distorted configurations in the individual selected structures. This flexibility is represented in the figure by translucent grey spheres, which indicate the standard deviation of the chain positions in the selected set. The standard deviation of residue positions is also plotted below each average structure, in graphs <bold>D</bold>–<bold>F</bold>, and the regions with high variation represented in the structures are indicated. Plots <bold>K</bold>–<bold>M</bold> give the fraction of formed native contacts for each residue in the three sets of transition state structures. Residues with a high fraction of formed native contacts are marked in green in the shown average structures. In the average on-pathway transition state <bold>C</bold> the central three-stranded beta sheet is consistently well formed, while the termini remain mobile. In the average off-pathway structure <bold>A</bold> the inverted contact map stabilizes the termini and the hairpin formed by the RT-loop, while the central strands retain their flexibility. In the structures with neutral contact maps, shown in panel <bold>B</bold>, the complete chain is in an approximately native-like configuration, with most of the remaining variation at the termini. Red lines in the average structures mark residue pairs with strong repulsive interactions. As non-native interactions, repulsive contacts are only possible between distorted regions of the chain. The strongest repulsive interactions do however not occur in the highly flexible regions of each structure. Instead they are localized in partially structured regions, where parts of the chain are already constrained in mutual proximity. In any case the quantitative contribution of repulsive interactions to the penalty for off-pathway transition states is small.</p>

        <p>The average dihedral energies along the chain, plotted in graphs <bold>G</bold>–<bold>I</bold>, which make one of the largest contributions to the bias towards native transition states, closely reflect the pattern of structured and unstructured regions in each set of structures. In the average structures, regions of high dihedral energy are marked in orange. In every case the native-like regions have low average dihedral energies, and the distortions in the unstructured regions lead to high dihedral energies. The neutral contact map results in a relatively even pattern of dihedral energies. The patterns for the states with WT-dominant and inverted contact maps are complementary. In both the on- and the off-pathway states the variance in dihedral energies between native-like and distorted residues exceeds <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This variation inside each structure masks the smaller systematic difference in the averages on the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that gives rise to the overall stabilization of WT-dominant structures compared to off-pathway states. Similarly small distortions of formed contacts are responsible for the contribution in favor of WT-dominant transition states that is made by contact energies.</p>

Both contact and dihedral energies naturally decrease with the fraction of native-like local structures. Due to remaining distortions the average stabilization is generally smaller than it would be expected from perfectly native configurations. For frequently formed contacts and dihedrals the downward curvatures of the plots however indicate an added gain in stabilization beyond their increase in frequency. While more rarely formed contacts and dihedrals also remain relatively more distorted even in native-like structures, dihedrals and contacts that are frequently native-like also come closer to their native configuration when they are formed. This relationship appears equally in on-pathway transition states and in off-pathway structures. Histograms of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> shown in panels <bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold> reveal that on-pathway transition states benefit most from this additional stabilization of frequently native-like contacts and dihedrals, thanks to broadened or even bimodal distributions that maximize the fraction of such very frequently formed contacts and dihedrals.</p>

        <p>Under the influence of the native-centered stabilizing potentials of the structure-based model, the average energy of each contact and dihedral decreases with increasing probability to be native-like. Against idealized expectations the plots show a significant downward curvature. Contacts and dihedrals that are more frequently native-like receive an additional stabilization that is eventually responsible for the stabilization of WT-dominant transition states. Ideally, a contact would not be stabilized at all when it is unformed, and it would be perfectly native and stabilized by the full contact potential every time it is formed. In this case its average energy would just be the total stabilization of a formed contact multiplied with the fraction of time spent with the contact formed. Imperfect stabilization of a formed contact, caused for example by fluctuations around the native pair distance, would reduce the stabilization. A nonzero degree of stabilization for unformed contacts could equally reduce the energetic advantage of contact formation. But as long as every situation when a contact is formed or unformed remains equivalent to all other instances of contact formation or breaking, the stabilization would still be proportional to the fraction of times when the contact is formed. Instead the observed curvature in the plots proves that some contacts are better formed than others and thus receive additional stabilization. Specifically contacts that are formed frequently are at the same time also more closely native-like, and their stabilization is thus further increased. The same holds for dihedrals, which are distorted on average by a smaller amount when they are also distorted more rarely.</p>
        <p>WT-dominant transition state structures are favored by this effect, because they contain a higher proportion of contacts and dihedrals receiving the extra stabilization.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Against expectations, the transition state structure for the folding of SH3 is not determined by the configurational entropy of the protein chain, even though the interaction potential is generic and simplified, and chain connectivity is a prominent feature of the model. The known agreement between the folding routes of different SH3 domains confirms that the mechanism is determined by the geometry of the fold. But the geometry does not select the WT-dominant transition state based on its entropy. Instead, the competing chain geometries in the transition region are discriminated by their energies.</p>
      <p>The stabilizing effect that was found in contact and dihedral potentials favors structured transition states over random contact formation in general. Any pattern of structure formation that prefers one set of contacts over the others will lead to a broadened or even bimodal distribution of formation probabilities, which will benefit from the extra stabilization of frequently-formed native structures.</p>
      <p>The underlying cause of this effect is probably cooperativity. In both the WT-dominant and the inverted transition state structures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, native-like contacts and dihedral conformations are concentrated in contiguous parts of the native structure. It seems plausible that native contacts and dihedrals receive an extra stabilization in this situation, because adjacent contacts further restrict deviations from the native configuration, especially if multiple contacts act on the same residue.</p>
      <p>Cooperative stabilization of native-like structure is an essential ingredient of protein folding in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002776-Wang3">[41]</xref>. Cooperativity is required to predict realistic barrier heights in folding simulations, and it is necessary to obtain a stable native state in structure-based models. Cooperativity is implicitly present in the model because the adoption of native-like backbone configurations, guided by the local dihedral potential, automatically leads to the simultaneous formation of native contacts. The mutual stabilization of native-like structure in adjacent parts of the protein is an additional consequence of this built-in cooperativity between the different elements of the potential.</p>
      <p>Such concurrent stabilization of native structure by several potential contributions is a fundamental characteristic of the protein energy landscape, it is a consequence of the principle of minimal frustration. A tendency to fold with polarized transition states, like the one of SH3, is therefore deeply rooted in proteins in general.</p>
      <p>In our model, the WT-dominant transition state and the off-pathway structure with the inverse polarization are both favored by the observed stabilization of contiguous native structure. The WT-dominant transition state is favored over the alternative only quantitatively. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g008">Fig. 8</xref> the decisive energetic advantage for the WT-dominant transition state is provided by the dihedral potential. Inspection of the average conformations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g007">Fig. 7</xref> suggests a structural reason. In the WT-dominant transition state the native structure is formed by the central part of the chain, and the termini remain unstructured. In the inverse case the termini are joined by their native contacts, and the central segment of the chain is unstructured. But this central segment of the chain is nonetheless strongly constrained by its connections to the bound termini, while the free termini in the WT-dominant transition state are naturally separated by the interposed native core. In the WT-dominant transition state the termini can thus be unbound and still maintain relatively native-like conformations individually. In the off-pathway state, only strongly distorted configurations of the central chain segment can avoid the formation of additional native contacts in this region. The distortion affects primarily the dihedral potentials and the angles, but it will also propagate to the formed contacts. The forced distortion of the central chain segment in the off-pathway transition state is then responsible for the increased energies observed in both the backbone potentials and the contact interactions in off-pathway structures.</p>
      <p>In the context of the larger kinase the SH3 domain may still be forced to fold with the penalized inverted mechanism, depending on when SH3 folds in relation to the neighboring domain. If the SH3 domain folded after the rest of the protein, the termini would be held close together by the existing structure, and the folding barrier would be increased. Once the protein is completely folded, the higher barrier for unfolding with joint termini could on the other hand increase the kinetic stability of the SH3 domain.</p>
      <p>The energy cost for distortions of the backbone opposes the effect of configurational entropy. In an ideal protein, as it is recreated by a structure-based model, the native structure is the global energy minimum. Accessible non-native configurations, which increase the configurational entropy of the system, are only reached at the cost of increased potential energy. Globally the compensation of energy and entropy is a central feature of the folding reaction. In the competition between alternative folding routes, the higher energy of additional distorted configurations will counter their favorable contribution to the configurational entropy. For SH3 the energy cost of distortion outweighs the entropic effects, and the folding route is selected by the energy terms in the model.</p>
      <p>Quantitatively the relevant energies are not very strong. Contributions of the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for individual contacts and dihedrals add up to an apparent free energy bias in favor of the WT-dominant route of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g002">Fig. 2 <bold>A</bold></xref>. A reduction of the underlying dihedral interactions by 50% is sufficient to reduce this bias to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g005">Fig. 5 <bold>A</bold></xref>. The effect of this loss on the mechanism is clearly visble in the route measure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, and in the absence of dihedral interactions the remaining contribution from the contact potential is not sufficient to maintain the mechanism. Individually the isolated differences in the contact and dihedral energies observed between the extremes of positive and negative <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reach <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> each. The smaller apparent free energy bias already contains a competing entropy contribution, visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002776-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, that also reaches several <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Through manipulation of the chain volume this entropy contribution too can be modified sufficiently to change the folding route. A new basin in the entropy contribution to the landscape of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> compensates enough of the persisting energy bias to suppress the folding mechanism. Similar changes in energy are also readily accessible in actual proteins. Individual contacts provide energies of the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002776.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and a small number of mutations could easily achieve a sufficient redistribution of the stabilization to modify the mechanism. The partial cancellation of the configurational entropy by the energy cost of distortions facilitates such adjustments by reducing the required energies.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the observed folding mechanism of SH3 in our simulations is not explained by the configurational entropy of the chain. Instead a polarized folding mechanism is favored by cooperative interactions that stabilize contiguous native structure. Chain connectivity is responsible for the mechanism because it provides local coupling, not because it determines configurational entropy. The actual structure of the WT-dominant transition state ensemble is determined by the energy cost of distorted backbone configurations, which acts directly against the trend given by chain entropy. Although the folding mechanism is determined by an unexpected energetic effect, the results illustrate again the malleability of the folding mechanisms and functional dynamics of proteins. Small, accessible changes to several competing energy and entropy contributions can each reverse the weak bias towards the observed mechanism and may serve to switch between alternative behaviors.</p>
