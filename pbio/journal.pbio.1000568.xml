<p>Temporal expression profiling of sensory precursor cells reveals how the <italic>atonal</italic> proneural transcription factor regulates a specialized neuronal differentiation pathway.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>In neurogenesis, neural cell fate specification is generally triggered by proneural transcription factors. Whilst the role of proneural factors in fate specification is well studied, the link between neural specification and the cellular pathways that ultimately must be activated to construct specialised neurons is usually obscure. High-resolution temporal profiling of gene expression reveals the events downstream of <italic>atonal</italic> proneural gene function during the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> chordotonal (mechanosensory) neurons. Among other findings, this reveals the onset of expression of genes required for construction of the ciliary dendrite, a key specialisation of mechanosensory neurons. We determine that <italic>atonal</italic> activates this cellular differentiation pathway in several ways. Firstly, <italic>atonal</italic> directly regulates <italic>Rfx</italic>, a well-known highly conserved ciliogenesis transcriptional regulator. Unexpectedly, differences in <italic>Rfx</italic> regulation by proneural factors may underlie variations in ciliary dendrite specialisation in different sensory neuronal lineages. In contrast, <italic>fd3F</italic> encodes a novel forkhead family transcription factor that is exclusively expressed in differentiating chordotonal neurons. <italic>fd3F</italic> regulates genes required for specialized aspects of chordotonal dendrite physiology. In addition to these intermediate transcriptional regulators, we show that <italic>atonal</italic> directly regulates a novel gene, <italic>dilatory</italic>, that is directly associated with ciliogenesis during neuronal differentiation. Our analysis demonstrates how early cell fate specification factors can regulate structural and physiological differentiation of neuronal cell types. It also suggests a model for how subtype differentiation in different neuronal lineages may be regulated by different proneural factors. In addition, it provides a paradigm for how transcriptional regulation may modulate the ciliogenesis pathway to give rise to structurally and functionally specialised ciliary dendrites.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Early during development, cells differentiate and take on specialized forms and functions. This requires the activation of specific genes for different cellular pathways. Our study addresses how this activation is regulated in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system. In this model, it is well known that proneural transcription factors are involved in directing cells to differentiate into various types of neurons. However, the mechanism by which they choreograph the activation of genes for neuronal differentiation is not clear. In this study, we focused on events leading to differentiation of mechanosensory neurons, which have specialized dendritic processes that mediate sensory perception. In these developing neurons we profiled the time course of gene expression that is triggered by the proneural factor <italic>atonal</italic>. Our analysis revealed the activation of genes required for the formation of these specialized dendrites, called cilia. We then identified several ways in which <italic>atonal</italic> regulated these genes. First, it activates intermediate transcription factors that regulate different subsets of differentiation genes. Second, in at least one case, <italic>atonal</italic> activates a differentiation gene directly, one that is involved in the formation of cilia (ciliogenesis). These findings offer new insight into how proneural factors regulate specialized neuronal differentiation pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Once an embryonic cell is committed to a particular fate, it is likely that a precisely ordered progression of gene expression is required to coordinate the complex cell biological events that eventually lead to its terminal differentiation. Determining how this progression is regulated is an important step towards understanding how cells acquire specialised morphologies and functions. In the developing nervous system, cell fate commitment is initiated by the activity of proneural basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Bertrand1">[1]</xref>. In vertebrates, <italic>atonal</italic> (<italic>ato</italic>)-related proneural genes are required for neurogenesis in the spinal cord and cortex (<italic>neurogenin</italic>), cerebellum (<italic>atoh1</italic>), and retina (<italic>atoh7</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Bertrand1">[1]</xref>. <italic>atoh1</italic> is also required for the formation of mechanosensory cells in the inner ear and in skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Bermingham1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-BenArie1">[3]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>ato</italic> itself specifies the precursors of several specialised sensory neuron types, including photoreceptors and mechanosensory chordotonal (Ch) neurons, which mediate hearing and proprioceptive feedback during locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Jarman1">[4]</xref>. Whilst proneural genes are intensively studied, little is known of how their function leads to specific programs of neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p><italic>ato</italic> expression in the ectoderm leads to sense organ precursor (SOP) specification in a process that is refined by Notch signalling. After commitment, SOPs divide several times asymmetrically before the 4–5 progeny cells interact and terminally differentiate to form the neuron and support cells of the mature Ch sense organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). The function of <italic>ato</italic> and other proneural factors in SOP fate determination is relatively well studied. Indeed, known proneural target genes are almost all concerned with SOP specification or fate maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Singson1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Pi1">[9]</xref>. It is not clear, however, how its function as ‘master regulator’ leads to subsequent neural development. Since <italic>ato</italic> is expressed only transiently during SOP formation, a likely hypothesis is that it initiates a gene regulatory cascade, which eventually regulates differentiation genes. The nature of this cascade and its regulation have not been elucidated.</p>

<p>In contrast to the dearth of knowledge of the regulatory cascade, more is known of Ch neuron terminal differentiation itself. Notably, Ch neurons develop a highly structured dendrite based on a modified cilium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-McIver1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Uga1">[12]</xref>. Ciliogenesis is a conserved, highly ordered process involving the coordinated action of hundreds of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gerdes1">[13]</xref>. In vertebrates, ciliated cells are widespread, both in the PNS (e.g. photoreceptors, olfactory neurons) and other adult tissues (e.g. kidney, lung), and developing cells have a primary cilium that is required for signal transduction for a number of paracrine pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gerdes1">[13]</xref>. In contrast, the only ciliated cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are sensory neurons and sperm. As a consequence, genetic analysis of defective sensory neuron differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has enabled the discovery and characterisation of a number of ciliogenesis genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Baker1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-AvidorReiss1">[16]</xref>. These include genes required for the specialised transport process known as Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-AvidorReiss1">[16]</xref> and homologues of genes disrupted in the human ciliopathy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Ciliogenesis is one of the key differentiation events that must be initiated by <italic>Drosophila</italic> proneural factors.</p>
<p>An important question in the regulation of cellular diversity is how core cell biological pathways are modified to give distinct cell types. Cilia perform a wide variety of specialised functions, but it is poorly known how the core ciliogenesis program is modulated in different cell types. The ciliary dendrite of Ch neurons is anatomically and physiologically distinct from those of other <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons (notably the External Sensory (ES) neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Kim1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gong1">[18]</xref>. Ultimately, these subtype-specific differences in the ciliary dendrite must be regulated by the proneural factors, which have well-known neuronal subtype determining properties in both invertebrates and vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Bertrand1">[1]</xref>. Whilst <italic>ato</italic> directs the formation of Ch precursors, another proneural gene, <italic>scute</italic> (<italic>sc</italic>), performs this function for ES precursors. <italic>sc</italic>'s function is likely to be mediated partly by the homeodomain factor, Cut, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Bodmer1">[19]</xref> but little is known of Cut's molecular function. Apart from the involvement of <italic>cut</italic>, it is at present entirely unknown how subtype specification by transiently expressed proneural factors is translated into differences in neuronal phenotype, including the modulation of ciliogenesis.</p>
<p>In order to bridge the gap between proneural factor function and the activation of genes required for neural terminal differentiation, we used expression profiling to characterise the progression of gene expression during Ch neuron development. A time course in the onset of differentiation gene expression can be discerned. We then show that <italic>ato</italic> regulates some of these events through a number of intermediate transcriptional regulators. The gene for Regulatory factor X (<italic>Rfx</italic>), a well-known and highly conserved regulator of aspects of ciliogenesis, is regulated differently by proneural genes in Ch and ES lineages. We propose that this links proneural subtype specification to differences in ciliogenesis. We also identify a novel forkhead-related factor that is required to regulate genes for specialised aspects of Ch neuron function. In addition, we find that some putative differentiation genes are expressed surprisingly early in neural development and that <italic>ato</italic> may directly regulate at least one such gene.</p>

<title>High-Resolution Expression Profiling of Embryonic Ch Cells</title>
<p>For expression profiling during Ch development, <italic>ato</italic>-expressing cells were isolated from timed collections of embryos. <italic>ato</italic>-expressing cells were marked by GFP expression from an <italic>ato</italic>GFP reporter gene construct (<italic>ato</italic>GFP cells). This reporter gene is expressed predominantly in Ch precursors and their progeny but also in other <italic>ato</italic>-expressing cells including the developing larval eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Embryos from timed collections were dissociated and <italic>ato</italic>GFP cells isolated by FACS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Such cells were isolated from embryos at three time points corresponding to the first 3 h of neural development (t1–t3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s019">Text S1</xref>). t1 coincides maximally with <italic>ato</italic> expression (and therefore should include direct target genes), whereas later time points reflect subsequent post-<italic>ato</italic> development as the precursors divide leading up to differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression profiling revealed the number of differentially expressed genes in <italic>ato</italic>GFP+ versus <italic>ato</italic>GFP− cells (referred to as ‘<italic>ato</italic>-correlated genes’) to be 330, 456, and 411 at t1, t2, and t3, respectively (≥1.5-fold enriched, ≤1% false discovery rate (FDR)). Set analysis of genes enriched in <italic>ato</italic>GFP cells (<italic>ato</italic>-correlated genes) shows a clear time course of expression changes, with 69, 141, and 210 genes unique to t1, t2, and t3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s006">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s007">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s008">S3</xref>). This suggests an increase in the complexity of gene expression as development proceeds to differentiation. Manual inspection of <italic>ato</italic>-correlated genes ranked by fold change shows a high representation of known neurogenesis genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s006">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s007">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s008">S3</xref>). For instance, among the top ranked genes at t1 are <italic>spineless</italic>, <italic>twin of eyeless</italic>, <italic>cato</italic>, <italic>couch potato</italic>, <italic>dachshund</italic>, <italic>ato</italic>, <italic>Rfx</italic>, <italic>senseless</italic>, and <italic>BarH1</italic>, all of which are associated with aspects of neural development. Gene ontology (GO) analysis shows strong enrichment of GO annotation terms related to PNS development across all three time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s009">Tables S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s010">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s011">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s012">S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s020">Text S2</xref>).

To characterise the Ch expression of ciliogenesis genes further, we compared the t3 expression data with collections of genes previously linked to ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000568-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s014">S9</xref>).

Another study identified potential ciliogenesis genes from comparative genomic analysis of ciliated and non-ciliated organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-AvidorReiss1">[16]</xref>.

<title>Temporal Sequence of Differentiation Gene Expression</title>
<p>It is striking that our analyses indicate enrichment for genes required for ciliary differentiation, because terminal Ch differentiation has not yet occurred by the embryonic stage represented at t3 (approximately Stage 12). This suggests that some aspects of differentiation require the activation of specific differentiation genes prior to overt differentiation. Unexpectedly, a proportion of ciliary genes are already expressed even at t1 (8.6% of all ciliogenesis genes (14/175), 21.4% of compartmentalised ciliogenesis genes (6/28); <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000568-t001">Table 1</xref>). At t1 the Ch precursor cells have just been specified by <italic>ato</italic> and have still to undergo two rounds of division before neuronal differentiation occurs. In situ hybridisation confirmed that mRNAs for several ciliogenesis genes are expressed in Ch precursors or in their first division products. This includes genes required for a wide range of cilia components, such as the ciliary rootlet (<italic>CG6129</italic> – homologue of Rootletin), the IFT-B complex (<italic>CG15161</italic> – homologue of IFT46), and the IFT-A complex (<italic>Oseg1</italic> – homologue of IFT122; <italic>Oseg4</italic> – homologue of WDR35) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g003">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Most striking, for instance, is <italic>unc</italic>, which is thought to be involved in basal body maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Baker1">[14]</xref>. Although reported to be expressed only upon differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Baker1">[14]</xref>, we find that <italic>unc</italic> RNA is already 9.9-fold enriched at t1 (ranked 11<sup>th</sup>), and early expression is confirmed by in situ hybridisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, UNC protein is also expressed early and is already localised to the centrosomes in Ch precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g003">Figure 3F–I</xref>). Conversely, many known differentiation genes are not differentially expressed even at t3, supporting the conclusion that general differentiation has not yet occurred. This includes the Ch-specific TRPV-encoding genes, <italic>nanchung</italic> (<italic>nan</italic>) and <italic>inactive</italic> (<italic>iav</italic>), sensory neuron genes like <italic>futsch</italic> (MAP1B), and several groups of ciliogenesis gene. Therefore, a specific progression of gene expression can be discerned that defines a temporal program for organised ciliogenesis and neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>Expression Analysis of Enriched Genes Identifies a Characteristic Ch-Enriched Pattern</title>
<p>A precise program of gene activation implies that transcriptional regulation is important for coordinating the cell biological events underlying ciliogenesis, yet little is known of the gene network underlying this. As a first step in exploring the transcriptional regulation of Ch genes, we characterised expression patterns of a sample of <italic>ato</italic>-correlated genes by in situ hybridisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s015">Table S10</xref>; sample chosen based on fold change and lack of previous detailed annotation relating to PNS expression pattern). At least 90% of genes tested (<italic>n</italic> = 43) showed expression patterns that overlap <italic>ato</italic>-expressing cells, and the vast majority of these showed expression in Ch cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Moreover, most of these genes showed expression in the neuronal branch of the sensory lineage, rather than in support cells. Given the nature of the profiling (Ch cells compared with the rest of the embryo), we expected expression in <italic>ato</italic>-dependent cells, but not necessarily restricted to such cells within the nervous system. Indeed, various types of pattern were observed, including those we categorise as pan-neural (CNS and PNS), pan-sensory (PNS only), or Ch-specific. This distribution of patterns is broadly consistent with the view that the related Ch and ES lineages have both shared and unique properties. Unexpectedly, however, a significant proportion of genes show an intermediate ‘Ch-enriched’ pattern, characterised by strong and early onset expression in the Ch lineage but weak and later onset in the ES lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This includes many differentiation and ciliogenesis genes (including those mentioned above) that might otherwise have been expected to be required equally in all ciliated sensory lineages (pan-sensory). We suggest therefore that the subtype differences between the two main neuronal lineages with ciliary dendrites (Ch and ES) may partly arise from modulation in timing and level of expression of genes required for a common cellular differentiation program.</p>
<p>Since <italic>ato/sc</italic> proneural genes control the acquisition of Ch/ES subtype identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Jarman2">[24]</xref>, the modulation of differentiation suggested above must ultimately result from differences in proneural gene function. In order to link the regulation of differentiation to <italic>ato</italic> function, we carried out profiling of <italic>ato</italic>-expressing cells from <italic>ato</italic> mutant embryos at t1. In such embryos, <italic>ato</italic>GFP-expressing cells largely fail to become specified as Ch precursors and remain as ectodermal cells. Comparison with the wildtype expression profile yields 50 genes that are ≥2-fold differentially expressed in wild-type <italic>ato</italic>GFP+ cells at t1 (compared with the GFP– cells) but not in mutant <italic>ato</italic>GFP+ cells (compared with the GFP− cells from the same embryos) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s016">Table S11</xref>). Of these, 11 genes also show a ≥2-fold difference between the fold changes observed in wildtype and mutant embryos, which represent good candidates for downstream targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s017">Table S12</xref>). Three of these encode transcription factors (<italic>Rfx</italic>, <italic>cato</italic>, and <italic>fd3F</italic>). These genes were investigated as candidate intermediate regulatory factors that link proneural function to differentiation.</p>

<title>A Regulator of Ciliogenesis, RFX, Is Regulated by <italic>ato</italic> and <italic>sc</italic> in Different Ways</title>
<p>RFX is a well-known, highly conserved regulator of ciliogenesis and is best known as a proven or predicted regulator of many ciliogenesis genes through binding to an X-box motif (notably those genes associated with IFT-B) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Laurenon1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Dubruille1">[25]</xref>. Although required for neuronal differentiation, the <italic>Rfx</italic> gene is already highly expressed in the earliest <italic>ato</italic>GFP cells (9.76-fold enriched at t1, ranked 12<sup>th</sup>), indicating that it may be responsible for early expression onset of a subset of differentiation genes. Consistent with this, a resampling analysis demonstrates that gene lists for all three time-points are highly significantly enriched for the presence of nearby X box motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s004">Figure S4</xref>), indicating the likely presence of <italic>Rfx</italic> target genes. In addition, of the set of 83 genes in the genome that have a conserved perfect X box motif nearby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Laurenon1">[20]</xref>, 21.7% are expressed at t3—a 7.1-fold greater frequency than expected by chance (<italic>p</italic> = 8.23×10<sup>−10</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000568-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s014">S9</xref>). These include ciliogenesis genes for which experimental evidence has been obtained that they are direct <italic>Rfx</italic> targets (such as <italic>CG15161</italic>, <italic>btv</italic>, <italic>tectonic</italic>, <italic>CG6129</italic>, <italic>CG4525</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Laurenon1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although <italic>Rfx</italic> is required for both Ch and ES neurons, examination of its expression pattern revealed that, like many of its target genes, it shows a Ch-enriched pattern of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g004">Figure 4A–C</xref>). It is possible, therefore, that variations in <italic>Rfx</italic> expression may underlie different subtype-specific programs in Ch and ES cells. In turn, this suggests that <italic>Rfx</italic> may be regulated differently by ATO and SC proteins in these lineages as part of their neuronal subtype-determining function. Therefore, we examined the regulation of <italic>Rfx</italic> by proneural factors. Embryonic expression analysis confirmed that Ch expression of <italic>Rfx</italic> overlaps with that of <italic>ato</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Rfx</italic> expression in ES lineages begins later, only after the termination of <italic>sc</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). By reporter gene analysis, we found that <italic>Rfx</italic> is regulated through separable Ch and ES enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). The Ch enhancer is activated early in Ch development (<italic>RfxA</italic>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). This enhancer contains an E box motif whose sequence conforms to that previously shown to respond specifically to ATO activation (E<sub>ATO</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Powell1">[7]</xref>. This motif binds ATO in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s005">Figure S5</xref>), and when it is mutated, the early phase of expression in Ch cells is abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Conversely, this enhancer is ectopically activated when <italic>ato</italic> is misexpressed in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g004">Figure 4I,J</xref>), but this ectopic activation is abolished when the E box motif is mutated (unpublished data). In contrast to direct activation by <italic>ato</italic>, the ES enhancer is active only after <italic>sc</italic> expression is switched off (<italic>RfxB</italic>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g004">Figure 4K,L</xref>), suggesting that <italic>sc</italic> only indirectly activates <italic>Rfx</italic> in ES development. However, we note that the ES enhancer does contain two motifs conforming to the known SC binding site (GCAGSTG) and so it is possible that SC directly primes the <italic>Rfx</italic> gene for later expression in ES lineages. Overall, the evidence suggests that <italic>Rfx</italic> is a direct target of <italic>ato</italic> but not of <italic>sc</italic>, supporting the hypothesis that differences in <italic>Rfx</italic> regulation may be one means by which proneural factors regulate neuronal subtype characteristics.</p>

Mutant larvae and adult flies exhibit locomotion defects similar to those manifested in <italic>ato</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g005">Figure 5G,H</xref>; FGN and APJ, in prep.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Jarman1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Caldwell1">[28]</xref>. Given the expression pattern of <italic>fd3F</italic>, these defects can be attributed to defective Ch neurons, which are required for proprioceptive feedback during locomotion. In <italic>ato</italic> mutants, such defective behaviour results from loss of Ch neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis suggests, however, that Ch neurons are mostly specified normally in <italic>fd3F</italic> mutants and little gross structural defect was observed in the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g005">Figure 5I,J</xref>; FGN, in prep.). Consistent with this, preliminary analysis of gene expression suggests that most ciliogenesis genes tested are not affected in <italic>fd3F</italic> mutants (FGN and APJ, in prep.).</p>
<p>We hypothesized, therefore, that <italic>fd3F</italic> regulates specialised aspects of Ch neuronal or ciliary physiology. The transient receptor potential (TRP) family of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are particularly associated with sensory functions in a range of ciliary contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Bloodgood1">[29]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>nan</italic> and <italic>iav</italic> encode subunits of a TRPV channel that are uniquely expressed in Ch neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Kim1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gong1">[18]</xref>. The proteins are located in the Ch ciliary dendrite, where they are required for sensory transduction. We find that the expression of both <italic>nan</italic> and <italic>iav</italic> is strongly reduced in <italic>fd3F</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g005">Figure 5K–N</xref>, and unpublished data). Failure in regulation of <italic>nan</italic> and <italic>iav</italic> can therefore account for the defective Ch neuron function of <italic>fd3F</italic> mutants. In conclusion, <italic>ato</italic> directly or indirectly activates a transcriptional regulator concerned with Ch neuron physiology (specifically, Ch ciliary dendrite physiological specialisation).</p>

<title>Ato Directly Regulates <italic>dilatory</italic>, a Gene Directly Involved in Differentiation</title>
<p>Whilst many early expressed differentiation genes are known or predicted <italic>Rfx</italic> targets, not all Ch-specific or Ch-enriched genes (nor ciliogenesis genes) have nearby X box motifs, suggesting that other intermediate regulatory factors remain to be discovered. Another possibility is that some early expressed differentiation genes may be directly regulated by proneural factors. Such genes include <italic>CG1625</italic> and <italic>unc</italic>, whose expression depends strongly on <italic>ato</italic> function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s014">Table S9</xref>). Our analysis (LM and APJ, in prep.) shows that <italic>CG1625</italic>, which we name <italic>dilatory</italic> (<italic>dila</italic>), encodes a coiled-coil protein that localises to the basal body, and <italic>dila</italic> mutants exhibit defects in ciliary axonemal assembly. Together, these suggest that <italic>dila</italic> is a not a transcriptional regulator, but instead has a direct function in ciliary dendrite formation. Here, we examined the regulation of <italic>dila</italic>. The gene is highly expressed in early Ch cells (11-fold enriched at t1; ranked 10<sup>th</sup>), and <italic>dila</italic> RNA exhibits a Ch-enriched gene expression pattern in embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>). However, it has no X box motif within 2 kb of its transcription start site. Its early expression raises the possibility that <italic>dila</italic> is directly regulated by <italic>ato</italic>. In vivo reporter gene analysis led to the identification of an enhancer required for <italic>dila</italic> expression in Ch cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g006">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Conversely, the reporter gene is misexpressed when <italic>ato</italic> is ectopically activated in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g006">Figure 6G,H</xref>). This enhancer contains two sequences resembling E<sub>ATO</sub> motifs, both of which bind ATO/DA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g006">Figures 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s005">S5</xref>). Mutation of these two motifs within this enhancer results in loss of early expression in Ch SOPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g006">Figure 6D,F</xref>) and loss of misexpression in response to ectopically activated <italic>ato</italic> (unpublished data). These data are consistent with direct regulation of <italic>dila</italic> by <italic>ato</italic> via one or both of these E<sub>ATO</sub> motifs. We note that in a recent study of potential <italic>ato</italic> target genes in retinal development, similar evidence was presented to suggest that <italic>dila</italic> (as <italic>CG1625</italic>) is regulated by <italic>ato</italic> via these two motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Aerts1">[30]</xref>. In conclusion, <italic>dila</italic> represents a differentiation gene that is directly controlled by a proneural factor, despite the gap between proneural factor expression and terminal differentiation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Numerous genetic and misexpression analyses in a range of organisms have shown that proneural factors influence a neuron's ultimate phenotype (including its subtype identity) at an early stage in its development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Bertrand1">[1]</xref>. However, the nature of this influence on the cell biological processes of neuronal differentiation has remained obscure. This study bridges the gap between early specification by the proneural factor, <italic>ato</italic>, and the differentiation of Ch neurons. The current model in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates is that proneural factors activate two types of target gene during neural precursor specification: a common target set for shared neuronal properties and a unique target set for subtype-specific properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Powell2">[31]</xref>. Our data suggest that such neuronal subtype differences are ultimately controlled by proneural factors in several ways: by the differential regulation of both specific and common intermediate transcription factors, which in turn regulate genes for aspects of neuronal structural and functional differentiation, and by direct regulation of potential differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary of proposed interactions leading from proneural genes to neuronal subtype differentiation. Solid and dashed arrows represent putative direct and indirect regulation, respectively. <italic>ato</italic> and <italic>ac</italic> regulate shared and unique aspects of sensory neuron differentiation. Ch ciliary specialisation is regulated by <italic>ato</italic> via several routes. (1) <italic>ato</italic> regulates a Ch-specific intermediate transcriptional regulatory (<italic>fd3F</italic>) that in turn regulates specialised aspects of sensory ciliary function. (2) <italic>ato</italic> regulates at least one differentiation gene directly (<italic>dila</italic>). (3) <italic>Rfx</italic> regulates a subset of ciliogenesis genes (including IFT-B genes) shared between sensory lineages, but differences in <italic>Rfx</italic> regulation by proneural genes <italic>ato</italic> and <italic>sc</italic> (only <italic>ato</italic> regulates <italic>Rfx</italic> directly) modulate these aspects. (4) The regulation of other aspects of differentiation and ciliogenesis (including IFT-A genes) does not depend on <italic>Rfx</italic>, suggesting further intermediate regulators remain to be discovered.</p>

<p>The proneural factors <italic>ato</italic> and <italic>sc</italic> commit cells to similar but distinct neural precursor fates: Ch and ES neurons are evolutionarily related cell types with similar but distinct structural and physiological properties. Notably, both are characterised by the possession of specialised ciliary-based dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-McIver1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Uga1">[12]</xref>. Thus, ciliogenesis is a key pathway that must ultimately be activated in sensory neurons subsequent to proneural factor function. However, there are important differences between the dendrites of Ch and ES neurons. Ch dendrites have a more prototypically organised axonemal structure and possess a characteristic ciliary dilation—a specialisation that separates the Ch ciliary dendrite into functionally distinct zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Lee1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, there is evidence for an active ‘beat’ of Ch cilia during sensory transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gpfert1">[33]</xref>. In general, ES dendrites appear reduced in structure: although a basal body and short axoneme are present, the tip of the dendrite consists of a ‘tubular body’ of irregularly packed microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-McIver1">[10]</xref>. Thus the basic ciliogenesis pathway must be modulated differently in Ch and ES differentiation, and ultimately this must reflect a difference in function between <italic>ato</italic> and <italic>sc</italic> proneural factors. The ciliogenic regulator <italic>Rfx</italic> is expressed and required for both ES and Ch lineages, but it is more strongly and more persistently expressed in Ch lineages (the Ch-enriched pattern). This modulation of <italic>Rfx</italic> expression is at least partly due to differences in its regulation by proneural factors, since it appears to be a direct target of <italic>ato</italic> but not <italic>sc</italic>. We hypothesise that differences in <italic>Rfx</italic> regulation by the proneural factors lead to differences in implementation of a core cilia biogenesis program, thereby directly linking early proneural factor function with key differences of neuronal morphology. Consistent with this idea, our data show that several known or predicted ciliogenesis genes also exhibit this Ch-enriched pattern, and some of these are predicted or known <italic>Rfx</italic> targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Laurenon1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this view, the subtype differences between Ch and ES neurons are partly produced by quantitative differences in timing or level of expression of a common differentiation process, which ultimately depends on a qualitative difference in <italic>Rfx</italic> regulation by the proneural factors. A possible example of this is <italic>CG6129</italic>. This gene is a predicted <italic>Rfx</italic> target gene and is expressed in a Ch-enriched pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000568.s003">Figure S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Laurenon1">[20]</xref>. The homologous mouse protein (Rootletin) localises to the ciliary rootlet and is required for its formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Yang1">[34]</xref>. Thus Ch-enriched expression of <italic>CG6129</italic> explains the presence of the ciliary rootlet in Ch neurons but not ES neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Moulins1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Uga1">[12]</xref>. One prediction of this hypothesis is that overexpression of <italic>Rfx</italic> in ES neurons will upregulate Ch-enriched genes, and this is borne out by preliminary experiments that show an increase in <italic>CG6129</italic> expression in ES neurons upon <italic>Rfx</italic> overexpression (<italic>sca</italic>Gal4/UAS-<italic>Rfx</italic> embryos; LM and APJ, unpublished data). It is notable that differences in IFT activity are proposed to underlie differences in ciliary morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Silverman1">[35]</xref> while RFX class factors have been associated with regulating genes for IFT in a variety of organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gerdes1">[13]</xref>. Our work suggests that variations in <italic>Rfx</italic> expression level and timing should be explored as a possible factor in cilium diversity.</p>
<p><italic>fd3F</italic> fits the more conventional view of a proneural target gene that implements a subtype-specific program of differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Powell2">[31]</xref>. It is expressed downstream of <italic>ato</italic> uniquely in Ch neurons and regulates genes required for functional specialisation of the Ch ciliary dendrite. It is likely that Forkhead factors regulate specialisation of ciliogenesis in other organisms. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>FKH-2</italic> is expressed widely early in development but is also required specifically for ciliary specialisation of one type of sensory neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Mukhopadhyay1">[36]</xref>. <italic>Foxj1</italic> in mice, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and zebrafish appears to be required for the motile cilia of the lung airway and embryonic node, but not for primary cilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Yu1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gomperts1">[39]</xref>. It remains to be determined whether <italic>fd3F</italic> regulates the machinery for the active beat that occurs in Ch dendrites as part of sensory transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gpfert1">[33]</xref>. Together, our studies of <italic>Rfx</italic> and <italic>fd3F</italic> extend the previously limited knowledge of the gene regulatory network underlying ciliogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gerdes1">[13]</xref> and provide insight into how the core program may be modified to produce the highly specialised and diverse morphologies that cilia adopt for different functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Mukhopadhyay1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous to this study, little was known about how <italic>ato/sc</italic> proneural genes control the acquisition of Ch/ES subtype identity, except that regulation of the Cut homeodomain transcription factor is involved. Mutant and misexpression analyses show that <italic>cut</italic> is a fate selector switch for ES identity downstream of <italic>sc</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Bodmer1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Blochlinger1">[40]</xref>, but nothing is known of its mode of action or targets. Whereas <italic>Rfx</italic> and <italic>fd3F</italic> functions are likely to be confined to neuronal morphology, <italic>cut</italic> affects the identity of support cells too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Merritt1">[41]</xref>. As a fate switch in the entire lineage, it appears likely that <italic>cut</italic> is involved in high-level fate specification (like proneural genes) rather than regulating aspects of differentiation directly. However, it is also possible that <italic>cut</italic> may repress ciliogenesis genes in ES neurons, either directly or by repressing <italic>Rfx</italic> expression. It will be important to integrate <italic>cut</italic> into the Ch/ES gene regulatory network in the future.</p>
<p>In our temporal expression profiling data, there is a steady increase in the number of known or suspected differentiation genes expressed in developing Ch cells. Many more are not expressed until after our analysis ends. Ciliogenesis is a highly intricate cellular process requiring the coordination of perhaps hundreds of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Gerdes1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Li1">[42]</xref> and differences in expression onset may indicate prerequisite steps in the process of differentiation and ciliogenesis. A surprising observation was the significant number of ciliogenesis and differentiation genes that are expressed even at the earliest profiling time point. This is unexpected, since the earliest time point is predicted to be not only before differentiation but also even before cell divisions have generated the neurons. We suggest that further analysis of expression timing may lead to insights into the cell biology of ciliogenesis. The early activation of differentiation genes may reflect the rapid pace of development in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. Thus, early expression of ciliogenesis genes may provide components that prime cells for rapid cilium assembly later once differentiation has been triggered. Along these lines, our findings mirror striking observations of retinal ganglion cells, whose rapid differentiation within 15 minutes of the exit from mitosis has been taken to imply that genes required in postmitotic cells must be transcribed before cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Livesey1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Waid1">[44]</xref>. A more intriguing possibility is that early expression reflects an orderly time course for ciliogenesis that begins many hours before the final cell division. For example, <italic>unc</italic> is thought to be required for the conversion of the mitotic centriole to ciliogenic basal body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Baker1">[14]</xref>, but we found that the mRNA and fusion protein are expressed even in SOPs, several cell divisions before terminal differentiation. Interestingly, in mammals newly replicated centrioles mature over two cell cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Rieder1">[45]</xref>. It is conceivable that the sensory neuron basal body might similarly need time to mature.</p>
<p>Since <italic>Rfx</italic> and some ciliogenesis genes are expressed in SOPs, what prevents ciliogenesis from being activated in the non-neuronal support cells? One possibility would be an extension of model recently proposed for the generation of support cell differences, in which Notch signalling between daughter cells confines the function of genes to one branch of the lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Miller1">[23]</xref>. This would predict that ciliogenesis genes and/or <italic>Rfx</italic> are Notch target genes. Another possibility is that some of the gene products are asymmetrically segregated. Thirdly, ciliogenesis may not be triggered until one or more key gene products are produced in the neuronal cell.</p>
<p>As a corollary, it will be important to explore further the gene regulatory network underlying the temporal and cell-type differences in ciliogenesis genes. Some early expressed differentiation genes are known or predicted <italic>Rfx</italic> targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Laurenon1">[20]</xref>. This gives a rationale for the early regulation of <italic>Rfx</italic> by <italic>ato</italic> in Ch lineages. However, in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Rfx</italic> regulates only a subset of ciliogenesis genes (notably, it does not regulate IFT-A genes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000568-Laurenon1">[20]</xref>. Further studies on <italic>ato</italic> target genes and the ciliogenesis regulatory network in sensory neurons will identify other important regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000568-g007">Figure 7</xref>). It remains to be determined how many differentiation genes are, like <italic>dila</italic>, direct targets of <italic>ato</italic>. Interestingly, vertebrate proneural factors are hypothesised to regulate directly the transition from cycling neural progenitor (or neural stem cell) to postmitotic differentiating neuron. Perhaps <italic>ato</italic> has retained some part of an ancestral proneural factor function in direct regulation of terminal differentiation despite the subsequent evolution of SOPs that must undergo several divisions before differentiating.</p>
