Although the functional significance of individual coding mechanisms has been investigated, ways in which multiple mechanisms interact and integrate are not well understood. The locust olfactory system, in which dense, transiently synchronized spike trains across ensembles of antenna lobe (AL) neurons are transformed into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB; a region associated with memory), provides a well-studied preparation for investigating the interaction of multiple coding mechanisms. Recordings made <italic>in vivo</italic> from the insect MB demonstrated highly specific responses to odors in Kenyon cells (KCs). Typically, only a few KCs from the recorded population of neurons responded reliably when a specific odor was presented. Different odors induced responses in different KCs. Here, we explored with a biologically plausible model the possibility that a form of plasticity may control and tune synaptic weights of inputs to the mushroom body to ensure the specificity of KCs' responses to familiar or meaningful odors. We found that plasticity at the synapses between the AL and the MB efficiently regulated the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter the intense AL oscillatory output and condense it to a sparse representation in the MB. Activity-dependent plasticity drove the observed specificity, reliability, and expected persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role for plasticity in information processing and making a testable prediction about synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The way in which the brain encodes, processes, transforms, and stores sensory information is a fundamental question in systems neuroscience. One challenge is to understand how neural oscillations, synchrony, population coding, and sparseness interact in the process of transforming and transferring information. Another question is how synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change their strength, interacts efficiently with these different coding strategies to support learning and information storage. We approached these questions, rarely accessible to direct experimental investigation, in the olfactory system of the locust, a well-studied example. Here, the neurons in the antennal lobe carry neural representations of odor identity using dense, spatially distributed, oscillatory synchronized patterns of neural activity. Odor information cannot be interpreted by considering their activity independently. On the contrary, in the mushroom body—the next processing region, involved in the storage and retrieval of olfactory memories and analogous to the olfactory cortex—odor representations are sparse and carried by more selective neurons. Sparse information coding by ensembles of neurons provides several important advantages including high memory capacity, low overlap between stored objects, and easy information retrieval. How is this sparseness achieved? Here, with a rigorous computational model of the olfactory system, we demonstrate that plasticity at the input afferents to the mushroom body can efficiently mediate the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter intense sensory input, condensing it to the sparse responses observed in the mushroom body. Our results suggest a general mechanism for plasticity-enabled sparse representations in other sensory systems, such as the visual system. Overall, we illustrate a potential central role for plasticity in the transfer of information across different coding strategies within neural systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Swartz Foundation, the NIDCD, and an NICHD intramural award.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal circuits implement a variety of coding strategies that differ in their reliance on precise timing and correlations between action potentials (“spikes”).

The functional significance of these distinct coding strategies has been investigated in different sensory modalities, yet their interaction and integration within neural systems remains an open question in the theory of neural coding.

In particular, in the antenna lobe (AL) of the locust <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Laurent1">[3]</xref> (the analog of the vertebrate olfactory bulb), oscillatory synchronization is a feature of population coding.

In locusts, although a large fraction of the 830 AL projection neurons (PNs) participates in a dense and dynamic oscillatory response, only a very small subset of the 50,000 Kenyon cells (KCs) in the ipsilateral MB actively responds to any single odor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive1">[7]</xref>. Individual KC responses are rare and consist, on average, of only a few action potentials. Thus activity in the MB is sparse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive1">[7]</xref>, and population codes mediating odor representations differ markedly between AL and MB. Similarly, studies in mice have shown that individual odorants are represented by subsets of sparsely distributed cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Zou1">[21]</xref>.</p><p>The transformation of odor responses from AL to MB requires the tendency of PNs to synchronize through oscillatory dynamics, the ability of KCs to respond as coincidence detectors, activated only by correlated input from the AL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive2">[8]</xref>, and a precisely and actively tuned match between coding and decoding processes.

We explored this hypothesis here with a biologically plausible computational model. This model includes the main processing steps of the insect olfactory system, but was designed to be general enough to allow comparisons to vertebrate olfaction and to sensory processing in other brain areas. Two different forms of dynamic regulation of synaptic strength were compared, one based on the precise millisecond timing of individual spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Gerstner1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Song1">[24]</xref> and a second that depended on the rate of spike occurrence averaged over longer intervals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Sejnowski2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Miller1">[26]</xref>. We found that plasticity can efficiently tune the selectivity for synchronized input, generating sparse, reliable and persistent representations to familiar or meaningful odors in the MB. Finally, we found the model makes an experimentally testable prediction about plasticity mechanisms governing synapses to KCs. Although this model is focused on the locust olfactory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive1">[7]</xref>, electrophysiological recordings and theoretical considerations suggest that sparseness could be a ubiquitous coding strategy exploited by several different modalities across different organisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Olshausen1">[5]</xref>).

In general, population sparseness across all odors decreased linearly with increasing initial conductance in the naive case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Yet both rate- and timing-dependent plasticity mechanisms produced the same near maximal sparseness, with somewhat lower sparseness when initial conductances exceeded 120%. Thus, activity-dependent synaptic tuning is able to normalize postsynaptic neuronal responses over a wide range of initial conditions, and can do so without a global scaling signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Song2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Kempter1">[31]</xref>. Additionally, this finding strongly mitigates the choice of initial synaptic strengths for computational models incorporating synaptic mechanisms with forms of plasticity analogous to SRDP or STDP: such models require less fine-tuning to work well. Finally, these forms of synaptic plasticity appear to favor a sparser code within a neuron population of fixed size, thereby increasing the global storage capacity of the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Olshausen1">[5]</xref>.

The random sequence was less effective at producing reliable odor representation, indicating that repeated consecutive presentations of 1-s trials from the same odor are needed to form a more stable representation. Exposure to odors not included in the training sequences (e.g. odors 5, 6, 7, 8, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g003">Figure 3</xref>) in one case reproduced the expected pattern with remarkable similarity (odor 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For the other odors, the responses after olfactory experience remained similar to their respective naive case (not shown). These results suggest that training by a set of odors presented even in random sequences could tune the system and lead to high KCs specificity for each of them. What is important is an extensive “coverage” of the odor space by the set of odors used for training. Thus, training by a set of similar odors can leave some of AL to MB afferents unchanged, so the following presentation of another “different” odor may lead to a non-sparse response. In contrast, a set of more distinct odors would tune the whole system for all possible inputs including those not used for training. This “tuning” with even an impoverished set of odorants could occur at early stages of development. This result suggests some behavioral consequences, e.g., animals growing in a very stable and poor odor environment should show poor performance in discriminating among similar odors if these odors belong to a novel (for that animal) chemical group.</p><p>We found that the rate-based learning rule was less successful in storing multiple odors. Exposure to a single odor after olfactory experience with multiple odor sequences with SRDP induced firing patterns with mixed degrees of similarity to those expected and observed after training with a single odor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000062.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The expected pattern was reproduced only in 44% of the tested samples. The remaining combinations either yielded “wrong” patterns (13%) or did not elicit any reliable response. In some cases, odor sequence training induced a KC to become specific to an odor to which it was not responding when trained on the same odor alone (e.g., sequence 1234 tested with odor 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000062.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Interestingly, the best reproductions of the expected, single odor-trained olfactory representation were observed when presenting the first odor of each training sequence, e.g. odor 1 for 1234, odor 2 for 2143, etc., indicating that under SRDP the first odor in the sequence had a major effect on the synaptic strengths of KCs. Also in the SRDP case, the random sequence did not induce any significant persistent odor representation.</p><p>Finally, exposure under SRDP to odors not included in the training sequences did not reproduce the original patterns, and responses were often characterized by widespread silence. Thus, although the two learning rules performed similarly in the previous experiments, the results with odor sequences indicate that synaptic changes induced by STDP are more specific and less disruptive than SRDP, allowing persistent coexistence of multiple olfactory representations. This result can be explained in part by the more significant alternations of synaptic weights observed with SRDP model (see below). Note that the performance difference between the two plasticity models cannot be equalized by modifying the model parameters to reduce synaptic changes associated with SRDP. Such a change would actually decrease the SRDP model performance in experiments with single odor presentations.</p><p>It is important to emphasize a difference between olfactory stimuli and other modes of sensory input, e.g., visual. In our model, each odor stimulus could be considered a sequence of independent pulses or bins, each bin corresponding to one cycle of LFP oscillations. Each cycle consisted of a unique combination of active PNs that were synchronized to each other, and all together provided an input that may be sufficient to induce spiking in a postsynaptic KC. Only small subset of all possible 10 cell combinations of PNs had a “real” target (one of 19 KCs) in our model. Each KC produced typically zero or one spike during the whole 1 sec odor stimulus, responding to a unique combination of synchronized PNs found at one of many LFP cycles. Coincidence detection properties of the KCs in our model prevented integration across many cycles making each cycle essentially independent. In other words, each unique pattern of PN activity at each LFP cycle during 1 sec odor presentation could be treated as a separate stimulus – brief odor pulses. Therefore, one possible interpretation of the above experiments on representation persistence is that a set of 20 different stimuli presented as a sequence (first 1 sec odor) was used to train a model circuit, followed by application of 3x20 (2d, 3d and 4th odors) independent stimuli. Finally, the representation persistence was tested using the original set of 20 stimuli. Results of simulations support a coexistence of multiple odor representations; the sparseness of KC responses guaranteed little interaction between different odor representations.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Synaptic Strength Dynamics</title><p>To better understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of the response patterns to multiple odor sequences, we analyzed the evolution of the synaptic strengths under each learning mechanism. While training with odor sequences, changes under SRDP affected most KCs, and most synapses at each KC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, upper row). The proportion of synapses undergoing strong changes was larger than for STDP, as shown by the wider and higher kurtotic distributions of synaptic efficacies for increasing number of training trials and learned odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, upper rows). In contrast, synaptic changes under the STDP rule were subtler, and restricted to fewer KCs and fewer synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). As expected from the specified dependence on instantaneous conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), both rules generated unimodal distributions of synaptic efficacies, for both single odor and odor sequence olfactory experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The average evolution of synaptic strength shows that SRDP had a stronger impact on KC synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). After SRDP learning of the first odor in a sequence (or 50 single odor learning trials), the average change was comparable to the value reached with STDP after exposure to the full 4-odor sequence (200 trials, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, under these conditions, STDP is more selective than SRDP.

Distinct olfactory representations were already obtained with one training block. With two training blocks (100 trials), odor classification improved further, resulting in only three cases of partial overlap. The average evolution of the classification error rate across all odor pairs suggests that an asymptotically small (∼2%) number of classification errors was reached after 100 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). We noted that, corresponding to this saturation point, the divergence of average odor responses (cloud centers) in KC odor space also reached an asymptotic value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). After 100 training trials the distance between two cloud centers was always larger than twice the average distance of single responses from their respective centers (cloud radius), explaining the optimal classification results.</p><p>To what extent does plasticity-based improvement of KC decoding abilities depend on the difference between PN responses elicited by odors, that is, their mutual distance in PN space? To explore those features over a homogeneous distribution of pairwise distance values, we generated several sets of 10 odorants with increasing degree of dissimilarity between odors within sets (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g008">Figure 8A</xref>).

For each odor pair in a set, we quantified the distance (or divergence, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) in PN space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, bottom panel) and classification error in KC space (as above) between the two representations. Before synaptic tuning with STDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, upper panel), odor pairs with a high degree of similarity in slow structure gave a wide range of error rates (0–45%), suggesting that the naive circuitry is unable to exploit synchrony information to create distinct representations. The fraction of pairs with poor classification was very high, particularly over the range of PN distances covered by the two sets with very similar odors. For larger PN distances, the error rate was nearly constant and mostly below 5%. Thus the classification rate was influenced by differences already expressed in, and transmitted from the AL. After olfactory experience, the error rate for most odor pairs plummeted to below 5% over the whole PN distance range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, mid panel). This suggests that the strong enhancement of classification ability for similar odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, insert) was provided by the increased sensitivity to oscillatory synchronization patterns after STDP, as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Stopfer2">[12]</xref>.

In our computational model, plasticity could optimally tune KCs to become selective coincidence detectors of preferred simultaneous PN input. Physiological results from locust MB indicate that coincidence detection results from the non-linear membrane integrating properties of active depolarizing conductances (most likely voltage-dependent) in KCs together with AL driven feed-forward inhibition through lateral horn interneurons (LHIs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive2">[8]</xref>. Even with the intrinsic (active conductances) and synaptic (input from LHIs) mechanisms present, the specificity of KCs responses to dynamic input is likely to require “initial” tuning of the synaptic strengths between AL and MB. Indeed, with excessively strong synaptic afferents, as in the case of high initial synaptic conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g004">Figure 4</xref>), a few aligned PN spikes would be sufficient to induce spiking in a KC. Reducing the KC integration window would reduce the probability of firing; however, the sparseness of the response would still depend on the synaptic weights. Increasing the initial synaptic coupling from AL to MB would sacrifice sparseness. In this situation the KC could not detect stimulus specific synchrony in the input from the AL, resulting in a surplus of KCs firing for each odor presentation. Computational work has shown that only when temporal aspects of coding were not addressed, plasticity in the MB could be omitted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Huerta1">[38]</xref>. Thus, in our model, synaptic plasticity provides a mechanism for tuning synaptic weights to the MB to enable coincidence detection-based odor encoding by KCs, and to ensure a sparse odor representation in the MB as observed experimentally. However, these results do not imply that odor encoding in the mushroom body depends solely on previous odor experience; synchronous spiking in odor specific populations of PNs controls the KCs response patterns during odor stimulation. Therefore, in the system implementing AL-to-MB plasticity proposed here, the similarity of glomerular olfactory maps and the structure of the olfactory system across individuals (e.g.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Marin1">[ 39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Tanaka1">[40]</xref>) can still be reflected in odor-evoked activity in the MB as observed, for example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Wang1">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Here we propose a form of experience-dependent plasticity as a complementary mechanism to stabilize the interface between the two circuits, increasing reliability, providing persistence and maximizing the selectivity of sparse responses to time-varying input.

Analogous scenarios may occur in other neural systems. In the developing visual system, the fundamental structure of cortical maps appears to be intrinsic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Crowley1">[42]</xref>, yet experience is crucial for maintaining the responsiveness and selectivity of cortical neurons, as well as for defining detailed map features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Crair1">[34]</xref>.

With our model we found that changing the fraction of PNs synapsing upon a single KC made little difference to the results as long as all initial synaptic weights were scaled accordingly. Indeed, the fraction of PNs connected to a single KC, the size of the KC integration window and the absolute synaptic weights between AL and MB constitute complimentary parameters that control the sparseness of MB responses. The effect of increasing the number of PNs projecting to a single KC is similar to that of increasing synaptic weights or increasing the integration window in KCs – all lead to a loss of sparseness (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, our study provides a general prediction for how a loss of sparseness in the MB can be recovered by active plasticity mechanisms operating between AL and MB.</p><p>Sparseness of KCs responses also depends on the input they receive from LHIs; this rhythmic inhibitory input resets KCs at the end of each oscillatory cycle, thus preventing the integration of spikes from PNs over longer time intervals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive2">[8]</xref>. And, recently, it was proposed that LHIs maintain the sparseness of KCs' responses across a wide range of odor concentrations by changing the size of the KCs' integration window <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Assisi1">[44]</xref>. Under the conditions considered by our model, however, the duration of the KCs integration window was already limited by the intrinsic properties of KCs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to the case of a change in odor concentration, a change in the synaptic weights between the AL and the MB does not affect the timing of the LHI firing. Therefore, an increase in synaptic weights to the MB would lead to immediate increases in response probability of KCs, which cannot be compensated by LHI input; under these conditions, other mechanisms involving direct alternations of synaptic weights are required to control sparseness.</p><p>Between zero (no specific response in any KC) and ∼15% of all KCs, depending upon the odor, remained active after training in our model; a given odor usually induced responses in 5-10% of all KCs. This fraction is somewhat larger than the estimations from the experimental data, likely the consequence of our simulation of odors as the activation of all PN afferents. <italic>In vivo</italic>, an odor would induce measurable responses in only a fraction (∼40%) of the total PN population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Mazor1">[45]</xref>.

Repeatedly correlated inputs on the timescale of the LTP time window will eventually control postsynaptic firing, whereas less effective, uncorrelated inputs will be weakened. Thus the STDP mechanism was more effective than SRDP at tuning postsynaptic neurons to select synchronized ensembles. Synaptic changes under STDP were in general less intense and more selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g006">Figure 6</xref>), such that a fixed number of synapses could learn to represent a larger number of odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This was mediated by the fine timing-dependent interplay of LTP and LTD that allows activity-dependent bidirectional modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Markram1">[46]</xref>, a computationally useful feature. In addition, acting locally at each synapse, STDP conveyed global stability and normalized synaptic strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Song2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Kempter1">[31]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g004">Figure 4</xref>), without requiring a global scaling signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Abbott2">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Why does STDP favor sparse representations in the MB? A spike occurred in a KC only when input from the AL exceeded a predefined threshold. We found that vigorous spiking occurred throughout the MB when this threshold was set low – then, many KCs received input sufficient to trigger a spike. Because different KCs sample different sets of PNs, dense spiking can only occur when synapses are relatively strong, permitting only few input spikes to depolarize KCs above the spike threshold. Thus, there is a strong relationship between the sparseness of responses in KCs and synaptic weights from AL to MB. This relationship also underlies our observation that, when MB responses are dense, only the first few of a series of spikes from PNs received by KCs may have positive STDP timing; the rest of the spikes will arrive after the KC has fired an action potential, causing the respective synapses to be weakened by STDP. Thus, for each KC, plasticity acts to facilitate only a few of the input synapses and depresses the others. The overall effect of this dynamic is a decrease in net synaptic weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Synaptic depression halts only when synaptic weights become sufficiently weak that the collective action of the majority of the input spikes is required to trigger a postsynaptic KC response. Because only a fraction of the PNs is synchronized during an odor response, only a few KCs may receive enough synchronized input to spike. So, the process converges to the state that is characterized by sparse odor representation in the MB.</p><p>Whereas the functional significance of oscillatory synchronization in neural circuits is generally uncertain, in the insect AL it has been shown to be essential for fine perceptual discrimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Stopfer2">[12]</xref>. Our model replicated this aspect of coding, as shown by simulations with PN firing patterns with the same slow temporal structure but different cycle-specific PN synchronization. Because of the intrinsic sensitivity to such synchronous ensembles, STDP tuning efficiently enhanced the ability of the circuit to discriminate among similar odors (simulated by similar PN response patterns), significantly reducing classification errors. In general, STDP was more effective than SRDP, which has implications for future experimental investigations of plasticity mechanisms in insects MB. We cannot exclude the possibility that, for different types of neuronal networks and different input patterns, SRDP may prove as efficient as STDP did in our model of the locust olfactory system. Particularly, models of sensory processing which do not depend on the synchrony of presynaptic spikes may benefit less from STDP. We tested a wide range of parameters in our model and always found STDP to perform better than SRDP. Interestingly, STDP was recently observed to occur at the downstream (projected to the alpha/beta lobes) synapses from KCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Cassenaer1">[47]</xref>.

However, the main prediction of our study is that synaptic plasticity on the KCs dendrites is important to ensure optimal (sparse) MB responses after sufficient odor experience. It suggests that a broad enough set of distinct odors could tune the whole system and ensure optimal MB responses for all possible inputs including those not used for training.

At the next cycle any active PN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, colored boxes) could then become silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, white boxes) and vice versa. However, to avoid abrupt changes we assigned higher probability (<italic>P</italic> = 0.65) for any PN to stay in its current state (silent or active) than to change activation state. This procedure created firing patterns for individual PNs with epochs of active (silent) behavior lasting 150–200 msec on average, which was consistent with experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-MacLeod1">[67]</xref> and our previous results of AL modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Bazhenov1">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Spike timings of active PNs at each trial were calculated from Gaussian distributions with standard deviation σ being function of cell and cycle numbers. Narrow distributions (small σ) characterized cells firing consistently near LFP peak (see below) across trials (synchronized neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, pink boxes). Wide distributions characterized neurons spiking randomly from one trial to another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, yellow boxes). For a given neuron, σ changed from one cycle of oscillation to another to model transient patterns of synchronization. To avoid fast switches between synchronous and asynchronous states, we assigned a higher probability for any active PN to preserve its low (or high) σ between cycles. About 50% of all active neurons were synchronized at each cycle of oscillations. This design created a temporal structure where action potentials of each PN were phase-locked with “the LFP” for 1–5 cycles of population oscillations (50–250 ms), and were followed or preceded by epochs of desynchronized firing or silence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-MacLeod1">[67]</xref> and previous modeling results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Bazhenov1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Bazhenov2">[10]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, on average, about 50% of the PNs were active at each instant of a given odor presentation. About half of those were synchronized with each other, generating 20 Hz oscillations in the population average (referred to as “the LFP”). The identities of both the active PNs and the synchronized subset changed slowly at each 50 ms oscillation cycle over stimulus duration, modeling slow temporal structure and transient spike synchronization, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-PerezOrive2">[8]</xref>. This pattern was odor specific and preserved across all trials with a given odor. However, precise timing of individual spikes was set to be different for different trials of a given odor, as calculated from Gaussian distributions. The resulting “jitter” of spike timing was centered on the LFP peak: it was small (&lt;10 msec) for synchronized PNs, while it was large (up to 50 msec) for nonsynchronized PNs. This jitter of PN spike timing was an essential source of noise in the input to the MB.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Olfactory Learning Experiments and Response Quantification</title><p>A presentation block of olfactory stimuli consisted in a series of 50 exposures to a 1-s odor trial followed by a 1-s blank period. Either SRDP or STDP mechanisms were engaged during training experiments, which typically involved presentation of multiple blocks. Plasticity mechanisms were disabled during quantifications of population response, which always employed one block (50 trials). Spike raster diagrams illustrating population responses over one presentation block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g002">Figure 2D and 2E</xref>, left panels) were summarized by cumulative spike count bar plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g002">Figure 2D and 2E</xref>, right panels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g003">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g005">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Population Sparseness</title><p>Population sparseness <italic>S<sub>p</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Willmore1">[68]</xref> was measured to quantify the extent to which the population code in KCs becomes sparser after repeated exposures to odors:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000062.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>N</italic> is the number of units and <italic>r<sub>j</sub></italic> is the response of unit <italic>j</italic>. This measure of sparseness is inversely proportional to the number of active cells in the population response, varying from 0 for the densest to 1 for the sparsest. To ensure that population sparseness was estimated only for reliable and meaningful responses to a given odor, we required that, at least in one cell, more than 1/4 of the 1-s trials elicited on average at least one spike.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Odor Space in AL</title><p>Odor encoding in the AL was determined by the spike timing structure over all PN-cycle combinations (100 PNs×20 oscillation cycles in a 1-s trial). A special metric was defined to measure the distance (divergence) between two such odor representations. First, for every PN a time series was created by convolving every spike with a Gaussian Kernel (σ = 5 ms, μ = 2σ, full-width-half-maximum = 11.8 ms). The 100 presynaptic spike trains representing the first odor were then compared pairwise with the 100 presynaptic spike trains representing the second odor using an L1-metric (Manhattan distance); this spawned a 100-D vector with the L1-distances. The Euclidean norm of this vector provided the distance measure between two odor representations in PN space.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Odor Space in MB</title><p>Single-trial population output in the MB was examined as a vector in a 19-dimensional (19-D) KC odor space, each dimension counting the spikes generated by one KC during response to a 1-s odor presentation. The average vector over 50 trials represented the average response to a given odor. For illustration, a set of single trial responses can be imagined as a 19-D cloud of points centered on their average response. The Euclidean metric determined the distance (divergence) between two responses. For example, two different odors with ultra sparse representations (i.e., based on one single KC spike per trial) would occupy the unity on orthogonal axes in MB odor space, and therefore their distance would be <italic>sqrt</italic>(2) = 1.44 spikes apart.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Similar Odorants</title><p>Some experiments required sets of similar odorants with a quantifiable degree of within-set similarity. Starting with the AL representation of a master odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000062-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>), a new odor was independently generated by randomly substituting a fraction of PN-cycle spike pattern combinations of the master odor, with a set-specific fixed substitution probability <italic>P<sub>S</sub></italic>. In other words, the slow temporal structure of odor encoding in AL was altered by <italic>P<sub>S</sub></italic> • 100%. For each of the 10 new odors in a set, each replacing spike pattern was extracted from the corresponding PN-cycle time window of one of 10 target odors totally different from each other. They were called ‘target’, because with <italic>P<sub>S</sub></italic> = 1 the slow temporal structure of the master odor would be entirely mutated into that of a target odor. Additionally, the synchrony characteristics (fine structure) of every PN-cycle in a new odor were reassigned independently. Spikes not phase-locked with the LFP could become synchronous, and vice versa. By repeating this procedure with several values of <italic>P<sub>S</sub></italic> ∈ {0, 0.02, 0.08, 0.2, 0.5}, we were able to control a progressive divergence of the master odor toward the 10 different target odors. Odor pairs in the new sets were thus characterized by varying degree of similarity determined by <italic>P<sub>S</sub></italic>. All newly generated odors had a comparable ratio of PN-cycle compartments with synchronous spikes, non-synchronous spikes and silence.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title><italic>In Vivo</italic> Recordings</title><p>Standard extracellular, “tetrode” recordings were made from PNs in the locust antennal lobe, as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000062-Stopfer3">[33]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000062.s001" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000062.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>SRDP and the persistence of olfactory representations.
