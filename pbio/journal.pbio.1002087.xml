<article-title>Link between Cell Junctions and Microtubule Cytoskeleton Is Critical for Epithelial Morphogenesis</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Epithelial morphogenesis involves a dramatic reorganisation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. How this complex process is controlled at the molecular level is still largely unknown. Here, we report that the centrosomal microtubule (MT)-binding protein CAP350 localises at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. By two-hybrid screening, we identified a direct interaction of CAP350 with the adhesion protein α-catenin that was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Block of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin)-mediated cell-cell adhesion or α-catenin depletion prevented CAP350 localisation at cell-cell junctions. Knocking down junction-located CAP350 inhibited the establishment of an apico-basal array of microtubules and impaired the acquisition of columnar shape in Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells grown as polarised epithelia. Furthermore, MDCKII cystogenesis was also defective in junctional CAP350-depleted cells. CAP350-depleted MDCKII cysts were smaller and contained either multiple lumens or no lumen. Membrane polarity was not affected, but cortical microtubule bundles did not properly form. Our results indicate that CAP350 may act as an adaptor between adherens junctions and microtubules, thus regulating epithelial differentiation and contributing to the definition of cell architecture. We also uncover a central role of α-catenin in global cytoskeleton remodelling, in which it acts not only on actin but also on MT reorganisation during epithelial morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Epithelia cover all the surfaces of and the cavities throughout the body and serve as barriers between the organism and its external environment. Epithelial differentiation requires the coordination in space and time of several mechanisms that ultimately lead to the acquisition of distinctive epithelial features, including apical-basal polarity, specialised cell-cell junctions, and columnar shape. Epithelial differentiation also induces the reorganisation of three cytoskeletal networks: actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. In simple epithelia, cadherins and their cytoplasmic binding partners catenins play a crucial role in connecting cell-cell junctions to the actin cytoskeleton. The cadherin extracellular domain forms adhesive contacts between adjacent cells, and their cytoplasmic tail indirectly binds the actin-binding protein α-catenin, thus linking cell-cell junctions to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. We report here an additional role of α-catenin in remodelling microtubules during epithelial differentiation. In most epithelial cells, microtubules are organised as parallel bundles aligned along the apico-basal axis and as apical and basal plasma membrane-associated networks. We demonstrate that the microtubule-binding protein CAP350, which is only localised at the centrosome in most cells, is also recruited at cell–cell junctions in epithelial cells through its binding to α-catenin. In the absence of junctional CAP350, microtubules are unable to reorganise in bundles, and cells do not acquire columnar shape. Our results suggest that recruitment of centrosomal proteins to cell-cell junctions could be a general mechanism to control microtubule reorganisation in neighbour cells during epithelial differentiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epithelial polarisation involves a coordinated series of events resulting in the asymmetric segregation of plasma membrane into apical and basolateral domains. The establishment of apico-basal polarity is also accompanied by asymmetric distribution of intracellular organelles, cytoskeleton reorganisation, and polarised membrane trafficking [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. How the intracellular redistribution of organelles and the establishment of plasma membrane domains are coupled to define the spatial orientation of cell polarity is, however, not well understood.</p>
<p>The MT cytoskeleton undergoes a profound reorganisation during epithelial polarisation [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In many epithelia, MTs are prominently organised in bundles aligned along the apico-basal axis with their minus ends oriented toward the apical membrane and plus ends toward the basal membrane and as networks of mixed polarity underneath the apical and basal membranes. The molecular events underlying MT reorganisation and their contribution to epithelial morphogenesis remain unclear. In addition, these mechanisms seem to be different depending on the tissue. For instance, in the stratified epidermis, proliferative basal cells have a radial array of MTs organised around the centrosome (CTR), while differentiated cells have acentrosomal cortical MTs. During epidermal differentiation, desmosomes appear to be essential to organise MTs around the cell cortex. The centrosomal proteins Ninein, Lis1, and Ndel1 are recruited to desmosomes by desmoplakin [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and both desmoplakin and Lis1 are required to organise MTs at the cortex. In simple epithelia, lateral intercellular junctions are largely composed of cadherin-based cell–cell contacts or adherens junctions (AJs). AJs consist of cadherin-adhesion receptors and associated cytoplasmic proteins, collectively called catenins. Cadherins form an adhesive interface all along the lateral domain but are also organised into special complexes known as zonula adherens (ZA) that are localised at the apical end. AJs are enriched in MTs, and MT bundles aligned along the apico-basal axis have their minus ends in close proximity to the ZA [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The molecular players underlying the AJ–MT connection remain, however, mostly unknown.</p>
<p>Although cadherins are known to cooperate with the actin cytoskeleton [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], a growing body of evidence also links cadherins to MTs. Indeed, it has been shown that MT disruption either by overall depolymerisation or by freezing the dynamic activity of MT plus ends perturbs cadherin-based cell-cell contacts [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression of exogenous cadherins in CTR-free cytoplasts increased the number of MTs [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This effect, which was dependent on the formation of cell–cell contacts, was mimicked by application of beads coated with stimulatory anti-cadherin antibody and suppressed by overexpression of the cytoplasmic cadherin tail [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, targeting α-catenin, but not p120-catenin or β-catenin, to the plasma membrane reproduced the MT-stabilising activity of E-cadherin in this assay [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In mammalian epithelial cells, a protein complex containing Plekha7, the minus-end MT-binding protein Nezha/CAMSAP-3/Patronin, and KIF3C was reported to be recruited to ZA by interaction of Plekha7 with p120-catenin [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In nonpolarised individual cells, CAMSAP-3 is localised at the CTR and at minus ends of noncentrosomal MTs [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Whether CAMSAP-3 regulates the orientation of MTs in polarised epithelial cells remains to be elucidated. p120-catenin was also shown to interact with the MT plus-end binding protein CLASP2 in progenitor epidermal cells, suggesting that, depending on the cell context, p120-catenin could recruit opposite MT-binding activities [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>CAP350 is a large and highly conserved cytoskeleton-associated protein-glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domain-containing protein that directly binds MTs through its N-terminal domain. It localises at the CTR, where it might play a role in MT anchoring [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. CAP350 also participates in MT stabilisation at both the Golgi area and centrioles [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was reported that CAP350 interacts with the centrosomal protein FOP and recruits it to the CTR [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, a novel protein superfamily, the TON1 Recruiting Motif (TRM) protein family, has been identified in plants [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An archetypal member of this family, TRM1, is a MT-associated protein that localises to cortical MTs. TRM1 interacts in vivo with the TON1 protein that shares similarity with human FOP and is essential for MT organisation at the cortex [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Three motifs of TRMs (M3, M4, and M2) are found in CAP350. The M2 motif of CAP350 is responsible for FOP recruitment and was shown to interact with plant TON1 protein in yeast. These results suggest a conservation of CAP350-FOP centrosomal components in plant cells where they bind cortical MTs. CAP350 also targets the deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD) to the CTR in mammalian cells. This targeting is required for proper ciliogenesis, supporting an indirect role of CAP350 in primary cilium formation [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies on CAP350 have been generally performed in cells that do not make adhesive contacts with one another or do not express E-cadherin, such as Hela cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Intriguingly, a stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis of isolated adherent surfaces of epithelial MDCKII cells identified CAP350 as one of the most enriched cellular proteins [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This study suggested both the existence of a membrane-bound fraction of CAP350 in polarised kidney cells as well as a previously unknown role of this protein at the cell periphery.</p>
<p>In this work, we report that CAP350 localises at the cell cortex in a cadherin-adhesion-dependent manner. A two-hybrid screen for centrosomal protein partners revealed a consistent high-confidence interaction of CAP350 with the adhesion protein α-catenin. By using MDCKII cells grown either as polarised epithelia or as cysts, we show that CAP350 is required for epithelial morphogenesis.</p>

<title>CAP350 Localises at Cell-Cell Contacts in Epithelial Cells</title>
<p>By using a previously characterised goat polyclonal antibody (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, CAP350g), we found that in methanol- or paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed MDCKII epithelial cells, CAP350 is essentially detected at the CTR (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, left panel). However, when cells were extracted with Triton before fixation, an additional cell peripheral CAP350 labelling was observed (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, right panel). As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, CAP350 clearly co-localised with α-catenin at cell-cell contacts but it was absent from cell-substrate adhesion sites (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, arrows). These results suggested that CAP350 accumulated at cell-cell adhesions. Similar results were also obtained in human epithelial MCF10A cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig.</xref>). To confirm this peripheral localisation, we performed additional immunofluorescence (IF) experiments by using two other antibodies (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>): a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognising the N-terminal part of the protein (CAP350r, Novus Biologicals) and a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the central part of the protein (CAP350m, this work). Both antibodies revealed a fraction of CAP350 co-localising with α-catenin at cell-cell junctions, which was more conspicuous when cells became fully polarised (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Double labelling for CAP350 and the adhesion proteins E-cadherin or β-catenin further indicated that, in addition to the CTR, CAP350 localised at cell-cell adhesion sites in epithelial cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to verify the specificity of the peripheral labelling, we developed three short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviruses targeting different CAP350 sequences (shCAP1, shCAP2, and shCAP3) and infected MDCKII cells. As controls, we generated lentiviruses containing either empty vectors or shRNAs against CAP350 but including four point mutations (shm4). Four days post-infection, cells infected with any of the shCAP-lentiviruses showed reduced CAP350 expression when compared with either noninfected or control lentivirus-infected cells, as revealed by WB (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig.</xref>). When cells were infected with a mix of the three lentiviruses (hereafter shCAP-lentiviruses), CAP350 was almost undetectable by western blot (WB) (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Immunofluorescence experiments showed that under these conditions cortex-associated CAP350 fraction disappeared, thus confirming the specificity of the staining (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Similar phenotypes were observed in cells infected with any of the lentiviruses (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig.</xref>). Since lentiviruses targeted different CAP350 sequences, the possibility that the observed phenotypes were due to off-target effects is very unlikely. Under these conditions, however, the CTR-associated fraction was still present in most cells, suggesting a slower turnover of the protein at this location (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig.</xref>). These partially depleted cells appeared enlarged and displayed disorganised cell–cell contacts (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig.</xref>). Similar results were obtained in MCF10A cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig.</xref>).</p>
<p>Seven days post-infection, CAP350 centrosomal fraction was also exhausted (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E Fig.</xref>). In order to preserve the centrosomal function of CAP350, all our experiments were carried out in cells infected with shRNA lentiviruses for four days, after which CAP350 was still maintained at the CTR. Indeed, quantification of CAP350 fluorescence intensity of more than 800 cells proved similar amounts of centrosomal CAP350 in shCAP- and shm4-infected cells 4 d post-infection (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). To further assess the integrity of the CTR, the presence of specific centrosomal markers such as FOP, whose recruitment to the CTR is CAP350-dependent, γ-tubulin, and pericentrin (PCNT) was analysed in cells transduced with specific or control lentiviruses for four days. Once again, no significant differences in the distribution of any of these centrosomal proteins were observed (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). Altogether, these analyses indicated that the experimental conditions we had set up would allow us to investigate the role of CAP350 at the cell periphery without severely affecting its function at the CTR (see below for CTR functionality).</p>
<p>To further substantiate that CAP350 is a cell-cell junction protein in epithelial cells, we examined the distribution of CAP350 in cells lacking E-cadherin. As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>, in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) CAP350 was exclusively detected at the CTR by IF and hardly detectable by WB in whole-cell extracts, as expected for a strict centrosomal protein. Similar results were obtained in the MCF10A-derived cell line NeuT that expresses a constitutively active form of the oncogene ERBB2/HER/neu (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1F Fig.</xref>). In these cells, loss of E-cadherin and cell-cell adhesion was accompanied by loss of CAP350 labelling at the cell periphery but not at the CTR. A significant reduction of CAP350 expression was also detected by WB (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1F Fig.</xref>). These results, and those by others [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], suggest that whereas CAP350 is ubiquitously localised at the CTR, the presence of CAP350 at cell-cell contacts is a feature of E-cadherin-expressing epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Junctional Localisation of CAP350 Depends on Cadherin-Based Cell-Cell Adhesion</title>
<p>To examine if the peripheral localisation of CAP350 depends on cell-cell adhesion, we first applied the calcium chelation method with ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). As expected, under calcium chelation condition, cells detached from each other and rounded up. E-cadherin and α-catenin stainings disappeared from the plasma membrane (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 0 min). Similarly, CAP350 peripheral labelling was abolished by EGTA treatment (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 0 min). Calcium addition allowed de novo formation of cell-cell contacts. Sixty minutes after calcium addition, E-cadherin and α-catenin, but not CAP350, were detected at most of the cell-cell contacts (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 60 min). By 2 h, CAP350 was also recruited to cell adhesions (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 120 min).</p>

<p>Then, we wondered whether cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion was responsible for junctional CAP350 localisation. To address this issue, we specifically inhibited E-cadherin homophilic binding by using a blocking antibody against its extracellular domain DECMA-1 and examined the distribution of either E-cadherin, α-catenin, and CAP350. Cells were allowed to polarise for three days in the presence of either an irrelevant antibody (immunoglobulin G [IgG] control) or the DECMA-1 antibody. Contrary to the control, cells were unable to form confluent layers in the presence of DECMA-1 and appeared as isolated groups containing a variable number of cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Cell morphology and cadherin-based contact integrity were also compromised. As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, distribution patterns of either E-cadherin or α-catenin were altered or even abolished at some cell-cell contacts. Changes in CAP350 distribution completely paralleled those of E-cadherin or α-catenin (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). By contrast, the distribution of the zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) remained intact (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), indicating that changes in CAP350 localisation were not due to nonspecific alterations at the plasma membrane. Remarkably, we observed severe modifications of MT network in the presence of the blocking antibody, pointing out the relevance of E-cadherin-based adhesion in the organisation of the MT cytoskeleton (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that during cell-cell adhesion formation, the centrosomal protein CAP350 localises to cell-cell contact sites and that this localisation is dependent of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion.</p>

<title>CAP350 Interacts with α-catenin</title>
<p>To identify possible partners of CAP350, a two-hybrid screening was carried out using several fragments of the protein as baits. This screening identified a high-confidence interaction of CAP350 with α-catenin (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Seven independent α-catenin clones were isolated with the CAP2 fragment (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, dark red), corresponding to the middle part of CAP350, and three with the CAP4 fragment (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, dark yellow), corresponding to the C-terminus of the protein. To confirm these interactions, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments from A293T cells co-expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-α-catenin fusion protein and myc-tagged versions of either CAP2 or CAP4 fragments of CAP350 (as represented in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, top panel). A CAP1A fragment was also included in the assay as a negative control.

<p>All isolated clones contained a sequence that is included in the vinculin homology domain 1 (VH1) domain of the protein. To ascertain CAP350 binding to the VH1 domain of α-catenin, we generated two α-catenin-truncated mutants, VH1Cat consisting of the VH1 domain and VH2Cat roughly corresponding to the VH2 domain, to be used as a negative control (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, top panel). VH1 domain of α-catenin co-precipitated in the presence of both fragments, whereas no interaction was detected with the VH2Cat construct (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, bottom panels). Next, we used a lysate of GFP-α-catenin transfected cells to examine whether GFP-α-catenin co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous CAP350. As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> (top panel), anti-CAP350 antibodies co-immunoprecipitated both CAP350 and GFP-α-catenin.

<title>CAP350 Is Recruited to Cell-Cell Contacts through Interaction with α-catenin</title>
<p>To assess the contribution of α-catenin in CAP350 recruitment to cadherin-based cell-cell contacts, cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against α-catenin were examined by IF 36 h and 72 h after transfection (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells began to detach from each other, but some cell-cell contacts still remained. Under these conditions, both junctional α-catenin and CAP350 stainings were significantly diminished, and only residual α-catenin-CAP350 co-localisation was detected at the remaining cell-cell contacts. Seventy-two hours after α-catenin siRNA transfection, when most cell-cell contacts were disrupted, CAP350 peripheral localisation was completely abolished. WB of α-catenin siRNA transfected cell extracts confirmed almost full depletion of α-catenin after 72 h (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The amount of CAP350 in α-catenin-depleted cells did not change, indicating that disappearance of CAP350 peripheral labelling was not due to degradation (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, loss of α-catenin and subsequent dissociation of CAP350 resulted in the loss of the polarised pattern of MT cytoskeleton, further supporting the role of cadherin junctions in defining MT network architecture (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).

<title>Ectopic CAP350 Is Able to Bundle MTs</title>
<p>To characterise the molecular basis of CAP350 function in cell-cell adhesion, we ectopically expressed myc-CAP350 in MDCKII cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). As also reported in other cell types [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], at a low expression level CAP350 targeted the CTR (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig.</xref>). When the expression level increased, myc-CAP350 also associated with MTs, mostly in the pericentrosomal area (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). At a high expression level, the protein covered the whole MT network. Under these conditions, MTs did not arise from the CTR, and some unusually thick, bended MT bundles were observed (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), thus indicating that CAP350 is able to bind to the lattice of cytoplasmic MTs when present in excess. It must be noted that ectopic CAP350 was not detected at cell-cell contacts. Contrary to the endogenous protein, transfected myc-CAP350 was only detected in the insoluble fraction after detergent extraction (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) in agreement with the IF results. To investigate whether MT binding could prevent ectopic CAP350 targeting to cell-cell contacts, we expressed a truncated mutant lacking the MT-binding N-terminal domain but containing both α-catenin binding domains and the CTR targeting site (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Unfortunately, results from these experiments were inconclusive since the truncated mutant was not detected either at cell-cell contacts or at the CTR, probably because of improper folding (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig.</xref>).</p>

<p>An even stronger MT-bundling effect was detected when a construct consisting of only the N-terminal MT-binding domain CAP1 was expressed (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). In vitro assays had previously shown that the N-terminal domain of CAP350 directly binds MTs through two independent regions [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To provide support to the MT-bundling activity of CAP1 domain, we generated two shorter N-terminal constructs (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) corresponding to the two independent MT-binding sites [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, both truncated mutants were able to decorate MTs (although with different affinities), but none of them exhibited MT-bundling ability, indicating that these two domains have to form part of the same molecule to display this capacity. These experiments suggested that, in addition to its known MT-binding and stabilising properties, CAP350 might possess a genuine MT-bundling capacity.</p>

<title>CAP350 Targets α-catenin to MTs In Vitro</title>
<p>Since CAP350 is able to bind both α-catenin and MTs, we then wondered whether CAP350 could recruit α-catenin to MTs. To answer this question, we carried out in vitro MT co-sedimentation assays. Soluble fractions from control or CAP350-depleted cells were incubated with taxol and assembled MTs sedimented by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. As a negative control, guanosine-5’-triphosphate (GTP) and taxol were not added in parallel assays. As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>, α-catenin associated with MTs in a CAP350-dependent manner.

Altogether, our results support a model in which CAP350 could bridge adhesion complexes at the plasma membrane to MTs: CAP350 would be recruited to the AJs by interaction between its CAP2 and CAP4 domains and the VH1 domain of α-catenin and, in turn, would bind MTs via its CAP1 domain (see below).</p>

<p>Strikingly, cells lacking junctional CAP350 appeared bigger and flatter than control cells (see also <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). To quantify this phenotype, we measured the apical surface enclosed by the ZO-1 signal in mosaic images of confluent layers (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Quantification of more than 20,000 cells revealed a 25% increase in the mean apical surface of knockdown cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). This percentage is probably underestimated since a number of cells may not be transduced. The distribution profile of cells ranked by apical area clearly showed a shift towards higher apical area values in depleted cells: the number of cells with the smallest area decreased, whereas the number of cells with highest area increased (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). To find out whether this increase in size is due to defective cell-cell adhesion or to increased cell-substrate adhesion, we also compared the surface occupied by control or depleted cells when they grew isolated. Data indicated no significant differences among them (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Finally, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that the total volume of the cells remained unchanged after CAP350 depletion, suggesting that the increase in the apical area was accompanied by a decrease in height (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig.</xref>). Indeed, flattening of the cells was evident from vertical confocal images (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>).

<p>First, we monitored calcium-induced AJ reassembly in GFP-α-catenin expressing cells infected with either control shm4 (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, left panels, and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Movie</xref>) or shCAP lentiviruses (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, right panels, and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Movie</xref>). Under calcium chelation, α-catenin dissociated from the plasma membrane (time 0). In cells expressing CAP350, 30 min after calcium addition α-catenin was already detected at the cell surface, and by 60 min contacts between cells were re-formed. In cells lacking junctional CAP350, α-catenin accumulated at spotlike junctions at the tips of cellular processes between neighbouring cells. However, these primordial contacts seemed to be unstable and disappeared. By 4 h, stable contacts between CAP350-knockdown cells were not yet established. Extended cell-cell contacts between depleted cells were clearly observed 7 h after calcium addition, although cells still occasionally detached from each other and appeared more mobile than control cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig.</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Movie</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Movie</xref>). Thus, the absence of junctional CAP350 delays the establishment of cell-cell contacts, probably by interfering with the ability of the cells to extend nascent cadherin-based adhesive contacts, and affects their stability.</p>

<p>Then, we performed MT regrowth experiments after nocodazole treatment in the control (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, top panels) and junctional CAP350-depleted cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, bottom panels) that had been allowed to polarise for four days. At 8 min after drug washout, prominent MTs were observed to emanate from the CTR under both conditions. No significant differences were detected either in density or length of CTR-growing MTs. These results indicated that not only the integrity but also MT nucleation activity at the CTR were preserved under our shRNA conditions. By 40 min a dense MT network occupying the whole cytoplasm had been formed in both the control and junctional CAP350-depleted cells. Four hours after drug washout, however, MT organisation was strikingly different: whereas MT network had acquired a polarised phenotype with conspicuous cortical MTs in control cells, the MT network of CAP350-knockdown cells resembled that of nonpolarised cells with long and mostly straight MTs.</p>
<p>In order to follow MT dynamics and/or growth during cell polarisation, we generated a tetracycline-inducible MDCKII cell line expressing the microtubule plus-end binding protein 3 (EB3) fused to the fluorescent protein Ruby (Ruby-EB3). Control or shCAP lentivirus-transduced Ruby-EB3 cells were recorded 12 h after tetracycline addition (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Alternatively, they were allowed to polarise for four days before recording (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). In nonpolarised cells, both the distribution and the number of EB3 comets were similar either in the presence or in the absence of junctional CAP350 (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Movie</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Movie</xref>). MT-nucleating activity of the CTR was also comparable in control or partial CAP350-knockdown cells. By contrast, the pattern of EB3 comet distribution dramatically changed in control cells after polarisation (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Movie</xref>). In fully polarised cells, CTR activity was hardly distinguishable and the EB3 comets decreased in number and acquired a cortical distribution (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). This reduction in centrosomal activity and MT dynamics is in agreement with the increase in MT stability that has been described in fully polarised cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the absence of cortical CAP350, however, this shift of MT arrangement from a nonpolarised to a polarised state did not take place (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Movie</xref>). Indeed, the number of EB3 comets per cell was similar to that of control nonpolarised cells and four times higher than control polarised cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data support that CAP350 plays an important role in both the AJ formation and MT remodelling that occur during acquisition of columnar epithelial morphology. CAP350 thus emerges as a good candidate to mediate the reciprocal relationship between cadherin-based adhesion and MT cytoskeleton.</p>

<title>Reduction of CAP350 Expression Levels Results in Defective Cystogenesis</title>
<p>The effect of CAP350 depletion on epithelial architecture prompted us to study the function of CAP350 on cystogenesis. Consistent with 2-D-cultured cells, CAP350 staining was found at both the CTR, which localises at the apical pole, and the cell-cell junctions in MDCKII control cysts (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). In contrast, FOP exclusively localised at the CTR (magnifications in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). A more careful examination showed that CAP350 labelling intensity inversely correlated with the distance to the apical pole, and therefore, CAP350 overlapped with α-catenin mainly at the most basal half of lateral cell surfaces (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>).</p>

<p>Knockdown of CAP350 profoundly affected the number, the size, and the morphology of MDCKII cysts. The number of cysts formed from the same number of control- or shCAP-transduced cells plated on Matrigel was reduced by about 50%. Measurement of the diameter of more than 150 cysts revealed a 20% reduction in CAP350-knockdown cyst size compared to control cysts (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). These figures could reflect individual differences in the reduction of CAP350 expression level. It should be noted that successfully formed cysts from shCAP-transduced cells lacked cortical CAP350 but retained CAP350 and FOP at the CTR, which maintained its apical localisation (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>).</p>
<p>GP135/podocalyxin, an apical marker used to monitor lumen formation [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], showed that almost 70% of control cysts contained a single lumen (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). However, only 37% of CAP350-knockdown cysts were able to form a single lumen, while the rest contained multiple small lumens (42%) or consisted of cell aggregates without any obvious lumen (21%; <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Since defective cystogenesis can be attributed to cell polarity defects and subsequent mis-segregation of apical/basolateral membranes, we compared the localisation of several polarity markers in control and CAP350-knockdown cysts. In both cases, F-actin and GP135 were enriched at the apical membrane of all lumens, ZO-1 was restricted to the apical cell–cell contact region, and E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin were located at lateral cell–cell contacts. However, we could occasionally observe intracellular lumens (yellow arrows in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>), co-localisation of α-catenin and β-catenin with apical markers (arrowheads in <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>), and cells containing two apical poles. Furthermore, cadherin-based cell-cell junctions appeared wider and disorganised in CAP350-knockdown cysts. We conclude that the global cell polarisation is taking place in CAP350-knockdown cysts, although a series of minor defects could be observed. Reorganisation of the MT cytoskeleton and the alignment of MTs along the apico-basal axis could be observed by confocal microscopy in the MDCKII cyst (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). In addition, a conspicuous MT network in the basal pole and a meshwork of short MTs at the apical pole of cells could be observed. Strikingly, cysts obtained from CAP350-knockdown cells contained less MTs. Both apical and basal MT networks persisted, but very few vertical MTs could be observed throughout the whole cyst (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). Acetylated tubulin labelling that usually lines the lumen under the F-actin ring maintained its distribution in CAP350-depleted cysts, further suggesting that the apical MT network is retained in CAP350-depleted cysts (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). These results demonstrate that CAP350 is required for organising the apico-basal arrangement of MTs in 3-D-cultured MDCKII cells and is therefore necessary for epithelial architecture.</p>

<title>CAP350 Is Required for Epithelial Morphogenesis in Medaka Embryos</title>
<p>Finally, we aimed to understand the cellular role of CAP350 in the context of a developing organism.

All the anomalous transcripts generated upon MCap350 interference include premature stop codons and hence yield exon-5 truncated forms of Cap350 (i.e., including only the first 340 N-terminal amino acids [aas]).</p>

<p>To evaluate the efficiency of the microinjections, the RNA of the membrane-tagged tracer Lyn_tdTomato was injected alone (mock injection) or co-injected with MCap350. Only those embryos expressing significant levels of Lyn_tdTomato at blastula stage (stage 11) were scored and analysed further. Strikingly, while epiboly progressed normally in mock-treated embryos at stage 15 (<italic>n</italic> = 56), in 100% of the MCap350-injected embryos (<italic>n</italic> = 76), the blastoderm cells failed to properly migrate and accumulated at the animal pole (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002087.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10D</xref>). Later during development, MCap350-injected embryos failed to gastrulate and degenerated before neurulation (stage 18). This observation indicates that CAP350 is required for embryo morphogenesis very early during development, shortly after the onset of zygotic transcription, and suggests that this loss-of-function phenotype corresponds to a severe cellular defect. In agreement with data obtained from MDCKII cells, both MT network and cell contacts, as revealed by α-tubulin and α-catenin immunostainings, appeared disorganised in morphant embryos (<xref rid="pbio.1002087.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10E–J</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings identify CAP350 as an essential regulator of the MT architecture during epithelial differentiation. Recruitment of CAP350 to AJs by α-catenin confers to cells the capacity to develop apico-basal MT arrays and thus to acquire a columnar shape. Our data also indicate that, in addition to MT ends anchoring at the ZA, formation of cortical MTs would require MT stabilisation. Finally, they unveil a previously unknown role of α-catenin in coordinating actin and MT cytoskeleton remodelling during epithelial differentiation.</p>
<p>We show here that in E-cadherin-expressing cells CAP350 localised at both the CTR and AJs, whereas it was restricted to the CTR in nonepithelial cells or in cells that had lost E-cadherin expression because of oncogenic transformation. Interestingly, the total amount of CAP350 was also significantly reduced under these conditions, suggesting a coordinated regulation of either transcription or stability of both proteins. We also show that CAP350 recruitment to cell-cell contacts depends on both E-cadherin-based adhesion and α-catenin. On the other hand, CAP350-mediated binding of α-catenin to MTs could be demonstrated by MT-sedimentation experiments. Altogether, these results strongly support a role of CAP350 and α-catenin complexes at the AJ–MT interface. Remarkably, blocking of cadherin homotypic binding as well as depleting either α-catenin or junctional CAP350 led to similar perturbations on MT reorganisation during cell polarisation, highlighting the relevance of cadherin-based adhesion in MT regulation.</p>
<p>Biochemical approaches together with two-hybrid screening demonstrated that CAP350 could bind the N-terminal VH1 domain α-catenin directly. This domain has been reported to mediate α-catenin binding and α-catenin homodimerisation, which are mutually exclusive interactions [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since the VH1 domain is engaged in α-catenin binding at the AJs, the question as to how CAP350 binds to these complexes is intriguing and remains unresolved. Several other proteins, including merlin, centralspindlin, Ajuba, and DLC1, have been also reported to interact with the VH1 domain of α-catenin, but the mechanism responsible for their targeting to the ZA has not been investigated further [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. CAP350 contains two VH1-binding sites, suggesting that it may bind either two α-catenin monomers or one α-catenin homodimer. However, the asymmetric nature of the recently reported α-catenin dimer structure [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] suggests that CAP350 probably binds α-catenin monomers. Interestingly, a recent work has demonstrated that the complex formed by E-cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin is able to bind directly to F-actin under force application [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Anchoring of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin complexes to actin filaments in polarised cells mainly occurs at the apical-basolateral boundary, where the actin ring develops, and probably involves a set of additional actin-binding or regulatory proteins [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We showed in the present work that CAP350 was absent from this region and instead co-localised with a fraction of basolateral E-cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin complexes. Indeed, whereas E-cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin stainings in MDCKII cells forming cysts extended from the apical ZA to the basal membrane, CAP350 localisation was restricted to the basal half of the lateral contacts, being excluded from the ZA. This suggests that, in addition to α-catenin, other, as-yet-unknown factors should collaborate to confer this differential localization. This spatial segregation also suggests that α-catenin may participate in different cadherin-based complexes located at specialised membrane regions, where it may perform specific functions: ZA-located α-catenin could regulate actin dynamics, whereas basolateral α-catenin could participate in MT reorganisation. Further supporting this view, junctional CAP350-depleted cells exhibited perturbed AJs but an apparently intact ZA.</p>
<p>Cell-cell junction formation and MT reorganisation are multistep and interdependent processes. Our data point out a role for CAP350 in several steps of the process. Recruitment of CAP350 to the cell surface occurred shortly after membrane contact formation between neighbour cells both in normal growth conditions and after calcium addition. The binding of α-catenin to E-cadherin and β-catenin complexes preceded CAP350 recruitment, thus suggesting that CAP350 binds to preassembled E-cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin complexes. Accordingly, CAP350 depletion did not prevent α-catenin association to cell-cell contacts nor did it induce its dissociation. However, our in vivo experiments demonstrated that CAP350 participates in the formation of AJs. This agrees with previous data showing that MTs are required for AJ assembly in tumour cell lines [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and for AJ turnover in polarising epithelial cells in Drosophila [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A role for β-catenin-bound dynein in capturing MTs in developing cell-cell contacts has been reported [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is worth keeping in mind that, in addition to its N-terminal MT-binding domain, CAP350 contains a CAP-Gly domain and two putative end binding protein 1 (EB1)-interacting sites that could mediate binding to MT plus ends. It could be speculated that two different complexes containing either β-catenin and dynein or α-catenin and CAP350 cooperate during AJ assembly by providing both tethering and stabilising activities.</p>
<p>Interestingly, α-catenin and CAP350 complex properties and behaviour clearly contrast with those of the p120-catenin, Pleka7, and CAMSAP-3 system [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CAMSAP-3 specifically localises at the ZA, whereas CAP350 localises at the basolateral membranes. In addition, CAMSAP-3 is recruited to cell junctions only in the mature cell-cell contacts and therefore appears to be more important for their maintenance than for their formation. While CAMSAP-3 may function by anchoring MT minus ends to the ZA once the apico-basal MT array has been established, its potential role in MT reorganisation during polarisation remains still to be investigated [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Taken together, this evidence suggests complementary roles for these two MT-regulatory systems during apico-basal polarisation. Alpha-catenin and CAP350 complexes would act earlier, regulating AJ formation and the concurrent transition from a radial mesenchymal array to an apico-basal epithelial architecture. In the latter stages of the differentiation process, recruitment of CAMSAP-3 and KIFC3 to ZA could serve to anchor MT minus ends at the ZA. Based on the perturbations induced by full CAP350 depletion on MT organisation, a role for CAP350 in MT-minus-end anchoring at the centrosome was proposed [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, CAP350 also associated with MTs in the Golgi area [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and its related plant protein TRM1 was found to bind to cortical MTs [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These results, together with the present work, argue against a restricted role in MT-minus-end anchoring. More work is necessary to clarify whether CAP350 is a specific MT-minus-end-binding protein or if it plays a more general role in MT dynamics.</p>
<p>The presence of two tandem MT-binding sites in the N-terminal domain of CAP350, both of which are required for its putative MT-bundling activity, provide mechanistic insights on how CAP350 could participate in the formation of apico-basal MT arrays. Interestingly, junctional CAP350-depleted cysts contained few cortical apico-basal MTs, whereas the apical and basal MT networks were preserved. This supports the hypothesis that junctional CAP350 depletion does not affect global MT dynamics but does affect the stabilisation of cortical MTs specifically. Indeed, junctional CAP350-depleted-cells exhibited a robust MT-nucleating activity at the CTR and were able to develop a dense MT network, as shown by Ruby-EB3 live-imaging experiments during MT regrowth. However, contrary to control cells, CAP350-depleted cells lacked cortical MTs. The absence of cortical MTs may contribute to defective lumen formation. Only a few studies about the contribution of MTs to spatial orientation of apico-basal polarity are available [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Notably, our results indicate that CAP350-dependent stabilisation of cortical MTs is not essential for segregation of apical and basolateral domains nor for CTR or Golgi Apparatus (GA) relocation to the apical pole, which is in agreement with the fact that these relocations take place before MT reorganisation is completed. Indeed, analysis of apical exocytosis in polarising MDCKII cells revealed that efficient secretion of apical proteins occurs well before completion of MT array rearrangement [<xref rid="pbio.1002087.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Strikingly, knockdown of CAP350 in medaka embryos blocked epiboly. Epiboly, the spreading of the blastoderm over the large yolk cell, is considered the first morphogenetic movement of the teleost embryo. Given that epiboly occurs shortly after the onset of zygotic transcription at stage 12 and that the morpholino only interferes with spliced zygotic transcripts, it is likely that CAP350 has an essential and general role in tissue morphogenesis. This early arrest of development in epiboly prevented further analysis of CAP350 during embryogenesis but allowed us to confirm in a developing organism the results obtained in polarised kidney cells. CAP350-depleted blastoderm cells exhibited defects in cell-cell adhesion and MT organisation. These defects can account for the block in epibolic movement, since both E-cadherin and MTs have been shown to be essential for epiboly; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this work reveals an essential role of the CAP350-α-catenin complex in defining the polarised columnar architecture of epithelial cells. Epithelial polarity and tissue architecture are compromised at early stages of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a critical step in carcinoma progression and metastasis. Whether the CAP350-α-catenin complex somehow participates in this transition deserves further analysis.</p>

<title>Lentiviral shRNAs</title>
<p>Stable RNAi was achieved by lentiviral shRNA. RNAi sequence against human CAP350 was 5ʹ-GTTACTCAGATGAACGATA-3ʹ. RNAi sequences against canine CAP350 (shCAP1 5ʹ-TTAAGAAGCAACCTGGAACAGTTGA-3ʹ, shCAP-2 5ʹ-GCAGCAAGAGAAGGCAGAAATTAAA-3ʹ, and shCAP3 5ʹ-AAGAGATGGAGCTAATTTCTTTGTG-3ʹ) were designed by using the BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen). As controls, a shRNA containing four point mutations was used. Sequences were submitted to BLAST search to ensure targeting specificity. Complimentary oligonucleotides containing the shRNA sequences were synthesized with BglII and HindIII overhangs and were purchased from Sigma-Proligo. Oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into pSUPER. Next, the H1 polymerase promoter-shRNA sequence cassette was removed with EcoRI/ClaI and ligated into the lentiviral vector pLVTHM (Addgene plasmid 12247). Two different versions of each lentivirus were generated: +GFP and −GFP. All inserts were sequenced. Experiments in MDCKII cells were carried out by infection with a mix of the three lentiviruses (named shCAP), unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<title>MDCKII Ruby-EB3-Inducible Cell Line Generation</title>
<p>A Ruby-EB3-inducible cell line was generated using the Flp-In T-REx system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a MDCKII host cell line was obtained in a two-step procedure. In the first step, MDCKII cells were transfected with pFRT/lacZeo2 followed by selection with 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Single-copy integrants were identified by Southern blot analysis and β-galactosidase expression was analysed to identify clones with integration of the pFRT/LacZeo2 plasmid into a high-expression site (β-Gal Staining Kit, Invitrogen). In a second step, MDCKII cells were transfected with pcDNA6/TR and selected with 10 μg/ml Blasticidin (InvivoGen) until colonies formed.</p>
<p>To generate stable Flp-In T-REx MDCKII cells containing Ruby-EB3, EB3 was excised from mCherry-EB3 and inserted into pcDNA5/FRT/TO-neo-Ruby (kindly provided by Dr. J. Pines) between BamHI and NotI sites to create the plasmid pcDNA5/FRT/TO-neo-Ruby-EB3. This was co-transfected with pOG44 (1:9) into MDCKII host cells, and proper recombination events were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 (InvivoGen). To induce Ruby-EB3 expression, cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline for 12 h before the assay. Stable cells were maintained in culture with tetracycline-free FBS (Clontech) to avoid background expression of the protein.</p>

<title>Confocal Microscopy, Live Imaging, and Image Analysis</title>
<p>Confocal images were captured using either TCS SP5 or TCS SPE confocal Leica laser scanning systems equipped with DMI60000 and DM 2500 microscopes, respectively, and a HCX PL APO Lambda blue 63x 1.4 OIL objective at 22°C. Images correspond to maximal projections or optical sections according to each experiment. Mosaic images were automatically acquired with a Nikon eclipse Ti-e microscope controlled by NIS-Elements imaging software (Nikon) and using the scan-large-image tool.</p>
<p>For in vivo imaging experiments of AJ reassembly, cells expressing either control or CAP350 shRNAs (GFP-) were plated onto 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (IBIDI), transfected with peGFP-α-catenin and cultured in phenol red–free MEM. Two hours after EGTA addition, cells were washed, and transfected cells were identified and recorded at 37°C every 8 or 15 min for 5 or 12 h (as indicated) with an inverted microscope (DM16000; Leica) equipped with a camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics) and using an HCX Plan Apochromat CS 63×/1.4 NA oil objective. For time-lapse experiments to visualise MT dynamics, Ruby-EB3-inducible MDCKII cells were plated three days after infection with shCAP lentivirus (GFP+). Noninfected Ruby-EB3-inducible MDCKII cells were also plated. The day after, Ruby-EB3 expression was induced for 12 h, and cells were recorded every 24 s for 288 s. For quantification of the area covered by isolated cells, cells were plated at a density of 10,000–20,000 cells/ml and analysed the day after seeding.</p>
<p>Image processing was carried out using the Leica (LAS) and Adobe Photoshop softwares. For presentation, whole images were adjusted for intensity level, contrast, and/or brightness. Quantification of cell surface was performed using the multiwave length cell-scoring module of Metamorph Offline software. Cyst diameter was calculated with ImageJ and the command Multimeasure. The cyst section with the widest transverse diameter was chosen for image analysis. For quantification of lumen formation, MDCKII cysts were phenotypically classified into three groups based on GP135 staining: single-lumen cyst (single central lumen), multiple-lumen cyst (≥two lumens) and aberrant cyst (cell aggregate without visible lumen). More than 200 cysts from randomly selected fields were examined under each condition. For quantification of centrosomal CAP350 fluorescence intensity, mosaic images were processed with Metamorph Offline software. After background subtraction, resulting objects were detected by using the “create regions around objects” command and objects’ intensities were estimated with the “region measurements” tool. For calculation of the number of EB3 comets, cells with comparable levels of Ruby-EB3 expression were selected and processed with the ImageJ software. Regions were created around selected cells, and image background fluorescence was corrected. The number of Ruby-EB3 comets per cell was calculated by using the “analyse particles” command. Frame 5 of each movie was selected for quantification. Between ten to fifteen cells of each group were quantified.</p>

<title>Proposed model for the CAP350/α-catenin mediated mechanism that regulates MT reorganisation during epithelial differentiation.</title>
<p>CAP350 is recruited to AJs by interaction between its CAP2 and CAP4 domains and the VH1 domain of α-catenin. Once recruited to the AJ, CAP350 binds and could bundle MTs via its N-terminal domain. By linking E-cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin complexes at the plasma membrane with MTs, CAP350 may confer to cells the capacity to develop apico-basal MT arrays and to acquire columnar shape. In the absence of junction-located CAP350, transition from a radial mesenchymal MT array to an apico-basal epithelial one is blocked.</p>
