<abstract>
<p>Dendrodendritic synaptic interactions between olfactory bulb mitral and granule cells represent a key neuronal mechanism of odor discrimination. Dendritic release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from granule cells contributes to stimulus-dependent, rapid, and accurate odor discrimination, yet the physiological mechanisms governing this release and its behavioral relevance are unknown. Here, we show that granule cells express the voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in clusters distributed throughout the cell surface including dendritic spines. Deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in granule cells abolished spiking and GABA release as well as inhibition of synaptically connected mitral cells (MCs). As a consequence, mice required more time to discriminate highly similar odorant mixtures, while odor discrimination learning remained unaffected. In conclusion, we show that expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in granule cells is crucial for physiological dendritic GABA release and rapid discrimination of similar odorants with high accuracy. Hence, our data indicate that neurotransmitter-releasing dendritic spines function just like axon terminals.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>In axonal nerve terminals, neurotransmitter release is triggered by a localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomain generated by voltage-gated calcium channels in response to an action potential, which in turn is mediated by voltage-gated sodium channels. Dendritic neurotransmitter release has been thought to work differently, mainly depending on Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering directly through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, a subtype of ligand-gated ion channel. To further investigate how dendritic neurotransmitter is released, we studied granule cells in the olfactory bulb of mice, which establish inhibitory dendrodendritic synapses with mitral cells. We show that granule cells express voltage-gated sodium channels predominantly localized in dendrites and spines. Down-regulation of these channels precludes action potential firing in granule cells and strongly reduces mitral cell inhibition. Behaviorally, these mice require more time to discriminate highly similar odorants at maximal accuracy. Therefore, the inhibition of mitral cells relies on neurotransmitter released from the dendrites of granule cells by a mechanism that resembles axonal neurotransmitter release much more than previously thought.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inhibitory interactions in the olfactory bulb (OB) play a crucial role for spatiotemporal processing of olfactory information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref005">5</xref>]. The inhibitory network forming the mammalian OB circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref009">9</xref>] is dominated by a reciprocal dendrodendritic synapse established between mitral cells (MCs) and granule cells (GCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref015">15</xref>]. This synapse has been shown to define olfactory discrimination time in a stimulus-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref016">16</xref>]. The structural basis for this behavioral function is represented by two adjacent and inversely oriented synaptic contacts formed between an MC lateral dendrite and a GC spine: an asymmetric contact mediating glutamatergic excitation of the GC and a symmetric contact mediating GABAergic inhibition of the MC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref011">11</xref>]. Intense research has addressed the physiological properties of this synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref022">22</xref>], but important aspects of fast and synchronous neurotransmitter release from GC spines and its molecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. A key issue concerns the mechanisms translating the glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) into gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release from the GC spine.</p>
<p>In axonal nerve terminals, fast and synchronous neurotransmitter release is triggered by a highly localized cytoplasmatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomain generated by voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) in response to an action potential invading the presynaptic terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref027">27</xref>]. Mainly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> tail current during the repolarization phase of the action potential boosts Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and thereby drives neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref025">25</xref>]. This axonal mechanism of neurotransmitter release constitutes a hallmark of synaptic transmission, because it ensures fast and synchronous release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref026">26</xref>]. Dendritic release is thought to function differently. Previous work at the dendrodendritic synapse suggested that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow into the GC spine directly triggers GABA release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref028">28</xref>]. However, such a dendritic release mechanism would require Ca<sup>2+</sup> to diffuse over a large distance (approximately 1 μm) from the glutamatergic postsynaptic density to the GABAergic active zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref011">11</xref>], implying a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> domain directly driving neurotransmitter release. Yet such large Ca<sup>2+</sup> domains are unlikely to exist in GCs, because the high intrinsic buffer capacity of GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref029">29</xref>] limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion, and EGTA does not affect dendrodendritic inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref020">20</xref>]. Alternatively, the glutamatergic EPSP may be sufficiently strong to directly activate VDCCs located next to GABAergic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref020">20</xref>]. Specifically, the Na<sup>+</sup> inward current provided by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) may either directly trigger a local Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref020">20</xref>] or relieve Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of NMDARs and thereby contribute to the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal causing GABA release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref019">19</xref>]. Other conductances, such as transient receptor potential-canonical (TRPC) channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref030">30</xref>] or T-type VDCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref021">21</xref>], could amplify this process. Nevertheless, none of these mechanisms can provide a sufficiently steep voltage gradient to boost Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via the tail current mechanism. Only one report pointed toward a role of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) in GABA release from GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref019">19</xref>]: tetrodotoxin (TTX) application decreased dendrodendritic inhibition when applying short depolarizing pulses to MCs, while application of long depolarizing pulses increased it. Because this study relied on applying depolarizing square pulses (3 and 50 ms) that have no similarity with the time course and shape of an action potential, and furthermore used 0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and TTX in the external solution, these results describe a functional state that cannot be considered physiological. Hence, the contribution of VGSCs to physiological GABA release from GCs remains unknown.</p>
<p>Although dendritic expression of the VGSC Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 α-subunit has been demonstrated in hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref031">31</xref>], the molecular identity of dendritic VGSCs and, in particular, their contribution to dendritic transmitter release remain poorly described. Furthermore, the network and behavioral consequences of dendritic VGSC function remain unknown. To address these issues, we evaluated the expression of VGSCs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref032">32</xref>]) in mouse OB GCs and targeted the function of VGSCs in GC dendritic processing. Using 3D-immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref033">33</xref>], we found that GCs exclusively express the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 α-subunit strongly clustered across the entire GC surface, including the spine heads. We specifically knocked down Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 expression in GCs using viral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) delivery. Na<sup>+</sup>-current and GC spiking were abolished in knockdown GCs. Dendrodendritic inhibition of MCs was strongly attenuated. Discrimination of highly similar odorants required more time for accurate discrimination, yet discrimination of dissimilar odors and odor discrimination learning remained unaffected in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown mice. These results establish that VGSCs play a pivotal role in synchronous GABA release under physiological conditions at the dendrodendritic synapse that is required for fast odor discrimination.</p>

<title>Expression of VGSCs in the mouse OB</title>
<p>To clarify the role of VGSCs in GC function, we first analyzed the expression of VGSC α-subunits in the mouse OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Reverse transcriptase PCR (rT-PCR) showed that the SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, and SCN8A mRNAs were abundant in the OB, while only negligible amounts of SCN5A and SCN11A mRNA could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Because SCN5A (Na<sub>V</sub>1.5) is expressed in cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref034">34</xref>] and in limbic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref035">35</xref>], and SCN11A (Na<sub>V</sub>1.9) is expressed only in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref036">36</xref>], we focused our subsequent protein analysis on a subset of four VGSC α-subunits known to be widely expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref032">32</xref>]. Western blot analysis revealed the expression of five α-subunits in the mouse OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), four of which (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) correspond to the genes identified by rT-PCR (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, and SCN8A, respectively). Additionally, the VGSC α-subunit Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 was prominently expressed in the OB despite the absence of its mRNA (SCN9A). Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry using subunit-specific antibodies to assess the distribution of the VGSC α-subunits in the mouse OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We used the auxiliary β-subunit Na<sub>V</sub>2.1 to normalize the signal intensity of the VGSC α-subunits, because it is expressed ubiquitously with the α-subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref032">32</xref>]. Indeed, we have observed that the signal intensity of the β-subunit Na<sub>V</sub>2.1 is homogeneous across the OB layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g001">Fig 1D</xref>; ANOVA, <italic>F</italic> = 0.57, <italic>p</italic> = 0.64). Our region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of the signal intensity of the VGSC α-subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) suggests that Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 is most abundantly expressed in the OB, in particular in the granule cell layer (GCL) and in the external plexiform layer (EPL). Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is strongly expressed in the mitral cell layer (MCL) and olfactory nerve layer (ONL), while Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 mostly occurs in the ONL. Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is strongly expressed in the ONL and shows a weak and punctate expression in the GCL. The Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 subunit is strongly expressed in the ONL, consistent with its expression in olfactory sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref037">37</xref>] and the absence of its mRNA in our OB sample (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The monoclonal antibodies against Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 target epitopes on the N-terminus of these α-subunits that share a high sequence similarity. We used human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells transfected with a plasmid expressing the Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 epitope sequences to confirm the specificity of these antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>In conclusion, we have identified the distribution of VGSC α-subunits in the mouse OB, while it remains unclear which subunits are expressed in GCs.</p>

<title>GCs exclusively express the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 VGSC α-subunit</title>
<p>To identify the VGSC α-subunits expressed in mature GCs, 3D-immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref033">33</xref>] of sparsely prelabeled GCs was performed. To achieve this, the GCL of 3-week-old mice was stereotaxically injected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref016">16</xref>] with recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/1 (rAAV2/1) encoding membrane-bound green fluorescent protein (mGFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref038">38</xref>]. After 3 weeks of expression, tissue containing prelabeled GCs was immunostained with antibodies against the VGSC α-subunit of interest. Only cells with clear GC morphology (soma diameter of &lt;10 μm, dendrite projecting into the EPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref039">39</xref>]) were considered for further analysis. The immunosignal residing inside the mGFP-delimited GC was excised, thereby delineating the expression pattern of α-subunits in individual GCs. Strikingly, only the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 α-subunit was expressed consistently in GCs at detectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The other subunits found to be present in the GCL (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) are likely expressed in axons of MCs and cell types other than GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref041">41</xref>]. In some instances, we observed a random partial overlap between Na<sub>V</sub>1.x and mGFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) owing to technical limitations of 3D-immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref033">33</xref>]. To further corroborate our finding, we used phrixotoxin-3, a selective antagonist of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 at low nanomolar concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref042">42</xref>], to block Na<sup>+</sup> currents in GCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s003">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>). This experiment showed a 75% ± 10% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) reduction of the Na+ current at −30 mV and further reduction to 96% ± 0.8% after adding 1 μM TTX. The incomplete block by phrixotoxin-3 was due to the low concentration that had to be used to selectively block Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (1 nM, IC<sub>50</sub> is 0.6 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref042">42</xref>]). In contrast to GCs, phrixotoxin-3 caused only a minor reduction of Na<sup>+</sup> currents elicited in MCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s003">S3D–S3F Fig</xref>). Hence, phrixotoxin-3 block of the Na<sup>+</sup> current is consistent with the expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 reported by immunohistochemistry.</p>

<p>Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 was found in a strongly clustered arrangement in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), and in the gemmules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) of the GCs. Close-up 3D reconstructions of the gemmules revealed clusters of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 immunoreactivity within the spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). To quantify the distribution of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters in GCs, we determined the ratio of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 cluster area relative to the area delineated by mGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). This analysis revealed the highest density of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters within the spine heads and dendrites. At GC somas, the cluster density was significantly lower (soma: 7% ± 1.3%; GCL dendrites: 32.2% ± 6.7%; EPL dendrites: 31.1% ± 6.5%; 43% ± 3.7% ANOVA, <italic>F</italic> = 9.101, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). This distribution pattern predicts a dominant function of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in the dendrites and particularly within gemmules of GCs. While Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 has been described as an axonal subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref032">32</xref>], this expression pattern is remarkable for axonless GCs, suggesting that the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 α-subunit might trigger synchronous GABA release from GC spine heads.</p>

<title>Knockdown of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunit abolishes action potential firing in GCs</title>
<p>To abolish Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> currents in GCs, we designed shRNA molecules to specifically target SCN2A (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Four different shRNAs bicistronically expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were cloned in rAAV2/1 vectors and stereotaxically delivered to the GCL. Upon 5 weeks of expression, OB acute slices were prepared to assess Na<sup>+</sup> currents in eGFP-positive GCs expressing the respective shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). shRNA#14 showed the most potent reduction of the Na<sup>+</sup> current in GCs (90% ± 3%, <italic>n</italic> = 8) and was therefore chosen for all subsequent experiments. The specificity of shRNA#14 for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 was further examined in silico (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The Na<sup>+</sup> current was reliably reduced in comparison to control cells and cells infected with a mismatch shRNA (shRNAmm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), suggesting a specific knockdown of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 α-subunit in the mouse OB.</p>

<p>The observed reduction of the Na<sup>+</sup> current amplitude after knockdown abrogated action potential firing in GCs upon somatic current injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). GCs expressing shRNA#14 failed to fire action potentials, while control cells or cells expressing the shRNAmm fired a single action potential upon 3-ms current injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, left set of traces) or fired tonically upon longer current injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, right set of traces). These experiments demonstrate that a selective knockdown of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 α-subunit abolishes action potential firing in GCs.</p>
<p>To further corroborate shRNA-mediated Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown, we examined the morphology of transduced GCs and quantified Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 expression. The general morphological features of GCs were unchanged upon shRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), and we observed a reduction of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) upon viral transduction of the GCL with rAAVs carrying shRNA#14, in comparison to control infection (mGFP) and shRNAmm14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). For a quantitative comparison, we calculated fluorescence ratios relative to the mean fluorescence of the control (control: 1.00 ± 0.019, shRNAmm: 1.01 ± 0.02, shRNA#14: 0.44 ± 0.02, ANOVA, <italic>F</italic> = 265.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Materials and methods</xref>). While we observed no intensity ratio differences between the control and the shRNAmm (<italic>t</italic> = 0.42, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), the intensity ratio was strongly reduced when comparing shRNA#14 expression with control (<italic>t</italic> = 19.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and shRNAmm (<italic>t</italic> = 20.16; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In summary, we demonstrated the effectiveness of shRNA#14 in reducing Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 subtype expression in GCs, leading to a strong reduction of Na<sup>+</sup> currents and abrogating action potential firing in GCs.</p>
<p>Before analyzing the physiological and behavioral consequences of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown in GCs, we investigated the spread of rAAV1/2 infection for widespread expression of shRNA#14 within the OB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). We observed that virtually all green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells were confined to the GCL, indicating that the stereotaxic delivery of rAAV2/1 particles into the GCL spares the MCL, EPL, and glomerular layer (GL), as previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref016">16</xref>]. Furthermore, rAAV transduction did not spread beyond the OB, thereby constituting a highly local genetic perturbation, a prerequisite to causally link molecular function to odor discrimination behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s006">S6B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref016">16</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref038">38</xref>]. While this approach is not inherently GC specific, more than 99% of the cells expressing GFP were GCs as judged by the diameter of the soma and location of the dendrite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s006">S6C–S6E Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref040">40</xref>]. Expression of the shRNA#14 (kd) and the shRNAmm control were tracked by coexpression of eGFP and compared to eGFP expression alone (control). Additionally, to quantify the number of infected cells in the GCL, the neuronal marker NeuN was used to identify the nuclei of neurons populating the OB, while 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to label nuclei of all cell types in the OB sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s006">S6F Fig</xref>). The number of DAPI-positive nuclei did not vary among the conditions tested (control: 529.7 ± 22.07, <italic>n</italic> = 4; mm: 486.5 ± 34.40, <italic>n</italic> = 6; kd: 520.0 ± 30.82, <italic>n</italic> = 6; ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> = 0.58), indicating that neither cell death nor glial proliferation occurred (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s006">S6G Fig</xref>). This is consistent with the unaltered ratio of NeuN/DAPI cells in the GCL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s006">S6H Fig</xref>; control: 73.92% ± 2.25%; mm: 80.43% ± 2.20%; kd: 76.16% ± 3.84%; ANOVA, <italic>F</italic> = 1.33, <italic>p</italic> = 0.31). To assess the number of neurons infected in the GCL, we counted the nuclei that were positive for both NeuN and eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). The fraction of infected neurons was not significantly different (control: 47.57% ± 0.93%; mm: 54.92% ± 1.73%; kd: 55.45% ± 2.35%; ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> = 0.12), suggesting that each viral preparation transduced approximately 50% of the GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). While the GCL is dominated by GCs, other types of neurons are present as well, although at much lower numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref041">41</xref>]. Because viral infection might also transduce a small number of these neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s006">S6D and S6E Fig</xref>), we refer to mice infected with rAAVs carrying the shRNA#14 as Na<sub>V</sub>1.2<sup>ΔGCL</sup> mice and mice infected with rAAVs carrying the shRNAmm as mm<sup>ΔGCL</sup>. Herewith, we show that our acute genetic perturbation approach is effective in selectively infecting the GCL, leaving other OB cell layers unaffected.</p>

<title>Dendrodendritic inhibition of MCs requires VGSC activation in GCs</title>
<p>To test if a lack of action potential firing in GCs would affect dendrodendritic inhibition of MCs by GCs, we performed whole-cell current clamp recordings from MCs in acute OB slices at near physiological temperature (34 ± 1 °C). Somatic current injections in MCs reliably generated action potentials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2003816.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). In the control and shRNA conditions, similar amounts of current were required to trigger action potentials with indistinguishable properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2003816.t001">Table 1</xref>, ANOVA, <italic>F</italic> = 0.80, <italic>p</italic> = 0.45). The action potential was followed by a rapid and pronounced hyperpolarization that increased with the number and frequency of action potentials elicited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). To further define the nature of this hyperpolarization, we blocked dendrodendritic transmission with ionotropic glutamate receptor (6-cyano-7- nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione [CNQX] and 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid [APV]) or GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (gabazine) antagonists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In both cases, a remaining hyperpolarization of 8%–11% was observed that could be attributed to MC-intrinsic conductances such as the afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that our recording conditions give rise to a fast hyperpolarization that predominantly reflects the synchronous recurrent inhibitory postsynaptic potential (rIPSP).</p>

<p>In control (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and mm<sup>ΔGCL</sup> cells (<italic>n</italic> = 12), action potential firing produced hyperpolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>) with indistinguishable amplitudes (control: 6.35 ± 0.62 mV; mm<sup>ΔGCL</sup>: 5.816 ± 0.47 mV; <italic>t</italic> = 0.71, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2<sup>ΔGCL</sup> cells, the hyperpolarization amplitudes were strongly decreased (2.87 ± 0.46 mV [<italic>n</italic> = 13]; control versus Na<sub>V</sub>1.2<sup>ΔGCL</sup> <italic>t</italic> = 4.73, mm<sup>ΔGCL</sup> versus Na<sub>V</sub>1.2<sup>ΔGCL</sup> <italic>t</italic> = 4.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 in both conditions).

Hence, given that 90% of the measured hyperpolarization is contributed by the rIPSP (see above), knockdown of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in GCs highly significantly reduces dendrodendritic inhibition. While the action of ionotropic glutamate receptor blockers and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors appears stronger than the effect of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), this is expected because Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 is only knocked down in approximately 55% of the GCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Discussion</xref>).</p>

As described above, in control cells, the hyperpolarization amplitude increased with the number of action potentials triggered in the MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>), suggesting that brief bursts of action potentials facilitated GABA release from GCs. Upon Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 α-subunit knockdown in the GCL, the frequency-dependent facilitation of the hyperpolarization amplitude was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Furthermore, action potentials in MCs remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2003816.t001">Table 1</xref>), supporting the notion that rAAV infection is restricted to the GCL.

Subsequently, the test odorants amyl acetate and ethyl butyrate (amyl acetate versus ethyl butyrate [AAvEB]) and their binary 6:4 mixtures (6v4/4v6) were tested.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show that GCs express clusters of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunits on their dendritic surface including spine heads. These VGSCs are required for synchronous GABA release, MC inhibition, and rapid odor discrimination. On a more general perspective, our results suggest that dendritic neurotransmitter release operates mechanisms of fast and synchronous release known for axon terminals.</p>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Dendritic VGSCs</title>
<p>Our expression analysis shows that GCs exclusively express the sodium channel α-subunit Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, a subunit predominantly expressed in axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref032">32</xref>]. At first glance, it may sound surprising that an axonless neuron expresses an axonal VGSC subunit in its dendrites. However, given that GCs use dendritic spines both to receive synaptic input and to generate output, the presence of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunit may imply that neurotransmitter release from spines utilizes the same mechanisms established in axon terminals. Another VGSC subunit, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, has been found in proximal and distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref031">31</xref>] supporting a role in mediating backpropagating action potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref045">45</xref>]. Lorincz and colleagues found Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 only within axons and presynaptic terminals but not in the dendritic domain. Hence, while dendritic expression of certain VGSC subunits appears to be a general phenomenon, we postulate that Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 occurs only in dendrites capable of neurotransmitter release.</p>

<title>Functional predictions derived from the clustered expression pattern of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in GCs</title>
<p>Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 is expressed in small clusters over the entire extent of a GC, including the heads of GC spines (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Cluster formation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 may be required to achieve a sufficiently large local current density for sodium channel activation and action potential initiation, similar to the situation found at nodes of Ranvier or the axon initial segment. VGSC clusters in the dendritic shaft may propagate the action potential along the dendritic tree of the GC, thereby generating a global action potential. Clusters situated in the GC spines may mediate a locally restricted action potential, as discussed in a separate section below.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Mechanisms of GABA release from GC spines</title>
<p>We suggest that under physiological conditions, the glutamatergic EPSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>) leads to a local depolarization that reaches the threshold of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), which then drives the initiation of an action potential in the spine. Subsequently, activated VDCCs, presumed to be localized in the GABAergic active zone, produce a nanodomain with high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration during the repolarization phase of the action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), when the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is high, similar to the mechanisms known to exist in axon terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref046">46</xref>]. In GC spines, this mechanism allows for fast and synchronous release of GABA and temporally well-resolved inhibition of MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) MCs receive inputs from the ORNs, activating the recurrent inhibitory network. (B) Action potential propagation in the MC lateral dendrite leads to glutamate release from MCs and consequent activation of AMPAR and NMDAR in GC spines, leading to sodium and calcium influx, respectively. (C) The depolarization of the GC spine activates the VGSC Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 subtype, which leads to an all-or-none event, as known for release in axon terminals. (D) Activation of the VGSCs activates VDCCs that in turn generate a Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomain during the repolarization phase of the action potential, when the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is particularly large. Finally, the nanodomain of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (not shown for simplicity) triggers GABA release in a fast and synchronous fashion.

<p>Knockdown of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in GCs activity-dependently reduced the hyperpolarization amplitude in MCs by 60%–75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Considering that 10% of the control hyperpolarization is mediated by the afterhyperpolarization or other intrinsic MC conductances such as I<sub>h</sub>, an rIPSP component of approximately 15%–30% remained (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). However, if GABA release depends on a local all-or-none spine action potential, expression of the shRNA should result in a complete block of the rIPSP. This apparent discrepancy may be due to the incomplete transduction of GCs connected to the stimulated MC with rAAVs expressing shRNA and the incomplete knockdown of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Thus, a mixed population of unperturbed GCs and GCs with Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown defines the strength of recurrent inhibition found in MC recordings presented here. Alternatively, after Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown, T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may contribute to GABA release from GC spines and thereby generate some of the remaining MC hyperpolarization. The contribution of VGSC α-subunits other than Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 appears unlikely, given that none of these could be detected in GCs by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Hence, the strong reduction of the rIPSP amplitude indicates that an all-or-none action potential is required for fast and synchronous GABA release from GC spines.</p>
<p>While we demonstrated a clustered distribution of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 within GCs, with higher densities in the spine heads and dendrites compared to the soma, the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown is likely to affect clusters in all locations of the GC. Hence, despite the highest density of clusters occurring in the spine heads, it remains difficult to know at which site action potentials get initiated: spine head or dendrite. Assuming the former raises the question whether this action potential remains a local event or propagates into the GC dendrite, thereby causing a global GC action potential. Recent work suggested that the high impedance of GC spine necks may insulate GC spines to function as “mini-neurons” or single processing units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref047">47</xref>]. Such isolated autonomous compartments would mainly support local recurrent MC inhibition and may employ local plasticity mechanisms but would not allow dendritic integration of multiple glutamatergic inputs from different MCs. Yet the spine neck has little effect on EPSP propagation in the forward direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref048">48</xref>]. Such an impedance mismatch circuit allows coincidence detection within the dendrite and, in combination with dendritic inhibition, controls action potential generation in the dendritic tree. Hence, the design of the GC dendrite provides a solution to both ensure efficient local neurotransmitter release, plasticity, and dendritic computations of multiple synchronously active MC inputs.</p>

<title>Role of NMDARs at the dendrodendritic synapse?</title>
<p>This Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-dependent model of reciprocal synaptic communication seemingly contradicts previous work claiming that dendrodendritic GABA release is governed by NMDAR-mediated currents that activate P/Q-type VDCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref028">28</xref>] or that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry by NMDARs suffices to drive GABA release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref019">19</xref>], such that VGSCs are not required for GABA release at the dendrodendritic synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref017">17</xref>]. These studies used Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free solutions containing TTX combined with very long MC current injections. Such unphysiological conditions will yield an unnaturally strong release of glutamate from MC dendrites, followed by a sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow through NMDARs into the GC spine heads that will suffice to trigger slow, asynchronous GABA release. In contrast, synchronous GABA release physiologically triggered by MC action potentials occurs on the time scale of a few milliseconds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Thus, a comparison of the studies mentioned above with our results needs to consider that two different modes of transmitter release are affected—asynchronous and synchronous release, respectively—each operating on different release sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Electron microscopy has revealed a segregated organization of the postsynaptic density and the active zone harboring GABA-filled synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref013">13</xref>], suggesting that NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is not spatially coupled to the release machinery. However, maximal release rates only occur at high local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref051">51</xref>] requiring a close spatial relationship (a few nm) between the VDCCs and the release machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref026">26</xref>]. Thus, synaptic NMDAR activation will not suffice to generate a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient sufficient to release GABA from GC spines, but the unphysiological conditions described above may result in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> domain reaching from the glutamatergic postsynaptic density to the GABAergic active zone, where it could trigger the release of GABA. Consistent with nanodomains mediating GABA release, EGTA perfused into GCs did not affect dendrodendritic inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>An MC action potential triggers recurrent inhibition with a delay of a few milliseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4</xref>). NMDARs activate rather slowly, half-maximal currents are reached after approximately 3 ms, and the peak current is reached after approximately 10 ms. Therefore, NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref052">52</xref>] inflow into the GC will only occur after the peak of the MC recurrent hyperpolarization is already declining, consistent with our notion that synchronous GABA release from GCs cannot be mediated by NMDARs under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>What then are NMDARs needed for at the dendrodendritic synapse? Our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref016">16</xref>] has shown that deletion of NMDARs in GCs slows the EPSP time course, reduces MC inhibition, and slows odor discrimination time, albeit to a much smaller extent than reported here for deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. These results suggest that NMDARs are not essential for synchronous GABA release from GC spines under physiological conditions. Alternatively, NMDARs may enhance the local depolarization after AMPAR-mediated relief of Mg<sup>2+</sup> block and may contribute a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that could modulate the release machinery via high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors or exert actions via other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal could also be detected by high-affinity release sensors and directly translated into long-lasting asynchronous release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref049">49</xref>], consistent with the slow time course of the IPSC reported by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref019">19</xref>]. Due to the long-lasting activation (hundreds of ms) of NMDARs caused by a single synaptic glutamate transient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref053">53</xref>], repetitive glutamatergic input may recruit these mechanisms even more strongly and may transiently increase GABA release (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Alternatively, NMDARs may establish synaptic plasticity mechanisms and contribute to local signals that do not reach VGSCs’ activation threshold.</p>

<title>GC spiking and modes of MC inhibition</title>
<p>GCs have been shown to fire action potentials in response to odorants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref055">55</xref>]. Moreover, awake behaving animals show much stronger GC activity with low temporal structure compared to anesthetized animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref057">57</xref>], implying that GCs modulate MC activity through extended lateral interactions independent of the respiratory cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref055">55</xref>]. These observations contradict the claim of the GC spine being a “mini-neuron” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref047">47</xref>], for which consequently the GC would appear rather silent, with dendritic spines working independently. We propose that EPSPs generated in several spines within close spatial proximity may depolarize the dendrites to firing threshold, causing the GC to fire a global action potential. In this context, T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may play an important role in amplifying small glutamate receptor–mediated depolarizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref021">21</xref>] in gemmules and thereby generate a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the neighboring compartments of the dendritic tree. Our model of GC function allows establishing rapid and synchronous local recurrent inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref058">58</xref>] in parallel to global dendritic computations, resulting in lateral inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref022">22</xref>]. Yet these events cannot occur segregated or in a gradual fashion, as previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref059">59</xref>], because once the depolarization reaches action potential threshold at the dendrite, a global action potential will be elicited. GC inhibition can shunt action potential propagation and consequently isolate dendritic compartments to compute stimuli from different sources. Indeed, GC dendrites can respond differently to odors than the soma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref057">57</xref>] because of GC inhibitory mechanisms that might play a pivotal role to compartmentalize GC responses to a given stimulus. At the spine level, A-type voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref020">20</xref>]) will dampen the developing interspike depolarization to temporally space successive action potentials more widely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref060">60</xref>]. The A-type current may lead to the low spiking rate observed in GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref062">62</xref>]. Altogether, we suggest that GCs use VGSCs to drive GABA release in a fast and synchronous manner at the GC spine and that generation of dendritic spikes at multiple dendritic domains allows for coincidence detection and dendritic integration.</p>

<title>GCs’ specificity of viral transduction</title>
<p>The viral approach used in this study is not inherently selective for GCs. The parameters of stereotaxic injection can effectively limit viral spread and transduction to the GCL of the OB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref038">38</xref>]. However, in addition to GCs, the GCL also contains deep short axon (dSA) cells, a heterogeneous population of cells classified based on their soma size, location, and morphology (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref039">39</xref>]). More than 99% of the cells analyzed in our study had dendrites of typical morphology reaching into the EPL and soma sizes of less than 10 μm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).

This would in turn increase MC inhibition (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref038">38</xref>]). However, we found the opposite, indicating that dSA cells were not perturbed in a physiologically relevant manner.</p>

<title>Rapid odor discrimination requires VGSC expression in GCs</title>
<p>GCL-specific deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels resulted in a stimulus-dependent slowing of the time needed for highly accurate odor discrimination, not interfering with odor discrimination learning and accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These results recapitulate our previous observations after GCL-specific deletion of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluN1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref016">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 deletion had a much stronger effect on the rIPSP amplitude, indicating that AMPARs remaining in the absence of NMDARs are sufficient to maintain dendrodendritic inhibition at a level stronger than after Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown. Interestingly, both GluN1 deletion and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown resulted in a stimulus-dependent phenotype: only discrimination of highly similar binary mixtures, but not of dissimilar stimuli, was affected. In conclusion, under physiological conditions, Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 activation is crucial for inhibitory interactions of GCs and MCs, underlying an important molecular mechanism for the OB to enhance discrimination of highly similar activity patterns.</p>
<p>What is the mechanistic link between altered MC inhibition and odor discrimination behavior? This and our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref038">38</xref>] suggest a correlation between the strength of dendrodendritic inhibition and discrimination time: stronger inhibition will accelerate odor discrimination and vice versa. On the cellular level, the simplest mechanism causing a shift in discrimination time could be the time required to build up a hypothetical level of recurrent MC inhibition sufficient to discriminate similar stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref016">16</xref>]. However, understanding how network connectivity, neuronal ensemble formation, decision-making, and coupling of olfactory and motor areas give rise to odor discrimination behavior remains a challenge to be addressed.</p>

<title>Knockdown of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 strongly reduces Na<sup>+</sup>-currents in GCs.</title>
<p>(A) shRNAs were designed using the InvivoGen Wizard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sirnawizard.com/" xlink:type="simple">www.sirnawizard.com</ext-link>). Four suitable target sequences were identified on the SCN2A mRNA. rAAV1/2 vectors mediating shRNA expression driven by the U6 promotor and GFP expression from the CBA promoter. rAAV was injected into the OB (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Materials and methods</xref>). (B-E) Voltage-clamp recordings were established from transduced and control GCs in 300-μm-thick OB slices at 34 ± 1 °C. Series of voltage square pulses ranging from −70 mV to +10 mV per step, with 5-ms duration, were applied to assess the amplitude of Na<sup>+</sup> currents in each pulse tested. Four shRNA molecules were tested (B-E), and each affected the Na<sup>+</sup> current differently. (B) The shRNA#5 targeted nucleotides 291–312 and reduced the Na<sup>+</sup> current by approximately 60% compared to control. (C) The shRNA#14 targeted nucleotides 2085–2106 and reduced the Na<sup>+</sup> current by approximately 90% relative to control. (D) The shRNA#22 targeted nucleotides 3211–3232 and reduced the Na<sup>+</sup> current by approximately 75% relative to control. (E) The shRNA#44 targeted nucleotides 5180–5201 and reduced the Na<sup>+</sup> current by approximately 45% compared to control.

<title>In silico simulation of the specificity of the shRNA#14 to target specifically the SCN2a gene in mice.</title>
<p>(A) Amino acid sequence similarity among the Na<sub>v</sub>1.x subtypes. Sequences were aligned in the CLC sequence viewer software, using the UPGMA algorithm. The color code depicts the most prominent expression location as indicated in the color legend. The resistance of each subtype to TTX is indicated gray. (B) Phylogenetic relationship of the mouse VGSCs α-subunits. The published nucleotide sequences in PubMed Central were aligned using the neighbor-joining algorithm, with a gap open cost of 7, gap extension cost of 3, and gap end was free. Bootstrapping analysis was performed, and the values shown in the ramification branches of the tree represent the number of replications. The tree was rooted using a VGSC expressed in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (not shown). The scale bar represents 100 nucleotide substitutions. The tree was generated using the CLC sequence viewer software. (C) Coding sequence similarities among the most similar Na<sub>V</sub>1.x brain subtypes with the gray line delineating the target region of shRNA#14. The sequence similarity is 62% among Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub> 1.3 and 76% between Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub> 1.2. (D) The shRNA#14 is highly specific for SCN2a. BLAST of the 21-nucleotide sense sequence of shRNA#14 against the sequences of the VGSCs brain subunits demonstrates that this molecule has very low probabilities to knock down SCN1a, SCN3a, and SCN8a (E value &gt; 0.1) at any location within the coding region of the VGSCs subunits (left side of the panels). The shRNA#14 shows a region in the SCN2a gene with 100% similarity (red arrow), so that the E value is very low for this region (2e<sup>-8</sup>), indicating high probability of knockdown of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 subunit. shRNA, short hairpin RNA; TTX, tetrodotoxin; UPGMA, unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean; VGSC, voltage-gated sodium channel.</p>

<title>GCL-restricted expression in a large fraction of GCs reveals GC specificity of acute targeted genetic perturbations within the OB.</title>
<p>(A) rAAV1/2 particles were delivered into the GCL of the OB, and spread of infection was assessed by imaging eGFP, rAAV-mm#14//eGFP (mm), and rAAV-shRNA#14//eGFP (kd). All images were acquired with a wide-field fluorescence microscope. DAPI staining identifies OB layers (top-down: GCL, MCL, EPL, GL). (B) Low-resolution wide-field epifluorescence image of a typical injection directed to the GCL of the OB with GFP expression in the GC domain of the OB (somas located in the GCL, dendrites that transverse the GCL toward the EPL and dendritic arborizations very prominent in the EPL). No fluorescence is observed in cortical and subcortical regions. (C) Maximal projection of a confocal image stack showing GFP expression in the GCL (10–15 consecutive stacks; <italic>n</italic> = 3 preparations from one mouse each); 3 fields of 200 μm × 800 μm per preparation were chosen randomly to determine the dimensions of GFP-expressing cells. (D) Histogram showing the distribution of the soma diameters of GFP-expressing cells in the GCL. A total of 510 cells were analyzed. According to Nagayama and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref039">39</xref>], GCs are the only cells that extend their dendrites into the EPL, as was the case for all GCs analyzed. Furthermore, GCs have much smaller somas (6–8 μm) than dSA cells (10–20 μm). (E) Cumulative distribution of the data shown in C; 99% of the infected cells have a soma diameter of less than 10 μm and hence can be classified as GCs. (F) Representative confocal image stacks (MIP of 10 image frames) of OB horizontal sections of mice stereotaxically injected with rAAV-eGFP (“control,” <italic>n</italic> = 4 mice), rAAV-mmshRNA#14 (“mm,” <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice), or rAAV-shRNA#14 (“kd,” <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice). DAPI-stained nuclei (blue), anti-NeuN antibody labels neuronal nuclei (magenta), and GFP reveals transduced GCs (green). (G-H) Nuclei were counted in OB horizontal sections for each labeling condition. From each OB analyzed, 5 stacks of 10 image frames each were taken from random regions of the GCL. (C) Total number of nuclei: control: 529.7 ± 22.07, mm: 486.5 ± 34.40, kd: 520.0 ± 30.82; ANOVA, <italic>F</italic> = 0.59, <italic>p</italic> = 0.58.

<p>(A) Single action potentials (left) or 20 consecutive action potentials at 100 Hz (right) were evoked in MCs (<italic>n</italic> = 3) through somatic current injections.

<title>Relative contribution of synaptic and nonsynaptic mechanisms to MC hyperpolarization.</title>
<p>Quantitative comparison of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown and pharmacological blockade of dendrodendritic communication based on the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s007">S7 Fig</xref>. Glutamate receptor and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blockade reduced the hyperpolarization by 90%. Assuming a close to complete block of all glutamate receptors and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors of the dendrodendritic synapse, the remaining 10% of the hyperpolarization could be attributed to a nonsynaptic mechanism such as the AHP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003816.ref058">58</xref>]. Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown reduced the hyperpolarization amplitude by 60%–75%. The less pronounced block caused by the genetic manipulation can be explained by the incomplete transduction of the GC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4</xref>). MCs receive gemmules of GCs from a mixed population: GCs with a reduced number of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and unperturbed GCs with a normal complement of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. As we have demonstrated above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003816.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), our genetic perturbation does not affect MCs and hence cannot be attributed to any MC-intrinsic mechanisms. Furthermore, phrixotoxin-3 did not have an effect on voltage-gated conductances in MCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003816.s003">S3D–S3F Fig</xref>), indicating that even Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown in MCs would not affect action potential firing. Taken together, the hyperpolarization determined after Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockdown includes nonsynaptic components such as the AHP or I<sub>H</sub> but mostly reflects the rIPSP. Subtracting these approximately 10% nonsynaptic contributions from control and knockdown conditions would yield a reduction of the rIPSP by approximately 70%–80%. (A) Single MC action potential. ANOVA, <italic>F</italic> = 17.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001. *** denotes highly significant difference relative to control and mm.
