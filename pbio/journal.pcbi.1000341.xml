                <p>DNA–protein interactions are involved in many essential biological
                    activities. Because there is no simple mapping code between DNA base pairs and
                    protein amino acids, the prediction of DNA–protein interactions is a
                    challenging problem. Here, we present a novel computational approach for
                    predicting DNA-binding protein residues and DNA–protein interaction
                    modes without knowing its specific DNA target sequence. Given the structure of a
                    DNA-binding protein, the method first generates an ensemble of complex
                    structures obtained by rigid-body docking with a nonspecific canonical B-DNA.
                    Representative models are subsequently selected through clustering and ranking
                    by their DNA–protein interfacial energy. Analysis of these encounter
                    complex models suggests that the recognition sites for specific DNA binding are
                    usually favorable interaction sites for the nonspecific DNA probe and that
                    nonspecific DNA–protein interaction modes exhibit some similarity to
                    specific DNA–protein binding modes. Although the method requires as
                    input the knowledge that the protein binds DNA, in benchmark tests, it achieves
                    better performance in identifying DNA-binding sites than three previously
                    established methods, which are based on sophisticated machine-learning
                    techniques. We further apply our method to protein structures predicted through
                    modeling and demonstrate that our method performs satisfactorily on protein
                    models whose root-mean-square Cα deviation from native is up to 5
                    Å from their native structures. This study provides valuable
                    structural insights into how a specific DNA-binding protein interacts with a
                    nonspecific DNA sequence. The similarity between the specific
                    DNA–protein interaction mode and nonspecific interaction modes may
                    reflect an important sampling step in search of its specific DNA targets by a
                    DNA-binding protein.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Many essential biological activities require interactions between DNA and
                    proteins. These proteins usually use certain amino acids, called DNA-binding
                    sites, to recognize their specific DNA targets. To facilitate the search of its
                    specific DNA targets, a DNA-binding protein often associates with nonspecific
                    DNA and then diffuses along the DNA. Due to the weak interactions between
                    nonspecific DNA and the protein, structural characterization of nonspecific
                    DNA–protein complexes is experimentally challenging. This paper
                    describes a computational modeling study on nonspecific DNA–protein
                    complexes and comparative analysis with respect to specific
                    DNA–protein complexes. The study found that the specific DNA-binding
                    sites on a protein are typically favorable for nonspecific DNA and that
                    nonspecific and specific DNA–protein interaction modes are quite
                    similar. This similarity may reflect an important sampling step in the search
                    for the specific DNA target sequence by a DNA-binding protein. On the basis of
                    these observations, a novel method was proposed for predicting DNA-binding sites
                    and binding modes of a DNA-binding protein without knowing its specific DNA
                    target sequence. Ultimately, the combination of this method and protein
                    structure prediction may lead the way to high throughput modeling of
                    DNA–protein interactions.</p>

            <p>DNA-binding proteins play an essential role in many fundamental biological
                activities, including DNA transcription, replication, packaging, repair and
                rearrangement. Interactions relevant to these activities typically involve specific
                binding sites on both proteins and DNA. Over the past several decades, many efforts
                have been made in order to understand basic principles that determine the specific
                DNA-protein interactions. It is well-known that there does not exist a simple
                recognition code between protein amino acids and DNA base pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Luscombe1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Sarai1">[4]</xref>. This poses a great
                challenge for the prediction of DNA-protein interactions.</p>
            <p>The daunting task of elucidating DNA-protein interactions can be addressed with the
                assistance of computational modeling. Methods for docking the complex from separated
                protein/DNA structures have been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Aloy1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-vanDijk1">[7]</xref>. As an
                early example, the Monte Carlo program MONTY has been applied to sample
                configurations of a single DNA-protein complex in the vicinity of its native state
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Knegtel1">[6]</xref>.
                The development of an efficient geometric recognition algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-KatchalskiKatzir1">[8]</xref>, which allows a global search for optimal surface
                complementarity though rigid body rotation and translation, greatly advanced the
                molecular docking field. An implementation of the algorithm, FTDOCK, was applied to
                DNA-protein docking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Aloy1">[5]</xref>, with encouraging benchmark results reported on
                modeling eight DNA/repressor complexes starting from unbound protein structures and
                canonical B-DNA. A more recent approach, HADDOCK, starts with a similar rigid body
                docking procedure, followed by semi-flexible refinement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-vanDijk1">[7]</xref>. Excellent docking
                models were obtained for three examples by HADDOCK.</p>
            <p>The docking methods assume the availability of both protein and DNA structures. Given
                only the structure of a DNA-binding protein, it is of interest to determine the
                DNA-binding protein residues without the knowledge of the associated specific DNA
                sequence and structure with which the protein interacts. In the last few years,
                several methods have been developed to address this problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Ahmad1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Yan1">[15]</xref>. Most
                focus on analyzing characteristic patterns of DNA-binding residues from the solved
                structures of complexes. Standard machine-learning techniques, such as Support
                Vector Machine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Bhardwaj1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Kuznetsov1">[13]</xref> and neural networks
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Ahmad1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Tjong1">[14]</xref>, have been adopted to differentiate DNA-binding
                residues from non-DNA-binding residues, using features like sequence composition,
                evolutionary profile, solvent accessibility, and electrostatic potential. Recently,
                a knowledge-based method DBD-Hunter that combines structural comparison and
                evaluation of a statistical pair potential was proposed for predicting DNA-binding
                proteins and associated binding residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Gao1">[11]</xref>. The method yields an
                accuracy of 87% on DNA-binding site prediction in comprehensive
                benchmarks. However, the method is limited by the availability of appropriate
                DNA-protein complex structures to be used as templates.</p>
            <p>In this study, we present a novel approach for predicting the protein residues that
                bind DNA and DNA-protein interaction modes, given the structure of a DNA-binding
                protein as the input. We systematically docked 44 specific DNA-binding proteins in
                both holo (DNA-bound) and apo (DNA-free) forms to a nonspecific canonical B-DNA
                molecule. Using energy evaluation and model clustering, we obtained representative
                complex models that provide structural insights into how DNA-binding proteins
                interact with a nonspecific DNA sequence. For about 80% of the proteins,
                the sites for specific DNA recognition are among the favorable interaction sites for
                nonspecific DNA binding. Furthermore, the interaction modes observed in the top
                ranked, nonspecific DNA-protein encounter complexes bear a certain similarity to the
                specific DNA-protein binding mode in the experimental structure. The biological
                implications of this similarity are discussed. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
                approach achieves better performance than three established methods based on
                machine-learning techniques. In addition to experimental structures, we show that
                our method can be applied to predicted protein models, generated by the
                state-of-the-art modeling program TASSER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. Satisfactory results
                were obtained for protein models with a root-mean square deviation, RMSD, ≤5
                Å of their Cα atoms from their native holo-structures. We also
                show that our method can be further improved by considering conformational changes
                of DNA.</p>

                    dA·dT base pairs, following the modeling procedure illustrated in
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. For each
                    structure, we keep the top 2500 docking complex models ranked by their
                    DNA-protein interfacial energy. We first compare DNA-interacting protein
                    residues observed in top ranked encounter complexes with those observed in the
                    native (experimental) complex structures. For this purpose, the Matthews
                    Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is used to quantify the similarity between
                    interaction sites for specific and nonspecific DNA on the protein's
                    surface. A complex model is considered near-native if the associated MCC is
                    higher than 0.5, which is the mid-point between perfect overlap
                    (MCC = 1.0) and a random model
                    (MCC = 0.0). As a representative example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref> show the

                            that specific-DNA recognition sites on a DNA-binding protein are
                            energetically favorable interaction sites for nonspecific DNA. A
                            nonspecific DNA (cyan) composed of 16 dA·dT base pairs was
                            docked to the protein structure (green), which is complexed with a

                <p>Analysis of docking solutions suggests that specific DNA-binding sites on
                    proteins are typically among the energetically favorable sites for sampling the
                    nonspecific DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g002">Figure
                        2</xref>, the MCC between specific and nonspecific DNA-binding sites is
                    anti-correlated with the DNA-protein interfacial energy. A representative
                    example is provided for the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1, which has a Pearson
                    Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of −0.46 between MCC and the interfacial
                    energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). On
                    average, the PCCs are −0.40/−0.43 for the APO/HOLO sets,
                    respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).
                    Although the correlation is not very strong, the analysis does indicate that the
                    specific DNA-binding sites on the protein are more likely involved in forming
                    encounter complexes with a nonspecific DNA, as compared to the other regions of
                    the protein. These nonspecific encounter complexes provide a structural basis
                    for understanding the process known as facilitated diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Halford1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-vonHippel1">[18]</xref>, during which a

                    target sequence (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). For the purpose of sampling DNA sequence, the
                    DNA-binding sites on the protein surface are energetically favorable to both
                    specific and nonspecific DNA, resulting in the observed overlap between these

                    such restraint, we obtained significantly better top one models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The mean MCC values

                    residue contacts. Then, the native DNA-protein contacts observed in the model
                    were counted, and the RMSD of native interfacial residues relative to their
                    positions in the model was calculated by optimally superposing these interfacial
                    residues. For each protein, the best result of top five clustering models is
                    shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. In these
                    models, the optimal alignment typically covers 85% of the length of
                    the shorter DNA, and more than 95% of the native interfacial
                    residues. On average, the fractions of native contacts (denoted as Fnat)
                    observed in the model are 33%/41% for the APO/HOLO sets,
                    respectively, and the corresponding DNA-protein interfacial RMSDs (denoted as
                        RMSD<sub>int</sub>) are 4.6/3.4 Å. The results indicate some
                    resemblance between nonspecific DNA-protein interaction modes and the
                    specific-DNA-protein binding mode, though consistent specific base recognition
                    cannot be expected due to the different DNA sequence employed and the possible
                    conformational changes involved. About 70% of contacts involving
                    specific base recognition in the specific complex are either lost or converted
                    to backbone contacts in the corresponding nonspecific contacts.</p>

                    DNA-protein interface exhibits a unique binding mode involving mainly loop
                    residues. The top energy-ranked model correlates well with the native structure,

                    energy-ranked model obtained with the unbound structure, residues involving
                    DNA-protein interactions include about half of the protein residues contacting
                    the cognate sequence in the experimental structure, yielding a moderate MCC of
                    0.51. The result is expected since the cognate DNA significantly deviates from
                    the canonical B-DNA form by a bending angle of ∼50°, as shown in
                    the native complex structure. As a result, the nonspecific DNA can only be
                    partially aligned to the cognate DNA. In fact, the interaction mode presented by
                    our model more closely resembles the binding mode of the non-cognate DNA-protein
                    complex structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g005">Figure

                    are predicted as DNA-binding according to our model. Note that EcoRV functions
                    as a homodimer, and only the monomer was employed for docking.</p>

                <p>Our approach was further validated on predicted protein models. First, the

                    structural templates identified, proteins were classified into two groups: 30
                    Easy targets, which typically have good quality templates, and 14 Hard targets,
                    which usually do not have a reliable template hit. Note that we excluded from
                    the template library any structure that shares&gt;30% global
                    sequence identity with a given target. The best template, ranked by the TM-score
                    structural similarity metric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Zhang2">[27]</xref>, has a mean RMSD of 7.9 Å with
                    respect to the native holo-structure over about 92% alignment
                    coverage, and the mean sequence identity of these templates is 19%.
                    After TASSER runs for model assembly and refinement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Zhang1">[16]</xref>, the mean RMSDs of
                    the top TASSER model and of the best of top five models were improved to 6.9
                    Å and 6.4 Å over the regions aligned with the templates.
                    Overall, the mean TM-scores of the top and the best of five top models compared
                    against the native holo structure are 0.61 and 0.63; the latter is
                    ∼9% higher than the average TM-score of the best threading
                    templates. Systematic model improvement over the best templates is evident, as
                    an improved structural model was obtained in 37 of 44 cases.</p>
                <p>For reach protein, the top TASSER model was employed for docking and subsequent

                    models yields an average MCC/accuracy of 0.51/84% for DNA-binding
                    site prediction. For the Easy/Hard sets, the best of top five models gives mean
                    MCC of 0.50/0.23, a RMSD<sub>int</sub> of 5.9/11.2 Å, and Fnat of

                    is expected due to poor protein model quality. Overall, the binding site and

                    dependent up to 10 Å. Since in previous studies, the potentials were
                    derived from relatively small data sets, we re-parameterized these three
                    potentials with the same set of 179 crystal complex structures used for our
                    functional-group level quasichemical potential derivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Gao1">[11]</xref>. Then, for each target

                <title>Comparison with Other DNA-Binding Site Prediction Methods</title>
                <p>Our approach was compared with three established methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Ahmad1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Kuznetsov1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Tjong1">[14]</xref> that
                    predict DNA-binding sites based on protein structures. Note that none of these
                    three methods is capable of predicting the DNA-protein interaction mode. For the
                    purpose of comparison, all calculations were carried out on the same set, AS62
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Ahmad1">[9]</xref>, composed of DNA-binding protein structures in
                    their holo-forms. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000341-t003">Table 3</xref>, the top model from our approach already yields better
                    results than previous methods on average. The mean MCC of our top model is 0.53,
                    compared to 0.49 obtained independently by the Kuznetsov group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Kuznetsov1">[13]</xref>
                    and by Tjong and Zhou's method named DISPLAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Tjong1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, the best
                    of our top five models significantly improves the DNA-binding site prediction
                    with a mean MCC of 0.62 and a mean accuracy of 87%, leading the
                    results from the Kuzentsov method or DISPLAR by about one standard deviation
                    unit. The latter two methods perform better than that proposed by Ahmad

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Ahmad1">[9]</xref>.
                    This reason can be partially attributed to the fact that the Ahmad <italic>et
                        al.</italic> did not use position-specific sequence profiles in their
                    method.</p>

                <p>We further compared the performance of our method on apo structures with DISPLAR.
                    The predictions of DNA-binding sites of 44 proteins structures from the APO set
                    were performed using the DISPLAR webserver. The averages of MCC/accuracy by
                    DISPLAR are 0.39/82.5%, which are slightly lower than
                    0.40/82.7% from the results by the first ranked model of our method.
                    The difference is statistically insignificant. However, the performance of the
                    best of the top five models by our method, 0.54/86.7%, is
                    significantly better than that of DISPLAR (Wilcoxon signed-rank test

                    of) models generated by our method can be filtered through incorporation of
                    existing experimental studies on binding-sites, thereby further improving the

                <title>Effects of Conformational Changes</title>
                <p>The difference between the predicted docking model and the native complex
                    structure may be explained by two main reasons: First, nonspecific instead of
                    specific DNA was used for docking. Second, rigid-body docking does not consider
                    the conformational changes of either the DNA or the protein. The effects of
                    conformational changes in protein are clear as holo-structures consistently
                    produce models closer to the native state than those using apo-structures. In
                    principle, by also taking DNA conformational changes into account, one should be
                    able to obtain improved models.</p>
                <p>The flexibility problem can be partially addressed through docking the protein to
                    a library of DNA in various conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-vanDijk1">[7]</xref>. To explore this
                    idea, we constructed a DNA library composed of three poly dA·dT B-DNA
                    structures, whose backbone RMSDs range from 1 to 3 Å with respect to
                    the canonical B-DNA used above, and the canonical B-DNA itself (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000341.s002">Table S2</xref>).
                    For convenience, we name the canonical B-DNA as D0, and the DNA library as Dlib.
                    Using Dlib, we obtained complex models generated by docking the protein to each
                    DNA in the library. For each of the four protein-DNA combinations, the same
                    docking procedure described above was followed, and the top five clustering
                    models were selected and pooled together. From this pool of twenty clustering
                    models we selected top five models according to their interfacial energy. As
                    shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g007">Figure 7</xref>, the mean
                    MCCs of DNA-binding residues predictions are improved from 0.54/0.62 (D0
                    docking) to 0.57/0.68 (Dlib docking) for the APO/HOLO sets, respectively.</p>

                <p>One can further estimate the upper limit of such improvement by docking holo
                    protein structures to nonspecific DNA that adopts the native specific-DNA
                    conformation, though in general one cannot assume that the nonspecific DNA
                    associates with the protein in exactly the same conformation as the specific
                    DNA. In this estimation, we took the native DNA structures from the 44 complex
                    structures and mutated all base pairs into dA·dT with the program
                    3DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Lu1">[31]</xref>.
                    We name this set of DNA structures Dnat. Each protein structure from the HOLO
                    set was then docked to the corresponding DNA structure in Dnat. The resulting
                    average MCC for binding site prediction from the best of top five clustering
                    models is 0.71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000341-g007">Figure 7</xref>),
                    which is slightly higher than 0.68 from docking holo protein forms to Dlib.
                    While we expect to see further improvement with fully flexible docking, it poses
                    a challenging problem in practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-vanDijk1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Havranek1">[32]</xref>.
                    So far, successful examples are limited to local refinement, which requires that
                    the initial rigid body models subjected to flexible refinement are sufficiently
                    close to their native conformation. A thorough study on flexible docking,
                    however, is beyond the scope of the current study.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>How a DNA-binding protein locates its specific DNA target sequence is a fundamental,
                unsolved problem in biology. It has been proposed that association with nonspecific
                DNA sequences and subsequent travel along the sequence facilitates the search for
                the specific DNA target sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Halford1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-vonHippel1">[18]</xref>. In this regard, it
                has been shown that specific DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors and
                restriction endonucleases, can locate target sites at rates several orders of
                magnitude faster than that estimated by random three-dimensional diffusion, through
                mechanisms known collectively as facilitated diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Halford1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-vonHippel1">[18]</xref>. A crucial step of
                the facilitated diffusion processes involves the association of the protein with a
                nonspecific DNA sequence; this is followed by one-dimensional sliding along the DNA
                or hopping over short distances to accelerate the search for a specific DNA target
                sequence. Despite recent advances that provide visualizations of protein sliding
                along DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Gorman1">[33]</xref>, the structural details of how a DNA-binding protein
                associates with a nonspecific DNA remain elusive, primarily due to weak interactions
                between nonspecific DNA and the protein. Indeed, due to the fact that the
                interactions are nonspecific, there exist only a few solved atomic structures for
                nonspecific DNA-protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Winkler1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Kalodimos1">[34]</xref>. Our study provides
                useful structural insights into how a specific DNA-binding protein interacts with a
                nonspecific DNA sequence during the facilitated diffusion process. The similarity
                between the specific DNA-protein interaction mode and nonspecific interaction modes
                may reflect an important sampling step in search of its specific DNA targets by a
                DNA-binding protein.</p>
            <p>By systematically studying encounter complexes of 44 specific DNA-binding proteins
                with a nonspecific DNA molecule, we found that the vast majority of these
                DNA-binding proteins favorably interact with nonspecific DNA at the same binding
                sites for their specific DNA targets. Using APO/HOLO-structures for docking and a
                pair potential for energy ranking, we obtained at least one near-native model among
                the top ten models for 77%/84% of APO/HOLO proteins. In these
                models, protein residues that contact the nonspecific DNA coincide with those that
                contact the specific DNA with a MCC&gt;0.5. By introducing a clustering
                procedure, the most native-like model among the top five cluster representatives has
                an average MCC of 0.54/0.62 when APO/HOLO structures are used. Moreover, the
                DNA-protein interaction modes observed in these models resemble the corresponding
                native binding modes with specific DNA. The average interfacial RMSD is 4.6/3.4
                Å, and the fraction of native contacts observed is
                33%/41% for APO/HOLO proteins, respectively.</p>
            <p>Our results therefore suggest that a DNA-binding protein frequently samples
                nonspecific DNA using the same binding sites as used for specific DNA recognition.
                The results are consistent with a recent Langevin dynamics study on the diffusion of
                three DNA-binding proteins along nonspecific DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Givaty1">[35]</xref>, and are also
                consistent with the few available atomic structures of DNA-binding proteins in
                complex with both specific and nonspecific DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Winkler1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Kalodimos1">[34]</xref>. One interesting
                example is the endonuclease EcoRV, which locates a specific cleavage site through a
                combination of 1D sliding along nonspecific sequence and 3D jumping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Bonnet1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Stanford1">[37]</xref>. The
                nonspecific DNA recognition observed in our top model and in a crystal structure of
                the nonspecific DNA-EcoRV complex involves the same set of protein residues which
                also participate in specific DNA recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Winkler1">[24]</xref>. However, the majority
                of native contacts formed in the cognate DNA-protein complex structure are lost in
                our model, largely due to the absence of the dramatic bending exhibited by the
                cognate DNA.</p>
            <p>The overlap of nonspecific and specific DNA interaction sites on the protein surface
                allows us to predict DNA-binding residues. The best of top five models generated
                with holo-structures have an average MCC of 0.62, which is 15% higher
                than the average MCC of 0.54 obtained with apo-structures. Despite the notable
                difference, the performance of our method is satisfactory for apo-structures. This
                validation on apo-structures has important practical applications. Going beyond the
                DNA-binding site prediction, our method also provides models for the DNA-protein
                interaction modes. For 86%/71% of HOLO/APO structures, at
                least one of the top five models exhibits an interaction mode somewhat similar to
                the native binding mode, with a mean RMSD<sub>int</sub> of 3.1/3.9 Å and a
                Fnat of 44%/37%. These complex models are acceptable using
                CAPRI criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Mendez1">[19]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The performance of our method in DNA-binding site prediction has been compared with
                three machine-learning based methods. We note that the top model by our method
                already performs better than the other methods in terms of MCC and overall accuracy.
                While machine learning based methods typically provide only one model for
                assessment, our method generates a limited number of representative models for
                selection. This can be a great advantage for practical application, since
                incorporation of existing experimental studies on binding-sites may greatly improve
                model selection. On average, the best of our top five models by our method achieves
                a MCC of 0.62 and accuracy of 87%, which is significantly better than the
                MCC of 0.49 and accuracy of 81% of DISPLAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Tjong1">[14]</xref>, the best among other
                methods. In addition, our method has the advantage of predicting the binding mode,
                an ability that the machine-learning methods lack. A downside of our method,
                however, is that it is computationally more demanding than machine-learning methods,
                typically requiring hours <italic>versus</italic> minutes of computation time for
                one target. Nevertheless, given the widespread availability of computational
                resources, this is not a significant limitation.</p>
            <p>Despite these successes, the method is not designed for predicting the specific DNA
                sequence recognized by a DNA-binding protein; this is a related, yet very
                challenging problem. Knowledge-based distance-dependent contact potentials at the
                residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Sarai1">[4]</xref>
                or the all-atom level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Donald1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Robertson1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Liu1">[38]</xref>, and
                physics-based all-atom potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Morozov1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Siggers1">[40]</xref>, have been applied to predict DNA specificity.
                While these studies have reported success on a few cases, they are limited to known
                atomic complex structures or models from closely related complex structures with
                almost identical DNA-binding interface. Nevertheless, they suggest that a successful
                approach must address structural flexibility and cooperativity among partners that
                form a DNA-protein complex.</p>
            <p>Another interesting question is whether one can use the current approach to determine
                DNA-binding function given a protein structure. To explore this issue, we applied
                the method to ∼3,000 non-DNA-binding proteins collected previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Gao1">[11]</xref>.
                Unfortunately, we were not able to derive a practical interfacial energy threshold
                to differentiate DNA-binding proteins from non-DNA-binding proteins, despite the
                notable difference of average interfacial energy. For DNA-binding function
                prediction, the knowledge based approach DBD-Hunter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Gao1">[11]</xref>, which requires that the
                structure of a target protein be related to that of a known DNA binding protein,
                seems more appropriate. Future efforts may involve expanding the template library
                for DBD-Hunter by adding complex structure models obtained from the current
                approach.</p>
            <p>In the post-genomic era, the rapid progress of structural genomics projects has
                greatly advanced our knowledge about structural biology. Each year thousands of new
                protein structures have been determined and deposited to the PDB. In principle, the
                accumulation of protein structures enables a practical solution to the folding
                problem through template based modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. Using the
                well-established modeling method, TASSER, we have obtained a top ranked protein
                model within 5 Å from their native structures for over half of the 44
                DNA-binding proteins. These models were constructed and refined from
                homologous/analogues templates with less than 30% sequence identity. We
                have demonstrated that one can satisfactorily predict DNA-binding sites using these
                good models. The average MCC and accuracy are 0.51 and 84% for the best
                of top five complex models. This is roughly comparable to the performance when
                experimentally solved apo-structures are used. Ultimately, the combination of
                modeling and DNA-protein docking may lead the way to the high throughput prediction
                of DNA-protein interactions.</p>

                    FFT-based rigid-body docking program FTDOCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Aloy1">[5]</xref>. A grid size of 0.7
                    Å, a rotation angle step of 12°, and surface thickness of 1.2

                    to reduce the redundancy of the models due to the helical symmetry of the DNA

                    sequence identity from the 179 complex set and repeat the analysis. The top 2500
                    energy-ranked models were retained for clustering, which uses the coordinates of
                    the COM of DNA-binding protein residues. The clustering procedure starts by
                    selecting the top energy-ranked model as a clustering seed. All models within a
                    COM distance of 6 Å from the seed are assigned to this cluster, and
                    removed from subsequent clustering. We then repeat this procedure until no model
                    is left. Finally, the clusters were ranked using the average energy of all
                    members in each cluster. From each cluster, we select the lowest energy model as
                    the representative model.</p>

                <p>A protein residue is assigned to be DNA-binding (or DNA-interacting) if at least
                    one heavy atom from the protein residue is within 4.5 Å of at least
                    one heavy atom from the DNA. Using this definition, about 18% of
                    protein residues can classified as true DNA-binding in the analysis of the HOLO
                    set. Given the imbalanced nature of the DNA-binding residues and non-DNA-binding
                    residues, the Matthews correlation coefficient is a suitable metric for
                    assessing overlap or prediction of DNA-binding residues between an encounter
                    complex and the native complex. The MCC is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000341-Matthews2">[42]</xref><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000341.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where TP, FP, TN, and FN are true positives, false positives,

                    at the residue level. The RMSD between two structures was calculated using the
                    coordinates of backbone Cα and/or DNA C1′ atoms. The
                    interfacial RMSD was calculated for interfacial protein/DNA residues observed in
