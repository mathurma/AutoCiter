<abstract>
<p>The mitochondrial ribosome, which translates all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded proteins, should be tightly regulated pre- and post-transcriptionally. Recently, we found RNA-DNA differences (RDDs) at human mitochondrial 16S (large) rRNA position 947 that were indicative of post-transcriptional modification. Here, we show that these 16S rRNA RDDs result from a 1-methyladenosine (m<sup>1</sup>A) modification introduced by TRMT61B, thus being the first vertebrate methyltransferase that modifies both tRNA and rRNAs. m<sup>1</sup>A947 is conserved in humans and all vertebrates having adenine at the corresponding mtDNA position (90% of vertebrates). However, this mtDNA base is a thymine in 10% of the vertebrates and a guanine in the 23S rRNA of 95% of bacteria, suggesting alternative evolutionary solutions. m<sup>1</sup>A, uridine, or guanine may stabilize the local structure of mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Experimental assessment of genome-edited <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> showed that unmodified adenine caused impaired protein synthesis and growth. Our findings revealed a conserved mechanism of rRNA modification that has been selected instead of DNA mutations to enable proper mitochondrial ribosome function.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>RNA modifications constitute an important layer of information, with functional implications that are not written in the underlying DNA sequence. Recently, we observed an apparent RNA-DNA difference (RDD) at position 947 of the human mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), but its nature and mechanism were unclear. Here we show that this disparity reflects an m<sup>1</sup>A modification (methylation at position 1 of the adenine moiety), and demonstrated by a combination of knock-down experiments in cells and in vitro methylation assays that the tRNA methyltransferase TRMT61B is the best candidate enzyme to introduce this modification. We also show that this modification is present in most of the 16S rRNA molecules in isolated mitochondrial ribosomes, and that it occurs in all vertebrates with an adenine (90% of the vertebrates), but not in those with a thymidine at this 16S rRNA position. Finally, as the first step towards understanding the functional importance of this rRNA modification, we used a genome-edited bacterial system to demonstrate that an unmodified adenine reduced the growth and translation rates of the bacteria as compared to both wild-type bacteria and mutant bacteria with a thymidine in the relevant position. Hence, three solutions were selected during evolution to allow proper function of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA—either RNA modification or two alternative ancient evolutionary DNA mutations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most RNAs are enzymatically modified after transcription. To date, more than 100 different species of chemical modifications have been identified in various RNA molecules from all domains of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref001">1</xref>]. Historically, analyses of RNA modifications have been limited to abundant RNA molecules such as tRNA, rRNA, or UsnRNA. Recently, transcriptome-wide analyses using deep-sequencing combined with biochemical approaches have facilitated the identification of several modified bases in mRNAs and non-coding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref005">5</xref>]. Additionally, transcriptomes were compared to their corresponding genomic sequences as a practical approach for the detection of RNA-DNA differences (RDDs) and identification of the canonical A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing sites in diverse eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref006">6</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests the presence of non-canonical RDD sites (i.e., edits other than A-to-I [G] or C-to-U) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref009">9</xref>]. However, their very existence and general importance has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref010">10</xref>], and neither the mechanisms generating non-canonical RDDs nor conclusive experimental evidence for their functional role have been described in vertebrates.</p>
<p>It was previously suggested that many non-canonical RDDs are not editing events per-se but rather reflect RNA modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref008">8</xref>]. RNA modifications, such as methylation of specific bases, occur in mitochondrial RNAs in many vertebrates and invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref014">14</xref>]. These modifications play crucial roles in mitochondrial activity, and their absence leads to pathological consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref015">15</xref>]. While RNA modifications in mitochondrial tRNAs of mammals were thoroughly mapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref016">16</xref>], the mitochondrial ribosomal (r)RNAs have been far less investigated.</p>
<p>By sequencing both the genome and corresponding transcriptome of the human mitochondria in lymphoblastoid cells, we recently identified three new RDD sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref008">8</xref>] that were also corroborated in a larger human sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref013">13</xref>]. The most prevalent RDD occurred at adenine 947 of human mitochondrial 16S rRNA (mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA] position 2617). Specifically, we showed that this position was a mixture of A, T, or G in RNA-seq reads, suggesting the presence of an unidentified modified base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, cryo-EM structures of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) have been solved at high resolution, sufficient to map residues of rRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref018">18</xref>]. A947 is located in helix 71 (H71) of 16S rRNA in close proximity to the inter-subunit bridge B3, suggesting that the modified base at this position may play a functional role in mitochondrial translation. In this study, we investigated the function of A947 and its RDD. We found that the non-canonical mitochondrial 16S rRNA RDDs resulted from a 1-methyladenosine (m<sup>1</sup>A) RNA modification and identified the candidate modifying enzyme. We demonstrate that the modification occurred in most vertebrates and is enriched in the mature mammalian mitoribosome. Finally, we used a bacterial model to directly link the nucleotide identity of 16S rRNA position 947 to cellular growth and protein translation. Indeed, mutations in the equivalent structural position of A947 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> imply functional importance for modifying this base during evolution.</p>

<title>Identification of Methyladenosine at Position 947 in Human Mitochondrial 16S rRNA</title>
<p>We previously hypothesized that the observed 16S rRNA RDDs in RNA-seq represent an RNA modification that was manifested as a mixture of reads with thymine, adenine, and lower occurrences of guanine. However, the nature of this putative modification and its underlying mechanism remained to be elucidated. Previous RNA-seq analysis of templates harboring a m<sup>1</sup>A modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref019">19</xref>] resulted in nucleotide distribution of sequencing reads similar to our observed reads in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA transcript at position 947 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>To elucidate the chemical identity of 16S rRNA position 947, we isolated 16S rRNA from HeLa cells and analyzed its modifications by capillary liquid chromatography and nano electrospray mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref022">22</xref>]. By assigning RNase T<sub>1</sub>-digested fragments of 16S rRNA, we observed known 2’-<italic>O</italic> methylations including Gm1145, Um1369 and Gm1370 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, we clearly detected the mono-methylated RNA fragment (positions 939–950, MW 3833.5) containing the RDD site at position 947 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Further probing of the RNA fragment by collision-induced dissociation revealed that the methylation occurs at the adenosine residue occupying position 947 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>TRMT61B Introduces 1-Methyladenosine at Position 947 of Human Mitochondrial 16S rRNA</title>
<p>It is known that two isozymes introduce the m<sup>1</sup>A modification in human mitochondrial tRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref016">16</xref>]. TRMT10C is a subunit of the mitochondrial RNase P complex that additionally acts as a methyltransferase generating m<sup>1</sup>A as well as m<sup>1</sup>G at position 9 in mitochondrial tRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref023">23</xref>]. TRMT61B, another methyltransferase, is responsible for m<sup>1</sup>A at position 58 in some mitochondrial tRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref024">24</xref>]. Notably, a recent Genome Wide Association Study revealed association between the levels of our observed 16S rRNA RDDs with SNPs in TRMT61B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref013">13</xref>]. We thus hypothesized that the RDD at 16S rRNA position 947 echoes an m<sup>1</sup>A modification, likely introduced by TRMT61B.</p>
<p>To examine whether TRMT61B or TRMT10C catalyzes the formation of methyladenosine at position 947 in 16S rRNA, we knocked down each of them by siRNAs in HeLa cells, followed by total RNA extraction to obtain templates for primer extension. In control experiments of mock or luciferase knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), the cDNA extended from the primer was strongly arrested at position 948, and partially extended to C942 by inserting dideoxy guanosine. This indicated that A947 is partially methylated. In addition, we also observed a clear band due to m<sup>1</sup>A58 in tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> from HeLa cells treated by luciferase siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Upon knockdown of TRMT61B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), nearly half of the cDNA extended past position 947 and stopped at position 942. This demonstrated that the methyladenosine at position 947 was m<sup>1</sup>A, introduced by TRMT61B. In contrast, knock down of TRMT10C did not lead to altered cDNA extension. As a positive control, hypomodification of m<sup>1</sup>A58 in tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> was observed when TRMT61B was repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). To confirm this observation by RDD, total RNAs from HeLa cells treated by siRNAs targeting for TRMT61B or luciferase as a control were subjected to RNA-seq analyses, followed by mapping to the mtDNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s001">S1 Data</xref>). Mixed nucleotide frequencies at position 947 observed in the cells treated with the control siRNA were dramatically altered and converged into adenosine in the cells treated with siTRMT61B, supporting the result from the primer extension experiment. Moreover, we observed a slight decrease in the read coverage around position 947. This observed pattern is in agreement with a recently published report describing the signature of m<sup>1</sup>A in RNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref025">25</xref>]. Notably, the observed levels of reads with either a T or a G decreased (as well as the reduction in coverage) in the RNA extracted from the siTRMT61B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Detection of hypomodified m<sup>1</sup>A947 in mitochondrial 16S rRNA from siRNA-treated HeLa cells. After knockdown of luciferase (si-Luc, control), TRMT61B, or TRMT10C mRNAs, primer extension was used to detect methylated or non-methylated A947. The cells were transfected twice with siRNA and harvested 4 days after the first transfection. The knockdown efficiencies of TRMT61B and TRMT10C mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR and normalized to ACTB mRNA. The steady-state levels of both mRNAs were decreased to 5.7% compared to the mock cells. The primers are shown as solid lines next to the rRNA or tRNA, and nascent cDNAs synthesized from the primers are depicted as gray lines.

Total RNAs from HeLa cells treated with siRNAs for TRMT61B (si-TRMT61B) were incubated with recombinant TRMT61B in the presence or absence of Ado-Met. m<sup>1</sup>A947 formation in mitochondrial 16S rRNA was detected by primer extension. Total RNAs of si-Luc and si-TRMT61B were used as controls for primer extension. (E) In vitro reconstitution of m<sup>1</sup>A947 with wild-type TRMT61B and its active-site D335A mutant.

<p>To demonstrate that TRMT61B is a methyltransferase directly responsible for m<sup>1</sup>A947 formation in mitochondrial 16S rRNA, we carried out an in vitro reconstitution of m<sup>1</sup>A using recombinant TRMT61B. Total RNA extracted from HeLa cells treated by siRNA targeting TRMT61B was incubated with recombinant TRMT61B in the presence of AdoMet. m<sup>1</sup>A947 formation was specifically detected by primer extension assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). In the presence of both recombinant TRMT61B and AdoMet, the cDNA band that extended up to position 942 decreased, and the cDNA band that arrested at position 948 clearly increased, indicating that m<sup>1</sup>A947 was reconstituted in vitro. In the negative control experiment, m<sup>1</sup>A947 was not introduced without AdoMet. Moreover, using in vitro transcription, we prepared a 114-nucleotide-long RNA segment (16S rRNA positions 866–979) and performed an in vitro methylation assay by TRMT61B. As a negative control, we prepared an active-site mutant of TRMT61B (D335A mutation), according to the biochemical study on TrmI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref026">26</xref>], a bacterial ortholog of TRMT61B. Then, we carried out an in vitro methylation assay of the 114-mer RNA segment with either the wild-type TRMT61B or the D335A mutant in the presence or absence of AdoMet, followed by RNase A digestion, and subjected them to capillary LC/nano-ESI-MS analysis. The results indicate that TRMT61B clearly introduced the m<sup>1</sup>A947 in the 114-mer RNA segment in the presence of AdoMet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Moreover, the methylated tetramer (AAm<sup>1</sup>AUp) produced by RNase A digestion was probed by CID, and its sequence was confirmed by assignment of the product ions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). As expected, the D335A TRMT61B mutant failed to introduce m<sup>1</sup>A947 in the segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that the RDD site at 16S rRNA position 947 is m<sup>1</sup>A introduced by mitochondrial methyltransferase TRMT61B.</p>

<title>m<sup>1</sup>A947 Likely Occurs in Mitochondrial 16S rRNA throughout Vertebrate Evolution</title>
<p>Our previous phylogenetic analysis revealed high conservation of mtDNA position 2617, i.e., 16S rRNA position 947 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref008">8</xref>]. Specifically, this position was an adenine in nearly 90% of all tested vertebrate species, while the remaining 10% had a thymine. The above findings are consistent with the idea that the presence of the m<sup>1</sup>A modification results in a mixture of reads with mostly adenine or thymine and less with a guanine in RNA-seq data, as previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref019">19</xref>]. To assess the extent to which position A947 is methylated across vertebrate phylogeny, we analyzed RNA-seq data from nine species representing major vertebrate taxa (placental mammals, marsupials, monotremes, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and bony fish) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s001">S1 Data</xref>).

<p>Our analysis revealed that RDDs (A-to-U and A-to-G) occurred in the 16S rRNA of all tested species in which an adenine occupied mtDNA position 2617, indicating the presence of m<sup>1</sup>A947 in these 16S rRNAs. In contrast, species with a thymine in their mtDNA maintained a uridine in their RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s001">S1 Data</xref>). Notably, the RDD levels varied among the tested species, possibly due to physiological differences between different vertebrates. These observations further support our interpretation that position 947 of 16S rRNA is modified and that this modification is highly conserved across vertebrates.</p>

<title>m<sup>1</sup>A947 Is Highly Enriched in the Mature Mitoribosome</title>
<p>The m<sup>1</sup>A947 modification was identified in RNA-seq data generated from total RNA samples, harboring both mature and premature mitochondrial transcripts. As a first step to elucidate the functional importance of this modification, we assessed the extent to which 16S rRNA position 947 is present in the modified version in the mature ribosome. To this end, we purified whole mitochondria and isolated mitoribosomes from a single <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> liver specimen and sequenced mtDNA and RNA from the isolated mitochondria as well as RNA from the purified mitoribosome. As expected, 100% of mtDNA reads from isolated mitochondria showed an adenine at the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>scrofa</italic> orthologous position of human mtDNA position 2617 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s001">S1 Data</xref>).

<p>Notably, this position is structurally conserved from bacteria to mammals in both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ribosomal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref030">30</xref>]. Our RNA-seq analysis of diverse vertebrate species showed an RDD in species with an adenine, but not with a thymine, at 16S rRNA position 947. Furthermore, this position is occupied by a thymine in the human cytoplasmic ribosome and by a guanine in 95% of all tested bacterial species. We therefore hypothesized that three functional alternatives arose during evolution, all of which are capable of maintaining full ribosomal activity: (A) an unmodified thymine (human cytoplasmic and 10% of the vertebrate mitochondrial ribosomes), (B) an unmodified guanine (in most bacteria), and (C) an m<sup>1</sup>A modification in 90% of the mitochondrial ribosomes. According to this hypothesis, forcing an unmodified adenine into the mature ribosome would interfere with its activity. Because there is no available technology to modify specific mtDNA nucleotides in cells, we chose <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as our model system to test this hypothesis. Using the genome engineering technology MAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref031">31</xref>], we successfully replaced the endogenous bacterial nucleotide at position 1954, which corresponds to human mitochondrial 16S rRNA position 947, in all seven 23S rRNA gene copies. We independently replaced the wild-type guanine for either a thymine or an adenine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s004">S3 Fig</xref>) and tested the resulting strains in terms of growth rate and translation efficiency. Remarkably, strains harboring an adenine grew significantly slower as compared to strains harboring either the WT base (guanine) or a thymine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s001">S1 Data</xref>). This result is consistent with our hypothesis that the presence of either thymine or guanine is important for cell growth, and that an unmodified adenine has a negative effect at this position on the mitochondrial and bacterial translational machineries.</p>

<p>Next, we aimed at assessing the effect of the mutations on ribosomal activity by examining the impact of each base at the modified position on protein synthesis. Indeed, in vivo examination of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) production revealed that strains harboring an adenine at position 1,954 showed decreased maximal protein synthesis rate (64.4% and 76.2% in the mutant and WT, respectively) as well as a decrease in total protein production (75% and 83.6% in the mutant and WT, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s001">S1 Data</xref>). This observation suggests that the major growth defect of the bacterial strain harboring an adenine at position 1,954 is caused by impaired protein synthesis. Interestingly, the strain with a thymine demonstrated a comparable, and even higher, maximal protein production rate (109% in the mutant as compared to WT) as well as total protein production (110.1% in the mutant, as compared to WT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s001">S1 Data</xref>).

Taken together, our experiments strongly support our hypothesis that mitochondrial 16S rRNA position 947 should either be a modified adenine or harbor a thymine or guanine to maintain proper mitoribosomal activity.</p>

<title>m<sup>1</sup>A, Thymine, or Guanine at 16S rRNA Position 947 May Form Stabilizing Interactions within the Mitoribosome</title>
<p>To interpret the structural basis of our functional observations, we modeled adenine, m<sup>1</sup>A, or uridine at 16S rRNA position 947 within the recently solved cryo-EM structures of the human and porcine 55S mitoribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref018">18</xref>]. Interestingly, m<sup>1</sup>A947 resides within helix 71 (H71) in domain IV of the 39S large ribosomal subunit, which is located at the subunit interface near intersubunit bridge B3, where interactions with the 28S small ribosomal subunit are formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The loop region of H71 interacts with H92 in 16S rRNA domain V to form an interdomain interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s005">S4 Fig</xref>), which is likely stabilized by the methylation of U2552 of H92 in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (human mitochondrial U1369, porcine mitochondrial U1373) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref032">32</xref>]. Accordingly, m<sup>1</sup>A947 may also be involved in stabilizing the tertiary rRNA interactions in this region of the ribosome. m<sup>1</sup>A may do so by forming stabilizing electrostatic interactions between the positive charge induced by N<sup>1</sup>-methylation and the negatively charged phosphate rRNA backbone of H64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The unmodified adenine, in contrast, lacks this positive charge and may not be able to provide these stabilizing interactions. These observations raise the possibility that m<sup>1</sup>A enrichment in mitochondrial ribosomes is due to its contribution to the formation of more stable ribosomal subunits. In the case of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> ribosome, which contains a guanine at the corresponding position, the exocyclic amino group of this guanine residue may act as a hydrogen bond donor to the backbone of the 23S rRNA.</p>
<p>Examination of the model (and the superimposed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> ribosomal structure) shows that in addition to m<sup>1</sup>A, uridine may also form some stabilizing interactions that an unmodified adenine is unable to provide. This possibly explains why 10% of vertebrates harbor only thymine in their mtDNA and uridine in the corresponding 16S rRNA. More specifically, due to the size difference between adenine and uridine, the uridine may interact with the rRNA backbone indirectly via a water molecular bridge, reducing the effect of the partial negative charge of its exocyclic oxygen atoms. Hence, stabilization by the uridine may occur via a different mechanism from the fully-charged m<sup>1</sup>A modification.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report that the non-canonical RDDs in mitochondrial 16S rRNA position 947 result from an m<sup>1</sup>A modification generated by the mitochondrial RNA methyltransferase TRMT61B. Thereby, our finding sets the basis for assessing the prevalence of the underlying m<sup>1</sup>A modification echoed by A-to-U/G RDDs throughout the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref033">33</xref>]. TRMT61B introduces m<sup>1</sup>A modifications in position 58 of the T-loops of six tRNA species in bovine mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s006">S5A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref024">24</xref>]. Thus, similar to the bacterial RlmN methyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref034">34</xref>], TRMT61B modifies both tRNA and rRNA and, hence, constitutes the first vertebrate methyltransferase that modifies both tRNA and rRNAs.</p>
<p>Alignment of the T-loops of these six tRNAs revealed a weak consensus sequence (YMRAW) surrounding m<sup>1</sup>A58 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s006">S5B Fig</xref>), which is also present in the loop capping 16S rRNA H71 (UAAAU) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s006">S5B Fig</xref>). Close inspection of the tRNAs and the 16S rRNA revealed similarity in the structure of the backbone loop and orientation of the methylated base (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002557.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). In vitro reconstitution of m<sup>1</sup>A947 using recombinant TRMT61B in combination with total RNA extracted from siRNA-treated HeLa cells revealed the capability of TRMT61B to recognize deproteinized naked 16S rRNA as a substrate to introduce m<sup>1</sup>A947 in Helix 71. This finding indicates that m<sup>1</sup>A947 is likely introduced at the early assembly stage of the mitoribosomal 39S subunit. Therefore, TRMT61B likely recognizes its tRNA and rRNA targets by a similar molecular mechanism.</p>
<p>Notably, we observed partial reduction in the methylation state of 16S rRNA position 947 in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002557.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Such a partial phenotype is likely due to the stability of tRNA and rRNA molecules, which have relatively long half-lives as compared to mRNA molecules. Thus, pools of tRNA and rRNA molecules are not completely replaced with newly-synthesized hypomodified ones during cultivation after knockdown, even if the knockdown efficiency is quite high. Alternatively, although TRMT61B is the first methyltransferase that introduces an m<sup>1</sup>A modification in both mitochondrial tRNA and 16S rRNA, we cannot exclude the possible involvement of other additional enzymes. Therefore, our results underline the importance of a future detailed analysis of the mitochondrial m<sup>1</sup>A methylation mechanism and possible screen for its underlying components.</p>
<p>Our study revealed three changes that have occurred independently at the loop capping rRNA H71, which served as convergent evolutionary solutions for the ribosomal large subunit to allow formation of fully active ribosomes: one solution is generated post-transcriptionally (the 16S rRNA 947 m<sup>1</sup>A modification), and the two other solutions occurred at the DNA level (thymine in 10% of the vertebrate mitoribosomes and guanine in most bacteria). Our structural analysis suggests that in contrast to the unmodified adenine, the presence of m<sup>1</sup>A947 or an unmodified uridine in this position of the mitoribosomal 16S rRNA or a guanine in the corresponding position of the 23S bacterial rRNA may create stabilizing interactions within the ribosome, thus likely explaining their importance for protein translation in mitochondria and bacteria. Once a reconstituted in vitro human mitochondrial translation system is available, one will be able to assess the functional impact of mitochondrial 16S rRNA mutants, wild-type, and RNA-modified molecules and study their importance for mitochondrial translation.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that most vertebrate mitochondrial ribosomes rely on an rRNA modification, while a nucleotide compatible with a fully active ribosome is already encoded by the bacterial gene of the large rRNA subunit, the cytosolic ribosome in eukaryotes, and in a subset of vertebrate mitochondria. Intuitively, mutations at the DNA level (the vertebrate thymine and bacterial guanine) seem like more elegant solutions, eliminating the need for RNA modification at 16S rRNA position 947. Since the adenine (which is modified at the RNA level) was retained in 90% of the vertebrates, there might be selective pressure in favor of this base at the DNA level. Three possible explanations emerge: (A) The mitochondrial 16S rRNA transcript has a second role in addition to its role in the mitoribosome, which requires the 947A. (B) Random mutagenesis led to an adenine, which, in turn, has been retained due to co-occurrence with flanking sequences that together completed the recognition motif of TRMT61B. (C) The adenine is maintained at this mtDNA position because it strengthened a yet-to-be defined regulatory element. Interestingly, recent findings may favor the third hypothesis: Recently, ChIP-seq and DNase-seq analyses enabled us to identify candidate regulatory elements even within coding mtDNA sequences, thus suggesting a dual role for such sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref035">35</xref>]. Hence, the assessment of the putative regulatory impact of this region (with or without the mutations) merits further investigation.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings unveiled that the previously reported RDDs at 16S rRNA position 947 marked an m<sup>1</sup>A RNA modification introduced by the mitochondrial methyltransferase TRMT61B. As this modification is present in most 16S rRNA in the mature mammalian mitoribosome and occurs throughout vertebrate evolution, modification of position 947 is most likely important for mitoribosomal structure and function. In agreement with this idea, our bacterial model experiments indicate that in the absence of methylation, the adenine at position 947 had to be mutated (A-to-T) at the DNA level to enable translation and cell growth, as also observed in 10% of vertebrate species. As G in this position is likely the ancestral state, and is compatible with efficient protein translation, m<sup>1</sup>A or U likely evolved later at this position to meet the specific requirements of mitochondrial function. Finally, it is intriguing that the expression of TRMT61B is altered in Alzheimer’s disease, thus suggesting altered levels of mitochondrial tRNA and rRNA modifications in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002557.ref036">36</xref>]. In summary, three alternative evolutionary solutions (i.e., RNA modification and either of two DNA bases) were selected to maintain ribosomal function in bacteria and mitochondria.</p>

A typical cell-free reaction assay consists of 10 μL reaction mixture containing 33% (by volume) <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cell extract, and 66% of the reaction volume is composed of the reaction buffer containing nutrients, metabolites, and crowding agents. The reporter plasmid (pBEST-OR2-OR1-Pr-UTR1-deGFP-T500 [Addgene #40019]) is finally added to final concentration of 2nM.
