<abstract>
<p>As a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), the physiological substrates of ataxin-3 (ATX-3) remain elusive, which limits our understanding of its normal cellular function and that of pathogenic mechanism of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). Here, we identify p53 to be a novel substrate of ATX-3. ATX-3 binds to native and polyubiquitinated p53 and deubiquitinates and stabilizes p53 by repressing its degradation through the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway. ATX-3 deletion destabilizes p53, resulting in deficiency of p53 activity and functions, whereas ectopic expression of ATX-3 induces selective transcription/expression of p53 target genes and promotes p53-dependent apoptosis in both mammalian cells and the central nervous system of zebrafish. Furthermore, the polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded ATX-3 retains enhanced interaction and deubiquitination catalytic activity to p53 and causes more severe p53-dependent neurodegeneration in zebrafish brains and in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum of a transgenic SCA3 mouse model. Our findings identify a novel molecular link between ATX-3 and p53-mediated cell death and provide an explanation for the direct involvement of p53 in SCA3 disease pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Ataxin-3 (ATX-3) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that mutated in a neurodegenerative disease called spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). It contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract near its C-terminus, the expansion of which is known to be the causative factor for SCA3. It has been known for a long time that ATX-3 is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). However, the substrates targeted by ATX-3 in the physiological context remain elusive, thus largely limiting our understanding of its cellular function and that of the pathogenic mechanism of SCA3. This study has identified p53 to be a novel substrate of ATX-3, and its function is tightly regulated by ATX-3. PolyQ expansion augments ATX-3’s cellular function in p53 regulation. Due to enhanced interaction to p53 and up-regulation of p53, polyQ-expanded ATX-3 led to an increased p53-dependent neuronal cell death in zebrafish and mouse models, thus providing clear in vivo evidences for the direct involvement of p53 in SCA3 pathology. This study not only establishes a basic function of ATX-3 but also provides an explanation of how the interplays between ATX-3 and p53 contribute to the SCA3 pathogenesis; thus, it is an important contribution for the future development of therapeutic approaches for this currently untreatable neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado–Joseph disease (MJD), is an autosomal-dominantly inherited ataxia and one of at least nine polyglutamine (polyQ) neurodegenerative disorders described so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref003">3</xref>]. SCA3 is caused by an unstable cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion mutation in the <italic>ATXN3</italic> gene leading to an expanded polyQ tract within the ataxin-3 (ATX-3) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref004">4</xref>]. As a deubiquitylase, ATX-3 is highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed in cells throughout the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref005">5</xref>]. ATX-3 knockout (KO) mice have no major abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref006">6</xref>]. It is possible that, besides ATX-3, three other members of the MJD family of cysteine proteases, including ATX-3 Like, JosD1, and JosD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref007">7</xref>], may exert similar functions to ATX-3 and compensate for its absence in KO models. ATX-3 has a structured N-terminal Josephin domain comprising the catalytic site, two ubiquitin (Ub)-binding sites, and an unstructured C-terminal, which contains two or three Ub-interacting motifs (UIMs) flanking a polyQ tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref009">9</xref>]. The expansion of the polyQ tract is thought to trigger a pathogenic cascade, leading to cellular dysfunction and selective neuronal cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref010">10</xref>]. Expansion length is inversely correlated with age of disease onset and directly with disease severity. However, the precise pathogenic mechanism triggered by polyQ-expanded ATX-3 in SCA3 patients has remained elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of works have been carried out to explore ATX-3’s biological and potential cellular roles, and identification of molecular partners interacting with ATX-3 is hoped to facilitate identification of its physiological functions. For example, as a highly specialized deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), a function of ATX-3 has been shown to be involved in the cellular protein quality control system by interacting with p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref022">22</xref>] and several E3 Ub ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref028">28</xref>]. Moreover, several lines of evidence have shown that ATX-3 can bind DNA and interact with transcription regulators, thus being involved in transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref031">31</xref>]. Thus, ATX-3 has been associated with a wide range of biological activities.</p>
<p>The absence of ATX-3 leads to an increase of total ubiquitinated protein levels in ATX-3 KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref006">6</xref>], whereas overexpression of ATX-3 results in significantly reduced cellular protein ubiquitination in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref032">32</xref>], suggesting that ATX-3 may regulate the ubiquitination status of many proteins. However, the substrates targeted by ATX-3 in the physiological context remain unclear, thus limiting our understanding of its cellular functions. Whether the polyQ expansion in ATX-3 may contribute to the neuropathology by affecting its molecular interactions with other proteins or endogenous functions of normal ATX-3 is unknown. To develop effective therapies for this incurable disorder, it is important to identify ATX-3’s preferred substrates and to determine how the polyQ expansion causes the protein’s dysfunction.</p>
<p>In the present study, we used immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry to search for the proteins that associate with ATX-3. We have found that ATX-3 interacts with p53 and functions as a novel p53 DUB. ATX-3 deubiquitinates, stabilizes p53, and further regulates the functions of p53 in transactivation and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Whether and how the polyQ expansion in ATX-3 affects its functional regulation of p53 and further neurodegeneration have also been investigated.</p>

<p>The two or three UIMs of ATX-3, depending on the splice isoform, mediate its binding to poly-ubiquitinated substrates. We observed that full-length (FL) ATX-3 bound robustly to both the native and ubiquitinated form of p53 in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) and in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Mutating the active site cysteine 14 did not affect the Ub chain binding activity of ATX-3, whereas ΔC and ΔN deletion as well as the UIM mutations (S236/256A and A232/252G) resulted in either abolished or impaired Ub binding activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Consistently, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g001">Fig 1G</xref>, the cysteine 14 mutation did not affect the binding of ATX-3 to either native or ubiquitinated p53, whereas the ΔN mutant lost its binding to both forms of p53. The ΔC mutant was found to bind to the native p53 with decreased affinity, and the two UIM mutants showed significantly compromised binding to ubiquitinated p53. We constructed a catalytic inactive ΔC mutant to exclude the possibility that the N-terminal domain might be able to interact with ubiquitinated p53 but further be deubiquitinated before detection. Catalytic inactive ΔC mutant showed similar binding affinity to native p53 as the ΔC mutant did, confirming that N-terminal domain only bound to native p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that the binding of ATX-3 to p53 was synergistically regulated by the Josephin domain and the UIMs, with the former being primarily responsible for the binding of ATX-3 to the native p53 and further facilitating the latter to bind to ubiquitinated p53.</p>

<title>ATX-3 Suppresses p53 Ubiquitination in Cells and Deubiquitinates p53 Directly In Vitro</title>
<p>The interaction between ATX-3 and p53 suggested that p53 might be a substrate of ATX-3. Therefore, we tested whether ATX-3 affected the levels of p53 ubiquitination in vivo. As the p53 levels may differ among different cell lines, to show the generality of the effect of ATX-3 on p53, we generated ATX-3 stably knockdown cell lines in HeLa, HCT116, and RKO cells using two non-overlapping short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs. For the following experiments using knockdown cells in the study, either two clones of ATX-3 shRNA stably knockdown cells were used or one clone of knockdown cells was used but with rescue experiments performed in parallel. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, knockdown of ATX-3 in HeLa cells significantly increased the level of ubiquitinated-p53 (lane 3), and transient expression of ATX-3 effectively eliminated the increased ubiquitination that resulted from ATX-3 knockdown (lane 4). Moreover, ATX-3 overexpression resulted in a suppression of p53 ubiquitination (lane 2). Similar results were observed in ATX-3+/+ and ATX-3-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g002">Fig 2B</xref> left and right panel). Furthermore, our results showed that ATX-3 affected p53 ubiquitination in cells, and both the N-terminal Josephin domain and the C-terminal UIM domains of ATX-3 are required for this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These results suggest that ATX-3 may act as a p53-directed DUB.</p>

<title>ATX-3 Stabilizes p53 via the Ub-Proteasome Pathway</title>
<p>As ATX-3 interacts with p53 under physiological conditions and regulates the ubiquitination of p53 in cells, it is possible that ATX-3 may regulate the turnover of p53 via the Ub-proteasome pathway. We found that co-transfection of ATX-3 and p53 led to the accumulation of p53 protein compared with p53 alone-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In contrast, deletion of ATX-3 resulted in an overt reduction in p53 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, left), with no appreciable change at the p53 mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, right), indicating that the regulation of p53 by ATX-3 is unlikely at the transcriptional level. p53 levels were also compared in ATX-3 wild-type (WT) and KO mice primary cultures by western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). The basal p53 levels in ATX-3 KO primary MEFs were significantly lower than those in WT primary MEF cells. ATX-3 regulates p53 posttranslationally, because the half-life of p53 was significantly shortened in the ATX-3 stably knocked-down HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g003">Fig 3C</xref> upper). This result was further validated in another clone of ATX-3 shRNA-stable knockdown cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g003">Fig 3C</xref> lower) as well as in ATX-3-/- MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). In HCT116 p53-/- cells, the ectopically expressed p53 showed significantly prolonged half-life in ATX-3 and p53 co-transfected cells compared to that in p53 alone-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), thus confirming the positive regulatory effect of ATX-3 on p53 stability. Furthermore, we found that MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, but not NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, a lysosome inhibitor, or 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a well-characterized inhibitor of autophagy, could suppress p53 degradation after cycloheximide (CHX) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Pretreatment of cells with MG132 blocked the degradation of p53 in both ATX-3+/+ and ATX-3-/- MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that ATX-3 stabilizes p53 in cells via the Ub-proteasome pathway.</p>

<title>ATX-3 Regulates p53-Mediated Transcription and Cell Cycle Arrest</title>
<p>To explore the functional consequences of ATX-3-modulated p53 stability, the normal functions of ATX-3 in regulating p53-dependent biological activities were tested. In dual luciferase reporter assay, the DNA binding ability of p53, which is measured by the fluorescence intensity of PG13-Luc reporter, was significantly decreased in both ATX-3 knockdown HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and ATX-3 KO MEF cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Furthermore, acetylation of p53 at K373/K382 is reported to be a marker for the stimulation of the p53 transactivation activity. We treated the MEF cells with doxycycline (DOX) and found that the levels of acetylated p53 and one of its target gene products, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21<sup>cip1/waf</sup> proteins, were remarkably decreased in ATX-3<sup>-/-</sup> MEF cells compared to ATX-3<sup>+/+</sup> controls, and this could be restored to normal levels by transient expression of ATX-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These results suggest that ATX-3 deletion inhibits the stimulation of p53 transactivation activity. The expression of several p53 target genes, for example, <italic>CDNK1A</italic>, <italic>CCNB1</italic>, and <italic>BBC3</italic>, was affected at both mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g004">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s002">S2B Fig</xref>) associating with ATX-3 levels in HCT116 and MEF cells. The mRNA levels of cyclin B1 were higher in ATX-3 knockdown cells than that in control cells. This is because p53 acts as a repressor for cyclin B1. ATX-3 knockdown leads to an inhibition of p53 transcriptional activities, thus relieving its suppression on cyclin B1, resulting in its increased expression. Notably, overexpression of ATX-3 induced up-regulations of <italic>CDNK1A</italic> and <italic>BBC3</italic> but a down-regulation of <italic>CCNB1</italic>, which required both the DUB activity and the poly-Ub binding ability of ATX-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s002">S2C–S2F Fig</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of ATX-3 significantly blocked their induction, and this could be restored upon ATX-3 ectopic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). The inductions of all three p53 target genes were not changed in HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells, indicating that these inductions were p53 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>).</p>

<p>Using the zebrafish model system, we further examined whether ATX-3 induces p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo. As our cellular results showed that knockdown of ATX-3 led to a significant decrease of CPT-induced apoptosis, it is quite possible no apoptosis signal would be detected under unperturbed conditions when ATX-3 is knocked down or knocked out. Therefore, the apoptosis as well as neurodegeneration in zebrafish were performed under ectopic expression conditions instead of knockdown or KO conditions. <italic>p53 WT</italic> and <italic>mutant</italic> zebrafish embryos were injected with mRNA of FL and various <italic>ATX-3</italic> mutants. Twenty-four h post injections, the embryos were harvested and TUNEL-positive cells were analyzed. When the FL <italic>ATX-3</italic> mRNA was injected into <italic>WT</italic> but not the <italic>p53 mutant</italic> zebrafish embryos, significantly more apoptotic cells were observed in TUNEL-staining assays, indicating that ATX-3 caused p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo. In addition, injections of mRNA of the catalytic inactive mutant <italic>ATX-3-C14A (C/A)</italic>, the C-terminal deletion (<italic>ΔC</italic>), and the two UIM mutants (<italic>S/A</italic> and <italic>A/G</italic>) <italic>ATX-3</italic> in <italic>WT p53</italic> zebrafish embryos exhibited significant reduction in apoptosis compared with that of FL <italic>ATX-3</italic>, and no apoptosis was observed in <italic>p53 mutant</italic> zebrafish, indicating that the induction of p53-dependent apoptosis was critically dependent on the catalytic activity and the UIM domain of ATX-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that most TUNEL-positive cells localized in the head area of the zebrafish, suggesting that the apoptosis may occur mainly in the nervous system. To confirm this, TUNEL assay was performed by using the <italic>Tg(HuC</italic>:<italic>EGFP)</italic> transgenic zebrafish embryos, in which GFP-positive cells represent the expression of zebrafish neuronal marker <italic>elavl3</italic> (formerly known as <italic>HuC</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref033">33</xref>]. We observed that the TUNEL-positive cells induced by the FL <italic>ATX-3</italic> mRNA injection were localized in GFP-positive brain regions (telencephalon, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s003">S3B Fig</xref>; diencephalon/hindbrain, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s003">S3C Fig</xref>) of the zebrafish, indicating that the <italic>ATX-3</italic> mRNA injection-induced apoptosis occurred mainly in the nervous system of zebrafish.</p>

<title>The Interaction and DUB Activity of ATX-3 to p53 Are Functionally Enhanced by PolyQ Expansion</title>
<p>PolyQ-expanded ATX-3 (ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)) is thought to undergo conformational changes and acquire toxic properties, leading to altered molecular interactions. We wonder whether the polyQ expansion affects the ATX-3/p53 interaction. GST—pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) and coimmunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) showed that p53, both native and ubiquitinated form, bound ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q) stronger than the normal ATX-3. Consistently, ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q) exhibited stronger DUB activity than the normal ATX-3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) and in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Besides, we found that the degradation of p53 in the ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-expressing cells was slower than that of normal ATX-3-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>), and ectopic expression of polyQ-expanded ATX-3 induced higher levels of p53 protein than the normal ATX-3 in RKO, 293T, and MEF cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s004">S4E Fig</xref>), indicating that polyQ-expanded ATX-3 possessed enhanced capability to stabilize p53. The expression levels of p53-responsive genes (such as p21 and Puma) were also higher in ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q) expressing RKO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s004">S4F Fig</xref>), suggesting that p53 was functionally enhanced by polyQ expansion in ATX-3. For unknown reasons, HCT116 cells do not behave as significantly as other cell lines (such as RKO, 293T, and MEFs) in terms of p53 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g006">Fig 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s004">S4E Fig</xref>). To determine the p53 dependence issue, we used the HCT116 cell lines with both p53<sup>+/+</sup> and p53<sup>-/-</sup> genotypes. In HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup>, but not HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells, both the normal and polyQ-expanded ATX-3 increased the induction of p53-responsive genes at both mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g006">Fig 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g006">Fig 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s004">S4B Fig</xref>) when compared to the empty vector control group, but the difference did not reach the statistical significance between the normal ATX-3 group and polyQ-expanded ATX-3 group. All together, these data indicated that the polyQ expansion did not disturb the binding and the DUB activity of the normal ATX-3 to p53 and appeared to augment p53 stabilization.</p>

<title>PolyQ Expansion Affects p53-Dependent Apoptotic Function in Cells and in Zebrafish</title>
<p>CPT-induced apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI. Apoptotic cells are those positive for Annexin V staining (either positive or negative for PI staining) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Our results showed that expression of the FL ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q) led to a similar increase of p53-dependent apoptosis (including early and late apoptosis/necrosis) in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>) comparing to the normal ATX-3. Early apoptotic cells are Annexin V+/PI- staining, whereas late apoptotic/necrotic cells are Annexin V+/PI+ staining (PI-positive staining is due to a loss of plasma membrane integrity). Interestingly, we found that the normal ATX-3 induced a significantly higher percentage of early apoptotic cells, whereas the ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q) led to more late apoptotic/necrotic cells in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> but not HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). In support, we found that CPT treatment resulted in clearly different morphological nuclear changes in the ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)- and the normal ATX-3-expressing HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> but not HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells after staining the nuclear DNA by Hoechst-33342 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Nuclei of the normal ATX-3-expressing cells were round shaped but without condensed and fragmented chromatin, which represent an early apoptotic event. In contrast, nuclei of ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-expressing cells looked more amorphous, without any defined surface outline, and the nuclear heterochromatin was extensively packaged, indicating necrotic cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Furthermore, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, the p53-dependent apoptosis program marker such as cleaved PARP-1 in the ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-expressing HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells was found to be higher than the empty vector control group but weaker when compared to the normal ATX-3 group, indicating that the mitochondrial apoptotic p53 program played a role in this process, but the extent of this influence may not be as profound as that of the normal ATX-3. More importantly, High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) protein that released into the culture medium (a classical biochemical hallmark specific for necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref035">35</xref>]) as well as the level of receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinases 1 (RIP1, an important mediator of necrosis) were found to be significantly enhanced in ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-expressing HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells compared to those of the empty vector control and the normal ATX-3 group after CPT treatment, indicating that CPT apparently triggered a necrotic program in addition to the mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic program in polyQ-expanded ATX-3-expressing cells. These markers were not significantly changed in HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), demonstrating the changes of these markers were p53 dependent. Together, these results suggested that a continuum of apoptosis and necrosis existed in response to CPT insult in ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-expressing cells, both of which were mediated by p53.</p>

<title>PolyQ Expansion of ATX-3 Causes p53-Dependent Neurodegeneration in Mice Brains</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that neurodegeneration affects particular brain regions in MJD pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref041">41</xref>]. To further study the neurodegeneration in specific affected brain regions in MJD, we generated an in vivo MJD genetic mouse model by ectopic expression of WT and mutant ATX-3 (80Q and C14A) with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tag in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum of p53<sup>+/+</sup> and p53<sup>-/-</sup> mouse brain using lentiviral vectors (LV). The expression of these LV was first validated in 293T cells using fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s006">S6A Fig</xref>) and also by western blot with anti-ATX-3 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Immunostaining analysis for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker for dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, and for dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein (DARPP-32), a regulator of dopamine receptor signaling, was performed to evaluate the neurodegeneration induced by lentiviral transduction. Our results showed that, in p53<sup>+/+</sup> mice, WT ATX-3 caused a nonsignificant reduction of 15% TH-positive neurons in the SNpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>) and a reduction of 31% DARPP-32–positive neurons in the striatum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>), whereas mutant ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q) induced a more significant loss of neurons in both of these two brain areas when compared to the empty vector expressed brain section, with a reduction of 57% for TH-positive neurons in the SNpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>) and of 51% for DARPP-32–positive neurons in the striatum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>).

The evidences for p53 involvement in the mutant ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-induced neurodegeneration were provided by the fact that no significant decreases of both neuronal markers were detected in p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice after LV transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s006">S6E and S6F Fig</xref>).

The numbers of TUNEL-positive and activated caspase-3-positive cells were significantly increased in the EGFP-positive neurons in both the SNpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>) and striatum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>) of p53<sup>+/+</sup> but not p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These results confirmed the association of cell death with WT and mutant ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q) expression. It should be noted that WT ATX-3 induced significant higher TUNEL and activated caspase-3 staining compared to the mutant ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q). As signs of non-apoptotic cell death, including extracellular release of HMGB1 and higher expression of RIP1, were observed in mutant ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-expressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), and it is generally accepted that activated caspase-3 are rarely detected in the case of necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref042">42</xref>], we hypothesized that necrosis might occur in these brain areas. To gain further insights into mechanism of the neuronal death, we evaluated the expression of RIP1, which is an important molecule mediating necrosis when caspases are inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref043">43</xref>]. We found that mutant ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-expressed brain sections of p53<sup>+/+</sup> but not p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice had more intense staining for RIP1 than did the WT ATX-3 sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s007">S7A–S7C Fig</xref>). A high magnification view of the anti-RIP1 and anti-TH immunostaining in the SNpc of p53<sup>+/+</sup> mice showed that most TH-positive neurons showed intact nuclear membrane, whereas those neurons that had condensed chromatin structures and nuclei were highly RIP1 positive but negative for TH staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). No obvious RIP1 immunostaining was observed in p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). These results indicated the involvement of RIP1 in polyQ ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-induced neuronal death in mouse brains. Together, our in vivo data have demonstrated that the polyQ ATX-3 caused p53-dependent neuronal death in both apoptotic and necrosis manner in mouse brains.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>p53 activity is crucial in determining the cellular fate, keeping a delicate balance between cancer-suppressive and age-promoting functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref048">48</xref>]. Therefore, tight regulation of p53 is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions. It has been shown that p53 is mainly regulated at the level of protein stability, which occurs predominantly through the Ub-mediated proteasomal degradation. On the flip side of the regulation, deubiquitination, which is mediated by DUBs, provides a parallel important regulatory control of p53 stability. Previously, several DUBs from the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref053">53</xref>] and otubain (OTU) family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref054">54</xref>] have been shown to regulate the Mdm2-p53 pathway, each with different detailed mechanisms of action. For example, USP7 (also named HAUSP) was the first identified USP that stabilizes p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref055">55</xref>]. Later, it was found to deubiquitinate Mdm2 and Mdmx as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref056">56</xref>], thus showing selective deubiquitination to regulate the homeostatic levels of p53, Mdm2, and Mdmx under both normal and stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref055">55</xref>]. Unlike USP7, USP10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref052">52</xref>], a cytoplasmic DUB, had recently been shown to directly deubiquitinate p53, but not Mdm2 and Mdmx, and to regulate the subcellular localization and stability of p53 by opposing the effects of Mdm2. In the present study, we report that p53 is a novel substrate of ATX-3 under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested a possible role of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in neurodegenerative diseases, although the evidences are indirect. p53 is mutated in approximately half of all human cancers, and accumulating evidences also supported a role of p53 in neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref058">58</xref>]. For example, p53 was found to be highly elevated in brains affected by several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref059">59</xref>]. Furthermore, several epidemiological studies have found an inverse correlation between the risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref062">62</xref>], suggesting that some common protein effectors might likely be involved between these two multifactorial chronic pathologies. Given the important role of p53 in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, it is thus a likely possible candidate. Recent studies have reported that ATX-3 and ATX-3 like are involved in gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref063">63</xref>] and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref064">64</xref>], supporting the association of the Josephin family of DUBs with cancer. Importantly, aberrant activation of the p53 pathway has previously been reported in both MJD patient brain tissues and transgenic animal disease models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref065">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref069">69</xref>], and elevated p53 level was observed in MJD transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref065">65</xref>]. Therefore, the overall above-cited data concur to suggest the possibility of a functional link between ATX-3 and p53. p53 has not come out as a potential issue in the ATX-3 KO mice from the literature. As we mentioned in the Introduction section, this may be because other members of the MJD DUBs may compensate for its absence in ATX-3 KO models under unstressed conditions. Here in our study, we discovered that ATX-3 interacts with p53 and functions as a DUB for p53.</p>
<p>We have observed that the Josephin domain of ATX-3 is sufficient for the direct binding of ATX-3 to native p53, whereas the ubiquitinated p53 interacts with ATX-3 primarily through the UIMs, indicating that UIMs function to help recruit and bind the ubiquitinated p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>). Therefore, both the Josephin and UIM domain coordinately regulate the interaction between ATX-3 and p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>). During the DUB process, in addition to the catalytic cysteine 14 site and the N-terminal Josephin domain, the UIMs of ATX-3 are also required for its DUB activity towards p53, which may function to position the polyubiquitinated p53 correctly relative to the catalytic site for subsequent cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Thus, ATX-3 deubiquitinates and stabilizes p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g009">Fig 9C</xref>), which is an essential step for p53 function in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). The direct interaction between ATX-3 and p53 is primarily mediated by the Josephin domain, and the first two UIM domains function to enhance the interaction by trapping the Ub-chains on p53. The polyQ tract between UIM2 and UIM3 is expanded in MJD. Our results suggest that polyQ length enhances rather than disturbs the binding and deubiquitination of ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> to p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g006">Fig 6A–6D</xref>), which, in turn, causes more p53-dependent apoptosis/necrosis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g007">7A, 7B, 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">8E and 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s005">S5B, S5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s007">S7A and S7B</xref> Figs).</p>

<title>A schematic diagram for ATX-3 interaction and regulation of p53.</title>
<p>(A) ATX-3 binds to the DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 via its Josephin domain under physiological conditions. (B) During the DUB process, ATX-3 primarily binds to ubiquitinated p53 through UIM1 and UIM2, and the Ub binding sites in the Josephin domain may also help the binding. (C and D) The deubiquitination of p53 by ATX-3 in physiological conditions leads to the stabilization of p53, which further results in the selective activation of p53-responsive genes involving both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The expansion of the C-terminal polyQ tract augments the binding of ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q) with p53 and thus enhances the DUB activity of ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q), resulting in p53-dependent cell death (including both early apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic manner) in SCA3 neurons.</p>

<p>Previously, mutant huntingtin with expanded polyQ was found to bind to p53 and cause more cell death than WT huntingtin in neuronal cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref070">70</xref>]. Here, polyQ-expanded ATX-3 was found to cause an increased percentage of cells undergoing p53-dependent late apoptotic/necrotic cell death than the normal ATX-3 did in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) and in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>). In consistence with our result, Evert’s group also observed an increased necrotic cell death in a cellular model for SCA3 upon polyQ ATX-3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref071">71</xref>], and p53 have been recently reported to play important roles in activating necrotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref073">73</xref>]. Whether polyQ-expanded ATX-3 has additional targets that work together with p53 in inducing necrosis is not known yet, but we did find that the level of RIP1, an important mediator in necrosis, increased significantly in p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells upon polyQ-expanded ATX-3 expression when compared to the empty vector control and the normal ATX-3 group, but remained at a basal low level in p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g007">7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">8E and 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some other signaling pathways or p53 status (such as modification or subcellular distribution) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000733.ref074">74</xref>] might also been affected upon polyQ-expanded ATX-3 expression, which led to the change of the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis and necrosis.</p>
<p>We first used zebrafish as a model vertebrate to test the influence of polyQ expansion on the neuronal cell death in vivo. It is intriguing to note that injection of <italic>ATX-3</italic> mRNA into the zebrafish embryos led to p53-dependent apoptosis, which occurred mainly in the central nervous system of zebrafish at early development stage (24 hpf). However, the polyQ-expanded ATX-3 induced progressive severe p53-dependent neurodegeneration in the central nervous system of zebrafish, suggesting that it caused other kinds of p53-mediated neural cell death besides apoptosis, too.</p>
<p>By generating a lentiviral-based in vivo MJD genetic model in p53<sup>+/+</sup> and p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice, our in situ detection of two apoptotic markers (TUNEL and active caspase-3) and one necrosis marker (RIP1) data have provided convincing evidences that both enhanced apoptotic-like and non-apoptotic cell death are observed in the SNpc and striatum of ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-expressed neurons in p53<sup>+/+</sup> mice brains but not in p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s007">S7A–S7C Fig</xref>). Meanwhile, significantly more p53-positive cells were detected in ATX-3<sup>exp</sup> (80Q)-expressed mouse brains sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000733.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000733.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>). These data supported an idea that, due to enhanced interaction to p53 and up-regulation of p53, polyQ-expanded ATX-3 led to an increased p53-dependent neuronal cell death (including both early apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic manner). All together, the aforementioned studies and our results provide consistent evidences for the involvement of p53 in SCA3 pathogenesis, and the activation of the p53 pathway likely triggers neuronal dysfunction and eventually neuronal cell death in SCA3.</p>
<p>In conclusion, by identifying p53 as a new substrate of ATX-3, our study not only reveals a physiological function of ATX-3 and a new mechanism of p53 regulation but also establishes a novel molecular link between disease mutant ATX-3 and p53-mediated neurodegeneration, which sheds light on the molecular pathogenic mechanisms in SCA3.</p>

<p>Mice were perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Serial coronal sections were cut through the entire striatum and SNpc at 25 μm. Free-floating cryosections from injected mice were blocked in PBS/0.3% TritonX-100 containing 10% normal donkey serum (Gibco) and then incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal anti- DARPP-32 antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:200); a rabbit polyclonal anti-TH antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:200); a mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody, clone PAb1620 (1:50; Millipore); a rabbit polyclonal anti-RIP1-specific antibody (1:50, Proteintech); and a rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase 3, p17-specific antibody (1:50, Proteintech). Sections were washed in PBS and then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies coupled to fluorophores (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37°C. TUNEL analysis was performed using cryosections with the ApopTag-fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon) according the manufacturer's instruction. Apoptotic cells were quantified, and apoptotic indices were calculated by computer-assisted image analysis following identification of apoptotic cells by morphological analysis, the TUNEL assay, or activated caspase-3 immunostaining. Imaging was done by total internal reflection fluorescence microscope and three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy. Cell counts were determined from anatomically matched sections from each of the animals, and three animals were used for cell counts.</p>

<title>Ataxin-3 interacts with p53.</title>
<p>(A) 293T cells were transfected with the indicated Flag-ataxin-3 full-length or its mutants. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by M2 beads, and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p53 polyclonal antibody. (B and C) GST-pull down assay was performed with GST or the indicated GST-fused proteins and the whole cell extract of A549. GST proteins were stained by Ponceau S, and the pulled down proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p53 polyclonal antibody. (D) GST-pull down assay was performed with the GST-Ub chains and the whole cell extract of 293T transiently transfected with indicated Flag-tagged ataxin-3 and its mutants. GST-Ub was stained by Ponceau S, and the pulled down proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag antibody. (E) Effects of ataxin-3 gene knockout on p53 protein levels in primary MEFs. Ablation of ataxin-3 gene caused significantly decreased p53 levels in KO primary MEFs. Each lane represents one primary MEF culture from one fetus. We should note here that, the p53 protein levels in primary KO MEFs were gradually increasing with the passages number increase during immortalization, suggesting a compensation for the absence of ataxin-3 may occur in KO MEF cells during immortalization.</p>
