<abstract>
<p>Recent single molecule experiments, using either atomic force microscopy (AFM) or Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have shown that multidomain proteins containing tandem repeats may form stable misfolded structures. Topology-based simulation models have been used successfully to generate models for these structures with domain-swapped features, fully consistent with the available data. However, it is also known that some multidomain protein folds exhibit no evidence for misfolding, even when adjacent domains have identical sequences. Here we pose the question: what factors influence the propensity of a given fold to undergo domain-swapped misfolding? Using a coarse-grained simulation model, we can reproduce the known propensities of multidomain proteins to form domain-swapped misfolds, where data is available. Contrary to what might be naively expected based on the previously described misfolding mechanism, we find that the extent of misfolding is not determined by the relative folding rates or barrier heights for forming the domains present in the initial intermediates leading to folded or misfolded structures. Instead, it appears that the propensity is more closely related to the relative stability of the domains present in folded and misfolded intermediates. We show that these findings can be rationalized if the folded and misfolded domains are part of the same folding funnel, with commitment to one structure or the other occurring only at a relatively late stage of folding. Nonetheless, the results are still fully consistent with the kinetic models previously proposed to explain misfolding, with a specific interpretation of the observed rate coefficients. Finally, we investigate the relation between interdomain linker length and misfolding, and propose a simple alchemical model to predict the propensity for domain-swapped misfolding of multidomain proteins.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Multidomain proteins with tandem repeats are abundant in eukaryotic proteins. Recent studies have shown that such domains may have a propensity for forming domain-swapped misfolded species which are stable for long periods, and therefore a potential hazard in the cell. However, for some types of tandem domains, no detectable misfolding was observed. In this work, we use coarse-grained structure-based folding models to address two central questions regarding misfolding of multidomain proteins. First, what are the possible structural topologies of the misfolds for a given domain, and what determines their relative abundance? Second, what is the effect of the topology of the domains on their propensity for misfolding? We show how the propensity of a given domain to misfold can be correlated with the <italic>stability</italic> of domains present in the intermediates on the folding and misfolding pathways, consistent with the energy landscape view of protein folding. Based on these observations, we propose a simplified model that can be used to predict misfolding propensity for other multidomain proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein misfolding and aggregation are well-known for their association with amyloidosis and other diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref002">2</xref>]. Proteins with two or more domains are abundant in higher organisms, accounting for up to 70% of all eukaryotic proteins, and domain-repeat proteins in particular occupy a fraction up to 20% of the proteomes in multicellular organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref004">4</xref>], therefore their folding is of considerable relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref005">5</xref>]. Since there is often some sequence similarity between domains with the same structure, it is easily possible to imagine that multidomain proteins containing repeats of domains with the same fold might be susceptible to misfolding. Indeed, misfolding of multidomain proteins has been observed in many protein families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref006">6</xref>]. Single molecule techniques have been particularly powerful for studying folding/misfolding of such proteins, in particular Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). For instance, recent studies using single-molecule FRET, in conjunction with coarse-grained simulations, have revealed the presence of domain-swapped misfolded states in tandem repeats of the immunoglobulin-like domain I27 from the muscle protein Titin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>] (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1e</xref>). Domain-swapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref002">2</xref>] involves the exchange of secondary structure elements between two protein domains with the same structure. Remarkably, these misfolded states are stable for days, much longer than the unfolding time of a single Titin domain. The domain-swapped misfolds identified in the Titin I27 domains are also consistent with earlier observations of misfolding in the same protein by AFM, although not given a structural interpretation at the time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref008">8</xref>]. In addition, AFM experiments have revealed what appears to be a similar type of misfolding in polyproteins consisting of eight tandem repeats of the same fibronectin type III domain from tenascin (TNfn3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref009">9</xref>], as well as in native constructs of tenascin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref008">8</xref>], and between the N-terminal domains of human <italic>γ</italic>D-crystallin when linked in a synthetic oligomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref010">10</xref>].</p>

<title>Misfolding mechanism of tandem domains.</title>
<p>The schematic shows the native-like stable intermediates populated <italic>en route</italic> to native folding (upper) or misfolding (lower), and used to explain single-molecule and ensemble folding kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>]. The correctly folded dimer (c) is formed from the unfolded chain (a) via an intermediate (b) in which either of the domains folds natively. The misfolded dimers (e) form via initial formation of a domain-swapped “central domain” (d) formed by the central regions of the sequence, followed by a “terminal domain” formed by the terminal regions of the sequence. The blue and red dots indicate the N- and C- terminal respectively, in each case. The N- and C-terminal halves of the chain are also coloured in blue and red respectively.</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition to domain-swapped misfolding, an alternative type of misfolded state is conceivable for polyproteins in which the sequences of adjacent domains are similar, namely the formation of amyloid-like species with parallel <italic>β</italic>-sheets. Theoretical work in fact made the prediction that such species would be formed in tandem repeats of titin domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref011">11</xref>]. Recently, time-resolved single-molecule FRET experiments on tandem domains of I27 have revealed a surprising number of intermediates formed at short times, which include an unexpected species that appears to be consistent with the previously suggested amyloid-like state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>]. However, since only the domain-swapped species persisted till long times, and therefore are the most likely to be problematic in cells, we focus on their formation in this work.</p>
<p>A simplified illustration of the mechanism for folding and misfolding, based on both coarse-grained simulations as well as single-molecule and ensemble kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>], is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1</xref>, using the Titin I27 domain as an example. Starting from the completely unfolded state in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1a</xref>, correct folding would proceed via an intermediate in which either one of the domains is folded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1b</xref>), and finally to the fully folded state, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1c</xref>. The domain-swapped misfolded state, an example of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1e</xref>, consists of two native-like folds which are in fact assembled by swapping of sequence elements from the N- and C-terminal portions of the protein. The final structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1e</xref> comprises what we shall refer to as a “central domain” formed by the central regions of the sequence (on the left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1e</xref>) and a “terminal domain” formed from the N- and C-termini (on the right). The intermediate structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1d</xref>, suggested by coarse-grained simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>], and supported by experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>], has only the central domain folded. This central domain can itself be viewed as a circular permutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref013">13</xref>] of the original native Titin I27 structure, as discussed further below.</p>
<p>While domain-swapped misfolding of tandem repeats has been identified in a number of proteins to date, there are several other proteins for which it does not occur to a detectable level. For instance, extensive sampling of repeated unfolding and folding of a polyprotein of Protein G (GB1) by AFM revealed no indication of misfolded states, in contrast to Titin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref014">14</xref>]. Similarly, early AFM studies on polyUbiquitin also did not suggest misfolded intermediates in constant force unfolding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref020">20</xref>], and lock-in AFM studies of refolding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref021">21</xref>] were fully consistent with a two-state folding model, without misfolding. More recent AFM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref022">22</xref>] studies have suggested the formation of partially folded or misfolded species, which have been attributed to partial domain swapping in simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref023">23</xref>], but these are qualitatively different from the fully domain-swapped species considered here. Therefore, it is interesting to ask the general questions: when included in tandem repeats, what types of protein structures are most likely to form domain-swapped misfolded states, and by what mechanism?</p>
<p>In order to investigate the misfolding propensity of different types of domains, we have chosen seven domains, based on (i) the superfamilies with the largest abundance of repeats in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref024">24</xref>], (ii) proteins for which some experimental evidence for misfolding (or lack thereof) is available and (iii) proteins for which data on folding kinetics and stability is available for their circular permutants (only some of the proteins meet criterion (iii)). The circular permutant data are relevant because the misfolding intermediates suggested by simulations and experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>] can be viewed as circular permutants of the original structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1d</xref>). Each of the chosen proteins is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g002">Fig 2</xref> and described briefly in Materials and Methods. We study the folding and misfolding of the seven protein domains, using the same structure-based model as that successfully employed to treat Titin I27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>]. Molecular simulations are carried out to characterize the possible structural topologies of the misfolded intermediates and the mechanism of their formation. Our model is consistent with available experimental information for the systems studied, in terms of which proteins misfold and what misfolded structures they tend to form. We then investigated what factors influence the propensity of multidomain proteins to misfold. The simplest rationalization of the propensity of a multidomain protein for domain-swapped misfolding would seem to be offered by parameterizing a kinetic model based on the scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1</xref>, particularly for the steps <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1a–1b versus 1a–1d</xref>. We hypothesized that the propensity to misfold might be characterized in terms of the folding kinetics of the isolated circular permutants representing the domain-swapped intermediates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1d</xref>. However, contrary to this expectation, we found that the stability of such isolated domains, rather than their folding rate, is the main determinant of misfolding propensity. Although superficially this appears to differ from previously suggested kinetic models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>], it is completely consistent, with a specific interpretation of the rates. Building on this understanding, we developed a very simplified model which can be used to predict which domains are likely to be susceptible to domain-swapped misfolding. Finally, we have investigated the effect of the composition and length of the linker between the tandem repeats on the misfolding propensity.</p>

<p>Tandem Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g002">Fig 2a</xref>) are widely found in signal transduction proteins and they share functions such as mediating protein-protein interactions and regulating ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref025">25</xref>]. Kinetic and thermodynamic properties of native and all the possible circular permutations of SH3 single domain have been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref026">26</xref>]. Two different circular permutant constructs of the sequence are known to fold to a circularly permuted native conformation (PDB accession codes are 1TUC and 1TUD) that is similar to the wild-tpe (WT) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>With a similar function to the SH3 domains, Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g002">Fig 2b</xref>) are also involved in the mediation of intra- and intermolecular interactions that are important in signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref027">27</xref>]. The SH2 domains are well-known from crystallographic analysis to form metastable domain-swapped dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Fibronectin type III (fn3) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g002">Fig 2c</xref>) are highly abundant in multidomain proteins, and often involved in cell adhesion. We have chosen to study the third fn3 domain of human tenascin (TNfn3), which has been used as a model system to study the mechanical properties of this family. Single-molecule AFM experiments revealed that a small fraction (∼ 4%) of domains in native tenascin (i.e. the full tenascin protein containing both TNfn3 and other fn3 domains) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref008">8</xref>], with a similar signature to that observed for I27. Subsequently, misfolding events have been identified in a polyprotein consisting of repeats of TNfn3 only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref009">9</xref>]. Interestingly, a structure has been determined for a domain-swapped dimer of TNfn3 involving a small change of the loop between the second and third strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>PDZ domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g002">Fig 2d</xref>) are one of the most common modular protein-interaction domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref031">31</xref>], recognizing specific-sequence motifs that occur at the C-terminus of target proteins or internal motifs that mimic the C-terminus structurally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref032">32</xref>]. Naturally occurring circularly permuted PDZ domains have been well studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref035">35</xref>], and domain-swapped dimers of PDZ domains have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Titin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g002">Fig 2e</xref>) is a giant protein spanning the entire muscle sarcomere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref038">38</xref>]. The majority of titin’s I-band region functions as a molecular spring which maintains the structural arrangement and extensibility of muscle filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref039">39</xref>]. The misfolding and aggregation properties of selected tandem Ig-like domains from the I-band of human Titin (I27, I28 and I32) have been extensively studied by FRET experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref024">24</xref>]. In the earlier work on tandem repeats of I27 domains, around 2% misfolding events were reported in repeated stretch-release cycles in AFM experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref008">8</xref>]. A slightly larger fraction (∼ 6%) of misfolded species was identified in single-molecule FRET experiments and rationalized in terms of domain swapped intermediates, captured by coarse-grained simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast, with the above misfolding-prone systems, there are certain polyprotein chains have been shown be resistant to misfolding, according to pulling experiments. For instance little evidence for misfolding was identified in a polyprotein of GB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref014">14</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g002">Fig 2g</xref>), with more than 99.8% of the chains (GB1)<sub>8</sub> folding correctly in repetitive stretching–relaxation cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Lastly, we consider polyUbiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g002">Fig 2f</xref>), for which there is conflicting experimental evidence on misfolding. Initial force microscopy studies showed only the formation of native folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref015">15</xref>], with no misfolding. Later work suggested the formation of collapsed intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref022">22</xref>], however the signature change in molecular extension of these was different from that expected for fully domain-swapped misfolds. A separate study using a lock-in AFM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref021">21</xref>] found Ubiquitin to conform closely to expectations for a two-state folder, without evidence of misfolding. For this protein, there is a strong imperative to avoid misfolding, since Ubiquitin is initially expressed as a tandem polyUbiquitin chain in which adjacent domains have 100% sequence identity, yet this molecule is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref040">40</xref>].</p>

<title>Coarse grained simulation model</title>
<p>A coarse grained structure-based (Go-like) model similar to the earlier work is employed for the study here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref041">41</xref>]. Each residue is represented by one bead, native interactions are attractive and the relative contact energies are set according to the Miyazawa–Jernigan matrix. The model is based on that described by Karanicolas and Brooks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref041">41</xref>], but with native-like interactions allowed to occur between domains as well as within the same domain, as described below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>]. All the simulations are run under a modified version of GROMACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref042">42</xref>]. For the seven species we studied in this work, the native structures of single domains that were used to construct the models for SH3, SH2, PDZ, TNfn3, Titin I27, GB1 and Ubiquitin correspond to PDB entries 1SHG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref043">43</xref>], 1TZE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref044">44</xref>], 2VWR, 1TEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref045">45</xref>], 1TIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref046">46</xref>], 1GB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref047">47</xref>] and 1UBQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref048">48</xref>] respectively. For the single domains of SH3(1SHG), TNfn3(1TEN) and GB1(1GB1), additional linker sequences of Asp-Glu-Thr-Gly, Gly-Leu and Arg-Ser, respectively, are added between the two domains to mimic the constructs used in the corresponding experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref026">26</xref>]. Construction of the Titin I27 model was described in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to allow for domain-swapped misfolding, the native contact potentials within a single domain are also allowed to occur between corresponding residues in different domains, with equal strength. Specifically, considering each single repeat of the dimeric tandem that has <italic>L</italic> amino acids, given any pair of residues (with indices <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>) that are the native interactions within a single domain, the interaction energy for the intradomain interaction (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>)) is the same as the interdomain interaction between the residue (<italic>i</italic> or <italic>j</italic>) and the corresponding residue (<italic>j</italic> + <italic>L</italic> or <italic>i</italic> + <italic>L</italic>) in the adjacent domain, i.e. <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>) = <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+<italic>L</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>) = <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>+<italic>L</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>) = <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+<italic>L</italic>,<italic>j</italic>+<italic>L</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>).</p>

<title>Kinetic folding simulation of dimeric tandem</title>
<p>To investigate the folding kinetics of the dimeric tandem, a total of 1024 independent simulations are performed on each system for a duration of 12 microseconds each. Different misfolding propensities are observed at the end of the simulations. With the exception of Ubiquitin and GB1, the vast majority of the simulations reached stable native states with separately folded domains. A small fraction of simulations form stable domain-swapped misfolded states.

<p>To mimic the folding stability difference between native and circular permutant folds, a penalty energy term <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> has been added whenever the native fragment crosses the midpoint of the sequence from either side (the function <italic>θ</italic>(<italic>χ</italic>) above is 1 if this is true, otherwise zero). That situation corresponds to formation of a domain-swapped structure, in which there is additional strain energy from linking the termini, represented by <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>. We only use the Ising model here to investigate formation of the first domain (either native or circular permutant), by rejecting any proposed Monte Carlo step that would make the native segment longer than the length of single domain, <italic>L</italic>.</p>

<title>First passage simulations of misfolding in multidomain proteins</title>
<p>In order to characterize the potential misfolding properties of each type of domain, we have used a Gō-type energy function based on the native structure. Such models have successfully captured many aspects of protein folding, including <italic>ϕ</italic>-values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref054">54</xref>], dimerization mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref056">56</xref>], domain-swapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref060">60</xref>], and the response of proteins to a pulling force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref062">62</xref>]. More specifically, a Gō type model was used in conjunction with single-molecule and ensemble FRET data to characterize the misfolded states and misfolding mechanism of engineered tandem repeats of Titin I27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>]. We have therefore adopted the same model. Although it is based on native-contacts, it can describe the type of misfolding we consider here, which is also based on native-like structure. Note that this model effectively assumes 100% sequence identity between adjacent domains, the scenario that would most likely lead to domain-swap formation. It is nonetheless a relevant limit for this study, as there are examples in our data set of adjacent domains having identical sequences which do misfold (e.g. titin I27) and those which do not (e.g. protein G).</p>
<p>For each of the folds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g002">Fig 2</xref>, we ran a large number of simulations, starting from a fully extended, unfolded chain, for sufficiently long (12 <italic>μ</italic>s each) such that the vast majority of them reached either the correctly folded tandem dimer, or a domain-swapped misfolded state similar to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1e</xref> for titin. In fact, for each protein, a number of different misfolded topologies are possible, illustrated for the Src SH3 domain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Each of these domains, shown in conventional three-dimensional cartoon representation in the right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g003">Fig 3</xref> and in a simplified two-dimensional topology map in the left column, consists of two native-like folded (or misfolded) domains. For convenience, we call the domain formed from the central portion of the sequence the “central domain” and that from the terminal portions the “terminal domain”. We have chosen to characterize each topology in terms of the position, <italic>K</italic>, in sequence after which the central domain begins. Thus, the native fold has <italic>K</italic> = 0, and all the misfolded states have <italic>K</italic> &gt; 0. Typically, because of the nature of domain swapping, <italic>K</italic> must fall within a loop. Of course, there is a range of residues within the loop in question that could be identified as <italic>K</italic> and we have merely chosen a single <italic>K</italic> close to the centre of the loop. This position, and the central domain, are indicated for the Src SH3 misfolded structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g003">Fig 3</xref>. We note that each of these central domains can also be considered as a circular permutant of the native fold, in which the ends of the protein have been joined and the chain has been cut at position <italic>K</italic>.</p>

<p>With this nomenclature in hand, we can more easily describe the outcome of the folding simulations for the seven domain types considered in terms of the fraction of the final frames that belonged to the native fold, versus each of the possible misfolded states. These final populations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004933.t001">Table 1</xref>. We see that for five of the domains (SH3, SH2, PDZ, TNfn3, Titin I27), misfolded structures are observed, with total populations ranging from 5–10%. For the remaining two domains, Ubiquitin (UBQ) and protein G (GB1), no misfolded population is observed.</p>

<title>Consistency with existing experimental data</title>
<p>The ability to capture domain-swapped misfolds with simple coarse-grained simulations potentially allows us to investigate the origin of the misfolding, and its relation, if any, to the topology of the domain in question. However, we also need to benchmark the accuracy of the results against experiment as far as possible, in order to show that they are relevant. There are two main sources of information to validate our results. The first is the overall degree of domain-swapped misfolding for those proteins where it has been characterized, for example by single molecule AFM or FRET experiments. Qualitatively we do observe good agreement, where data is available: in experiment, domains which have been shown to misfold are TNfn3 (AFM) and Titin I27 (AFM, FRET), which are both found to misfold here, while there is no detectable misfolded population for protein G (AFM), again consistent with our results. We also do not observe any misfolding for Ubiquitin, consistent with the lack of experimental evidence for fully domain-swapped species for this protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Quantitatively, the fractional misfolded population is also consistent with the available experimental data. For instance, the frequency of misfolded domains in native tenascin is ∼ 4% as shown by previous AFM experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref008">8</xref>], the misfolded population of I27 dimers is ∼5% in single-molecule FRET experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>] while the misfolded population of GB1 domains in polyproteins (GB1<sub>8</sub>) is extrememly low (&lt; 0.2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref014">14</xref>]. Even though the observed misfolding population of the misfolded tandem dimer is low, it is potentially a problem considering that many of the multidomain proteins in nature have large number of tandem repeats, such as Titin which contains twenty-two I27 repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref063">63</xref>]. Recent FRET experiments on I27 tandem repeats have shown that the fraction of misfolded proteins increases with the number of repeats. For the 3- and 8-domain polyproteins, the fraction of misfolded domains increases by a factor of 1.3 and 1.8, respectively, relative to a tandem dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The second type of evidence comes from experimental structures of domain-swapped dimers. For several of the proteins, bimolecular domain-swapped structures have been determined experimentally. While no such structures have yet been determined for single-chain tandem dimers, we can compare the misfolded states with the available experimental data. For each experimental example, we are able to find a corresponding misfolded species in our simulation with very similar structure (related by joining the terminis of the two chains in the experimental structures). The domain swapped dimers solved obtained from experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g004">Fig 4a, 4c, 4e and 4g</xref>) are strikingly similar to the domain swapping dimeric tandem from simulations, which are the domain swapped SH3 domains when <italic>K</italic>(sequence position after which the central domain begins) = 37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g004">Fig 4b</xref>), SH2 with <italic>K</italic> = 72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g004">Fig 4d</xref>), TNfn3 with <italic>K</italic> = 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g004">Fig 4f</xref>) and PDZ with <italic>K</italic> = 23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g004">Fig 4h</xref>). Most of these states have relatively high population among all the possible misfolds as observed from the simulations (“Population” in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004933.t001">Table 1</xref>). While the coverage of possible domain swaps is by no means exhaustive, the observed correspondence gives us confidence that the misfolded states in the simulations are physically plausible.</p>

<title>Circular permutants as models of misfolding intermediates</title>
<p>Having shown that the misfolding propensities we obtain are qualitatively consistent with experimental evidence (and in the case of Titin I27, in semi-quantitative agreement with single-molecule FRET), we set out to establish some general principles relating the properties of each domain to its propensity to misfold in this way. We can start to formulate a hypothesis based on the alternative folding and misfolding pathways illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Native folding has as an intermediate a state in which either the N- or the C-terminal domain is folded. In contrast, on the misfolding pathway, the first step is formation of the central domain, followed by that of the terminal domain. This parallel pathway scheme suggests that a descriptor of the overall misfolding propensity may be obtained from the rate of formation of a single correctly folded domain, relative to that of the central domain (neglecting back reactions, because this are rarely seen in our simulations). We can study the central domain formation in isolation, since these structures are just circular permutants of the native fold, i.e. the two proteins have the same sequence as the native, but with the position of the protein termini moved to a different point in the sequence, as is also found in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref035">35</xref>]. These structures can be thought of as originating from the native by cutting a specific loop connecting secondary structure elements (the free energy cost of splitting such an element being too high), and splicing together the N- and C- termini. In the context of the tandem dimers, the position at which the loop is cut is the same <italic>K</italic> that defines the start of the central domain in sequence.</p>
<p>We investigate the role of the central domain by characterizing the free energy landscape of the single domain of each system, as well as all of its possible circular permutants, using umbrella sampling along the reaction coordinate <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>K</italic></sub>. <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>K</italic></sub> is exactly analogous to the conventional fraction of native contacts coordinate <italic>Q</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref064">64</xref>], but defined using the corresponding (frame-shifted) contacts in the circular permutant pseudo-native structure. The index <italic>K</italic> indicates the position along the sequence of the WT where the cut is made in order to convert to the circular permutant.</p>
<p>The free energy surfaces <italic>F</italic>(<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>K</italic></sub>) of two representative systems, SH3 and Ubiquitin, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g005">Fig 5</xref>, with the data for the remaining proteins given in the Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004933.s001">S1 Text</xref>. The free energy barrier height for folding Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> and the stability Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> are listed in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004933.t001">Table 1</xref>. The free energy plots indicate that the single domains of Ubiquitin and GB1 are stable only for the native sequence order, and not for any of the circular permutants. Based on the type of misfolding mechanism sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1</xref>, one would expect that unstable circular permutants would result in an unstable central domain, and consequently no stable domain-swappping misfolding would occur in the dimer folding simulations, as we indeed observe. This is also consistent with previous studies of polyproteins of GB1 and Ubiquitin using using AFM experiments, which reveal high-fidelity folding and refolding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref066">66</xref>]. We note that only under very strongly stabilizing conditions is any misfolding observed for ubiquitin dimers: running simulations at a lower temperature (260 K), we observe a very small (1.3%) population of misfolded states from 1024 trial folding simulations. At a higher temperature of 295 K, once again no misfolding is observed.</p>

<p>In contrast to the situation for GB1 and Ubiquitin, all of the circular permutants of the SH3 domain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g005">Fig 5</xref> are in fact stable, although less so than the native fold. The destabilization of circular permutants relative to native is in accord with the experimental results for the Src SH3 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref026">26</xref>] (rank correlation coefficient stabilities is 0.80). The other domains considered also have stable circular permutant structures. This is consistent with the fact that all of these domains do in fact form some fraction of domain-swapped misfolded states. The simplest view of the misfolding mechanism would be as a kinetic competition between the correctly folded intermediates versus the domain-swapped intermediates with a central domain folded (i.e. a “kinetic partitioning” mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref067">67</xref>]). In this case one might naively expect that the propensity to misfold would be correlated with the relative folding rates of an isolated native domain and an isolated circular permutant structure. However, the folding barriers Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> projected onto <italic>Q</italic> (for native) or <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>K</italic></sub> (for circular permutants) show little correlation to the relative frequency of the corresponding folded or misfolded state, when considering all proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004933.t001">Table 1</xref>). Since this barrier height may not reflect variations in the folding rate if some of the coordinates are poor (yielding a low barrier) or if there are large differences in kinetic prefactors, we have also directly computed the folding rate for the circular permutants of those proteins which misfold, and confirm that the rates of formation of the native fold and circular permutants are similar. We indeed obtain a strong correlation between the folding rate of the isolated circular permutant and the folding barrier Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> (Table B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004933.s001">S1 Text</xref>), which implies Q is a sufficiently good reaction coordinate here. We have also considered the relative contact order (RCO) as a proxy for the folding rate, since it has been found to correlate with folding rates for two-state folding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref068">68</xref>]. However, the RCO calculated based on the native or circularly permuted folds did not correlate with either the barrier height for single domain or circular permutant folding, or with the extent of misfolding in dimeric tandem proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004933.t001">Table 1</xref>). Since the folding rates do not explain misfolding propensities by themselves, another possibility is that the reverse reactions have to be considered. However, once they had formed, in most cases we did not observe unfolding of the first native domain, or of the intermediate with central domain folded, indicating that back reactions should not be needed, at least to explain the simulation data. This lack of refolding is a consequence of the significant stability of the native folds, which controls the relative folding and unfolding rates (and indirectly, those of the circular permutants). Under these conditions, given that folding rates are much higher, once a native fold (or circular permutant misfold) has formed, it is much more likely that a second domain will fold, rather than the first domain unfolding. Our choice of stabilizing conditions was motivated by the fact that misfolding is observed in experiment under conditions where the folded state is much more stable, and the stabilities (Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) of the folded single domains in our simulations are generally comparable to those in experiment (experiment vs simulation, UBQ: 6.1 vs 4.2, GB1: 5.3 vs 3.1, PDZ: 7.5 vs 4.5, SH3: 4.1 vs 9.2, Titin: 7.5 vs 8.1, Tnfn3: 5.3 vs 8.1 kcal/mol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref072">72</xref>].</p>
<p>On the other hand, we did note that there was a significant, and unexpected, correlation between the population of the final folded or misfolded states and the <italic>stability</italic> Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> of the corresponding intermediate. Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the folded stability Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> of the intermediate structure and the frequency of folded/misfolded states were 0.63, 0.94, 0.74, 0.81, 0.86 for the SH3, PDZ, TNfn3, SH2 and Titin I27 domains respectively. We note that there is also a reasonable correspondence between the relative stabilities of circular permutants in simulation and experiment, where data are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref026">26</xref>]. How can the correlation with stabilities rather than folding rates of the isolated domains be understood? The resolution lies in the difference between the folding to either type of intermediate represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g001">Fig 1</xref>, and folding of the single domain “models” for these species, namely that the intermediates fold <italic>in the context of the full sequence</italic>. This is important because a large fraction of native (or native-like) contacts are shared between the native fold and the various misfolded domains. As such, the native and misfolded states can be considered as belonging to the same folding funnel, with differentiation between the two occurring at a late stage of folding. This scenario is illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g006">Fig 6</xref>, in which folding to either a state with one native domain folded (on left), or one possible domain-swapped misfolded intermediate (on right) are considered. The states of the proteins are represented by very coarse-grained contact maps (e.g. representing contacts between pairs of <italic>β</italic>-strands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref073">73</xref>], rather than between residues). As can be seen, dividing this funnel into the separate funnels by considering only native contacts for the native or circularly permuted fold would be misleading (green and red funnels respectively), since the two funnels share several configurations, and many of their states can be converted to one in the other funnel by flipping a single coarse-grained “residue” between folded and unfolded states.</p>

<p>We can see this explicitly by plotting some representative folding transition paths from the Src SH3 dimer simulations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g007">Fig 7</xref> top row, we show a folding event for a simulation which forms a native fold (at the N-terminus), and in the bottom row, for a simulation which forms a circularly permuted central domain with <italic>K</italic> = 18. Each event is projected onto two different reaction coordinates,<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>K</italic></sub>, for <italic>K</italic> = 0 (standard native <italic>Q</italic>) and <italic>K</italic> = 18 (the <italic>Q</italic> when the circular permutant for <italic>K</italic> = 18 is considered as “native”). As is evident, a large fraction of the transition path looks very similar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g007">Fig 7b and 7d</xref>, with contacts that could be considered equally as native-like or central domain-like being formed initially in the lower left part of each plot. Around <italic>Q</italic><sub>0</sub> ≈ <italic>Q</italic><sub>18</sub> ≈ 0.5, the first trajectory moves toward the native structure, where it terminates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g007">Fig 7b</xref>). The second trajectory also deviates initially more toward the folded structure, but then switches back near the end to form the central domain structure instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g007">Fig 7d</xref>). A similar branching of folding pathways has also been proposed in a recent computational study of domain swapped dimer formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref074">74</xref>].</p>

<p>The common funnel picture helps to explain why the stability of the isolated native or circular permutant domains may be correlated with their frequency of formation in the context of the full length sequence in which either could potentially be formed. Initially, nucleation of folding could occur by formation of native contacts anywhere in the sequence. Indeed, they are most likely to form near the centre of the chain. However, as more native/native-like structure is accumulated, the nascent, partially folded protein will be biased to form the contacts leading to the lower free energy structure, and so the folding nucleus is likely to move towards one of the termini of the protein. We note that while a previous study suggested that the stability of the individual domains might be affected by conjugation to another folded domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref075">75</xref>], this is unlikely to be relevant because in our case the misfolding is controlled by formation of the first domain, while the second domain is still unfolded.</p>
<p>Further insight into how the above free energy bias influences the outcome of the folding kinetics can be obtained by considering the progressive formation of folded structure.

<title>Ising-like theoretical model</title>
<p>The results from the previous sections show that the misfolding propensity is highly correlated with the the stability of the isolated native domain and its circular permutants. To further explain how this might occur, we investigate the dependence of the misfolding propensity on the stability of the central domain in the context of full sequence (dimeric tandem). We have constructed an even simpler simulation model for formation of the first intermediate (native, or circularly permuted), by using a simulation of a Wako-Saito-Muñoz-Eaton Ising-like model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref076">76</xref>]. In the version we consider here, each residue is considered either to be folded or unfolded, so that each configuration can be described as a binary string. Furthermore, we impose the single-sequence approximation, namely that all native-like structure forms in a single segment of contiguous residues. We also restrict the number of folded residues to be at most one half of the dimer sequence length, so that only a single folded or misfolded domain can form, the aspect we are most interested in. To model the stability difference between native and circularly permuted domains, we introduce an additional energy penalty <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> for any folded segment which crosses the midpoint of the dimer sequence. Such a folded segment must be forming a circular permutant misfold and as such will incur some additional “strain” energy from joining the termini of the original fold.</p>
<p>We show results from a typical Monte Carlo trajectory for this model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g009">Fig 9</xref>.

<title>Predicting circular permutant stability using alchemical free energy method</title>
<p>Knowing that misfolding correlates with the relative stability of the native single domain and its circular permutants is useful because it suggests a means to predict the likelihood of misfolding, provided one has an estimate of the circular permutant stability. While one could attempt to determine this experimentally, by synthesizing the circular permutants, or computationally, as we have done, it would be very helpful to have a quick method to estimate this stability <italic>a priori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref077">77</xref>]. Here, we have developed such a method, based on an alchemical transformation from the native to the domain-swapped misfolded state: the overall conversion between the native and circular permutant can be expressed as the sum of the free energy changes of two steps as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g010">Fig 10</xref>: firstly, joining the N- and C- termini of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g010">Fig 10a</xref>) to form a cyclic intermediate state (I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g010">Fig 10b</xref>), in which procedure the free energy change is (Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>J</sub>). Note that this step is the same for all circular permutant folds. The second step is to cut different loops on the cyclic configuration I to form a circular permutant CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g010">Fig 10c</xref>) with the change of free energy (Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>C</sub>):</p>

<p>For the first step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g010">Fig 10a and 10b</xref>), in order to join the two termini, they must be sufficiently close. In general, bringing them closer together will require peeling off a small part of the native structure, starting from the termini. If we imagine that all of the structure between residues <italic>i</italic> at the N-terminus and <italic>j</italic> at the C-terminus remains native, then the change in free energy for linking the termini for cyclization, Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>J</sub>, can be split into energetic and entropic components:

The topological requirement of joining the two termini by peeling off residues 1 to <italic>i</italic> − 1, and <italic>j</italic> + 1 to L from the native state is that the linear distance between the residues <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> (<italic>d</italic>(<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>,<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>)) on the native structure is shorter than the effective length contributed by the joint parts:

Therefore, an offset number M = 6 is used in this case.

The free energy cost of cutting the loop (Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>c</sub>) is relatively small and is similar for all the circular permutants during the transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of linker length</title>
<p>From the alchemical method we can see that the difference of stability ΔΔ<italic>G</italic> largely depends on the native contacts that are broken in the procedure when joining the N- and C- termini. However, ΔΔ<italic>G</italic> could also be lowered by extending the linkers between domains, for instance, by adding extra residues at the two termini. If the loop formed by the linker is long enough, fewer native contacts will need to be disrupted, so that the circular permutant folds would be more stable. Therefore we have investigated the stability of circular permutant folds as a function of the length of C-terminal extension, by adding Gly-Ser repeats (forming no native contacts). This extra peptide corresponds to the linker between the tandem domains. The stability of circular permutants, obtained from simulations using umbrella sampling, as a function of linker length (<italic>ll</italic>) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g012">Fig 12</xref> (raw potentials of mean force on <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>K</italic></sub> in Figs C and D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004933.s001">S1 Text</xref>). As expected, longer linkers between the tandem repeats give more stable circular permutants. The relative change from <italic>ll</italic> = 0 to <italic>ll</italic> = 20 is roughly the same for all circular permutants of a given protein, as expected since the change in all cases is the same loop extension. Note, however, that the effect is much larger for ubiquitin than for TNfn3. To investigate the consequences of the change of central domain stability for the misfolding propensity of tandem repeats, we carried out first passage simulations of a tandem dimer of Ubiquitin with linker lengths of 5,8 and 10 residues respectively. The setup of the dimer simulations was the same previously. For each linker length, 1024 independent simulations were run from fully extended structures. No domain-swapped misfolding was found for <italic>ll</italic> = 5 and <italic>ll</italic> = 10, however, we indeed obtained three domain-swapped misfolding events for <italic>ll</italic> = 8. Two of the misfolds belong to the <italic>K</italic> = 61 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g012">Fig 12a</xref>) type and the other one is <italic>K</italic> = 36 type domain-swapping. As one can see from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g012">Fig 12a</xref>, the circular permutants <italic>K</italic> = 36 and <italic>K</italic> = 61 are the ones which are most stable with <italic>ll</italic> = 8. However, they are still somewhat unstable, explaining the small fraction of misfolded states obtained. In this case it is clear that the length of the linker between the termini of ubiquitin is one way in which domain-swapped misfolding is avoided in this protein: since ubiquitin is synthesized initially as an N-C linked polyubiquitin chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref040">40</xref>], it is essential to avoid such misfolding, given the importance of this protein to cellular homeostasis. It should be noted though that the influence of the linker depends very much on the protein, as might be expected, from the much smaller effect on the stability of circular permutants of TNfn3 than those of ubiquitin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004933.g012">Fig 12</xref>. In experiments on titin I27, the misfolded population was, within error, the same with and without the addition of a four residue RSEL linker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref007">7</xref>].</p>

<p>Lastly, we comment briefly on the effect of linker composition. Although we treat the linkers as structureless chains, not forming native contacts, there may be some effect of linker flexibility, arising from the backbone dihedral potential in our model. To test for this effect, we have carried out an additional 1024 independent simulations with the dimeric tandem repeat of the SH3 domain using a different four residue linker composition, GGGG, rather than the original DETG, as used in the original circular permutant studies by Serrano <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref026">26</xref>]. With the new linker GGGG, the observed misfolded populations are 94.3%, 1.3%, 2.3% and 2.1% for K = 0, 18, 37 and 46 respectively. The differences are not statistically significant compared to the results with the original linker.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have investigated the factors which favour formation of domain-swapped misfolded states in multidomain proteins, by building on knowledge of the folding/misfolding mechanism. Counter to our original expectations, the misfolding yield does not depend primarily on the relative folding rates of the native single-domain protein and its circular permutants, representing intermediates for correct folding and misfolding respectively. Although the folding rates of wild-type and circular permutants may often be quite similar, the fraction of misfolded protein is much smaller than this comparison would suggest. Instead, it appears that misfolding is correlated with the stability of the native single-domain protein relative to its circular permutants. This can be understood because the rate of formation of the first intermediate (native-like or misfolded) occurs in the background of the full-length sequence. In this context, while folding may be initiated at any point in the chain, the nascent structure will tend to migrate towards the N- or C-terminus because of the free energy bias towards the native fold; circular permutants invariably pay a cost in stability for joining the protein termini. Thus the folding rate of isolated circular permutants relative to wild-type protein may not be a good proxy for these rates in the context of the full length sequence, whilst the domain stability is a better guide as to the free energy bias towards a particular structure. This suggests that the rates of formation of these domains inferred from single-molecule experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004933.ref012">12</xref>] should be interpreted as the rates in the context of the full length sequence. In our analysis, we have neglected the effect of back-reactions. Since these occurred rarely in the simulations, they were not needed to explain the results. We have also quantified the effect of linker length on domain swapping, finding that sufficiently long linkers can permit misfolded species to form in cases where they did not for the native spacing. Finally, we have developed a simple model for predicting the stability of misfolded intermediates (circular permutants of native), which should prove useful for determining whether a given protein may be susceptible to this type of misfolding.</p>
