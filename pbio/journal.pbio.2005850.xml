<abstract>
<p>Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) regulatory T (Treg)-cell function is controlled by environmental cues of which cytokine-mediated signaling is a dominant component. In vivo, interleukin-4 (IL-4)-mediated signaling via IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) mediates Treg cell transdifferentiation into ex-Foxp3 T helper 2 (Th2) or T helper 17 (Th17) cells. However, IL-4-mediated signaling also reinforces the Foxp3 Treg compartment in vitro. We generated Foxp3-specific IL-4Rα-deficient mice and demonstrated differential efficiency of IL-4Rα deletion in male (approximately 90%) and female (approximately 40%) animals, because of cyclic recombinase (Cre)-mediated X-linked <italic>foxp3</italic> inactivation. Irrespective of the degree of IL-4Rα deletion within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population, mice showed exacerbation of immune effector responses with aggravated tissue pathology in tissue-dwelling helminth infections (<italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> or <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>). Mechanistically, IL-4Rα deletion in males and females led to a reduced expression of Foxp3 and subsequently an impaired accumulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to inflamed tissues. In-depth cellular typing by flow cytometry revealed that the impairment of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling during helminth infections decreased the ability of central Treg cells to convert into effector Treg (eTreg) cells and caused a significant down-regulation of markers associated with Treg cell migration (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 [CXCR3]) and accumulation in inflamed tissues (GATA binding protein 3 [GATA3]) as well as survival (B cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl-2]). These findings unprecedentedly, to our knowledge, uncover a role for IL-4Rα signaling in the positive regulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell function in vivo. Complementing our past knowledge on a widely reported role for IL-4Rα signaling in the negative regulation and transdifferentiation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in vivo, our present findings reveal the host requirement for an intact, but not reduced or potentiated, IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to optimally control inflammation during helminth infections.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Host soluble mediators such as cytokines play a key role in the regulation of the immune response. Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) regulatory T (Treg) cells, which are involved in maintaining self-tolerance and immune system homeostasis, are influenced by cytokines, including interleukin-4 (IL-4). However, opposing reports have emerged on the effect of this cytokine on Treg cells. Some evidence suggests IL-4 inhibits Treg cells, whereas other studies indicate a supportive role for this cytokine in Treg cell biology and function. To unambiguously address this question, we generated mice with IL-4 receptor specifically removed from the Treg cell population. Our newly generated mice did not show any sign of spontaneous inflammation during homeostasis, but when challenged with an experimental infection by parasitic worms, deletion of the IL-4 receptor from the Treg cell population led to increased inflammation and aggravated tissue pathology. Several defects such as poor activation, reduced promigratory marker expression, and reduced survival were apparent in Treg cells with impaired IL-4 responsiveness. Our evidence presents a strong case for a supportive role of IL-4 via IL-4 receptor in the biology and optimal regulatory function of Treg cells during worm infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulatory T (Treg) cells, the central component in the regulation of the immune system, play a pivotal role in the maintenance of self-tolerance and immune homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref001">1</xref>]. Research on the molecular bases of Treg cells’ function has revealed the X-linked transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) as uniquely expressed in Treg cells. How Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells are regulated is a critical question yet to be fully explored. Growing evidence has established that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell function is greatly affected by the integrity of their receptors and the cytokines available in the milieu. Our knowledge of the intricacies of such regulation has now considerably expanded.</p>
<p>Cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-15 (IL-15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref004">4</xref>], interferon gamma (IFN-γ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref006">6</xref>], interleukin-12 (IL-12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref007">7</xref>], interleukin-6 (IL-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref009">9</xref>], and interleukin-4 (IL-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref015">15</xref>] have been reported to provide critical signals in the modulation of Treg cells’ development and function. IL-4, the canonical cytokine defining Type 2 immune responses, signals through the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) to mitigate Treg cell function during Type 2 diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref017">17</xref>]. Recent reports have shown that augmentation of IL-4Rα signaling through gain-of-function mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref015">15</xref>] or chronic Type 2 inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref018">18</xref>] leads to a drastic reduction in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population and impairment of Treg cell suppressive function, which in turn drive their reprogramming toward T helper 2 (Th2)-like or T helper 17 (Th17)-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref018">18</xref>], favoring the notion of an inhibitory role for this receptor in Treg cell function. However, treatment of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)<sup>+</sup> cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25)<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in vitro with IL-4 has been shown to have an antiapoptotic role, an augmentation of the rate of Foxp3 expression, and potentiation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell suppressive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref010">10</xref>], suggesting an unappreciated supporting role for IL-4Rα-mediated signaling in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell function in vitro yet to be validated in vivo.</p>
<p>In the present study, we show that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in secondary lymphoid organs constitutively express IL-4Rα and up-regulate the receptor expression upon <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> (<italic>Sm</italic>) infection. We provide evidence that either 40% or 90% of deletion of the IL-4 receptor specifically within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population leads to aggravated tissue inflammation during helminth infections (<italic>Sm</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> [<italic>Nb</italic>] infections) and that this occurs as a result of a weakened Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment paralleled by an uncontrolled effector T-cell compartment. Adding to previous reports that have defined a restraining role for IL-4Rα on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in vivo, we now present complementary evidence indicating that this receptor is equally needed, in full, in vivo for Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell ability to control inflammation during helminth infections.</p>

<p>IL-4Rα-mediated signaling and associated factors critically mediating the function of Th2 cells were recently shown to play an important role in controlling Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref020">20</xref>].

<title>Generation and characterization of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> BALB/c mice</title>
<p>To better dissect the role of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, we generated a murine model, termed Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup>, with a specific cyclic recombinase (Cre)-mediated deletion of the <italic>il-4rα</italic> gene in Foxp3-expressing cells.

<p>To assess the functional impairment of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in our newly generated model, pooled spleen and MLN cells of naïve male and female Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice and their littermate controls were cultured with or without recombinant IL-4 (rIL-4) for 40 hr and/or 1 hr, and then, levels of IL-4Rα surface expression and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) phosphorylation were measured by flow cytometry, respectively. CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells from Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice and their littermate control had a comparable level of IL-4Rα expression, as determined by IL-4Rα geometric mean fluorescence intensity (GMFI), after the addition of rIL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g002">Fig 2J and 2K</xref>). In agreement, no major differences in the level of phosphorylated STAT6 (p-STAT6) either at baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>) or after rIL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s003">S2A Fig and S2C–1E</xref>) in both populations (CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells) were noted between Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice and their littermate controls. In contrast, a proportion of rIL-4-stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells derived from Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice were significantly impaired in their ability to up-regulate IL-4Rα expression compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells derived from their littermate control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g002">Fig 2J and 2K</xref>). In support, STAT6 phosphorylation upon rIL-4 stimulation in CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice was significantly higher compared to Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s003">S2A and S2C Fig</xref>), indicating that the IL-4Rα signaling pathway on CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells is impaired in our Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice. Of interest, we noted that at baseline, male mice do have a higher level of p-STAT6 when compared to female mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s003">S2B Fig</xref>). In our Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice, even though the increase in STAT6 phosphorylation upon rIL-4 stimulation in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment was higher in female mice than males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s003">S2D and S2E Fig</xref>) because of the differential deletion of <italic>il4ra</italic> gene on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, the initial higher level of p-STAT6 noticed in male mice brought the absolute final level of p-STAT6 in male and female mice to a comparable level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s003">S2C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results reveal that IL-4Rα is specifically deleted on CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice either partially (approximately 40% in females) or quasi-completely (approximately 90% in males), resulting—in both cases—in a significant impairment of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling in the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population.</p>

<title>Impairment of IL-4Rα within Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells neither alters Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment nor breaks tolerance under a steady state</title>
<p>Equipped with the aforementioned murine model, we first interrogated the need for Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to express IL-4Rα expression under a steady state in vivo. Naïve Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice and littermate control, IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice, were examined for alteration of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartments, overall tissue pathologies, and tissue cellularities.

<p>Mice with a Treg cell–specific deletion of GATA3, a transcription factor closely associated with IL-4Rα-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref024">24</xref>], have been shown to develop a spontaneous inflammatory disorder with an increased release of inflammatory soluble mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref025">25</xref>]. To address whether the deletion of IL-4Rα within Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells would also instruct a spontaneous and perhaps more subtle inflammatory response in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice, serum levels of soluble inflammatory mediators and liver enzymes and cytokine production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were determined. Serum levels of IL-4, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), immunoglobulin E (IgE; Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g003">3L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s004">S3J</xref>), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g003">3M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s004">S3K</xref>) in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice were similar to those of littermate controls. All CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell–derived cytokines tested were also similar between Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice and littermate controls (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g003">3N and 3O</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s004">S3L</xref>). Collectively, these results show that in vivo under a steady state, impairment of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment neither alters Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartments nor results in spontaneous inflammatory disorder in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice.</p>
<p>To further address the molecular basis of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells’ need to express IL-4Rα signaling, we assessed the in vitro Foxp3 Treg conversion and expansion capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>−</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> cells from Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice, respectively, in comparison with CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>−</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> cells from IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> littermate controls. CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>−</sup> T cells were sorted with 99.8% purity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s005">S4A Fig</xref>) from naïve Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice and their IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> littermate controls. Sorted cells were cultured in the presence of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in combination with T-cell receptor stimulation using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 72 hr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s005">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>), which are known to induce conversion from CD25-negative to CD25-positive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref026">26</xref>]. In our cultures, CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>−</sup> T cells converted to CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells (induced Treg [iTreg] cells), with the highest rate of conversion recorded from CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>−</sup> T-cell cultures derived from Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s005">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). This suggests that IL-4Rα signaling on CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>−</sup> T cells might interfere with their ability to convert but is clearly not needed to promote their differentiation into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell in vitro.</p>
<p>Next, we measured the effect of IL-4 stimulation on Treg cells. To do so, CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells, sorted from naïve Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice and their littermate control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s005">S4A Fig</xref>), were cultured in the presence or absence of rIL-4 for 18 or 36 hr. Whereas IL-4 treatment enhanced the survival of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells from control mice, the survival of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells from Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice remained unaltered following treatment with rIL-4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s005">S4D Fig</xref>). These results suggest that IL-4/IL-4Rα signaling promotes CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cell survival in vitro and that this process is abrogated in CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells from Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice. Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells derived from IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice considerably expanded Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells’ frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s005">S4E Fig</xref>) and expression level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s005">S4F and S4G Fig</xref>) in response to in vitro stimulation with rIL-4, whereas CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells from Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice failed to do so. Taken together, these data indicate that even though IL-4Rα-mediated signaling negatively influences the ability of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>−</sup> Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells to convert into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, this receptor, later on, promotes the survival and enhances the Foxp3 expression of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in vitro.</p>

<title>Intact IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell is required for the regulation of exacerbated immune responses</title>
<p>The strategy of probing subtle immune impairments, nonapparent during a steady state, under more inflammatory settings has previously proven to be efficient in unveiling hidden immune defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref027">27</xref>]. Moreover, the aforementioned enhancement of survival and Foxp3 expression of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells upon induction of IL-4/IL-4Rα-mediated signaling in vitro and the striking higher expression of IL-4Rα by Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells observed during infection warranted us to further address the possible higher need for this receptor by Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, in vivo, during inflammatory disease conditions. To do so, IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup>, Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup>, and IL-4Rα<sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected with <italic>Sm</italic> cercariae and euthanized 8 wk thereafter. Deletion of <italic>il-4rα</italic> within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population was confirmed at the genomic level by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and at the protein level by flow cytometry (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5A and S5B</xref>), at which specific deletion of IL-4Rα on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells (more efficient in males, when compared to females), but not on CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, was observed. Flow cytometry analysis of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells within the <italic>Sm</italic>-diseased livers showed significant reduction of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell infiltration into the liver of <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> when compared to their littermate controls (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5C</xref>). Furthermore, we noted that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in the liver of <italic>Sm-</italic>infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice had a significant reduction in the expression levels of Foxp3 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5D</xref>). This suggests that IL-4Rα signaling seems to be necessary for the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell in order to maintain or up-regulate its expression of the suppressive marker Foxp3 in vivo during inflammation. Deletion of IL-4Rα signaling on Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice resulted in elevated cytokine production, including Type 1 (IFN-γ), Type 17 (interleukin-17 [IL-17]), and Type 2 (IL-4, interleukin-5 [IL-5], interleukin-10 [IL-10], interleukin-13 [IL-13]) cytokines in the liver of both male and female <italic>Sm-</italic>infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5E</xref>). These suggest that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells do require IL-4/IL-4Rα-mediated signaling in vivo to suppress overshooting inflammation.</p>

<p>The analysis within the MLNs supported this conclusion. Even though the frequency of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5G</xref>) within the MLNs in <italic>Sm-</italic>infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice were similar to littermate controls at 8 wk post infection, Foxp3 surface expression level on a per-cell basis was, however, dramatically reduced in <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice compared to infected littermate controls (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5H</xref>). Reduced suppressive capacity potential was combined with increased frequency of proliferating (CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>−</sup> ki67<sup>+</sup>; Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5I</xref>) and effector (CD4<sup>+</sup> cluster of differentiation 44 [CD44]<sup>+</sup>; Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5J</xref>) T cells within the MLN of <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice, accompanied by significant increase in IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5K</xref>). Together, these findings strongly suggest that the impairment of IL-4/IL-4Rα-mediated signaling within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment diminishes Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell recruitment to affected tissues during inflammation and impairs Treg cell ability to up-regulate suppressive factor, culminating into a heightened immune activation.</p>
<p>We next questioned the nature of the heightened immune response observed during inflammation in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice. To do so, MLN cells from <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice and littermate controls were probed for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell–expressing GATA3 as a marker of Th2 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref024">24</xref>], T-box transcription factor (T-bet) as a marker of T helper 1 (Th1) responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref028">28</xref>], RAR-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγt) as a marker of Th17 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref029">29</xref>], and B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) as a marker of T follicular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref031">31</xref>]. Consistent with the Th2 hegemony that is characteristic of <italic>Sm</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref032">32</xref>], MLN CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice overexpressed GATA3 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4N</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s007">S6A</xref>); however, all other T-cell polarization markers remained unaltered compared to littermate control (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4N</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s007">S6A</xref>). Of importance, CD4<sup>+</sup> GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3)<sup>+</sup> cells from <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice produced more IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 compared to littermate controls (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4O</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s007">S6B</xref>). Together, these suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup> GATA3<sup>+</sup> responses likely drive the heightened immune response and the elevated cytokine production observed in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice during inflammation. Nevertheless, with the recent description of ex-Foxp3 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref018">18</xref>], this observation could be confounded by the likelihood of cytokine production by newly formed ex-Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells dually expressing GATA3 and Foxp3 and releasing cytokines following deletion of IL-4Rα. To address that, we traced back the source of the produced cytokines during <italic>Sm</italic> infection by co-staining of intracellular cytokines and Foxp3 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We observed that CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells did not produce more cytokines in the MLN of <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4P</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5N</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s007">S6B</xref>), ruling out a role for Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the heightened cytokine production observed in <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice. Collectively, we conclude that the heightened immune response observed—which is due to impairment of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment in <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice—is driven at least in part by CD4<sup>+</sup> GATA3<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>−</sup> but not Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

<title>Deletion of IL-4Rα within Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population impairs their ability to control tissue inflammation in diseases</title>
<p>To further appraise the consequences of the heightened immune responses observed in diseased <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice, egg-driven fibrogranulomatous inflammation, as well as Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells’ infiltration in the liver of <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice, was microscopically assessed in comparison with that of <italic>Sm-</italic>infected littermate controls. We noted that <italic>Sm</italic> infection resulted in enlarged egg-driven granulomas in the liver of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice when compared to granulomas in the liver of their littermate control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). In agreement with this observation, we found that the average number of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells within egg-driven granulomas in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice was significantly reduced when compared to the amount of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells recruited to the liver of littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). Furthermore, collagen levels, attesting the degree of tissue fibrosis, were considerably higher in the livers of <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice when compared to the levels reported in <italic>Sm</italic>-infected littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Indeed, colorimetric measurement of 4-hydroxyproline, a direct product of acid hydrolysis of collagen, confirmed our observed increased level of collagen in the liver of <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g004">4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s006">S5F</xref>). In fact, with similar egg burdens in the guts and livers of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice and their littermate control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g005">Fig 5G</xref>), <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice still displayed much larger coalescing granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g005">Fig 5H</xref>), as indicated by hematoxylin–eosin (HE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and chromotrope aniline blue (CAB) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).

<p>Since Cre expression can generate a phenotype of its own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref039">39</xref>], we sought to address whether the uncontrolled immune responses and the exaggerated fibrogranulomatous inflammation noted in the <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice were due to the specific deletion of IL-4Rα on the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells or were an artefact effect from the Cre transgene alone. To test that, IL-4Rα<sup>+/+</sup> and Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>+/+</sup> mice were infected with 100 <italic>Sm</italic> cercariae, and then, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartments and fibrogranulomatous inflammation in liver and gut were investigated 8 wk post infection. We noted that IL-4Rα expression on either CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s008">S7A Fig</xref>) in <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>+/+</sup> mice was similar to littermate controls. Furthermore, in liver, the frequency of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s008">S7B and S7C Fig</xref>) and level of Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s008">S7D and S7E Fig</xref>) as well as GATA3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s008">S7F and S7G Fig</xref>) expression within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment in <italic>Sm-</italic>infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>+/+</sup> mice were similar or slightly affected when compared to their infected littermate controls. The similar frequency of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s008">S7H and S7I Fig</xref>), as well as the comparable level of Foxp3 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s008">S7J and S7K Fig</xref>), was also noted in the MLN of <italic>Sm</italic>-diseased mice. In fact, Cre transgene expression in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>+/+</sup> mice led to neither an expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> GATA3<sup>+</sup> T-cell population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s008">S7L Fig</xref>) nor uncontrolled Type 1 (IFN-γ), Type 17 (IL-17), or Type 2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) cytokine production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s008">S7M Fig</xref>). In agreement with these observations, we found that Cre expression did not affect either liver granuloma size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s009">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>) or hepatic fibrosis, as indicated by CAB staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s009">S8C Fig</xref>) and colorimetric measurement of 4-hydroxyproline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s009">S8D Fig</xref>). Similar to the liver, gut tissues of <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>+/+</sup> mice had a comparable granuloma size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s009">S8E Fig</xref>), similar collagen deposition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s009">S8F Fig</xref>), and a similar level of 4-hydroxyproline content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s009">S8G Fig</xref>) when compared to their infected littermate controls, indicating that Cre transgene, in our mouse model, does not have any impact on either the immune responses or the tissue inflammation.</p>
<p>Taken together, these observations indicate that the impairment of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling, but not the Cre transgene expression, specifically within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment during experimental schistosomiasis drives a poor accumulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the inflamed tissues and consequently results in elevated host fibrogranulomatous responses around the trapped parasite eggs.</p>
<p>We next aimed to test whether this would also hold true in another inflammatory helminth disease model. We found that following subcutaneous infection of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> and IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> littermate control mice with <italic>Nb</italic>, the airways of <italic>Nb</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice showed much heavier mucus production 9 d post infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s010">S9A and S9B Fig</xref>). Moreover, we noted that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells’ recruitment to the inner layer of the alveoli of the lungs of <italic>Nb-</italic>infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s010">S9C and S9D Fig</xref>) was diminished, indicating that in this model as well the impairment of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment impairs their ability to accumulate at the inflamed tissue and to control local tissue inflammation. Collectively, these results clearly suggest, in two different and major inflammatory helminth models, that impairment of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment leads to uncontrolled immune responses and exacerbated tissue(s) inflammation, underscoring a hitherto-unappreciated role of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to control inflammatory responses in vivo.</p>

<title>IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell is required for the generation of potent effector Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg (eTreg) cell population</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the mechanisms underpinning the poor ability of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to accumulate in the inflamed tissues in our diseased Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice. First, we assessed the effect of IL-4Rα deletion specifically on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment for its ability to build up the eTreg cells needed to contain the immune responses at the site of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref040">40</xref>]. To address that, central Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg (cTreg) cell and eTreg cell populations in hepatic lymph nodes (hLNs) and MLNs of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice infected with <italic>Sm</italic> for 8 wk were assessed in comparison to those of <italic>Sm-</italic>infected littermate controls. In both lymph nodes, deletion of IL-4Rα specifically on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells resulted in the accumulation of cTreg cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g006">6A and 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s011">S10A</xref>), which was associated with a significant reduction in the pool of eTreg cell population (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g006">6A and 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s011">S10B</xref>), indicating that IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells could be playing a role in inducing the conversion of cTreg cell to eTreg cell. Furthermore, the ability of these eTreg cells to maintain or up-regulate the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), a chemoattractant receptor required for the migration of eTreg cells to nonlymphoid tissues (in particular, liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref041">41</xref>]), was significantly impaired in both hLNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>) and MLNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s011">S10C and S10D Fig</xref>) of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice infected with <italic>Sm</italic> for 8 wk. In support, the expression level of GATA3, a transcription factor required for Treg cell accumulation at the site of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref042">42</xref>], within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell in the liver of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice infected with <italic>Sm</italic> for 8 wk was diminished when compared to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g006">Fig 6F and 6G</xref>). Together, these results suggest that IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell is required for the maintenance or up-regulation of the markers required for migration and accumulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell in the inflamed tissue.</p>

<p>Then, we traced back whether the reduction in the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population in the liver of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice infected with <italic>Sm</italic> for 8 wk was due to a global defect in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells or in the Treg cell de novo conversion in vivo, since eTreg cell can be thymic-derived and/or peripherally induced. To address that, we analyzed the thymic-derived Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells (Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Helios<sup>+</sup> Treg cells) and the peripherally iTreg cells (Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Helios<sup>−</sup> Treg cells) in the liver of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice infected with <italic>Sm</italic> for 8 wk and their littermate controls. We noted that in the liver of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice infected with <italic>Sm</italic> for 8 wk, both Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Helios<sup>+</sup> and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Helios<sup>−</sup> Treg cells were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g006">Fig 6H and 6I</xref>), suggesting a global defect in the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population.</p>
<p>Finally, inasmuch as the reduction of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population was independent of its proliferation as Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in the liver of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice infected with <italic>Sm</italic> for 8 wk and their littermate control had a comparable expression level of Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g006">Fig 6J and 6K</xref>), we therefore asked whether the reduction of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population in the liver could be possibly driven, in addition to their poor migration and accumulation, by the lessened ability of these Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to survive in the absence of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling. Indeed, we noted a diminished expression level of the pro-survival factor B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g006">Fig 6L and 6M</xref>) within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population in the liver of the Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice infected with <italic>Sm</italic> for 8 wk when compared to their littermate control. In support, those Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population had a higher expression level of the apoptotic marker caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g006">Fig 6N and 6O</xref>) as well as the fixable viability stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g006">Fig 6P and 6Q</xref>), indicating that the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population in the liver has a higher propensity to undergo apoptosis in the absence of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling, which recapitulates our in vitro data mentioned earlier. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-4Rα-mediated signaling is required for the conversion of cTreg cells into eTreg cells. These eTreg cells further need the IL-4Rα-mediated signaling to maintain or up-regulate markers required for their migration, accumulation, and survival at the site of inflammation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell function have uncovered a critical regulatory role for the cytokines present in the milieu (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref009">9</xref>]). IL-4, the canonical cytokine of Type 2 immune responses that signals via IL-4Rα, signaling on Treg cells has been shown to promote Treg cell reprogramming toward Th17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref015">15</xref>] or Th2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref018">18</xref>] cells. As a consequence, enhanced signaling via IL-4Rα in Treg cells has resulted in impaired suppressive function and heightened inflammation, establishing the concept of a negative regulation of Treg cell activity by IL-4Rα-mediated signaling. The present study, however, shows that IL-4Rα-mediated signaling is also required by Treg cells to control inflammation in diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005850.g007">Fig 7</xref>). First, in an experimental murine model of schistosomiasis, we demonstrated that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells up-regulated IL-4Rα expression. Further analyses on the need for the host to up-regulate this receptor during schistosomiasis were then conducted using a murine model of specific deletion of IL-4Rα within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population, termed Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice. Specific removal of IL-4Rα in a part or almost totally on the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population exacerbated tissue inflammation during experimental <italic>Sm</italic>- and <italic>Nb</italic>-mediated diseases. Aggravated immunopathology was associated with a decline in Treg cell accumulation in the diseased tissues and the reduced expression of suppressive markers, paralleled by an augmentation of immune effector responses as translated in the <italic>Sm</italic> model in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice. Collectively, these findings unprecedentedly, to our knowledge, uncovered a critical need for IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to control tissue immunopathology in helminthiases. Such a need for Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells for this signaling axis is yet to be examined in allergic Th2 inflammation and Th1- or Th17-dominated diseases.</p>

</fig>
<p>Recently published reports have shown that augmentation of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells leads to an impaired suppressive activity of those cells with subsequent reprogramming into ex-Foxp3 Th2 or Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref018">18</xref>]. Although these observations would suggest that IL-4Rα signaling might not favor Treg cell activity, our present analyses revealed that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells have a basal expression level of IL-4Rα under a steady state, pointing at a possible requirement for this receptor in Treg cell biology. Our assumption is in accordance with a previous attempt by other investigators that have reported the potency of IL-4 to prevent spontaneous apoptosis and reduction of Foxp3 expression in the cultures of isolated Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref010">10</xref>]. In fact, IL-4 stimulation of isolated cultures of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in our study recapitulated such a need for IL-4Rα-mediated signaling to prevent cell death and to maintain or enhance Foxp3 expression, indicating a hitherto-unappreciated need for IL-4Rα-mediated signaling in Treg cell biology and activity. IL-4Rα expression by Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells was further enhanced following <italic>Sm</italic> infection, suggesting a strong requirement for this receptor either to preserve Treg cell activity or foster their transdifferentiation into ex-Foxp3 Th2 cells. In fact, the reprogramming of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells into functional effector ex-Foxp3 Th2 cells has now been demonstrated during <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref018">18</xref>], during which ex-Foxp3 Th2 cells generated in an IL-4Rα-dependent manner were shown to contribute to the overall antiparasitic Th2 response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref018">18</xref>]. Hence, it is possible that IL-4Rα up-regulation on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells during acute experimental schistosomiasis observed in our study could occur as an attempt for the host to rapidly mount a protective Th2 immune response during acute schistosomiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref032">32</xref>]. More experiments are clearly needed at this point to address the likelihood of such a contribution of ex-Foxp3 in the host protective Th2 response during experimental schistosomiasis.</p>
<p>IL-4Rα removal specifically from the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment was achieved by making use of the Cre-lox system. A murine model, Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup>, was obtained in which IL-4Rα was deleted specifically within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment in a dosage-dependent manner whereby IL-4Rα is partially deleted in females and quasi-completely deleted in males. The more efficient Cre-mediated IL-4Rα deletion achieved in male when compared to female Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice strongly fits the phenomenon of random inactivation of the X chromosome that can take place in females but not males, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref044">44</xref>]. Our approach herein described could therefore set a precedent for the generation of transgenic mouse models with various levels of knockdown of a target gene.</p>
<p>We found, consistent with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref010">10</xref>], that isolated cultures of CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells tightly depended on IL-4Rα for survival and maintenance of Foxp3 expression. However, partial or quasi-complete removal of IL-4Rα from the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population did not affect the Treg cell compartment during steady state. A possible explanation could be that the remnant IL-4Rα on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in our Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> model is sufficient to preserve the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment and thus tolerance during a steady state in which randomly occurring inflammatory responses are not common. This is consistent with previous studies that have attempted to define the physiological importance of factors expressed by Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells. Specifically, in these studies, Foxp3-specific GATA3- or T-bet-deficient mice were clinically indistinguishable from their littermate controls and showed no defect on the function of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells under a steady state in young mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref042">42</xref>]. In older mice (6 mo upwards), however, the targeting of GATA3 within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population led to inflammatory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref025">25</xref>]. It is therefore feasible that specific deletion of IL-4Rα from the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment might also lead to apparent physiological defects only in old mice, but this is still to be addressed experimentally. Notably, inflammation in these models of Foxp3-specific GATA3 or T-bet deletion uncovered more robustly a defect in the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment that translated into physiological impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref027">27</xref>]. Similarly, infection of our Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice resulted in elevated inflammatory responses in helminth-mediated disease models. This was defined by increased levels of Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T-cell proliferation and activation as well as a clear augmentation of cytokine production, indicating a more potent effector response following either partial or quasi-complete deletion of IL-4Rα from the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment during inflammation. It is also important to point out that we observed similarly heightened cytokine release and inflammation in diseased female Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice, in which the less efficient deletion of IL-4Rα was observed when compared to <italic>Sm</italic>-infected male Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice. The possible explanations could be that (i) disruption of the IL-4Rα signaling pathway on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells as low as 40% is enough to completely disequilibrate the inflammation–regulation balance during infection, and/or (ii) the functional characterization of males and females mice, by using STAT6 phosphorylation as a readout, demonstrated that the absolute final levels of STAT6 phosphorylation in cells from male and female Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice were comparable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005850.s002">S1C Fig</xref>), indicating that male and female Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice do have a similar defect at the functional level of the IL-4Rα signaling pathway on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population. Such observations could provide an explanation for the similar phenotype in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> female and male mice during inflammation, when elevated IL-4 is produced.</p>
<p>As of yet, the general observation of heightened inflammatory responses in diseased Foxp3-specific IL-4Rα-impaired mice could be rooted under two opposing but not mutually exclusive explanations—i.e., (i) IL-4Rα as a critical receptor in conferring to Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells the necessary potency to control inflammatory responses in disease and/or (ii) the need for this IL-4Rα receptor to foster Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells transdifferentiation into effector T cells. The former explanation does find support in our observation of a significant reduction in Foxp3 expression levels within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell population following removal of IL-4Rα from the Foxp3 compartment in <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice. In fact, Foxp3 expression is the defining factor that endows Treg cell with a suppressive ability, and its continuous expression is required to maintain the transcriptional and functional programs of Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref048">48</xref>]. Consequently, our observation of a reduced Foxp3 expression during inflammation following IL-4Rα removal on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells defines a need for this receptor in stabilizing and promoting Foxp3 expression by Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in vivo. Although the latter explanation of a negative regulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells by IL-4Rα signaling in favor of ex-Foxp3 transdifferentiation can be appropriately dismissed by using fate-reporter mice, our present study, as it stands, convincingly indicates that the T cells responsible for the increased cytokine production reported in Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> diseased mice expressed not Foxp3 but rather GATA3, a profile inconsistent with recently reported ex-Foxp3 T cells during helminth infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref018">18</xref>]. This argued against Foxp3 Treg cells’ transdifferentiation into cytokine-producing effector T cells as mediating the heightened inflammation observed in diseased Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Partial or quasi-complete removal of IL-4Rα within the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell compartment of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> diseased mice led to an impaired accumulation of Treg cells to the site of inflammation. Mechanistically, various processes can mediate such an impaired accumulation of Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> Treg cells observed in our infectious settings, including defects in (i) the extrathymic Treg cell conversion, (ii) the proliferation capacity, (iii) the generation of eTreg cells, (iv) the migration and the accumulation of eTreg cells at the site of inflammation, and/or (v) the survival of Treg cells. We found no obvious defect of CD25<sup>−</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cell precursors from Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice in converting into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in vitro, arguing against a defect in extrathymic Treg cell conversion. Ex vivo analyses of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells from diseased Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice showed no signs of impaired proliferation, dismissing Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell–defective proliferation as a possible cause of the poor accumulation reported. However, we found that cTreg cells in the lymph nodes of diseased Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice had a poor ability to convert into eTreg cells, resulting in a significant reduction in the eTreg cell population required to populate the nonlymphoid tissues that further contain the inflammatory immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref040">40</xref>]. Furthermore, migration and accumulation of these eTreg cells were impaired, as indicated by the reduction in the expression level of CXCR3 and GATA3, respectively. Our results are in full accordance with previous reports on the need of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to express GATA3 and CXCR3 to migrate and accumulate in the inflamed tissues and in the liver, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref042">42</xref>]. In addition to the reduction in the pool of eTreg cell population and their poor ability to migrate and accumulate at the site of inflammation, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in the liver of diseased Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> IL-4Rα<sup>−/lox</sup> mice had a higher propensity to undergo apoptosis, recapitulating our in vitro data, which showed that CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells’ survival and stability (as judged by Foxp3 expression) are compromised in the absence of IL-4.</p>
<p>Overall, our results support the idea that an intact, rather than a potentiated or diminished, IL-4Rα-mediated signaling is optimal to endow Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells with their most efficient ability to control inflammation in disease as illustrated here in helminthiases. As per our current findings, such an optimal response is most likely achieved by preventing Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell death and stabilizing the expression of canonical Treg cell–suppressive and associated markers such as Foxp3 and GATA3. In light of past reports that have defined a negative role for IL-4Rα-mediated signaling on Treg cell activity in Th2-dominated settings, our present finding of a negative role of IL-4Rα deficiency on Treg cells during inflammation further highlights the fact that the same cytokine can have both positive and negative effects on Treg cell activity and reinstates the notion that balance is key. Promoting or impairing IL-4Rα-mediated signaling yielded a similar result of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell impairment, therefore strongly arguing against the benefits of uninformedly modulating this cytokine receptor on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to ameliorate tolerance, particularly in the current global context where helminthiasis are highly common. This is therefore particularly important in light of recent therapeutic advances for the control of highly pathogenic cases of asthma for which IL-4Rα targeting has recently been introduced and is attracting further interest for other inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005850.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Conclusively, in this study, a case is made for the preservation of intact levels of IL-4Rα signaling on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to ensure optimal regulatory responses in vivo, and caution is therefore raised for the careful manipulation of this signaling axis in disease.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>All mice were maintained in specific-pathogen-free barrier conditions in individually ventilated cages at the University of Cape Town biosafety level 2 animal facility. Experimental mice were sex- and age-matched and used between 6 and 8 wk of age. All the experimental work was in strict accordance with the recommendations of the South African national guidelines and of the University of Cape Town practice for laboratory animal procedures, as in ethics protocols 014/003 and 016/027 approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Science, University of Cape Town. All efforts were made to minimize animals’ suffering. Prior to percutaneous infection with <italic>Sm</italic> cercariae, animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and monitored for 5 min to confirm deep anesthesia. Anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of pedal reflex (toe pinch) and eyeblink reflex amid a regular respiratory rate. The anesthesia duration was of a maximum of 30 min. During the anesthesia phase, animals were exposed to an infrared lamp to help them maintain their core body temperature. This procedure was performed and duly cared for by trained and authorized researchers. Post infection, animals were monitored until regaining of consciousness, and moistened food was added to the cage bedding. Upon reaching the study’s experimental end point and/or the protocol-defined humane end point, animals were euthanized under this study by exposure to an excess of halothane (4% in air) for 5 minutes. Death was confirmed either by neck dislocation or exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Death was not a predetermined end point in any of the arms of this study.</p>
