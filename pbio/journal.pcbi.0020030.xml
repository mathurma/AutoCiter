Uncovering the functional properties of such oscillators then becomes important for the understanding of these cellular processes and for the characterization of fundamental properties of more complex clocks. Here, we show how the dynamics of a minimal two-component oscillator is drastically affected by its genetic implementation. We consider a repressor and activator element combined in a simple logical motif. While activation is always exerted at the transcriptional level, repression is alternatively operating at the transcriptional (Design I) or post-translational (Design II) level. These designs display differences on basic oscillatory features and on their behavior with respect to molecular noise or entrainment by periodic signals. In particular, Design I induces oscillations with large activator amplitudes and arbitrarily small frequencies, and acts as an “integrator” of external stimuli, while Design II shows emergence of oscillations with finite, and less variable, frequencies and smaller amplitudes, and detects better frequency-encoded signals (“resonator”). Similar types of stimulus response are observed in neurons, and thus this work enables us to connect very different biological contexts. These dynamical principles are relevant for the characterization of the physiological roles of simple oscillator motifs, the understanding of core machineries of complex clocks, and the bio-engineering of synthetic oscillatory circuits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Periodic variations in protein abundances are at the heart of important cellular processes, with common examples being the circadian rhythms or the cell cycle. What is the molecular basis of this behavior? Recent reports showed how simple architectures, based on the interaction of a few molecular components, are capable of inducing oscillatory dynamics. These structures are also of interest for the understanding of complex cellular oscillators, as they appear to be core constituents of them. The authors carefully analyze one of these architectures and uncover how different genetic implementations of such structures strikingly influence its dynamical behavior. They consider two genetic implementations of a repressor and activator element combined in a simple logical motif. While activation is transcriptionally implemented in both cases, repression may act either transcriptionally or post-translationally. These differences in design originate drastic changes in the way oscillations are produced, in the tolerance to molecular noise, or in the circuit response to external stimuli. Similar aspects have been discussed in relation to neural dynamics; therefore this work is able to connect two very different biological scenarios. Thus, simple genetic motifs exploit not only their connectivity pattern but their design to act as information processing units within living cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Research was funded in part by the Ramón y Cajal program and DGICYT (Spain) Grant FIS2004–05072.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Guantes R, Poyatos JF (2006) Dynamical principles of two-component genetic oscillators.

This is the case, for instance, of the well-known sustained oscillations associated to circadian clocks, enzyme synthesis, or the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b001">1</xref>]. In many of these situations, oscillations are originated by the interaction of many components forming complex regulatory networks, whose main constituents are being experimentally determined.</p><p>Recently, simple oscillator architectures have been found to be involved in the regulation of seemingly unrelated biological processes. An oscillator based on a combination of positive and negative feedback loops has been shown to regulate the cell cycle of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Xenopus laevis</named-content> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b002">2</xref>]. The combination of a two-component negative feedback between Cdc2 and the anaphase-promoting complex, with a positive feedback centered on Cdc2, leads to robust oscillations. The tumor suppressor protein p53, one of the most extensively studied proteins in relation to cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b003">3</xref>], also seems to be part of a genetic oscillator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b004">4</xref>]. Single cell experiments uncovered the existence of oscillations originated by the interactions of two components, p53 itself and Mdm2—one of its major regulators. While this simple scheme only originates damped oscillations, the presence of a putative positive feedback on p53 or delays in protein production could promote undamped behavior. These findings suggested a digital, instead of analogical, action of the p53-Mdm2 system, which could function as a fail-safe mechanism to maintain low p53 levels under general physiological conditions. A third system was uncovered in the context of somite segmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b005">5</xref>] and linked to the oscillatory production of the Notch effector protein Hes1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b006">6</xref>]. These oscillations seem to be regulated by the presence of delays in a single negative feedback loop constituted by the very same protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b008">8</xref>], although a three-component negative feedback loop has been postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b006">6</xref>]. Finally, a genetic clock was discovered in relation to the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b009">9</xref>], a transcription factor that regulates several cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b010">10</xref>]. Oscillations, in this case, were associated with the interactions of proteins of the IκB family, which act as inhibitors of NF-κB. Three different isoforms of this inhibitor (IκBα, -β, and -ɛ) were revealed to contribute in distinct ways to the “decoding” of external information affecting the system. These same oscillations were later studied using time-lapse single-cell analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b011">11</xref>]. As a consequence, the NF-κB oscillator is proposed to act as a complex control module able to use period or amplitude to differentially regulate expression of target genes. Overall, these studies indicate the relevance of broadly characterizing the dynamical properties of minimal motifs.</p><p>Full understanding of the oscillatory dynamics of simple schemes is also relevant for the development of synthetic gene networks. Artificial networks can be constructed following the suggestions derived from mathematical modeling and then characterized by combining theoretical and experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b012">12</xref>]. This methodology has already been successfully applied in the case of oscillatory genetic networks. A bacterial oscillator was developed with the use of three well-known repressors linked in a daisy chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b013">13</xref>]. More recently, a combination of a positive and negative feedback constituting a two-component clock was both theoretically and experimentally characterized in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b014">14</xref>]. These two systems illustrate some of the advantages of studying basic properties of cellular oscillations in a context-independent biological setting.</p><p>Finally, the study of simple architectures can also help us identify common oscillator properties and their contribution to the dynamics and the modular assembly of more complex networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b018">18</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we focus on understanding the interplay between genetic design and the functional properties of one of these minimal logical architectures. In particular, we consider a relaxation-based oscillator combining an activator and a repressor unit operating on each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g001">1</xref>B). In order to be able to exhibit sustained oscillations, this system also requires an autocatalytic step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b019">19</xref>]. Thus, the activator is acting both on the repressor and on itself. This is not only a useful architecture to understand information processing of simple oscillators but also appears as a common core motif in unrelated biological contexts, such as the previously mentioned embryonic cell-cycle oscillator or the circadian clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b018">18</xref>]. We introduce two different genetic implementations of this scheme. Both designs largely differ in the way the onset of oscillations is produced. These differences have major implications in the oscillatory behavior, stimulus response, robustness to biochemical noise, and synchronization by a periodic signal. The contrast between both implementations should be more stressed for networks operating close to the bifurcation regime, e.g., oscillatory responses, although some of the main features persist for a broad parameter range. A prominent class of biological relaxation oscillators, where this difference in dynamics is crucial, is neurons. Neural computational properties drastically depend on the way oscillations are generated. Following these dynamical principles, neurons are generally classified as Type I or Type II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b021">21</xref>]. We are able to import some of these concepts into a completely different biological scenario.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020030-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Minimal Oscillatory Architecture and Its Genetic Implementation</title><p>(A) An activator (red) is acting on itself and on a repressor element (blue).

In Design I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), the repressor inhibits transcription of the activator in a sigmoidal way, e.g., we consider that the repressor binds to DNA as homodimer. This is a frequent biological situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b022">22</xref>], and it was recently used in the construction of a synthetic genetic clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b014">14</xref>]. In Design II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), the repressor antagonizes activator action, e.g., it acts as a protease increasing the activator degradation linearly. This design is related to previous theoretical studies of relaxation-based genetic oscillators, which were considered as valid core mechanisms of circadian clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b017">17</xref>].We can mathematically describe the deterministic dynamics of the two implementations by means of a set of differential equations. The corresponding full models describe the dynamics of the biochemical reactions associated with the activator and repressor elements, i.e., transcription, translation, promoter binding, etc. We can simplify these models by using standard quasi steady-state assumptions.</p><p content-type="flush">Design I:</p><disp-formula id="pcbi-0020030-e001"><graphic mimetype="image" position="float"

Both implementations are examples of relaxation-based oscillators. Oscillations appear when a clear separation of time scales between activator and repressor dynamics exists. This implies two conditions on the parameters: firstly, activator degradation should be stronger than the repressor one (Δ≫1), and secondly the activator translation rate should be also stronger than the repressor one (ɛ≪1, i.e., ξ<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>≪ξ<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>). The above conditions imply much faster activator dynamics, which “relaxes” the “stress” accumulated during the slow evolution of the repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b023">23</xref>].</p><p>Although both implementations share a common structure capable to generate oscillations, their dynamical behavior is drastically different. This is a direct consequence of how repression acts on each system. This difference can be understood by analyzing the associated response curves (nullclines) in the phase plane. These curves depict the equilibrium concentration of one species as a function of the other one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b023">23</xref>]. Sigmoidal repression in Design I permits the coexistence of high levels of the oscillator molecular constituents. High repressor concentration is required to actively shut off transcription of the activator. Thus, higher concentrations of both proteins are reached. This is reflected in the geometry of both nullclines which can intersect three times, i.e., there exists three equilibrium points, two of which have high concentration of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). In comparison, the linear repression in Design II implies a single equilibrium point at lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). These differences are thus a consequence of the faster repressor action in the post-translational design with respect to the transcriptional one.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020030-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Repressor and Activator Dynamics</title><p>(A and B) Shows repressor <italic>(y)</italic>, activator <italic>(x)</italic> phase plane analysis for both designs.

In a situation without oscillations, Design I shows two equilibria, one stable and one unstable, with high concentration of both proteins. A change in a system parameter can cause these equilibria to approach each other until they coalesce and disappear, giving rise to a stable limit cycle causing the oscillations (saddle-node bifurcation on an invariant circle, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In Design II, the single equilibrium point, stable when the system is not oscillating, may become unstable as a parameter changes and the system approaches a stable limit cycle (subcritical Hopf bifurcation, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Oscillatory Features</title><p>To highlight the distinct features associated with genetic design, we considered similar biochemical parameters for both implementations.

The most apparent property distinguishing both designs is the difference in period and amplitude of the oscillations. We characterized the shape of the oscillations in both cases as a function of the ratio of degradation rates, i.e., Δ, as this is one of the key parameters responsible for the different time scales between activator and repressor dynamics.</p><p>In Design I, after the saddle-node bifurcation, the period of the limit cycle can be arbitrarily large and changes appreciably with Δ. This is shown in the right inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, where the frequency of the oscillations is plotted as a function of Δ. Oscillations might emerge at almost zero frequency. In addition, the relatively long time necessary to achieve strong repression allows the presence of large concentration amplitudes in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Design II oscillations appear, however, with finite frequency and this tends to be a less variable characteristic of the system. Faster (linear) repression action prevents (in this case) large activator concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p><p>The previous features can be qualitatively understood by inspection of the response curves in a regime where the parameter Δ is close to its bifurcation value, i.e., the value where oscillations arise. Large periods in Design I appear as a consequence of a slowdown in the dynamics of the activator after reaching its maximal amplitude. This corresponds to the point in phase space where the activator and repressor response curves are tangent. These slow dynamics are a remnant or ghost of the presence of a previous stable equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b023">23</xref>]. Note that since the equilibrium is in the saturated part of the repressor-response curve, small changes in the activator (<italic>x</italic>) do not affect the equilibrium value of the repressor (<italic>y</italic>). This translates into oscillations with a broad “shoulder” of high activator and repressor concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) and consequently into large periods. On the other hand, the equilibrium point in Design II changes stability when the maximum of the activator nullcline crosses the repressor curve below its saturated regime. Therefore, dynamics at these concentration levels can not be arbitrarily delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p><p>A further noticeable difference in oscillatory behavior is the appearance of damped oscillations associated to subthreshold values of Δ. This is seen only in the second design due to presence of a low-amplitude unstable limit cycle characteristic of subcritical Hopf bifurcations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Damped oscillations can emerge as a response to subthreshold stimuli and also play a role in aspects such as noise resistance or entrainment to external periodic signals (discussions below). Finally, sustained oscillations are found in a larger range of parameter values for Design II (system robustness, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg003">S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Stimulus Response</title><p>Transient stimulation by an external signal can induce oscillations in genetic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b011">11</xref>]. These stimulus response dynamics may also be influenced by the different genetic design. We are interested in two scenarios where the stimulus duration and pattern are important. For both cases we suppose that the oscillators are initially in the rest state, i.e., not oscillating, which could be interpreted as the state of no activity of the circuit. The stimulus is able to activate this circuit, pushing it toward the oscillatory regime, e.g., by reducing the repressor degradation.</p><p>We first studied the dynamical response to a continuous stimulus with fixed amplitude but varying length. We measured the recovery of the system as the time-lapse needed to return to its rest state after the pulse is switched off. Recovery time increases relatively proportional to pulse duration for short pulses but experiences a sudden threshold for longer ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A). This threshold is due to the presence of a stimulus long enough to trigger an oscillation, and can act as a fail-safe mechanism to avoid unwanted circuit activity, e.g., protecting the cell from high concentrations of oscillator constituent proteins such as p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b004">4</xref>]. Below this threshold, Design II shows small jumps in response associated to the presence of damped oscillations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B).</p><p>In a second scenario, we analyzed the response of genetic oscillators to different stimulation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We first apply three consecutive signal pulses with the same fixed amplitude, duration, and inter-pulse time to an inactive circuit. This short pulse train does not elicit any significant response in either of the two designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g003">3</xref>B). However, a pulse train with the very same features as before, but a larger number of constituent pulses, is “integrated” by Design I which triggers an oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). This is not the case in Design II (figure not shown). We can imagine a complementary situation. In this case, we consider the same pulse pattern as initially but with a slight change in the duration of the pulses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g003">Figure 3</xref> caption for details). Oscillations are now induced in Design II only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). In summary, Design I acts by integrating external cues, while Design II better detects the periodicity of a given signal. These two different responses have been widely discussed in the context of neurobiology. Neurons in this way can be considered as “integrators” or “resonators,” also as a consequence of the different bifurcation scenarios previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b021">21</xref>].

Relaxation-based oscillators of the type discussed here have been thought to provide such noise resistance in circadian clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b017">17</xref>]. However, stochastic dynamics appear as a required feature to perform some biological tasks. This has been recognized in several contexts such as signal amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b032">32</xref>], noise-induced oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b017">17</xref>], and bi-stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b033">33</xref>]. Ultimately, noise can originate phenotypic heterogeneity, which increases the cell adaptation to unexpected environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>We simulated the stochastic dynamics of the system under different conditions with the Gillespie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b028">28</xref>] algorithm (see Supporting Information for details and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). In all situations, we computed the coefficient of variation (CV, standard deviation/mean) of the distribution of periods and the decay time of the auto-correlation function (τ<sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, the time scale at which the periodicity of a dynamical variable is lost) for both designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b030">30</xref>] as these are appropriate measures of the variability of oscillations with respect to molecular noise.</p><p>We first studied the effects of noise due to the presence of a small number of molecules of all circuit elements. We modified these numbers by changing a parameter Ω associated with the cell volume. We can envisage two dynamical situations. In the first one, the system is in a non-oscillatory state with the parameter of interest, i.e., Δ, close to the bifurcation value where the oscillations emerge. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g004">Figure 4</xref> it is shown how CV and τ<sub><italic>c</italic></sub> change, in this case as a function of the number of activator molecules. We see how at a certain level of noise CV reaches a minimum value (τ<sub><italic>c</italic></sub> reaches a maximum), i.e., oscillations become more coherent. This is, however, not the regime with the largest amount of molecules of circuit constituents, i.e., the closest to the deterministic noiseless limit, as one could a priori expect. Such apparent paradox is related to a stochastic resonance phenomenon linked to the noise-induced oscillations. This effect is common to both designs, but it is manifested in different ways. In Design I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g004">4</xref>C), a situation with a large number of molecules reduces the presence of noise-induced oscillations. Oscillations are produced as completely uncorrelated pulses with long waiting times between them, obeying a Poissonian distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). In the opposite regime of strong noise, oscillations are easily induced but in a very irregular way.

In this case, a lower minimum in CV is seen due to the inherent higher coherence of oscillations. Variability in the range of weak noise is associated with the presence of different time scales in the system due to the subthreshold oscillations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020030-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>We can compare the previous analyses with a far-from-bifurcation scenario (shown also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Stochastic resonance is absent in this case since noise-induced oscillations do not arise. In addition, oscillations in both designs are less variable when the number of present molecules increases, as one would expect. A comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g004">4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g004">4</xref>D reveals a common trend in which Design I dynamics are more variable when the oscillator is close to its bifurcation value.</p><p>It is also interesting to analyze the effects associated with low numbers of mRNA species. To examine this contribution to stochasticity, we changed the transcription and translation rates proportionally for a fixed-system volume (Ω). In this way, we are varying the average number of mRNA molecules while keeping the protein levels unchanged. A decrease in transcription, and thus in the number of messenger molecules, is compensated by a “burst” of translational activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g005">Figure 5</xref> we plotted the variability of oscillations (CVs and τ<sub><italic>c</italic></sub>s) as a function of the mRNA molecules of the activator for both designs. We again analyzed two situations with the system within (out) the oscillatory regime. Additionally, we selected a number of molecules of all constituents that correspond to the case of maximal coherence (minimal variability) found in the previous studies (solid curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020030-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These results show that mRNA change contributes strongly to the presence of noise in the system as we obtain similar qualitative behavior by changing mRNA only, than by modifying the number of all molecular species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b026">26</xref>].

In the presence of noise, the effect of a periodic signal is hardly noticed in the CV for the distribution of periods, where only a shift of the maximum of the distribution towards the external signal period is seen for both designs.

A usual strategy would be the following: Initially, it is, of course, necessary to identify its molecular components and then characterize their general biochemical properties. Molecular and genetic experiments are later carried out to delineate the logical architecture of its interactions and thus are able to establish the connection between the structure and the function of the module. As a consequence, the identification of similar architectures in different biological contexts could lead us to assume the same functional properties without the demand to characterize experimentally these new situations. In this work, we show the relevance of going from the uncovering of such logical structures, or “molecular cartoons,” to the determination of their specific genetic designs, in order to truly understand their overall functional properties.</p><p>We introduced a simple relaxation-based module to analyze the consequences of two alternative genetic implementations on its dynamics. We show that its behavior is dramatically influenced by how the repressor is operating in the system, either sigmoidally (transcriptional repression) or linearly (post-translational repression). These designs are shown to be associated with two different mechanisms originating the onset of oscillations, which in turn determine its dynamical properties.</p><p>Both designs differ in basic oscillatory features. Repression operating at the transcriptional level induces oscillations with arbitrarily large periods, while these are smaller and less variable in the post-translational case. In this latter design, the system also exhibits damped oscillatory dynamics. Additionally, in a situation where a similar number of molecules of repressor and mRNA species are present, post-translational repression displays much lower oscillating amplitudes of the activator. These differences greatly influence the functional properties of these designs such as their stimulus response, behavior in the presence of biochemical noise, and entrainment by periodic signals.</p><p>Recent experimental reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b011">11</xref>] have discussed the possibility that certain signaling modules could be encoding information on the amplitude and period of their oscillatory response in order to regulate their transcriptional targets. We show here how these two designs show distinct use of period and amplitudes and also very different signal response to external cues. Design I acts as a signal “integrator” while Design II resonates with specific frequencies of the stimulus (a “resonator”). These behaviors determine the information- processing capabilities of these systems in a similar way to the case of neural systems.

We studied the behavior of these designs in the presence of two sources of noise, one due to the presence of a small number of molecules of their constituents and the other due to changes in translational efficiency or “translational bursting” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b026">26</xref>]. Both cases exhibit the well-known phenomenon of stochastic resonance associated with noise-induced oscillations. This means that oscillations in both systems are more coherent for intermediate levels of noise rather than in a weaker noise regime, as one could naively expect. Analyzing both systems under similar noise conditions, we see that Design II exhibits more noise resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b017">17</xref>]. We also considered a simplistic scenario to study the entrainment of both designs by periodic signals since this is relevant for natural and artificial oscillators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b034">34</xref>]. Both systems showed distinct entrainment properties. Design I becomes, however, easier to synchronize due to the presence of a ghost state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b023">23</xref>].</p><p>Understanding the functional consequences of different genetic implementations of minimal motifs emerges as an important requirement to properly classify part of the overwhelming complexity found in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020030-b036">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Numerical simulations were done using MATLAB (The Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts, United States) and Fortran codes.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020030-sg001" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.sg001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Bifurcation Diagrams</title><p>(40 KB EPS)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020030-sg002" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.sg002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Robustness Study</title><p>(71 KB EPS)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020030-sg003" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.sg003" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><title>Additional Robustness Study</title><p>(26 KB EPS)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020030-sg004" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.sg004" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><title>Signal Response</title><p>(10 KB EPS)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020030-sg005" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.sg005" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><title>Biochemical Noise Study</title><p>(118 KB EPS)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020030-sg006" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.sg006" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S6</label><caption><title>Additional Biochemical Noise Study</title><p>(22 KB EPS)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020030-sg007" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.sg007" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S7</label><caption><title>Time Series of the Reduced/Full Models</title><p>(230 KB EPS)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020030-st001" mimetype="application/x-tex" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020030.sd001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Text S1</label><caption><title>Deterministic Models Derivation, Parameter Values, and Robustness against Systems Parameters Analyses</title><p>Signal response and influence of biochemical noise and further discussions.
