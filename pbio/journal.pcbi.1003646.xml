<abstract>
<p>Estimation of immunological and microbiological diversity is vital to our understanding of infection and the immune response. For instance, what is the diversity of the T cell repertoire? These questions are partially addressed by high-throughput sequencing techniques that enable identification of immunological and microbiological “species” in a sample. Estimators of the number of unseen species are needed to estimate population diversity from sample diversity. Here we test five widely used non-parametric estimators, and develop and validate a novel method, <italic>DivE</italic>, to estimate species richness and distribution. We used three independent datasets: (i) viral populations from subjects infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1; (ii) T cell antigen receptor clonotype repertoires; and (iii) microbial data from infant faecal samples. When applied to datasets with rarefaction curves that did not plateau, existing estimators systematically increased with sample size. In contrast, <italic>DivE</italic> consistently and accurately estimated diversity for all datasets. We identify conditions that limit the application of <italic>DivE</italic>. We also show that <italic>DivE</italic> can be used to accurately estimate the underlying population frequency distribution. We have developed a novel method that is significantly more accurate than commonly used biodiversity estimators in microbiological and immunological populations.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The “unseen species problem” is ubiquitous in biology and is frequently encountered outside its original setting in population ecology. For example, the human retrovirus HTLV-1 persists within hosts in multiple, genetically identical clones of infected cells. However, the number of clones in one host is unknown; this knowledge is required for an understanding of how the virus survives despite a strong host immune response. The problem arises again in estimating the diversity of the T-cell repertoire, which influences adaptive immunity. For example, the T-cell diversity may influence the outcome of viral challenge. While there have been numerous attempts to address the unseen species problem, there is currently no consensus on how to do so in immunology and microbiology. The aim of this study was to identify a suitable method to estimate the number of species in immunological and microbiological populations. We found that five existing estimators we tested performed poorly across three data sources (HTLV-1 clonality, T cell receptor, and microbial data). We therefore developed a new estimator, <italic>DivE</italic>, which significantly outperformed the other estimators. Accurate diversity quantification allows better evaluation of the impact on immunity from factors such as ageing and infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>How can we estimate diversity from a population sample? In viral infections, the number of viral variants and their population structure inform our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and can suggest treatment strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Bimber1">[2]</xref>. In immunology, the repertoire and population structure of B cell and T cell receptor clonotypes vary with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Messaoudi1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chen1">[7]</xref>, and are intimately linked to antimicrobial protective efficacy. In the human microbiome, decreased diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota is associated with atopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Wang2">[8]</xref>, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Ott1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Seksik1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>A complete census is usually impossible and so estimators of the number of unseen “species” are required. Here we use the word “individual” to refer to a single T cell sequence read, microbial sequence read, or virus- infected cell. We use “species” to denote a class of individuals, such a T cell clonotype, bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) or viral clone. The term “species richness” denotes the number of species in the population under consideration.</p>
<p>Immunological and microbiological data differ in important respects from ecological data. First, in many immunological and microbiological populations, it may be reasonable to assume that “species” are taxonomically similar, that the spatial distribution of individuals is homogeneous, and that individuals are sampled randomly, independently and with equal probabilities. If made, these simplifying assumptions allow the extrapolation of individual-based rarefaction curves, which depict the expected number of species against the number of individuals sampled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Scheiner1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Gotelli1">[14]</xref>. However, the above assumptions are frequently violated in ecological populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Gotelli1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Fager1">[18]</xref>, where unobserved individuals may differ from observed individuals in their colour, physical size, geographical distribution, movement, variety of habitats and relationship to other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-May1">[15]</xref>, and thus remain unobserved despite substantial subsequent sampling. Second, many common assumptions about population structure are inappropriate for immunological and microbiological populations, for example that all species have equal frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Lewontin1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Arnold1">[21]</xref>, or that the functional form of the population distribution is known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Bunge1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Willmot1">[26]</xref>. We therefore consider non-parametric estimators.</p>
<p>Non-parametric estimators, such as Chao1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chao1">[27]</xref>, and the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chao2">[28]</xref>, have been proposed. ACE has been suggested to be the best current approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Gotelli1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Bunge1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chao3">[29]</xref> and is widely applied in microbiology and immunology; for example to estimate the diversity of the human gastrointestinal flora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Eckburg1">[30]</xref>, human gut metagenome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Qin1">[31]</xref>, mouse TCR repertoire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Wong1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Pacholczyk1">[33]</xref>, fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Unterseher1">[34]</xref>, and the number of HTLV-1 infected cell clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Berry1">[35]</xref>. Although they were originally intended as methods to estimate lower bounds, the Chao1 estimator, and the modified, bias-corrected form Chao1bc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chao4">[36]</xref>, have been used to make a point estimate of the number of TCR clonotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-LaGruta1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Shugay1">[38]</xref>, the number of OTUs in hepatitis C virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Wang1">[1]</xref>, parasite diversity in malaria infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Bailey1">[39]</xref> metagenome size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Frisli1">[40]</xref>, the number of integration sites of therapeutic gene therapy vectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Wang3">[41]</xref>, soil diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Schloss1">[42]</xref>, and again the number of HTLV-1 infected cell clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Berry1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Gillet1">[43]</xref>. In addition to the ACE and the Chao estimator, we also consider two additional non-parametric estimators: the Bootstrap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Smith1">[44]</xref> and Good-Turing estimators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Good1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Most diversity estimators aim to estimate the species richness in one of two populations of interest: either in the population from which the sample was drawn (e.g. number of microbial species in the gut, given a sample from the gut) or the value where the rarefaction curve saturates (e.g. number of species at the point when further sampling does not yield any new species). These definitions of the population of interest lack flexibility and may be inappropriate or poorly defined for the question in hand. Indeed, if some species are represented by a single individual, the rarefaction curve will not saturate. For many microbiological and immunological questions, an estimator that allows the user to specify the size of the population of interest is desirable. For instance, we may wish to know the T cell repertoire diversity of both the blood and the whole body.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to identify a suitable method for estimating species richness in immunological and microbiological populations. We tested widely-used estimators on samples of microbiological and immunological populations. We found these estimators performed poorly. We therefore developed and validated a new method to estimate species richness and species frequencies.</p>
<p>We used data from three independent sources: (i) viral populations from human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1)–infected subjects; (ii) T cell antigen receptor (TCR) clonotype repertoires; and, (iii) infant faecal microbial samples.</p>
<p>HTLV-1 is a retrovirus that mainly infects CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes. HTLV-1 spreads within hosts via two routes: <italic>de novo</italic> infection of uninfected cells, and proliferation of infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Overbaugh1">[46]</xref>. When an infected cell proliferates, the integrated provirus is replicated with the host genome and a clone of infected cells is generated, each cell carrying a provirus in the same genomic site. Consequently, in each host, HTLV-1 persists in many distinct infected cell clones. We used high-throughput data on the abundance of HTLV-1 infected cell clones in 14 HTLV-1 seropositive subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Gillet1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>The human gastrointestinal tract contains a densely populated ecosystem of microbes that performs a variety of functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Palmer1">[47]</xref>. We obtained high-throughput 16S rRNA sequence data from infant faecal samples. In this study we used observed frequencies of different bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Sim1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>T cells are vital to adaptive immunity. The T cell population comprises a diverse repertoire of TCR clonotypes, each defined by the DNA sequence of the expressed TCR. In humans, there are a potential 10<sup>15</sup>–10<sup>20</sup> different TCR clonotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Miles1">[49]</xref>, but the actual number of clonotypes in one person is estimated to be between 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>8</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Arstila1">[50]</xref>. In this study we used RACE-based data on TCR clonotype abundance. We studied circulating central and effector memory, naïve and total CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>Blood samples were donated by HTLV-1<sup>+</sup> subjects attending the HTLV-1 clinic at the National Centre for Human Retrovirology (Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust) at St. Mary's Hospital, London UK, with fully informed written consent. This study was approved by the UK National Research Ethics Service (NRES reference 09/H0606/106). Parents gave full written informed consent for infant faecal sample collection, and all protocols and procedures were approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee, U.K. (Southampton and South West Hampshire) (ref: 05/Q1702/119). For the TCR data, leukaphereses were performed on healthy donors who provided written informed consent at the National Institutes of Health, USA. The protocol and use of these samples for immunological investigation were approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>HTLV-1 Data Collection</title>
<p>Previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Gillet1">[43]</xref> and new high-throughput data on HTLV-1 clonality were analysed. Each HTLV-1 dataset quantifies the abundance of HTLV-1-infected T cell clones. There were 105 datasets, comprising nine samples from each of 11 subjects (three independent samples at each of three time points), and 15 samples from four subjects. All had either HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis or were asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Microbial Data Collection</title>
<p>The microbial data were derived from faecal samples obtained from 10 infants. DNA was amplified with two sets of PCR primers, generating 20 datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Sim1">[48]</xref>. Amplicons of the V3-V5 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were generated by PCR using two sets of universal primers. Sequencing data were generated using the Roche 454 GS Junior platform. Analysis was performed using the QIIME pipeline as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Sim1">[48]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>TCR Data Collection</title>
<p>A total of 16 datasets were collected from two subjects, comprising TCR sequences from four phenotypically defined subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells: naïve, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM) and total. After flow cytometric sorting and cell lysis, mRNA was extracted and subjected to a non-nested, template-switch anchored RT-PCR using a 3′ TCRB constant region primer as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Price1">[51]</xref>. This approach allows linear and unbiased amplification of all TCRs irrespective of <italic>TRBV</italic> or <italic>TRBJ</italic> gene usage. Paired-end sequencing reactions (each 150 bp) were performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. Raw FASTQ files were annotated using reference TCRB sequences from the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imgt.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.imgt.org</ext-link>) and a custom-written Java application.

<title><italic>DivE</italic> Species Richness Estimator</title>
<p>We developed a heuristic approach to estimate species richness, which we named <italic>DivE</italic> (Diversity Estimator) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To calculate the <italic>DivE</italic> estimator, many mathematical models are fitted to multiple nested subsamples of individual-based rarefaction curves. Each model is fitted to all nested subsamples, and is scored on a set of four criteria. The five best-performing models are extrapolated and their respective estimates are aggregated to produce the <italic>DivE</italic> species richness estimate. <italic>DivE</italic> requires an estimate of population size. If the species richness of a wider population is desired, the same models are used but extrapolated to a different population size; this is only justified if the two populations are similar in their spatial distribution of individuals.</p>

<p><italic>DivE</italic> fits many models to rarefaction curves (black) and subsamples thereof (orange). Data is denoted by circles; fits by solid lines.

<p>The criteria against which each model fit is scored are:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p><bold><italic>Discrepancy</italic></bold> – the mean percentage error between data points and model prediction.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold><italic>Accuracy</italic></bold> – the percentage error between the full sample species richness, and the estimate of full sample species richness from a given subsample.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold><italic>Similarity</italic></bold> – the area between the curve fitted to a subsample and the curve fitted to the full sample, normalized to the area under the curve from the full data, on the interval [0, <italic>N<sub>obs</sub></italic>], where <italic>N<sub>obs</sub></italic> is the size of the full data.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold><italic>Plausibility</italic></bold> – the predicted number of species must either increase monotonically or plateau and the predicted rate of species accumulation must either decrease or plateau (i.e. for <italic>S(x)</italic> and <italic>x≥1</italic>, where <italic>x</italic> is the number of individuals, <italic>S′(x) ≥0</italic>, and <italic>S"(x) ≤0</italic>).</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>The rationale behind each criterion is as follows:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p><bold><italic>Discrepancy</italic></bold> - the model must describe the data to which it was fitted.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold><italic>Accuracy</italic></bold> - from a subsample, the model should predict the full sample species richness.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold><italic>Similarity</italic></bold> - an ideal model will produce identical fits from all subsamples. The smaller the area between the model fits, the better the model.</p>

<p>Criteria 2), 3) and 4) are independent of the fitting process. That is, they are not constraints by which models are fitted; instead they are tests of model performance.</p>
<p>Each model fit is scored on all four criteria. For criteria 1–3, we scored a fit in multiples of empirically chosen precision levels. The precision level for criterion 1 was 0.01%: a score of 1 denotes a model fit where the mean percentage error of the residuals, ε, was less than 0.01%; a score of 2 denotes 0.01%&lt;ε≤0.02% and so on. Criteria 2 and 3 were similarly scored in multiples of 0.5%. Criterion 4 was implemented by giving a score of 500 to model fits that violated either of its conditions; this value was chosen to exceed the score of any model fit that satisfied this criterion.</p>
<p>The final score for each model is an aggregate of the scores of all model fits across subsamples and criteria, and is calculated as follows. First, the score for each criterion is defined as the mean of the scores of all subsample fits for that criterion. The final score for each model is the mean of all criteria scores. The <italic>DivE</italic> species richness estimate is the geometric mean of the estimates provided by the five best-performing (i.e. lowest-scoring) models.</p>

<p>Due to differences between estimators and between datasets, we conducted multiple, distinct evaluations and validations. We first evaluated, for each estimator, the relationship between estimated diversity and sample size, using the estimates produced from a series of successively smaller, randomly generated <italic>in silico</italic> subsamples of observed data. For the microbial and TCR data respectively, five and six equidistant subsample sizes were chosen from each observed dataset. For the HTLV-1 data, subsample sizes were chosen to be approximately equidistant; however some were removed due to runtime constraints. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s008">Table S1</xref> for further details. Second, we measured the accuracy of <italic>DivE</italic> by comparing the estimated species richness <italic>Ŝ<sub>obs</sub></italic> at the size of the full dataset <italic>N<sub>obs</sub></italic> from each subsample to the (known) species richness <italic>S<sub>obs</sub></italic> in the full data. Using the same method, we compared <italic>DivE</italic> to the second order bias-corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AIC<sub>c</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Hurvich1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Burnham1">[66]</xref>. Third, the TCR data have rarefaction curves which plateau. Using smaller subsamples of this data and making the assumption that the species richness of the full data is equal to that of the entire population, we were able to evaluate the accuracies of all estimators together. Finally for 11 of the 14 HTLV-1 patients detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s008">Table S1</xref>, three samples were taken at a single time point. For each time point, the three samples were pooled and used as a practical test of <italic>DivE</italic>'s ability to predict species richness in larger samples.</p>

<title><italic>DivE</italic> Frequency Distribution Generation Algorithm</title>
<p>In addition to species richness, we wanted to estimate the population frequency distribution. Because of the considerable structural variation between and within immunological and microbiological populations, we developed a general method which does not assume the analytical form of the population structure. This algorithm uses the <italic>DivE</italic> estimator combined with observed abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g002">Figure 2</xref>). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s012">Text S1</xref> for details. The algorithm was applied to multiple random subsamples of observed data. The estimated distributions were then compared to the full data frequency distribution using two measurements: (i) error, defined as the sum of discrepancies in species frequencies between estimated and observed (full) distributions, divided by the number of individuals in the observed distribution, i.e. error  = <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003646.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>and (ii) percentage error between the Gini coefficients of the estimated and observed distributions.

<title>Comparison of Estimators: Relationship between Sample Size and Estimated Diversity</title>
<p>Each species richness estimator (Chao1bc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chao4">[36]</xref>, Bootstrap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Smith1">[44]</xref>, ACE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chao2">[28]</xref>, Good-Turing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Good1">[45]</xref>, the negative-exponential model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Colwell1">[12]</xref> and <italic>DivE</italic>) was applied to random subsamples of observed data. We used linear regression to calculate the average proportional increase in estimated diversity as a function of the proportional increase in sample size. Sample size and diversity were normalized respectively to the smallest sample and the estimated diversity at the smallest sample. For example, a “normalized gradient” of 0.5 would mean that, on average, an increase of 10% in sample size would produce a 5% increase in estimated diversity. A value of zero would signify no bias with sample size.</p>
<p>The existing estimators performed poorly when applied to the HTLV-1 and microbial data: estimates systematically increased with sample size. In contrast, <italic>DivE</italic> produced consistent estimates that showed no obvious relationship with sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g004">4</xref>). Across subjects and for all methods except <italic>DivE</italic>, estimates showed significant positive normalized gradients (p&lt;0.01 for every estimator, n = 14; two-tailed binomial test) ranging between 0.17 and 0.52 for the HTLV-1 data and 0.3 to 0.45 for the microbial data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Conversely, the normalized gradients produced by <italic>DivE</italic> did not differ significantly from zero (p = 0.18, n = 14; two-tailed binomial test), and were much smaller (0.0081 and 0.022 for the HTLV-1 and microbial data respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In any specified population there is only one value of species richness, and an accurate estimator will arrive at this value regardless of sample size. An increase in estimate magnitude with sample size implies that estimates of a population's species richness would increase if e.g. greater blood volumes were drawn or technique sensitivity was improved.</p>

<p>Normalized gradients measuring proportional increase in estimated diversity against proportional increase in sample size. Normalized gradients (shown for each estimator and each patient data set in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s008">Table S1</xref>) were calculated by linear regression. For the HTLV-1 and microbial data, all estimators except <italic>DivE</italic> show large normalized gradients that are significantly positive.

<p>The existing estimators were less biased when applied to the TCR data, and estimates were largely consistent. Although the normalized gradients were still significantly positive (p&lt;0.0001 for each estimator except <italic>DivE</italic>, n = 16), their magnitudes were substantially lower than for the HTLV-1 and microbial data. However, existing estimators again increased with sample size for the effector memory (EM) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population from the same subject. These observations can be explained with reference to the TCR rarefaction curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g003">Figure 3</xref>). With the exception of the CD8<sup>+</sup> EM dataset (for which the subsample sizes were considerably smaller), each TCR rarefaction curve reached a plateau, implying that the vast majority of observed clonotypes were encountered early. In contrast, the CD8<sup>+</sup> EM rarefaction curve did not plateau, suggesting that further sampling would reveal more CD8<sup>+</sup> EM clonotypes. In common with the microbial and the HTLV-1 datasets, <italic>DivE</italic> performed well for all TCR datasets, producing consistent results from all subsample sizes. To make sure that the smallest subsamples did not disproportionately contribute to the observed gradients, we repeated the above analysis using only estimates from the largest three subsamples in each patient dataset, which showed almost identical results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<p>The best-performing models were largely consistent within patients and between subsamples for the microbial and TCR data, although less so for the HTLV-1 data.

DivE's mean errors (between the species richness of the full data Sobs and <italic>Ŝ<sub>obs</sub></italic>) were 3.3%, 1.0%, and 4.0% for the HTLV-1, TCR and microbial data respectively. These were lower than the corresponding errors of 6.7%, 1.1%, and 7.5%, produced when models were scored by the AICc. This effect was more marked when we considered estimates from small subsamples, defined as those comprising at most 50% of the observed data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s009">Table S2</xref>). However, the differences between errors were smaller for the TCR data, perhaps also due to the saturating rarefaction curves in these samples.</p>

<title>Comparison of Estimators: Accuracy of Diversity Estimate</title>
<p>When rarefaction curves reach a plateau, we can assume that the value of the plateau is approximately equal to the species richness of the entire population, which the existing estimators aim to estimate.

<p>As neither the HTLV-1 nor the microbial data exhibit rarefaction curves that plateau, we cannot apply the same analysis to these datasets. Instead we took advantage of the fact that, for 11 of the 14 HTLV-1 subjects, the data comprised three time points,with three samples drawn at each time point in immediate succession from the subject. For a given subject and a single time point, the three samples were combined <italic>in silico</italic> to produce a single pooled sample. We compared the observed species richness of the pooled sample to each estimator's estimates from a subsample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The total blood diversity must be at least as great as that observed by pooling the samples. However, all existing estimators estimate the total diversity to be less than that observed. Based on a single subsample, the Chao1bc, ACE, Bootstrap, Good-Turing and negative exponential estimators respectively estimate medians of 27.0%, 12.7%, 71.1%, 65.5%, and 47.6% fewer clones than observed in the pooled samples (n = 11). Since the pooled samples do not saturate, and since the blood contains approximately 10<sup>5</sup> times more infected cells than the pooled sample, the diversity observed in the pooled sample is likely to be a small fraction of the total diversity. Since the existing estimators produce estimates lower than the pooled sample diversity, let alone total blood diversity, this represents a considerable error. We used <italic>DivE</italic> to produce two estimates: the pooled sample diversity and blood diversity. From the subsamples <italic>DivE</italic> estimated a median of 2.6×10<sup>3</sup> clones in the pooled samples, a median error of 2.5% (n = 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Additionally, <italic>DivE</italic> estimated 2.8×10<sup>4</sup> clones in the blood, approximately one log higher than the observed pooled sample diversity. Whilst we cannot determine whether or not this is accurate it is at least plausible, considering that it is not less than the diversity of the pooled sample, that the sampling fraction is very small, and that the rarefaction curve has not reached a plateau.</p>

<p>For HTLV-1 Patient D, three samples are pooled. Rarefaction curves from the pooled sample (black circles) and a subsample (red circles) are shown. Chao1bc, ACE, Bootstrap, Good-Turing and negative exponential estimates (blue, grey, green, black, and orange lines respectively) from the subsample, and <italic>DivE</italic> estimates (red cross) from the same subsample are plotted. Existing estimators produce a single estimate of diversity, and so their estimates are shown as lines. The diversity in the blood must be at least as great as that observed by pooling the samples. All existing estimators estimate the total diversity to be less than that observed. Given that the observed diversity is likely to be a small fraction of the total diversity this represents a considerable error. We used <italic>DivE</italic> to produce two estimates: the diversity in the pooled sample (i.e. in 15000 cells, red cross) and the total diversity of the blood. <italic>DivE</italic> accurately estimates the pooled sample species richness from the subsample, but also predicts higher values of species richness in the blood, consistent with the unseen clones implied by the pooled rarefaction curve.

<title>Estimate Error as a Function of Data Curvature</title>
<p>Next we sought to identify conditions under which <italic>DivE</italic> would be prone to error and should not be applied. When the observed rarefaction curve is linear, the data imply a constant rate of species accumulation, and so provide little information on how quickly the rate of species accumulation will decrease. This is usually indicative of severe under-sampling. We predicted that <italic>DivE</italic> will fail to give accurate estimates given such a near linear rarefaction curve. We tested this prediction by calculating the error in the <italic>DivE</italic> estimates as a function of rarefaction data curvature.</p>
<p>The curvature <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> was quantified by the area between the observed rarefaction curve and a linear rarefaction curve, as a fraction of the maximum possible area, which occurs when the rarefaction curve saturates immediately. <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> can take values between 0 and 1, where 1 reflects perfect saturation and 0 reflects a constant rate of species accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We took additional samples of 0.1% of the total CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells for subjects C and E to obtain lower curvature values.</p>
<p>As expected, at very low curvatures (0.016≤<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic>≤0.101), <italic>DivE</italic> was prone to overestimation and performed poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g006">Figure 6</xref>), with median error 0.23. However, for under-sampled populations of intermediate curvature (0.11≤<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic>≤0.62) <italic>DivE</italic> improved markedly (median error  = 0.06), and typically outperformed the other estimators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s010">Table S3</xref>). Finally, all estimators perform well when the curvature is high and most of the diversity has been observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g003">Figure 3D, 3H and 3L</xref>).</p>

<title>Example Application: Estimated Number of HTLV-1 Infected Cell Clones</title>
<p>In both HTLV-1 infection and infection with the related bovine leukaemia virus (BLV), accurate determination of the number of infected cell clones in the host is critical to understanding retroviral dynamics and pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Florins1">[68]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Cavrois1">[71]</xref>. Here we make two different estimates of the number of HTLV-1 infected cell clones: (i) in the circulation; and, (ii) in the whole body. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s012">Text S1</xref> for details of HTLV-1 population size estimation.</p>
<p>The mean estimated number of clones in the circulation in a single host was 2.9×10<sup>4</sup>. It is unknown whether the population structure of HTLV-1 clones in the blood reflects that in solid lymphoid tissue and the spleen. If we assume that these two populations have similar structures, and thus that it is justified to extrapolate to the whole body, we obtain an average of 6.2×10<sup>4</sup> clones, i.e. approximately only twice as many clones, although there are &gt;300 times as many infected cells in the body as the blood. These new estimates in the blood and body are approximately 1 and 1.3 logs higher respectively than those calculated using ACE and Chao1bc (p&lt;0.0001, two-tailed paired Mann-Whitney U-test), and &gt;2 logs higher than previously published estimates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s006">Figure S6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Berry1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Gillet1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Meekings1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Wattel1">[72]</xref>.</p>

<title><italic>DivE</italic> Uncertainty</title>
<p>Because of its heuristic nature, <italic>DivE</italic> lacks formal statistical confidence intervals. Uncertainty in the estimates produced by <italic>DivE</italic> has two sources: parameter values in each respective model (within-model variation), and the choice of model (between-model variation). Using standard errors of parameter estimates to calculate confidence intervals ignores uncertainty from model selection. Information theoretic approaches that take account of model selection uncertainty have become increasingly common in ecology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Johnson1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Stephens1">[74]</xref> and elsewhere. There are broadly two approaches: i) computing AIC weights, and ii) repeated resampling and model ranking to determine bootstrap model selection probabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Burnham1">[66]</xref>. However, neither approach is appropriate in our case. We do not rank models using AIC since this produces less accurate estimates than <italic>DivE</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s009">Table S2</xref>), and so we cannot use AIC weights to derive confidence intervals. Further, since there is a systematic bias towards lower species richness in bootstrap samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s007">Figure S7</xref>), a similar bias may be introduced in the estimation of bootstrap model selection probabilities, leading in turn to a bias in species richness estimation. Systematic underestimation in bootstrap samples is particular to species richness estimation: this does not highlight a general problem with resampling to quantify model selection uncertainty. As a pragmatic indicator of estimate variability, we use the range of estimates produced by the five best-performing models; the geometric mean of these five models is taken as the point estimate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003646.s011">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We wished to estimate species richness in three microbiological and immunological datasets. Initially we used estimators that are reported to perform well in ecology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Colwell1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Unterseher1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chao4">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Shen1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Esty1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Hortal1">[75]</xref>. In the datasets with rarefaction curves that did not plateau, these estimators were biased by sample size. For datasets with rarefaction curves that did plateau, estimates were consistent, but in such cases estimators contribute little information because approximate species richness is already known. Comparable results have been reported elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Colwell1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Hong1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Hughes1">[62]</xref>. By combining data from multiple independent HTLV-1 samples, we showed that these estimators substantially underestimated species richness.</p>
<p>We then developed a new approach, <italic>DivE</italic>, to estimate species richness and frequency distribution. In our first validation, <italic>DivE</italic> consistently and accurately estimated the diversity of the observed data from incomplete subsamples of that data. We subsequently determined conditions where <italic>DivE</italic> would fail and should not be applied. When the rarefaction curvature was low and the data implied a near-constant species-accumulation rate, <italic>DivE</italic> was prone to overestimation. However, in under-sampled populations of intermediate curvature, <italic>DivE</italic> substantially improved. The <italic>DivE</italic> distribution generation algorithm performed with reasonable accuracy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003646-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003646-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>We argue that biologically meaningful and useful estimators should be able to estimate species richness in a specified population. This is not the case with the existing estimators we tested. In contrast, <italic>DivE</italic> can estimate diversity in any given population size. However, population size estimation can be nontrivial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chao5">[76]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Chao6">[78]</xref>. In spatially homogeneous populations with equiprobable detection of individuals, estimating population size through scaling by area or volume is justifiable e.g. scaling from cells in 50 ml of blood to cells in the total blood volume. When population size estimates are unavailable, it is still usually possible to provide meaningful diversity estimates, e.g. the number of microbes per gram of faeces. <italic>DivE</italic> may also be useful in deciding the depth of sampling required for an adequate census. Deeper sampling may require more DNA sequencing or a larger tissue sample from a patient, and so minimizing sampling depth has financial and ethical benefits. This is not possible with the other estimators we tested.</p>
<p>The HTLV-1 data consisted of absolute species counts, and so we could estimate HTLV-1 diversity. Microbial and TCR datasets were used only for validation as these data consisted of sequence reads and not absolute counts. To the extent that read abundances differ from absolute counts, such data cannot be used to estimate species richness with any abundance-based estimator (e.g. <italic>DivE</italic>, Chao1bc, and ACE). Over-amplification by PCR may generate a saturating rarefaction curve that is not due to sampling depth, falsely implying that the majority of species have been observed. This can be seen in our TCR data: plateaus were far lower than previously reported diversity estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Arstila1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003646-Naylor1">[79]</xref>. However, absolute counts can often be obtained (e.g. by spiking a sample with a known quantity of identifiable individuals or by barcoding to identify PCR duplicates).</p>
<p>It is unlikely that sequencing error influenced our HTLV-1 diversity estimates, because sequencing error cannot systematically alter proviral integration site mapping. However, species richness estimates from TCR or microbial data are likely to be susceptible to sequencing error. Sequencing error can falsely increase diversity, and this will influence species richness estimates using any estimator; researchers must therefore exercise caution when analysing such data; ideally by preprocessing the data to remove error prior to further analysis. Caution must also be exercised when assuming that the spatial distribution of individuals is uniform. We believe that these assumptions are reasonable for the blood, but skin tissue for example may be more clustered.</p>
<p><italic>DivE</italic> is conceptually simple but can be computationally intensive to implement. When applying <italic>DivE</italic> to a new type of data it is necessary to ascertain which models perform best. This requires that many models be fitted to multiple subsamples. If, for a particular data type, a given set of models performs consistently well, application becomes much quicker because only these models need to be fitted, and it is no longer necessary to fit all models to all subsamples. In our analysis we found that five models performed consistently well, and so we have used the aggregate of the five best-performing models in our estimates. Since the optimal number of models may differ between datasets, we advocate careful analysis of model scores to decide how many models should be aggregated. The <italic>DivE</italic> estimator has been provided as an R package, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DivE/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DivE/index.html</ext-link>.</p>
<p>In summary, we have developed and validated a new approach to estimate species richness and distribution that significantly outperformed existing estimators of biodiversity in the datasets we examined.</p>
