While sequence similarity is the most popular tool used for this purpose, sequence motifs may also subserve this goal. Here we develop a motif-based method consisting of applying an unsupervised motif extraction algorithm (MEX) to all enzyme sequences, and filtering the results by the four-level classification hierarchy of the Enzyme Commission (EC). The resulting motifs serve as specific peptides (SPs), appearing on single branches of the EC. In contrast to previous motif-based methods, the new method does not require any preprocessing by multiple sequence alignment, nor does it rely on over-representation of motifs within EC branches. The SPs obtained comprise on average 8.4 ± 4.5 amino acids, and specify the functions of 93% of all enzymes, which is much higher than the coverage of 63% provided by ProSite motifs. The SP classification thus compares favorably with previous function annotation methods and successfully demonstrates an added value in extreme cases where sequence similarity fails. Interestingly, SPs cover most of the annotated active and binding site amino acids, and occur in active-site neighboring 3-D pockets in a highly statistically significant manner. The latter are assumed to have strong biological relevance to the activity of the enzyme. Further filtering of SPs by biological functional annotations results in reduced small subsets of SPs that possess very large enzyme coverage. Overall, SPs both form a very useful tool for enzyme functional classification and bear responsibility for the catalytic biological function carried out by enzymes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Sequence motifs are known to provide information about functional properties of proteins. In the past, many approaches have looked for deterministic motifs in protein sequences, by searching for functionally over-represented k-mers, with moderate levels of success. Here we revisit and renew the utility of deterministic motifs, by searching for them in a partially unsupervised and context-dependent manner. Using a novel motif extraction algorithm, MEX, deterministic sequence motifs are extracted from Swiss Prot data containing more than 50,000 enzymes. They are then filtered by the Enzyme Commission classification hierarchy to produce sets of specific peptides (SPs). The latter specify enzyme function for 93% of the data, comparing well with existing approaches for enzyme classification. Importantly, SPs are found to have biological significance. A majority of all known active and binding sites of enzymes are covered by SPs, and many SPs are found to lie within spatial pockets in the neighborhood of the active sites. Both these results have extremely high statistical significance.

Conventional approaches to function prediction rely on sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b003">3</xref>] or structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b004">4</xref>] similarity with proteins whose functions are known. This is sometimes misleading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b006">6</xref>]. Alternatively, one may use motif approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b012">12</xref>], trying to extract from the data subsequences that are responsible for particular functions. Motifs can be deterministic sequences of amino acids, regular expressions that allow various alternatives for specific locations within the motif, or stochastic structures specifying the probability of an amino acid at every location. This work aims to uncover deterministic sequence motifs, and considers their relationships with protein functionality. We focus on enzymes, whose functions are classified by the Enzyme Commission (EC) four-level hierarchy which is represented by four integers, n1.n2.n3.n4, corresponding to the different levels of classification. For example, the oxidoreductases class corresponds to n1 = 1, one of the six main divisions. For this class, n2 (subclass) specifies electron donors, n3 (sub-subclass) specifies electron acceptor, and n4 indicates the exact enzymatic activity.</p><p>Conventional sequence motif searches in enzymes are performed in a supervised fashion, using sequences of proteins that are known to have the same function and looking for (deterministic, regular-expression, or stochastic) motifs that are over-represented in this group of proteins. The motifs in question should then subserve such functions as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b009">9</xref>] phosphorylation of protein kinases; metal binding sites for calcium, zinc, copper, and iron; enzyme active sites, etc. With the advent of studies of protein–protein interactions, interest grew in finding sequence motifs that are responsible for them, and span an “interaction space” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>Here we perform a large-scale search for deterministic sequence motifs without specifying a priori their exact functional roles, using the unsupervised motif extraction (MEX) algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b015">15</xref>]. We have used one functional guidance: MEX was separately applied to each one of the six major EC classes. The same motifs may also appear in other classes, yet many of them turn out to occur in only one class, and belong to a specific EC branch. The latter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030167-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) are termed specific peptides (SPs). By representing some 50,000 enzymes (of average length of 380 amino acids) in terms of about the same number of SPs (of average length 8.4), we obtain a largely compressed functional representation and an EC classification with 93% accuracy.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030167-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030167.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The Occurrence of Specific Peptides within the EC Hierarchy of Enzymes</title><p>(A) A sketch of the EC hierarchy and the assignments of SPs to SP classes.

Most belong to single branches of the fourth level of the hierarchy, to be denoted as SPs of level 4 (SP4) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030167-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). SPs of higher hierarchy, SP3, SP2, and SP1, appear in more than one lower EC level. Thus, if a peptide is shared by two or more level 4 groups that belong to the same third EC level, and appears nowhere else, it is assigned to SP3. The SPs were further screened to eliminate any peptide that includes within it another peptide carrying the same SPN (N = 1,2,3,4) label.</p><p>The majority of SPs found at level 4 of the EC hierarchy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030167-t001">Table 1</xref>) are probably due to the high homology within this level, that often includes many orthologous genes. Thousands of SPs occur at higher levels of hierarchy, reflecting functional similarity among enzymes with lower sequence similarity. The occurrence of any one SP on the sequence of an enzyme specifies its EC functionality according to the specific branch N of its SPN. For example, enzyme P45048 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030167-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) contains SSAATYG, an SP3 specific to 5.1.3, and LNVYGYSK, an SP4 specific to 5.1.3.20.

Precision can be defined at the SP level, i.e., to what extent did the EC of this SP match the true EC of the enzyme that it hits. Precision can also be defined at the enzyme level: how many enzymes are correctly identified by all SPs that hit them. In other words, demanding the EC assignments of all SPs to be consistent with one another as well as with the “48.3” annotation of the enzyme. Overall recall is 84%. Precision at the SP level is almost perfect, 98.7%; nonetheless, at the enzyme level it reduces to 81.7%.

In conventional machine-learning analysis of sequence to function classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b002">2</xref>], one often tries to eliminate bias by avoiding high sequence similarity between proteins in the test set and proteins in the training set. In our case this is problematic, because it effectively calls for eliminating from the test set all enzymes that have four-digit EC numbers appearing in the training set. Alternatively, one could produce for each enzyme in the test set a new training set that does not contain sequences with the same EC number, which is both unconventional and computationally very complex.</p><p>To overcome this predicament, we have used the following procedure: a) start with the test set consisting of all sequences of SwissProt release 48.3 that do not appear in release 45; b) blast each one of these (test set) sequences against the sequences of the training set (SwissProt release 45) that do not have the same four-digit EC number; c) include in the non-redundant test set only sequences whose BLAST score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b020">20</xref>] with all other training sequences (including those with the same first three EC digits) is larger than 10<sup>−3</sup>; d) test generalization on this non-redundant set only for peptides in SP1, SP2, and SP3, thus avoiding the SP4 peptides that were extracted from the same fourth-level EC sequences as those of the non-redundant test set. It should be noted that removing the SP4 peptides makes the functional annotation task much more difficult because the coverage of enzymes by SPs is strongly reduced.

MEX was run on all data and SPs were selected from the MEX motifs according to the training data. Only this subset of motifs was then employed to classify the test data. This procedure has been repeated 45 times to gain statistics, and has been subjected to a support vector machine (SVM) analysis. It has been compared with a state-of-the-art method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b017">17</xref>] based on an analogous SVM procedure, applied to the same data using the same divisions and relying on classification of (train and test) data according to a matrix of Smith-Waterman distances from all oxidoreductases. The results are displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030167-st004">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030167-st005">S5</xref> and show a clear advantage to SP classification. For comparison, we use the Jaccard score defined as J = TP / (TP + FP + FN) where TP, FP, and FN denote true positives, false positives, and false negatives, accordingly. Whereas sequence similarity leads to an average Jaccard score of 0.86 on the second EC level and 0.82 on the third level, SP classification has average Jaccard scores of 0.93 and 0.92, accordingly. Comparing with yet another method, SVM-Prot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b019">19</xref>], which classifies enzymes on the basis of physical and chemical features of their amino acids, we note that the latter achieves a Jaccard score of only 0.74 on all oxidoreductases data at the second EC level.</p><p>The common lore, that large sequence identity between two proteins implies that the two have the same function, has its exceptions.

ProSite motifs are either regular expressions (of average length 18.3 amino acids) or weight matrices, while SPs are deterministic motifs (with average length of 8.4). We search for all appearances of ProSite regular expression motifs on enzymes. Each such appearance is noted on the enzyme sequence and checked whether it is also (partially) covered by an SP. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030167-sg006">Figure S6</xref> compares the appearance of SPs and ProSite motifs on the data, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030167-sg007">Figure S7</xref> displays the relative coverage of ProSite motifs by SPs as function of the minimal percentage of amino acids belonging to the ProSite motif that are also located on SPs. Thus we find that if at least 40% of the amino acids of the ProSite motif also belong to SPs, which would be appropriate for an average SP to be located within an average ProSite motif, then SPs cover 48% of all ProSite motif occurrences. This may be compared with a random model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) which covers on average only 24% of ProSite motif occurrences, with a standard deviation of 0.06%.

These SPs provided coverage of about 93% of all enzymes. By introducing further screening of SPs according to biological findings, a much reduced number of SPs may suffice for the purpose of classification. 21,228 enzymes carry active or binding site annotations in the 48.3 data. The number of SPs hitting these enzymes is 26,931; however, only 2,337 cover the active or binding sites. These 2,337 are found to occur on 79% of the 21,228 enzymes. Thus, instead of the approximately 1:1 ratio between the number of SPs and the number of enzymes they cover as found previously, we now obtain an order of magnitude parsimonious ratio, of about 1:8, while maintaining a similar level of classification accuracy.</p><p>The same SPs cover 36% of all original enzymes of our dataset. Performing a similar analysis on the 45 data, one finds that the 2,014 SPs that cover the annotated enzymes in it hit 75% of the relevant set of enzymes. Moreover, using the same SPs to classify the 10,585 novel enzymes contained in the 48.3 release and absent from the 45 release, one obtains coverage of 28% of them. This last fact demonstrates that the relatively large coverage reached by the small fraction of SPs that hit active sites is not limited to the dataset (training set) used to define the SPs. All these results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030167-t007">Table 7</xref>.

Large-scale studies often make use of multiple sequence alignment (MSA), phylogenetic information, and sophisticated mathematical models, thus leading to the plethora of algorithms and Web tools that permeate bioinformatics. While all that may be necessary to obtain a thorough understanding of the way proteins develop and perform, much can be gained by shifting attention to deterministic linear motifs on proteins. In doing so, we return to a way that has been often tried in the past. Thus, in the 1990s, many investigations looked for k-mers that are over-represented in sequences of proteins that have common functional properties. Some examples are ProSite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b012">12</xref>], with which we have compared our results, and papers such as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b030">30</xref>], where major emphasis has been put on finding a complete dictionary of motifs that cover all strings of amino acids that are of any importance. In the case of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b030">30</xref>], the search has been an unsupervised one leading eventually to a coverage of 98% of all amino acids on the protein strings. Some reviews of the motif approaches of the 1990s are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b009">9</xref>]. More recently, interests have shifted to automated prediction tools that may make use of motifs but are not limited to them. Examples are the GOtcha method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b031">31</xref>] that uses sequence-identity searches of various genomes to predict functional annotation, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b032">32</xref>] who pursue the same goal using PSI-BLAST searches with varying resolution.</p><p>Our goal is more moderate, restricting ourselves to the functional classification of enzymes. By doing so, and by applying the MEX algorithm together with limiting ourselves to SPs within the EC hierarchy, we are able to classify all enzymes by SPs occurring on them with coverage between 87% to 93%, depending on the EC level that is being looked for (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030167-t001">Table 1</xref>). Classification success of novel sequences that belong to the same type of data has coverage of 84% and precision of 99% at the SP level and 82% at the enzyme level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030167-t002">Table 2</xref>). Restricting ourselves to low bias (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030167-t003">Table 3</xref>), we still have a large precision of 88% at the SP level. We have demonstrated that our results surpass the classification accuracy of sequence similarity (using Smith-Waterman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b033">33</xref>]), and our SPs have a higher coverage than ProSite motifs. As such, they become a powerful tool that may be added to existing automated searches.</p><p>It should be noted that the SPs were extracted by an unsupervised motif search algorithm, applied to each one of the six EC classes. This is quite different from conventional supervised approaches. Our method may disregard motifs that obey some over-representation criterion, and choose others that do not satisfy such a global statistics measure. Another major difference from other approaches is that we do not make use of MSA. MEX finds significant motifs without requiring alignment as a preprocessing stage. In fact, MEX can serve as a source for MSA by employing its motifs for alignment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030167-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>SPs were selected from all MEX motifs by imposing the condition that they should be specific to particular levels of the EC hierarchy. This has led to a large number of SPs, as numerous as the set of all enzymes (but, obviously, providing a much more concise description). Imposing further biological conditions, one may find much smaller sets that suffice for classification. In an analysis of enzymes for which the active sites are known, we have shown that the set of SPs bearing these active sites, which comprises just 8.6% of all relevant SPs (i.e., those occurring anywhere on these enzymes), suffices to cover (and therefore label) all enzymes.</p><p>Conventional classification methods rely on homology. While large homology is also at the root of our success for most SPs of level 4 (see some examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030167-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), we have demonstrated (in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030167-t004">Table 4</xref>) that SPs can also be of importance in extreme cases, where straightforward comparison of an enzyme to another one with large sequence similarity may be misleading.</p><p>In conclusion, we have established a comprehensive and accurate classification scheme for enzymes based on the occurrence of short peptides on their sequences. The SPs contain, on average, just 8.4 amino acids, yet they suffice to correctly classify an overwhelming majority of known enzymes. Moreover, we have found indications for some of the biological roles of SPs, e.g., covering a majority of active sites. This study has laid the foundations for the further experimental investigation of these intriguing sets of SPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Motif extraction.</title><p>MEX is a motif extraction algorithm that serves as the basic unit of ADIOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030167-b015">15</xref>], an unsupervised method for extraction of syntax from linguistic corpora.
