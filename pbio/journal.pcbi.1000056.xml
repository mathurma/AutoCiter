To study the allosteric mechanism of different cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domains, we compared cAMP-bound and cAMP-free structures (PKA, Epac, and two ionic channels) using a new bioinformatics method: local spatial pattern alignment. Our analysis highlights four major conserved structural motifs: 1) the phosphate binding cassette (PBC), which binds the cAMP ribose-phosphate, 2) the “hinge,” a flexible helix, which contacts the PBC, 3) the β<sub>2,3</sub> loop, which provides precise positioning of an invariant arginine from the PBC, and 4) a conserved structural element consisting of an N-terminal helix, an eight residue loop and the A-helix (N3A-motif). The PBC and the hinge were included in the previously reported allosteric model, whereas the definition of the β<sub>2,3</sub> loop and the N3A-motif as conserved elements is novel. The N3A-motif is found in all <italic>cis</italic>-regulated CNB domains, and we present a model for an allosteric mechanism in these domains. Catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) represents a <italic>trans</italic>-regulated CNB domain family: it does not contain the N3A-motif, and its long range allosteric interactions are substantially different from the <italic>cis</italic>-regulated CNB domains.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cyclic nucleotides are small regulatory molecules which transmit signal from receptors positioned on a living cell membrane into the cell interior and regulate multiple biological processes ranging from bacteria to humans. Such regulation occurs through binding of the cyclic nucleotides to the corresponding proteins. All such proteins contain a relatively small domain responsible for the cyclic nucleotide binding. The most important task is to understand how cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domains translate the signal into a biological response. In this work, we studied changes in different CNB domains induced by the cyclic nucleotides using a new method for comparison of protein structures: local spatial patterns alignment. This novel method compares protein molecules and detects conserved spatial patterns comprised of similar amino acid residues. Moreover, it ranks the detected residues with respect to their functional or structural importance. Our results show that there are at least two different families of CNB domains. The first family has four structural elements which perform the signal translation. Two of these elements were known previously and two are novel. The second family can translate the signal using only three elements, but they have to work in pairs to provide interaction between the functional elements.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant NSF-DBI 99111196, National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant GM70996 (to LFTE), National Institutes of Health grant GM19301, and National Science Foundation grant DBI0217951 (to SST).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important second messenger, which regulates a large variety of cellular processes, including metabolism, cell shape transformation, gene transcription, photoreception and chemosensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Beavo1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Newton1">[5]</xref>. All cAMP-binding proteins in both pro- and eukaryotes share a small module – the cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNB domain), which is typically fused to another domain. The CNB domain contains a contiguous β-subdomain and a non-contiguous α-subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The former is a relatively rigid eight-stranded β-sandwich, which accommodates the cyclic nucleotide molecule.

Ribose-phosphate of cAMP, protected by the β-sandwich from the outside solution, forms six strong hydrogen bonds to the PBC. Due to these interactions, the B'-helix moves towards the cAMP molecule and adopts a compact conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Such movement causes a substantial rearrangement of the α-subdomain both in its N- and C-terminal parts. The latter contains the so called “hinge” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Diller1">[13]</xref>, which consists of two consecutive α-helices (B and C). These helices are remarkably flexible and due to a strong connection to the B'-helix perform a swing-like motion: moving towards cAMP in the B-form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The N-terminal part of the α-subdomain, which typically consists of two (short) helices and was called the “N-terminal helical bundle” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Rehmann1">[14]</xref>, moves in an opposite way; in the B-form it moves away from the PBC, facilitating the hinge closure. In the H-form the N-terminal helices move towards the cAMP and make a contact to the B'-helix, filling the void space that results from the hinge opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The other part of the cAMP molecule, the adenine ring, acts as a hydrophobic moiety, which stacks against a “capping residue” in all known CNB domain structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Berman1">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Although this model is in a good correspondence with much experimental data, two important issues remained unclear. First, as the authors mentioned, the N-terminal helical bundle is replaced by a single helix in the catabolite gene activator protein (CAP). This raises a question about the role of the helical bundle and its functional and structural conservation. Is it a universal part of the CNB domain or it is a part of protein-protein interface between the CNB domain and the host protein? The second problem is related to the loop located between β<sub>2</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> strands. A series of publications demonstrated, that it is an important element of allosteric mechanism in the PKA RIα∶A-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Das1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Zawadzki1">[18]</xref>, but it was not included in the model described by Rehmann et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Rehmann1">[14]</xref> and was not considered to be a universal element.</p><p>To elucidate the cAMP induced allosteric mechanism that is conserved in different CNB domains, we used a recently developed method for protein structure comparison: Local Spatial Patterns (LSP) alignment that is capable of detecting similar patterns made up by amino acid residues in space. It is fast and does not require preliminary sequence or structural alignment of the compared proteins. Earlier we used it for comparison of protein surfaces of several CNB domains in the B-form and detected a conserved set of hydrophobic residues protecting the cAMP ribose-phosphate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Berman1">[15]</xref>.

The latter consists of the A-helix, a preceding eight residue loop and a short N-terminal helix. The loop contains a set of 3<sub>10</sub>-turns, and is termed “the 3<sub>10</sub>-loop”. Based on these results, we propose a general model for the allosteric mechanism in CNB domains, which we called <italic>cis</italic>-regulated domains. In CAP the N3A-motif is reduced to a single A-helix. The difference between CAP and other CNB domains is discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>LSP Alignment Defines cAMP-Induced Conformational Changes in CNB Domains</title><p>The LSP alignment is a new method to compare protein molecules. It is based on a graph-theoretical representation of protein structure, and the result of this alignment is a pair of isomorphic graphs. Vertices of the graphs correspond to the residues which form similar spatial patterns in both proteins. Each vertex/residue is connected to the rest of the graph by several edges. They indicate the residue neighbors whose positions and orientation in space are conserved with respect to this residue. As we have shown earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Berman1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Kornev1">[21]</xref>, functionally important residues of protein kinases have numerous connections on the similarity graphs. In the previous works we considered only surface exposed residues. Here we analyze all residues. This allows us to recognize conserved motifs that are buried in the protein core. We define a term “involvement score” (IS) of a particular residue, which is equal to the number of edges for the corresponding vertex on the graph provided by the LSP alignment procedure. It reflects the extent of participation of this residue in formation of invariant spatial patterns and corresponds to AA and AI scores used in the previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Kornev1">[21]</xref>, where we compared active and inactive protein kinases.</p><p>Earlier we used the LSP alignment for comparison of different proteins having similar functions. In this work we present an alternative way of using the LSP alignment program. Our purpose was to quantify cAMP-induced structural rearrangements in different CNB domains. This was made by aligning two different conformations of the same protein. As the IS reflects only local structural similarities (in our case within 10 Å range between C<sub>α</sub>-atoms) any large scale rearrangements in the protein do not change the score significantly. Therefore, residues which form rigid structures inside the protein and maintain their relative positions will have a high level of IS. In contrast, those residues located in points of protein flexibility will have low IS, reflecting the loss of similarity between the two protein structures. One can speculate that the residues with the lowest IS can play an important role in the allosteric mechanism, as such elements like “hinges” or “switches” have to accept two distinctive “on” and “off” conformations.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recognition of a Conserved Novel Allosteric “N3A-Motif”</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g002">Figure 2</xref> presents the results of LSP alignment of PKA (RIα) H- and B-forms. As expected, residues from the rigid β-sandwich had the highest IS values, reflecting the rigidity of the β subdomain. In contrast, four regions showed a significant decrease in IS: 1) B'-helix of the PBC; 2) the hinge region; 3) the β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop and 4) N-terminal part of the α-subdomain. These results are in good correspondence with the NMR studies of the RIα A-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Das1">[16]</xref>. Our analyses show that both A- and B-domains have similar IS profiles, although the drop in the β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop in B-domain was less prominent. Similar results were obtained for the A-domain of PKA (RIIβ) and the potassium channel MloK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000056.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The decrease of IS in the β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop in the potassium channel CNB domain was not as striking as in A-domains of PKA (both RIα and RIIβ), but similar to the B-domain of RIα. This is in a good agreement with the earlier observation that B-domains of PKA are more similar to the rest of CNB domains, than the A-domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Berman1">[15]</xref>.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000056-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000056.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Study of the cAMP-induced conformational changes in PKA∶RIα by LSP-alignment.</title><p>High involvement scores correspond to relatively rigid parts of the molecule.

It is not a part of the current CNB domain nomenclature for two reasons: first – it is not present in CAP, and second – in the different CNB domains it forms slightly different secondary structures. For example in the B-form of RIα, RIIβ, MloK1 and Epac2 it contains a short 3<sub>10</sub>-helix. In the H-form of RIα∶A it contains a set of 3-turns, which do not form the classical 3<sub>10</sub>-helix and is considered to be a loop, while the B-domain retains its 3<sub>10</sub>-helix configuration. In H-form of PKA RIIα∶A and RIIβ∶A this element qualifies as an α-helix, but in the B-form of RIIβ∶A and RIIβ∶B it is a 3<sub>10</sub>-helix. However, a close look at the middle part of the bundle shows that the geometry of its backbone in different CNB domains (both H- and B-forms), is rather conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, this element, which we will define as a “3<sub>10</sub>-loop”, has a distinctive pattern of phi/psi angles: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows a sequence alignment of different N-terminal helical bundles. One can see that A-helix of the presented CNB domains is preceded by an eight residue long loop. Its first conserved feature is that both ends of the loop contain residues with negative chirality (a characteristic of β-strands): one at the N-terminus and two at the C-terminus. There is also a large conserved hydrophobic residue (phenylalanine or leucine) in the middle of the loop (F<sup>136</sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), which plays a central role in the hydrophobic cluster formed by the A-helix and the preceding α-helix, which did not have an established name. As in the PKA-RIα A-domain, it was called “αX<sub>n</sub>-helix” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Das1">[16]</xref> or “X∶N-helix” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Kim1">[6]</xref>, here we call it “N-helix”, and the combination of the N-helix, the 3<sub>10</sub>-loop and A-helix structure – the N3A-motif. The characteristic feature of this motif is the presence of multiple X–X pairs in its sequence (where X represents a hydrophobic residue or a residue with large hydrophobic segment such as arginine or asparagine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Such residues are closely positioned on one side of the helix and provide a secure connection between the N3A-motif elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), a feature similar to the tetratricopeptide repeat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Blatch1">[22]</xref> or the leucine-zipper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Lupas1">[23]</xref> motifs.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000056-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000056.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The conserved N3A-motif in the N-terminal part of the α-subdomain.</title><p>(A) Stereo picture of N3A-motifs from 9 different CNB domains: A and B domains of PKA types RIα, RIIα, and RIIβ; Epac2; ionic channel HCN; and potassium channel MloK1.

Until now, the beginning of the B domain was associated with the first residue in it's a-helix (e.g. W<sup>260</sup> in RIα or V<sup>280</sup> in RIIβ). Here we suggest a new boundary between the A and B domains, which will reflect the conservation of the N3A-motif. It is known that the RIα-(94-244) construct retains its functionality and is capable of both binding to cAMP and regulating PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Huang1">[24]</xref>. In addition, the C-helix of cAMP-bound RIα has a kink between Y<sup>244</sup> and E<sup>245</sup>. An identical kink exists in the cAMP-bound RIIβ (between Y<sup>265</sup> and E<sup>266</sup>). It seems logical to suggest that this kink indicates the border between the A and B domains, therefore defining E<sup>245</sup> as the beginning of N3A-motif for the B-domain of RIα. Such a definition supports the observation made earlier by Huang and Taylor that RIα “residues 245–260 at the end of cAMP binding domain A are structurally more a part of domain B than domain A” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Huang1">[24]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>LSP Alignment of Different CNB Domains Emphasizes the Allosteric Role of the β<sub>2,3</sub>-Loop</title><p>After the new definition of CNB domains, we used the LSP alignment to detect residues involved in formation of conserved spatial patterns as we did previously for PKA-C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Kornev1">[21]</xref>.

The result was rather unexpected as, until recently, this area was not considered as an important part of CNB domains. The scores, in general, did not depend on the presence of cAMP, which indicates overall conservation of the loop geometry. This suggests, that the β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop is an important element not only in PKA-R, as it was pointed by Das et. al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Das1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Das2">[26]</xref> , but in all CNB domains. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows a comparison between β<sub>2,3</sub>-loops of different CNB domains. As was detected by the DSSP program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Kabsch1">[27]</xref>, all loops have the same pattern of their main chain chirality, indicating a high level of their geometry conservation. The most distinctive common feature for all of them is a 3-turn between residues #2 (D<sup>164</sup>) and #5 (D<sup>167</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). It contains an invariant glycine residue #4 (G<sup>166</sup>) which makes a conserved hydrogen bond to the PBC-arginine carbonyl. The reason for strict conservation of the glycine is evident as its dihedral angles are ruled out for any other type of residue (<italic>φ</italic> = 89.4° and ψ = −26.8° for RIα∶A). Another conserved hydrogen bond is formed between the PBC-arginine amide and carbonyl of the residue #5. The third polar contact, which can be found in all CNB structures, is formed between the PBC-arginine guanidinium group and the carbonyl of residue #9 (N<sup>171</sup>). The hydrogen bond between the arginine and the side chain of residue #8 (D<sup>170</sup>), which was found to be important for RIα∶A, is not conserved: it can be seen only in the A domains of RIα and RIIβ. This residue, however, often binds to the side chain of residue #9 and provides communication between the β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop and the “hinge” as its carbonyl is always bound to the amide group of the first residue in the B-helix. Besides polar interactions with the PBC-arginine, residue #1 (I<sup>163</sup>) makes a conserved hydrophobic contact to the arginine side chain. This residue is a member of a conserved hydrophobic core formed by the highly scored residues: V<sup>162</sup>, I<sup>163</sup>, Y<sup>173</sup>, F<sup>198</sup> and V<sup>213</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The important detail is that another member of that cluster: Y<sup>173</sup> (one of the three highest scores obtained) – makes a conserved hydrogen bond to the residue #9 (N<sup>171</sup>), thus closing the circle around the PBC arginine.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000056-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000056.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment of β<sub>2,3</sub>-loops for different CNB domains.</title><p>Contacts formed by the residues are shown either on the upper left side (side chain) or lower right side (main chain).

The preceding β<sub>8</sub>-strand received almost the same level of scores.

The NMR-study of RIα showed that two residues from the β<sub>8</sub>-strand (W<sup>222</sup> and I<sup>224</sup>) had a substantial chemical shift, in response to cAMP binding and are a part of the allosteric mechanism. Our results support this conclusion and demonstrate conservation of the hydrophobic interface through different CNB domains.

There are several distinctive features that distinguish the CAP CNB domain from those discussed above. The major difference is that in functionally active CAP the two identical CNB domains form a homodimer with the interface being formed mainly by their C-helices. Regulatory subunits of PKA also contain two CNB domains, but their mutual interaction is rather limited: e.g. A-helix of B-domain contacts cAMP and the hinge from the A-domain. In contrast, in CAP the interaction between the two monomers is the most important allosteric contact between the PBC and the hinge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows that the major binding partner for each PBC is not the hinge from its own CNB domain but the hinge from the opposite monomer.

Using our new computational method we have analyzed both the allosteric mechanism and the structural motifs conserved in different CNB domains. LSP-alignment proved to be an effective tool for detection of the allosteric “hot spots” – residues with the most significant rearrangement of their side chains. The comparison of H- and B-forms of PKA-RIα pointed to four major elements of the allosteric mechanism: the PBC, the hinge, the β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop and the N-terminal helical structure. Based on our analysis the latter is now recognized as a new conserved element of <italic>cis</italic>-regulated CNB domains – the N3A-motif. It is not present in at least one <italic>trans</italic>-regulated CNB domain – CAP; however, it can be found in another transcriptional regulator, Crp/Fnr family from Porphyromonas gingivalis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Rotella1">[29]</xref> (PDB ID: 2GAU). The possible role of the N3A-motif in <italic>trans</italic>-regulated CNB domains needs to be elucidated, but the fact that the allosteric interface between α and β-subdomains is significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g007">Figure 7</xref>) indicates a possible difference in allosteric mechanisms.</p><p>The detection of four allosteric hot spots in PKA is consistent with NMR studies of the RIβ∶A-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Das1">[16]</xref>. Our analysis shows that the N3A-motif contains two types of residues: hydrophobic X–X repeats, which provide structural stability to the element as well as its interactions within the CNB domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>). The other set of residues is positioned on the tip of the 3<sub>10</sub>-loop and is often involved in functionally important protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>The results of different <italic>cis</italic>-regulated CNB domains LSP-alignment were in good correspondence with our earlier analysis of CNB domain surface: all eleven residues that were found to be conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Berman1">[15]</xref>, received very high IS values.

This brings up a question of the general role of the β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop in different CNB domains. As we showed, its residues always participate in multiple, highly conserved, polar and hydrophobic interactions with the PBC arginine (R<sup>209</sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The guanidinium group of this residue makes a very important hydrogen bond to the equatorial oxygen of the cAMP ribose phosphate. Perturbation of the bond, with an arginine-to-lysine mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Herberg1">[30]</xref>, or with substitution of the oxygen by sulfur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000056-Dostmann2">[31]</xref>, significantly disrupts the cAMP-related allostery. A close look at the β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop interactions with the PBC arginine, shows that it “surrounds” the residue, immobilizing its bulky side chain. The position and total geometry of the loop is remarkably conserved in all CNB domains. The central element of the loop is a universally conserved 3-turn between the positions #2 (D<sup>164</sup>) and #5 (D<sup>167</sup>). Spatial orientation of the turn is secured by another conserved interaction of residue #3 (Q<sup>165</sup>) with the β<sub>4,5</sub>-loop. The apparent reason for such rigidity is a correct positioning of the PBC arginine main chain, which is locked by two hydrogen bonds to residues #4 (G<sup>166</sup>) and #5 (D<sup>167</sup>). The tip of the arginine side chain is always bound to the #9 residue main chain (N<sup>171</sup>). A-domains of PKA regulatory subunits RIβ and RIIβ have an additional hydrogen bond to the side chain of residue #8 (D<sup>170</sup>). This interaction, however, is not conserved in other CNB domains. Alternatively, a polar bond between the eighth residue main chain and N-terminus of the B-helix was found in all studied structures. Thus, the possible role of the residue is to communicate between the PBC arginine and the hinge. The direct binding of residue #8 to the arginine, which is present in the PKA-R A-domains can substantially reinforce such communication.</p><p>These finding lead us to a suggestion that immobilization of the PBC arginine side chain has to be an important feature of the allosteric mechanism. Definitely, without a stable guanidinium group, one hardly can expect a stable bond with the ribose phosphate moiety of cAMP. Here we propose a general model describing the cyclic nucleotide related allostery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The model is built around interactions between the cyclic nucleotide phosphate and the PBC-arginine guanidinium group (red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000056-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). The main suggestion of the model is that the guanidinium group is very mobile and can not form a stable bond unless it is restricted by numerous interactions of the arginine with the PBC and β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop. This model is supported by the observation that the PBC-arginine side chain is not totally buried in the CNB domain, but partially exposed to the outer solution.

The primary function of the β<sub>2,3</sub>-loop is to position all parts of the arginine including the backbone, the hydrophobic part of the side chain and the guanidinium moiety. It also interacts with the hinge (through the residue #8) and the PBC (via hydrophobic contact between residue #7 and A<sup>202</sup>). The PBC serves, first of all, as a cyclic nucleotide molecule stabilizer, but it also plays an important role in immobilization of the arginine side chain (via A<sup>202</sup>).
