        <p>In order to metastasize, cancer cells need to acquire a motile phenotype. Previously, development of this phenotype was thought to rely on the acquisition of selected, random mutations and thus would occur late in cancer progression. However, recent studies show that cancer cells disseminate early, implying the existence of a different, faster route to the metastatic motile phenotype. Using a spontaneous murine model of melanoma, we show that a subset of bone marrow-derived immune cells (myeloid-derived suppressor cells or MDSC) preferentially infiltrates the primary tumor and actively promotes cancer cell dissemination by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CXCL5 is the main chemokine attracting MDSC to the primary tumor. In vitro assay using purified MDSC showed that TGF-β, EGF, and HGF signaling pathways are all used by MDSC to induce EMT in cancer cells. These findings explain how cancer cells acquire a motile phenotype so early and provide a mechanistic explanation for the long recognized link between inflammation and cancer progression.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cancer progression has been depicted as a linear process, during which the incipient cancer cell sequentially accumulates mutations that confer the ability to metastasize. However, recent studies show that cancer cells disseminate early, before such mutations can accumulate, implying the existence of a different, faster route to the metastatic phenotype. Using a mouse model of melanoma, we show that the primary tumor attracts a subset of immune cells that actively promote cancer cell motility, dissemination, and metastasis. These tumor-infiltrating immune cells do so by reactivating a cellular program (mesenchymal transition) used by melanocytes during their development to colonize the skin, and also believed to be an essential step in cancer cell dissemination and metastasis. Once the melanoma cells migrate out of the primary tumor, they can lapse back to their original phenotype and lose their migratory potential. This transient phenotypic switch may accelerate carcinogenesis and participate in the plasticity of cancer. It explains how cancer cells might spread to other organs even before the original tumor is detected. In addition to the evidence gleaned from our mouse melanoma model, we show that these immune cells induce typical features of epithelial-mesechymal transition in both melanoma and bladder human cell lines when examined in culture dishes. These findings provide an underlying mechanism for the long-recognized link between inflammation and cancer progression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tumor metastasis is the primary cause of death by cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Jemal1">[1]</xref>. Metastasis is a multistep process in which cancer cells derived from the primary tumor migrate to regional or distant sites where they re-initiate tumor development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Nguyen1">[2]</xref>. Until recently, the first step of metastasis, (i.e. tumor cell dissemination) was thought to be a late event in cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Fearon1">[3]</xref>. This time-lag was presumably needed to allow selected cancer cells to accumulate the additional mutations required for motility. However, recent work, including that of our laboratory, has challenged this paradigm. In fact, cancer cells disseminate even before diagnosis of the primary tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Bernards1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Husemann1">[6]</xref>, and so a different, faster mechanism must be driving the development of the motile phenotype.</p>
      <p>Tumors do not consist of a homogeneous population of cells; rather they are a composite of cancer cells, mesenchymal and endothelial cells, and immune cell populations. Among these immune cells are the myeloid cells, which are generating increasing interest as having a dynamic influence on tumor growth. The link between cancer progression and infiltration with myeloid cells was recognized by R. Virchow in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Balkwill1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-DeNardo1">[11]</xref>. Infiltration with myeloid cells is usually associated with less favorable clinical outcomes. During the past decade several distinct subsets of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Movahedi1">[12]</xref>, among which CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> MDSC have drawn attention for having a role in cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Bronte1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Ribechini1">[16]</xref>. MDSC, which can be further divided into monocytic (Mo-) MDSC and granulocytic (PMN-) MDSC, accumulate in most malignant murine and human tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Peranzoni1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Youn1">[19]</xref>. These cells have been shown to favor cancer progression by dampening anti-tumor immune responses, promoting angiogenesis, and creating a pre-metastatic environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Yang1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-OstrandRosenberg2">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>RETAAD mice are transgenic for the activated <italic>RET</italic> oncogene, which is specifically expressed in skin and eye melanocytes. RETAAD mice spontaneously develop uveal melanomas that are clinically detectable (exophthalmos) by 4 to 8 wk of age. In fact, microscopic eye tumors can be detected as early as 10 d after birth and cancer cells disseminate from the primary eye tumor throughout the body by 3 wk of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Eyles1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Kato1">[23]</xref>. Disseminated cancer cells can be monitored in the eye draining lymph node and in the lung by measuring ectopic expression of <italic>Dct</italic> (a specific marker of melanocytes) or <italic>RET</italic>. The disseminated cancer cells remain dormant for months before developing into cutaneous and then visceral metastases. Previous work showed that most tumors developing in a given mouse share a common clonal origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Eyles1">[5]</xref>. The stepwise evolution of melanoma in RETAAD mice mimics the natural history of disease progression in cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Eskelin1">[24]</xref>, underlining the suitability of this model for dissecting the role of immune cells in the process of metastasis.</p>
      <p>Although melanocytes are not of epithelial origin, metastatic melanoma cells undergo morphological changes resulting in decreased intercellular adhesion and increased cell motility, a process that morphologically and mechanistically resembles epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Alla1">[25]</xref>. EMT is a trans-differentiation process occurring during embryonic development and in carcinoma progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Thiery1">[26]</xref>. In the present study we used RETAAD mice to examine the presence and role of MDSC in melanoma metastasis. Interestingly, we found that PMN-MDSC preferentially accumulate in the primary tumor where they induce cancer cell EMT. PMN-MDSC favor the rapid acquisition of a motile phenotype by cancer cells resulting in multinodular growth of the primary tumor, dissemination throughout the body and distant metastasis.</p>

        <title>Gradual Accumulation of PMN-MDSC in Tumor-Bearing Mice</title>
        <p>RETAAD mice develop uveal melanoma that metastasizes to the skin and visceral organs. Tumor development at distant sites usually takes more than 6 mo. As previously described in other tumor models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Movahedi2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Youn1">[19]</xref>, we observed an increase in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells in both the spleen and blood during tumor progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s001">Figure S1A and B</xref>, respectively). This increase begins as the primary tumor starts to cause the eye to bulge (exophthalmos) and peaks once distant metastases become palpable. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s001">Figure S1C</xref>, purified CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells strongly inhibited antigen-specific T cell proliferation in vitro and therefore represent bona fide MDSC.</p>

        <title>PMN-MDSC Preferentially Accumulate in Primary Tumors</title>
        <p>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> MDSC are a heterogeneous population of myeloid cells. To further characterize MDSC in the RETAAD model, immune infiltrates of primary tumors and cutaneous metastases were analyzed. CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells represented on average 2.7% (95 CI = 1.9%–3.5%) of the total cells within a tumor, in good agreement with published data on spontaneous melanoma models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Landsberg1">[27]</xref> and uveal melanoma patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Bronkhorst1">[28]</xref>. Among immune cells infiltrating cutaneous tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), lymphoid cells represented 28.6% (95 CI = 20.1%–37.1%). The tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell population comprised CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> dendritic cells (3.6%, 95 CI = 2.5%–4.7%), CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> dendritic cells (5.8%, 95 CI = 4.2%–7.4%), B220<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> plasmacytoid dendritic cells (7.6%, 95 CI = 3.3%–11.0%), CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>−</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages (51.4%, 95 CI = 42%–61%) and CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> MDSC (6.7%, 95 CI = 3.6%–9.8%). MDSC could be further sub-divided into CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>hi</sup> F4/80<sup>−</sup> PMN-MDSC and CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>int</sup>F4/80<sup>lo</sup> Mo-MDSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). Interestingly, while most subsets of immune cells were equally represented in primary tumors and cutaneous metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), PMN-MDSC were 5 times more abundant in primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>, 24.5%±1.5% of immune cells versus 3.9%±0.2%; two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.0001). In order to understand the significance of this finding, we decided to examine the factors controlling the preferential accumulation of PMN-MDSC in the primary tumor and to investigate the role of these cells.</p>

        <title>Primary Tumors Express PMN-MDSC Chemoattractants</title>
        <p>To identify potential mediators of the preferential accumulation of PMN-MDSC in primary tumors, the expression of 148 inflammatory genes including chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, and their corresponding receptors was analyzed using low density qRT-PCR arrays. When primary tumors and cutaneous metastases from the same mice were compared, 21 genes were identified as differentially expressed (fold change &gt;2; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), of which 20 were more highly expressed in the primary tumor than in the corresponding skin tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s008">Table S1</xref>). The most differentially expressed genes (fold change &gt;4 and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) were members of the IL-1 families and, interestingly, four chemokines: CCL19, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5. For example, the average expression of CXCL5 was 56-fold higher in primary tumors than in cutaneous metastases (<italic>p</italic> = 8.38×10<sup>−5</sup>). Transcriptome analysis of purified tumor-infiltrating immune cells indicated that only PMN-MDSC express <italic>Il8rb</italic> (also known as <italic>CXCR2</italic>), the receptor for CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, PMN-MDSC express CXCL1 and CXCL2 while tumors express CXCL5. We therefore tested the capacity of these three chemokines to attract immune cells from tumor-bearing RETAAD mice in vitro. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g001">Figure 1F–H</xref>, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 are indeed potent attractants for PMN-MDSC, but not monocytes or lymphocytes. Moreover, RETAAD tumor cells attracted PMN-MDSC in vitro and this attraction was significantly reduced when PMN-MDSC were treated with either SB265610 or SB225002, two specific inhibitors of CXCR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). To establish the importance of CXCR2 ligands in the recruitment of PMN-MDSC to the primary tumors, bone marrow cells from Rosa mT/mG reporter mice expressing tdTomato (used as fluorescently tagged wild-type [<italic>wt</italic>] cells) and CXCR2 knockout mice expressing GFP (<italic>IL8rb-KO</italic> crossed with mice expressing EGFP under the lysozyme M promoter [<italic>Il8rb-KO</italic>]) were mixed at a 1∶1 ratio and adoptively transferred into tumor-bearing RETAAD mice. After 18 h, primary tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry for Gr1<sup>hi</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup> and Gr1<sup>hi</sup>GFP<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating PMN-MDSC. <italic>Wt</italic> PMN-MDSC were 7-fold more abundant than PMN-MDSC from <italic>Il8rb-KO</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g001">Figure 1J</xref>). This preferential migration was specific for the primary tumor as equal proportions of <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>Il8rb-KO</italic> PMN-MDSC migrated to the spleen. This shows that expression of CXCR2 is necessary for PMN-MDSC migration into the primary tumor in vivo. Of the three CXCR2 ligands, CXCL5 is the most highly expressed in primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) and is therefore likely to be the major mediator of the preferential recruitment of PMN-MDSC to the primary tumor. In summary, primary tumors express unique chemokines that specifically attract PMN-MDSC.</p>

        <p>To gain insight into the role of PMN-MDSC in primary tumors, these cells were depleted using anti-Ly6G antibody NIMP-R14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Nagendra1">[29]</xref>. The first injection of antibodies was given as soon as the primary tumor became visible (5 wk of age), then repeated twice a week, until the age of 20 wk when tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s003">Figure S3A</xref>, scheme B). Antibody treatment ablated PMN-MDSC (CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>hi</sup>) in the primary tumor and spleen (determined at the time of sacrifice) and in the blood for the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Importantly, the monocytic subset of MDSC (Mo-MDSC, CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>lo</sup>F4/80<sup>lo</sup>) was not affected by the depletion, whereas there was a slight increase in macrophage number (CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>−</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>) in the primary tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of PMN-MDSC resulted in reduced growth of the primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) but not cutaneous tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s004">Figure S4</xref>). At 20 wk of age, the mean diameter of primary tumors was 4.7 times smaller in depleted mice compared to mice treated with an isotype control antibody (mean diameter 1.9±0.5 mm versus 0.4±0.2 mm; two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 0.027). Enhanced angiogenesis was unlikely to explain the effect of PMN-MDSC on tumor growth since no significant difference in the density of blood vessels or CD45<sup>−</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells existed between PMN-MDSC-depleted and control tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s005">Figure S5A and B</xref>). In fact, there was a trend towards an increased density of CD45<sup>−</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> cells in the PMN-MDSC depleted mice. Taken together this shows that PMN-MDSC favor the growth of the primary tumor.</p>

        <title>PMN-MDSC Promote Cancer Cell Proliferation in the Primary Tumor</title>
        <p>To elucidate the mechanism by which PMN-MDSC favor growth of the primary tumor, we focused on the early steps of tumorigenesis. The depletion experiment was repeated starting at 1 wk of age, before any eye abnormality was detectable, and the primary tumors were analyzed at 7 wk of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s003">Figure S3A</xref>, scheme A). At this age macroscopic primary tumors are rarely detectable, and when microscopic tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, no difference was observed in the size of the lesion developing in treated and control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s006">Figure S6</xref>). However immunohistochemistry revealed that depletion of PMN-MDSC results in a reduced frequency of proliferating cancer cells, identified by double labeling with S100B- and Ki67-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g002">Figure 2C and D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, at 7 wk of age, primary tumors exhibited a mitotic index of 3.5%±0.6% that was reduced to 1.7%±0.1% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) in PMN-MDSC depleted mice. We calculated that such a 2-fold difference in the mitotic indices would translate into a reduction in tumor diameter of just under 2-fold at 7 wk and 4-fold at 20 wk, showing good agreement with the observed 4.7-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s009">Text S1</xref>).

        <title>PMN-MDSC Secrete Soluble Factors That Promote Cancer Cell Proliferation In Vitro</title>
        <p>To determine whether the effect of PMN-MDSC on cancer cell proliferation was direct or required additional stromal components, in vitro co-culture experiments were performed. Melan-ret cells, a cell line derived from a RET tumor, were co-cultured for 48 h with PMN-MDSC purified from tumor-bearing RETAAD mice. Cancer cell proliferation was measured in vitro by [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation. Addition of PMN-MDSC resulted in increased proliferation of the cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This effect was not due to proliferation of PMN-MDSC since even irradiated PMN-MDSC induced cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.035). Importantly this was specific to PMN-MDSC, as co-culture with F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells purified from tumor-bearing RETAAD mice did not enhance cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, it did not require direct contact between the PMN-MDSC and the cancer cells as increased proliferation was also observed when PMN-MDSC were separated from the cancer cells by a porous membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.025).

        <p>In the RETAAD model, primary tumors of the eye display a multinodular structure.

        <title>PMN-MDSC Induce Cancer Cell EMT In Vivo</title>
        <p>These in vitro findings led us to predict that in vivo depletion of PMN-MDSC would affect the frequency of cancer cells undergoing EMT in the primary tumor. S100A4 (also known as Fsp1) is a small Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein involved in EMT and cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Helfman1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Boye1">[39]</xref>. We measured the number of S100A4<sup>+</sup> melanoma cells in primary tumors. Interestingly, S100A4<sup>+</sup> cells were found specifically in the periphery of tumor nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). Importantly primary tumors from mice depleted of PMN-MDSC between 1 and 7 wk of age possessed a 3.6-fold lower density of S100A4<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g006">Figure 6I</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 3.42×10<sup>−8</sup> in two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test). Similarly, a 3.3-fold decrease was seen in vimentin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g006">Figure 6J</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.035 in paired two-tailed Wilcoxon-test). Closer characterization of S100A4<sup>+</sup> cells in primary tumors showed that there were indeed delaminating melanoma cells expressing HMB45 and MART-1 antigens and exhibiting a fusiform morphology (white arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g006">Figure 6K</xref>). The number of S100A4<sup>+</sup> cells expressing melanoma differentiation antigens was reduced in tumors depleted from PMN-MDSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g006">Figure 6L</xref>). This observation indicates that PMN-MDSC play a crucial role in EMT induction in melanoma cells in vivo.</p>

        <title>PMN-MDSC Induce EMT through Multiple Pathways</title>
        <p>To identify the molecular pathways involved in PMN-MDSC-induced EMT, the various cell subsets present in RETAAD tumors were sorted by flow cytometry before performing transcriptome analysis and searching for known inducers of EMT. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, PMN-MDSC were found to express Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1), while cancer cells were the main source of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). To determine whether these factors played any role in PMN-MDSC-induced EMT, NBT-II cells were pre-treated with various inhibitors before co-culture with PMN-MDSC. After 24 h, NBT-II cells were stained with desmoplakin to visualize the desmosomes that are typically found at the junctions between epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Addition of PMN-MDSC to untreated NBT-II cells resulted in the complete dissociation of the desmosomal complexes at the cell surface and their translocation into the cytoplasm. Cell scattering was strongly reduced by pre-treatment of NBT-II cells with SB525334, a specific inhibitor of the receptor for TGF receptor 1 (TGF-βR1). Nevertheless, most desmoplakin junctions were lost. In contrast, most cells treated with JNJ38877605, a specific inhibitor of the receptor for HGF (HGFR), retain desmoplakin at cell-cell junctions. Further inhibition of EMT was observed when NBT-II cells were pretreated with SB525334 together with JNJ38877605 and/or PD153035, a specific inhibitor of the receptor for EGF (EGFR). Pre-treatment of NBT-II cells with all three inhibitors completely reversed the effect of PMN-MDSC. Similar results were obtained when a different set of inhibitors was used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TGF-β1, EGF, and HGF play a crucial role in EMT induction by PMN-MDSC.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Recent data suggest that primary tumor cells acquire a metastatic phenotype during the early stages of cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Eyles1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Klein1">[40]</xref>. This hypothesis led to a conundrum, as the previously accepted theory of random accumulation of mutations leading to the metastatic phenotype was unable to explain such rapid cancer cell dissemination. Here we show that a particular subset of immune cells preferentially infiltrates primary tumors, induces EMT in primary tumor cells, and promotes cancer cell dissemination. Therefore, in our mouse model of melanoma, acquisition of a motile phenotype by cancer cells is instructed by tumor-infiltrating MDSC and occurs early in the development of the primary tumor.</p>
        <p>MDSC accumulate in the tumors, spleen, and blood of tumor-bearing mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Youn1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Melani1">[41]</xref>. In the RETAAD model, we uncovered a preferential recruitment of PMN-MDSC to primary tumors compared to cutaneous metastases, which correlated with a more inflammatory microenvironment. Importantly the chemokines CCL19, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 were significantly more highly expressed in primary tumors. CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 are known chemoattractants for neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Eash1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Chintakuntlawar1">[43]</xref> and, as shown here for the first time to our knowledge, potent attractants of PMN-MDSC as well. CXCR2, the receptor for CXCL2, CXCL5, and CXCL1, is specifically expressed on PMN-MDSC purified from RETAAD tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Pharmaceutical inhibition of CXCR2 reduced PMN-MDSC attraction by melanoma cells in vitro and genetic deletion of CXCR2 impaired their recruitment to the primary tumor in vivo. Since CXCL5 is the most highly expressed of the three CXCR2 ligands, it is the prime candidate for mediating the preferential attraction of PMN-MDSC to the tumor. In addition, since CXCL1 and CXCL2 are expressed by PMN-MDSC purified from RETAAD tumors, we propose that these two chemokines provide a positive feedback loop that further amplifies the accumulation of PMN-MDSC in primary tumors. Of note, CXCL1 and IL-8, the human ortholog of CXCL5, are expressed by human melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Dhawan1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Gutman1">[45]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Depletion of PMN-MDSC from 1 wk of age resulted in a decreased density of proliferating cells in primary tumors. Although no significant effect on tumor size was detected at 7 wk, when depletion was performed from 5 wk until 20 wk of age, primary tumors were much smaller. Importantly the size of cutaneous metastases, which contain few PMN-MDSC, was not affected by the depletion. Three sets of observations suggest that this effect is due to a direct action of PMN-MDSC on cancer cells. Firstly, highly purified PMN-MDSC stimulated the proliferation of Melan-Ret cells in vitro. This effect was mediated by soluble factors secreted by PMN-MDSC, since it did not require direct contact with the melanoma cells. Secondly, PMN-MDSC were the only tumor-infiltrating cells whose number was reduced by the antibody treatment; monocytes (CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>lo</sup>F4/80<sup>lo</sup>) were unaffected and macrophage (CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>−</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>) density was, if anything, slightly increased. Finally the number of endothelial cells (CD45<sup>−</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup>) was slightly increased in PMN-MDSC depleted tumors, showing that PMN-MDSC stimulated tumor growth independently of angiogenesis.</p>
        <p>EMT has been suggested to be an essential step in cancer cell dissemination and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Thiery2">[36]</xref>. Artificial induction of EMT in cancer cell lines promotes metastatic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Yang2">[46]</xref>. The aggressive behavior of melanoma has been attributed to its propensity to undergo EMT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Gupta1">[47]</xref>. In the present study we show that purified PMN-MDSC induce typical features of EMT in vitro in melanoma and bladder human cell lines and in cells freshly isolated from primary and metastatic RETAAD tumors. In vivo, depletion of PMN-MDSC reduced the density of vimentin and S100A4 expressing cells in the primary tumor. Vimentin is a classical mesenchymal marker, while S100A4, a target of the EMT inducer Snail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Moody1">[48]</xref>, is known to down-regulate E-Cadherin in mammary epithelial cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Keirsebilck1">[49]</xref>. Collectively these observations indicate that PMN-MDSC play a crucial role in cancer cell EMT in vivo. Interestingly, expression of S100A4 correlates with shorter patient survival in several cancers, including melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Andersen1">[50]</xref>.</p>
        <p>PMN-MDSC-induced EMT results in multinodular development of the primary tumor, since mice depleted of PMN-MDSC had primary tumors composed of fewer nodules. This observation is in agreement with previous findings that multinodular growth requires cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Narang1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Ferreira1">[31]</xref>. At 7 wk, decreased nodularity in PMN-MDSC-depleted tumors was observed in the absence of reduction in the whole tumor size, consistent with spatial redistribution of cancer cells, rather than inhibition of their development. In contrast, cutaneous tumors typically do not display such a multinodular structure, which is consistent with their low content of PMN-MDSC. In humans, many primary tumors exhibit higher fractal dimensions than normal tissue, as a result of their multinodular morphology. This morphology is thought to facilitate exponential growth of small avascular tumors, since in silico modeling indicates that the optimal tumor morphology under strong nutrient limitation is fractal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Ferreira1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Norton1">[51]</xref>. Therefore, induction of EMT in cancer cells is likely to be selected because it favors the growth of the primary tumor.</p>
        <p>PMN-MDSC-induced EMT was also associated with cancer cell dissemination and metastatic outgrowth. Cancer cell dissemination was assessed in the regional lymph nodes and in the lungs by measuring <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> expression. As shown previously, <italic>Dct</italic> expression correlates with the presence of S100B<sup>+</sup> melanoma cells detected by IHC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Eyles1">[5]</xref>. PMN-MDSC depletion from 1 wk of age resulted in reduced dissemination by as early as 7 wk. Reduced primary tumor burden could not explain the decreased cancer cell dissemination, since decreased expression of melanoma markers in the mandibular LN and the lungs preceded the effect on primary tumor size: no change in primary tumor size could be detected at 7 wk. Decreased <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> expression after PMN-MDSC depletion could result from decreased influx of and/or decreased proliferation of cancer cells in the lungs. The latter might be expected because PMN-MDSC favor cancer cell proliferation and suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity. We cannot exclude any of these explanations. In fact RETAAD mice possess increased numbers of PMN-MDSC in their lungs when compared with non-transgenic littermates (unpublished data). Furthermore CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells control the proliferation of disseminated cancer cells in the lungs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Eyles1">[5]</xref>. However, in our experiments, <italic>Dct</italic> expression was measured at an early time point (7 wk of age) and lung micrometastases have a low mitotic index in untreated animals (1.9% + 0.5%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Eyles1">[5]</xref>). We calculated that even an 80% inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in the lungs could not account for the observed decrease in <italic>Dct</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001162.s009">Text S1</xref>). Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis of lungs from control and depleted mice at 7 wk revealed mostly individual cancer cells (CD45<sup>-</sup>S100B<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). We therefore favor the interpretation that the decrease observed in <italic>Dct</italic> expression is mainly due to reduced colonization of the lungs by cancer cells rather than reduced proliferation.</p>
        <p>Analysis of cutaneous metastases provided further support for decreased cancer cell dissemination in mice depleted of PMN-MDSC. Since PMN-MDSC poorly infiltrate cutaneous tumors, depletion was less likely to affect cancer cell proliferation in this site. If PMN-MDSC were acting by promoting metastatic growth rather than dissemination, we would expect to see smaller metastases in depleted mice. However, depletion of PMN-MDSC from 1 wk of age reduces the number of cutaneous tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), but not their size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, when PMN-MDSC depletion was started at 5 wk of age (i.e. 2–3 wk after the initiation of cancer cell dissemination), no significant change was seen in the number of cutaneous metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This shows that metastatic potential had already been acquired at 5 wk and that cancer cells disseminating before 5 wk contain tumor initiating cells.</p>
        <p>Depletion of PMN-MDSC resulted in a very significant inhibition of tumor cell dissemination (85% reduction in the draining lymph node, 74% in the lung, 40% reduction in the incidence of cutaneous tumors) and EMT (68% reduction in S100A4<sup>+</sup> cells and 70% reduction in vimentin<sup>+</sup> cells). Other tumor infiltrating immune cells have been shown to favor metastasis. In a mammary tumor model, CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells were shown to accumulate in the primary tumor and promote metastasis through increased production of MMP. Interestingly, in this model, EMT was not involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Yang3">[52]</xref>. In a model of colorectal cancer, accumulation of immature myeloid cells distinct from MDSC favored invasion through the production of MMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Kitamura1">[53]</xref>. PMN-MDSC from RETAAD tumors also produce MMP, mostly MMP9, but when RETAAD mice were crossed to an MMP9-KO background, no significant difference was observed in cancer cell dissemination or in the incidence of cutaneous metastases (unpublished data). Therefore, myeloid cells that infiltrate the primary tumor could contribute to metastasis through more than one mechanism.</p>
        <p>Transcriptome analysis of the various cell subsets purified from RETAAD tumors showed that PMN-MDSC express TGF-β1 and HGF, whereas melanoma cells express EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001162-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This observation extends previous studies in a mammary tumor model showing that MDSC represent an abundant source of intratumoral TGF-β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Yang3">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Bierie1">[54]</xref>. We found that specific inhibitors of the corresponding receptors blocked PMN-MDSC mediated induction of EMT. The fact that EGF inhibitors reduced EMT induction while PMN-MDSC purified from RETAAD tumors did not produce EGF may suggest that PMN-MDSC stimulate EGF production by the cancer cells.</p>
        <p>Cancer progression has been often depicted as a linear process, during which the incipient cancer cell sequentially accumulates genetic and epigenetic changes that confer the hallmarks of cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Cahill1">[55]</xref>. Here we show that some of these properties can be induced by cues provided by the immune stroma of the primary tumor. Once the cell migrates out of the primary tumor, it may well lapse back to its original phenotype and, for example, undergo mesenchymal-epithelial transformation. Such a transient phenotypic switch may accelerate carcinogenesis and participate in the plasticity of cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Chaffer1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Ledford1">[57]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Tumor infiltration by myeloid cells is associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients. Most studies have focused on the role of macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Mantovani1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Qian1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Doedens1">[61]</xref>, whereas MDSC have been primarily characterized for their effects on immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Movahedi2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Greifenberg1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Corzo1">[66]</xref>, stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Rosenberg1">[67]</xref>, or endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Yang4">[68]</xref>. The present study demonstrates for the first time that PMN-MDSC act on cancer cells to promote proliferation, EMT, and dissemination. In turn, it provides a mechanistic explanation for the long-recognized link between inflammation and cancer progression.</p>

CXCL2 was analyzed separately using the following primers: 5’-AGTGAACTGCGCTGTCAATG-3’ and 5’-GAGAGTGGCTATGACTTCTGTCTG-3’. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH expression, and <italic>p</italic> values were calculated using a two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test. <italic>Dct</italic> expression was measured as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001162-Eyles1">[5]</xref>.</p>
