<abstract>
<p>Inter-individual variation in regulatory circuits controlling gene expression is a powerful source of functional information. The study of associations among genetic variants and gene expression provides important insights about cell circuitry but cannot specify whether and when potential variants dynamically alter their genetic effect during the course of response. Here we develop a computational procedure that captures temporal changes in genetic effects, and apply it to analyze transcription during inhibition of the TOR signaling pathway in segregating yeast cells. We found a high-order coordination of gene modules: sets of genes co-associated with the same genetic variant and sharing a common temporal genetic effect pattern. The temporal genetic effects of some modules represented a single state-transitioning pattern; for example, at 10–30 minutes following stimulation, genetic effects in the phosphate utilization module attained a characteristic transition to a new steady state. In contrast, another module showed an impulse pattern of genetic effects; for example, in the poor nitrogen sources utilization module, a spike up of a genetic effect at 10–20 minutes following stimulation reflected inter-individual variation in the timing (rather than magnitude) of response. Our analysis suggests that the same mechanism typically leads to both inter-individual variation and the temporal genetic effect pattern in a module. Our methodology provides a quantitative genetic approach to studying the molecular mechanisms that shape dynamic changes in transcriptional responses.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genetic variation is postulated to play a major role in transcriptional responses to stimulation. Such process involves two inter-related dynamic processes: first, the time-dependent changes in gene expression, and second, the time-dependent changes in genetic effects. Although the dynamics of gene expression has been extensively investigated, the dynamics of genetic effects yet remain poorly understood. Here we develop DyVER, a method that combines genotyping with time-series gene expression data to uncover the timing of transitions in the magnitude of genetic effects. We examine gene expression in yeast segregants during rapamycin response, finding several distinct ways of change in the magnitude of genetic effects over time. These include impulse-like and sustained transitions in genetic effects, acting both in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>. Our findings suggest that associations of genes with the same genetic variant often occur via the same timing of state transition in genetic effects. Furthermore, the results uncover a previously unknown variant whose impulse-like temporal genetic effect suggests a novel molecular function for determining the timing rather than the magnitude of response. Our results show that steady-state association studies miss important genetic information, and demonstrate the power of DyVER to render a comprehensive map of dynamic changes in genetic effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inherited variation in gene expression is likely to have a major effect on cellular and disease phenotypes, and may allow the underlying DNA polymorphisms (genetic variants) to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Schadt1">[1]</xref>. The <italic>genetic effect</italic> of a particular variant on a certain RNA is the quantitative change in gene expression that is associated with changing the variant's genotype (allele). Two recent studies have demonstrated that genetic effects on longitudinal gene expression data might be either stable – where the genetic effect is similar at all time points (a <italic>non-dynamic effect pattern</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>) – or flexible, changing the magnitude of effect during time points (<italic>a dynamic effect pattern</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B,C</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-GatViks1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Francesconi1">[3]</xref>.</p>

<title>Temporal genetic effect patterns.</title>
<p>Schematic view of gene expression patterns (top) and the relevant temporal genetic effects for these genes (bottom). The cartoons demonstrate a <italic>non-dynamic genetic effect pattern</italic> (<bold>A</bold>), a <italic>dynamic, linear genetic effect pattern</italic> (<bold>B</bold>), and a <italic>dynamic</italic>, <italic>non-linear genetic effect pattern</italic> (<bold>C</bold>). Top: shown are gene expression levels (<italic>y</italic>-axis) during a response to stimulation (<italic>x-</italic>axis). Each curve represents measurements in a different homozygous animal strain (segregants), where brown or black indicates whether the genotype of the associated genetic variant is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively, in each strain. Bottom: shown are <italic>genetic effects</italic> (that is, the change in gene expression between the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> -carrying and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> -carrying strains, <italic>y</italic>-axis) during a response to stimulation (<italic>x-</italic>axis).

<p>Dynamic effect patterns may be described in terms of the shape of changes in genetic effects over time. A <italic>linear-like genetic effect pattern</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>) reflects a gradual change in the magnitude of genetic effects, whereas in a <italic>non-linear genetic effect pattern</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>), the level of genetic effect is sustained in some time periods and spikes up or down in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>). In most studies, transcription responses across individuals have been monitored only in two time points (before and after stimulation) and therefore the dynamics of changes in genetic effects over time could not be characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Gargalovic1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Barreiro1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Understanding non-linear genetic effects can, in principle, allow the <italic>timing</italic> of influence of certain regulatory mechanisms to be revealed. For example, a single state-transitioning in genetic effects may uncover the timing of alteration in a regulatory mechanism interacting with a genetic variant (e.g., transition to a new steady state at t<sub>3</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>, <bold>left</bold>). Such a mechanism can be revealed even when additional mechanisms are acting in parallel (e.g., up-regulation during the entire time course; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>, <bold>left</bold>). The linear genetic effect pattern, in contrast, lacks sharp alterations and therefore does not specify finely-timed information about regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>This study is focused on mapping temporal patterns of non-linear genetic effects and using this information to address major questions about dynamic transcription responses. Which dynamic genetic effect patterns are prevalent in global gene responses? Are there any general principles - either functional or mechanistic - shared among genes carrying the same temporal genetic effect patterns? Can we derive insights about the mechanisms underlying such dynamic genetic effect patterns?</p>
<p>Here we developed DyVER (Dynamic Variant Effect on Response), a statistical framework to predict genetic variants and study their dynamic changes in genetic effect sizes. DyVER was mainly designed to achieve an accurate detection of non-linear genetic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>) during time points. The methodology is based on the notion of a two-state digital model that pinpoints the particular time point at which a rapid change in genetic effects occurs; it is therefore suitable for revealing the timing of state transitions in genetic effects. DyVER takes as input synchronous data in several time points and across a population, and is tailored for recombinant inbred strains that are commonly utilized in genetic studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-GatViks1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Peters1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Yvert1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>DyVER differs from extant genetic approaches in several aspects. First, some existing methods construct a full model of the response curve across individuals. Their number of parameters is therefore increasing with the number of time points (<italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Furlotte1">[15]</xref>). DyVER, in contrast, is primarily designed for the specific task of identifying the time points of alterations in effect sizes. This partial modeling allows the use of only a small number of parameters regardless the number of time points and the shape of the temporal pattern. Secondly, DyVER is focused on modeling the dynamics in genetic effects while eliminating the confounding gene expression variables. This is unlike extant approaches, which commonly fit both gene expression and genetic effects to a certain function over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Francesconi2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Furlotte1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Li1">[20]</xref>. Finally, if desired, DyVER can exploit the order in the input time course data, unlike several approaches that are based on unordered correlated traits (e.g., multivariate methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Jiang1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Banerjee1">[22]</xref> or dimension reduction methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Gilbert1">[23]</xref>). Notably, DyVER is a practical translation of differential expression approaches (with or without time-series data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Chechik1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Stegle1">[26]</xref>) for the case of statistical genetic studies.</p>
<p>Here we report on the use of DyVER to investigate temporal gene responses at six time points after stimulation with the TOR inhibitor rapamycin and across genotyped yeast segregants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Yeung1">[27]</xref>. The results depict a complex map of non-linear changes in genetic effects. We identify a causal variant that affects the timing of spike up in transcript levels. Importantly, our findings suggest a previously unknown high-order temporal coordination of genetic effects: modules of genes influenced by a common dynamic genetic variant not only participated in the same biological pathway, but also shared orchestrated dynamics of genetic effects. Based on this modularity, we hypothesize that in some cases dynamic effect patterns are a property of the regulatory mechanism within which a genetic variant resides (rather than a property of the target responding transcript). We demonstrate that using this notion it is possible to enhance the identification of underlying causal genes based on their characteristic temporal effect pattern. Our results indicate the utility of studying dynamic genetic effects acting on global gene transcription.</p>

<title>DyVER: A method for inferring dynamic, non-linear genetic effects</title>
<p>We devised a new method, DyVER, to identify genetic variants that underlie the expression of genes and their particular dynamic effect patterns. DyVER takes as input the measured transcription response of a gene over several consecutive time points following stimulation and across a cohort, as well as a set of potential genetic variants and their genotyping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). Given a candidate genetic variant with two alternative alleles, DyVER proceeds in three steps (<bold>Methods</bold>): (1) It first calculates the <italic>observed effect</italic> of the variant, namely the difference in gene response between strains carrying the two distinct alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>). The observed genetic effects are used as data in the subsequent steps. (2) To identify non-linear dynamic shapes of genetic effects, DyVER assumes a ‘digital’ regulatory model that distinguishes two possible states of genetic effects: first, a strong effect of genetic variant on the gene response (denoted the <italic>high-effect state</italic>); and second, a lower (such as zero) effect, or possibly an opposite effect (denoted the <italic>low-effect state</italic>). Several previous methods have employed a two-state model, although not in a dynamic or a genetic effect context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Flutre1">[28]</xref>. Based on a maximum likelihood approach, DyVER seeks a genetic variant and a sequence of states that best describe the dynamic changes in the size of the genetic effect. For example, if a gene is affected mainly by a variant <italic>v</italic> during a late time interval, DyVER successfully infers the correct effect pattern low→low→high→high for the correct variant <italic>v</italic> as it attains the highest likelihood score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B and C, right panel</bold></xref>). For incorrect variants, the likelihood scores are typically lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B and C, left panel</bold></xref>). DyVER's predicted sequence of states is referred to as the <italic>temporal two-state model</italic>. Finally, (3) DyVER calculates the statistical significance of association for each genetic variant based on a likelihood ratio score that takes as input the inferred temporal two-state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref>). We refer to this score as the <italic>DyVER score</italic>. Notably, although DyVER requires synchronous observations in particular time points, it is still possible to apply DyVER on partial observations in each of the time points (<bold>Methods</bold>).</p>

<p>Overall, step 1 allows DyVER to focus on dynamics in genetic effects regardless of the magnitude of transcription response, whereas the discrete modeling in step 2 allows detecting any sequence of spikes up or down in genetic effects. The two-state model from step 2 enhances the performance of the DyVER score (step 3) by allowing a separate parameterization for each of the states. Specifically, to infer an optimal temporal two-state model, DyVER uses a two-state hidden Markov process where the observed effects are treated as the outcome of a sequence of hidden high-effect and low-effect states (step 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>). The corresponding likelihood function consists of two components: (i) the <italic>probability of observed effects</italic> given a certain temporal two-state model; and (ii) the <italic>probability of a temporal two-state model</italic>, which may use a <italic>penalty</italic> factor to prioritize two-state models with a lower number of transitions between states, assuming dependencies among consecutive time points. In the absence of penalty, the order of time points is irrelevant and therefore the predicted two-state model can be viewed as a partition of an unordered group of time points into two sub-groups. The DyVER score exploits this partition for a different parameterization of the (unordered) time points in each of the two states. The addition of the penalty factor makes it possible to avoid an overfitted two-state model that is then given as input to the next step, hence further improving the DyVER score's performance.</p>

<title>DyVER accurately identifies dynamic genetic effects over time</title>
<p>We compared DyVER's performance to that of five alternative methods. In the first method, the most naïve approach, an ANOVA test is applied at each time point independently and the predicted genetic variant is the one with the most significant (minimal) ANOVA <italic>P</italic> value score. The second method builds on dimension reduction using principal component analysis (PCA): Given <italic>T</italic> time points for each strain as input, it first reduces the <italic>T</italic>-dimensionality of the data into a single dimension by projecting each strain onto the first principal component. Next, it applies an ANOVA test on this one-dimensional data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Gilbert1">[23]</xref>. The third method models dynamics in gene expression as well as dynamics in genetic effect sizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Furlotte1">[15]</xref>. For comparison, in the fourth method, a linear time term is included as a covariate in the ANOVA test to model dynamic changes in gene expression (without direct modeling of dynamics in genetic effects). Finally, we compared DyVER to a random prediction of association relationships. We called these approaches ‘naïve’, ‘PCA’, ‘detailed dynamics’, ‘expression dynamics’ and ‘random’, respectively. In both DyVER and all compared methods, for each simulated gene, the resulting <italic>P</italic> values were Bonferroni-corrected for the testing of multiple genetic variants. The quality of predicted variants were evaluated using the accuracy metric, defined as the tradeoff between the sensitivity and specificity of revealing genetic variants across different significance cutoffs. The accuracy metric ranges between 0 and 1 for poor and excellent performance, respectively (<bold>Methods</bold>).</p>
<p>To characterize DyVER's ability to reveal dynamic genetic variants and distinguish their effect patterns, we generated synthetic collections of genes that are associated with genetic variants over time. A single synthetic ‘collection’ consisted of 500 genes, 300 of them associated with a genetic variant over time, with two characteristic parameters: (i) the number of time points, and (ii) the effect size (in all cases we used 50 strains and 100 genetic variants). In a complete synthetic ‘dataset’ we generated 72 collections for various numbers of time points and effect size values. Overall, four synthetic datasets were generated in this study, each consisting of a different key class of dynamic effect patterns (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>): a linear-like pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>), a single state-transitioning based on a sigmoid function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref><bold>, left</bold>), and impulse and multiple-pulse (complex) patterns based on the product of two sigmoid functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>, <bold>middle</bold> and <bold>right</bold>, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Chechik1">[24]</xref>. In the following, we first analyze the performance of the DyVER's predicted associations (based on the DyVER score) in the absence of penalty and then present the contribution of the penalty factor.</p>
<p>DyVER showed good accuracy in all non-linear dynamic effect patterns (0.5 penalty; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref> presents the accuracy metric for synthetic datasets of varying numbers of time points. Accuracy values are averaged across the eight collections of distinct effect size. In all non-linear dynamic effect patterns, DyVER displayed the best accuracy in all tested time points ranging between 3 and 27, with improved accuracy for a larger number of time points. Importantly, although DyVER was not designed for linear-like effect patterns, it still attains the second-best performance for this case. The ‘expression dynamics’ approach yielded the most accurate predictions for the linear case, but attained poor results in the non-linear case. The tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity in the accuracy measure across the different methods is further demonstrated in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold> and <bold>B</bold>.

<p>We next aimed to characterize DyVER's applicability to short-term steady state of high genetic effects. To tackle this goal we compared two synthetic impulse datasets, both consisting of 27 time points across various effect sizes. For all genes, the short-impulse dataset consisted of a high-effect steady state of short duration (five time points), whereas the long-impulse dataset consisted of a high-effect steady state of long duration (fifteen time points). <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s004">Figure S4A</xref></bold> records the performance of DyVER compared to the five alternative methods on the short-impulse and the long-impulse datasets, and clearly shows that DyVER outperformed the alternative procedures when genetic influences were acting in short impulses, even with low-effect sizes.</p>
<p>The performance of both DyVER and the alternative methods declined when applied on a short impulse compared to a long impulse of genetic effects, but notably, the performance reduction was lowest with DyVER (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s004">Figure S4B</xref></bold>). For example, for high-effect sizes (0.625), the sensitivity of DyVER is 0.7 and 1 with short and long impulses, respectively. The sensitivity of PCA, in contrast, is respectively 0.47 and 1 with short and long impulses for the same effect size. Thus, even when genetic variants acted during short time intervals, DyVER still performed relatively well. This was unlike the alternative methods, whose performances were drastically reduced even for relatively high-effect sizes.</p>
<p>DyVER predicts a temporal two-state model, which may provide insights concerning the timing of changes in genetic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>). To evaluate the quality of this prediction, we compared the ‘ground truth’ (simulated) models against the inferred two-state models. We chose to work with the established error rate statistics, defined as the number of erroneous two-state models expressed as a fraction of the total number of significant correctly predicted variants. We called this metric a <italic>two-state pattern error rate</italic> (in short, error rate), and calculated it both for the case of stringent (exact) matching or flexible (non-exact) matching between the true and inferred models (<bold>Methods</bold>). In both cases, we found that DyVER performs well in predicting two-state models, where the flexible case outperforms the stringent case, as expected. For example, using single state-transitioning patterns with nine time points, effect size 0.75, significance cutoff 0.001 and the absence of penalty (probability of transition 0.5), the stringent and flexible error rates are 0.41 and 0.33, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>). The error rate increased with decreasing penalty (e.g., for transition probabilities of 0.01 (high penalty) and 0.5 (no penalty), stringent error rates are 0.32 and 0.41, respectively). As expected, error rates rose when a higher statistical significance cutoff (0.05) was used, whereas the gap between the error rates for different significance cutoffs remained relatively constant when the penalty increased. Results obtained for other effect sizes were similar.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results indicated that DyVER outperforms extant methods even in the absence of penalty and the presence of missing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s001">Figures S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s004">S4</xref></bold>), and that these performance can be even enhanced by the addition of a penalty component (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>). These results hold when the complexity of dynamic effect patterns is relatively low, as in the case of genetic effects in biological data (<italic>e.g</italic>., <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s006">Figure S6</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The partition revealed three prototypical non-linear genetic effect patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>), including (i) a single upward spike followed by a sustained high level of genetic effect (70 genes in C1–C4). These different groups were characterized by distinct timing of a state-transitioning, including an abrupt change in early time points (0–10 min, C1), as well as an intermediate-early (0–20 min, C2) and intermediate-late (20–30 min, C3) single state-transitioning. For example, <italic>SFA1</italic> and <italic>ESF1</italic> (in groups C1, C2) demonstrate a sustained genetic effect with a state transition at 0–10 and 0–20 minutes after rapamycin stimulation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). In the case of the four genes exhibiting a late state-transitioning (at 30–50 min, C4), a sustained new level of genetic effects might occur at later time points that were not measured in the current dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Yeung1">[27]</xref>. (ii) A single downward spike of genetic effect (C5–C6, 22 genes). In group C5, we observe an abrupt downward spike in 10–20 minutes followed by a sustained low level of genetic effect (for example, <italic>PHM6</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Group C6 represents a delayed gradual single state-transitioning during 20–50 minutes. (iii) An impulse of high genetic effect at 10–30 minutes after treatment (9 genes in C7, e.g., <italic>UGA4</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Overall, the single state-transitioning patterns were over-represented, whereas complex patterns of genetic effects were rare (1 gene, <italic>YER053C-A</italic>) and were under-represented [<italic>cis</italic>: <italic>P</italic> value &lt;10<sup>−19</sup>, <italic>trans</italic>: <italic>P</italic> value &lt;10<sup>−50</sup> (<italic>t</italic>-test), (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s006">Figure S6A</xref></bold>)].

<title>High-order coordination suggests that dynamic effect patterns are an emergent property of genetic variants</title>

Functional enrichment strongly related all six modules with specific biochemical pathways.

<p>Next we examined whether module genes show characteristic temporal effect patterns. On analyzing the modules we found that modules nos. 1, 3, 4, 5-I and 5-II relate to a specific prototypic temporal genetic effect pattern, whereas the remaining two modules (nos. 2 and 6) are more general and show several distinct patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). For example, module no. 1 contains 34 genes, 32 of which have an upward spike (a single state transition) of genetic effect at 10–30 minutes after rapamycin stimulation [FDR 0.01 (hyper-geometric test)]. As another example, module no. 3 contains five genes, all showing a downward spike of genetic effects at 10–30 minutes after stimulation. Specifically the downward spike occurs either 20–30 minutes after stimulation [4 genes, FDR 0.01 (hyper-geometric test)] or 10–20 minutes after stimulation (1 gene, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A–C</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s009">Figure S9C</xref></bold>). Overall, we found four modules with over-represented patterns of single state-transitioning at specific time points (nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5-I) and one sub-module of an impulse effect pattern (no. 5-II). The observed coordination of temporal genetic effects does not necessarily reflect a coordination of transcription responses (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s010">Figure S10</xref></bold>). In previous reports, baseline expression levels were used to identify eight genetic variants underlying similar modules (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s017">Table S2</xref></bold>), but the coordinated temporal genetic effects and the timing of upward or downward spikes of genetic effects were not characterized.</p>
<p>A plausible explanation for the ‘shared variant, shared temporal genetic effect pattern’ hypothesis is that the same molecular mechanism underlies both inter-individual variation and the dynamics of genetic effects. In such cases, the dynamic pattern of effect is an attribute of the underlying regulatory mechanism (rather than of the target genes), probably owing to temporal changes in the influence or activity of the regulatory mechanism. This hypothesis is further supported by the consistency in the timing of state transitions in module genes and their underlying (known) causal genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g005"><bold>Figs. 5D</bold></xref> versus <bold>5E</bold>): The <italic>trans</italic>-associated causal gene of module no. 1 (<italic>IRA2</italic>) attains a sustained-like pattern of gene expression that resembles the temporal genetic effect pattern of its target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D and E</bold></xref>, <bold>left</bold>). The <italic>cis</italic>-associated causal genes in modules nos. 3 and 4 (<italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>GPA1</italic>) exhibit drastic changes in their transcription response at the same time point at which there is a (downward or upward) spike in the genetic effect of their target genes (20–30 and 30–40 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D and E</bold></xref>, <bold>middle</bold> and <bold>right</bold>, respectively).</p>

<p>The impulse pattern reflects a difference in the timing of initiation of response among the strains carrying the RM and BY alleles in Chr2: 533–562 kb. For example, strains carrying the BY allele showed early up-regulation of <italic>DAL80</italic> in response to rapamycin, which was already detected at 10 minutes after stimulation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we present the DyVER computational algorithm for identifying genetic variants that lead to dynamic changes in genetic effects. DyVER was tailored to identify abrupt changes in the levels of genetic effects, which may provide valuable information about the timing of alterations in the particular regulatory mechanisms interacting with the underlying genetic variant. In comparison with other approaches, DyVER attained the most accurate identification of non-linear genetic effect patterns, even in the absence of penalty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s001">Figures S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s004">S4</xref></bold>), likely due to (i) a focus on genetic effects rather than on modeling the original phenotype values, and (ii) the prior knowledge about the separation of the time points into two distinct groups that differ in their observed effects (encoded in the temporal two-state model), thus allowing a different parameterization for each of these groups.</p>
<p>DyVER is using an HMM-based model for revealing genetic variants acting on time-series gene expression data. HMM modeling has been applied in various contexts, but not for the case of direct identification of underlying genetic variants. For example, HMM has been utilized for the identification of CNVs or haplotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Mott1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Wang1">[34]</xref>. Alternatively, an existing method was mainly focused on revealing differential expression between conditions using an HMM approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Stegle1">[26]</xref>. DyVER extends this method by providing a statistical genetics <italic>P</italic> value score and by allowing a number of parameters that is not increasing with the number of strains.</p>
<p>Our method opens multiple directions for future investigations. First, it is important to extend DyVER for the case of outbred heterozygous population, including human. In the current study, DyVER was designed for the case of a inbred (homozygous) strains that are common in genetic studies (e.g., in yeast, nematode, fly, mouse and rat) due to several major advantages: first, inbred strain enable controlled stimulations, and second, they avoid major challenges that are common in human genetics, including haplotype analysis, rare variants and uncontrolled variables. Future extensions may generalize the method for the heterozygous case, possibly by calculating genetic effects between each pair of genotypes (rather than between the only two possible genotypes as in the homozygous case), requiring to add additional one or two Gaussians within each of the model states. Second, the usage of a our probabilistic model leads to several limitations: the number of states should be specified in advance; we only capture correlations between sequential time points but cannot capture higher-order correlations among time points; and we generally assume that the probability of a time point is independent of the probabilities of its neighboring time points. Future improvements that handle more than two states and a more sophisticated probabilistic graphical model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Koller1">[35]</xref> may therefore enhance DyVER's performance. Third, DyVER relies on at least a few synchronized strains in each of the time points. Although DyVER allows missing data and possibly different strains in different time points (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>), it still cannot be applied on non-synchronous data (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Francesconi2">[11]</xref>). Data imputation methods can potentially enhance the DyVER analysis beyond this synchronization requirement.</p>
<p>Building on the DyVER approach, we analyzed temporal gene expression patterns following rapamycin treatment in yeast segregants. Our analysis identified 105 genes exhibiting significant non-linear genetic effects over time, 56 of them are well-established associations (in modules 1,2,3,4,5-I and 6), and the remaining genes are new candidates for future experimental investigations (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). For example, our study suggests a novel genetic variant residing in chr2: 533–562 kb as the underlying regulator of the timing of upward spikes in gene expression after rapamycin treatment. Reassuringly, this regulator acts primarily on genes that play a role in poor nitrogen source degradation (6 of 6 genes, module 5-II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g006"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The application of DyVER in yeast provided several novel insights that were mainly attained due to the unique capability of DyVER to classify associations based on their optimized temporal effect patterns. First, we use the temporal effect pattern to automatically organize the genes into clusters based on their predicted patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s012">Figure S12</xref></bold>). This organization is substantially different from previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-GatViks1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Francesconi2">[11]</xref> that have grouped time-series associations only manually. Based on this clustering, we found that abrupt single state-transitioning and impulse patterns occur in certain prototypical time points. In particular, DyVER identified an upward spike of genetic effect at 0–10, 0–20, 20–30 and 30–50 minutes (22, 34, 10 and 4 genes, groups C1, C2, C3 and C4, respectively); a downward spike followed by a new sustained low level of genetic effect (6 and 16 genes at 10–20 and 20–50 minutes, groups C5 and C6, respectively), and a single pulse of high genetic effects (9 genes, group C7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g004"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Second, many studies have shown that groups of co-associated genes also share similar functionalities. Interestingly, our results indicate that such co-associated genes typically share not only a similar functionality, but also a similar predicted pattern of temporal genetic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). One plausible explanation is that a causal regulator typically alters its functionality during its response to stimulation; therefore, a genetic variant interacting with such a regulator is likely to affect its target only during those time intervals in which the regulator is functional. Based on this rationale, the temporal effect patterns in target genes may uncover the temporal dynamics of their causal regulatory mechanisms. Thus, DyVER's characterization of temporal effect patterns, which are probably a property of the causal regulatory mechanisms, may provide a starting point for improved identification of causal genes. For example, it might be possible to pinpoint a causal gene in a genomic interval based on its predicted dynamics over time (as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D and E</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s011">Figure S11C</xref></bold>). Furthermore, it may be possible to discriminate between two genetic variants differing in their dynamic over time, even when these variants are co-localized at a nearby genomic position (as in module nos. 5-I and 5-II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results highlight the utility of studying temporal genetic effect patterns to discover and characterize dynamic causal regulators. The next step is to extend and apply our approach to map genetic effects in transcriptome of a wide range of mammalian cell types.</p>

<title>Calculating the observed effects</title>
<p>Typically, the expression of a gene is affected mainly by stimulation and is further modulated by a genetic variant. To successfully detect the minute effects of genetic variants, it is necessary to remove the confounding effects of the stimulation. Hence, our first step is to calculate the differences between expression values of strains carrying different alleles. We term these differences the ‘<italic>observed effects</italic>’, and we use this collection of observed effects in the rest of the method. For example, when a genetic variant acts, its observed effect values are usually high (e.g., time points <italic>t<sub>3</sub></italic> and <italic>t<sub>4</sub></italic> in variant <italic>v</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A and B</bold></xref>); much lower effect values are observed in the absence of influence (e.g., time points <italic>t<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>t<sub>2</sub></italic> in variant <italic>v</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A and B</bold></xref>) or when a wrong genetic variant is tested (e.g., variant <italic>u</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003984-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>More precisely, given a time point <italic>t</italic>, the putative effect of a variant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on two strains <italic>i,j</italic> carrying its <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> alleles is: <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003984.e025"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

<p>Since DyVER assumes that the variance of the genetic effects is not changing over time, variance stabilization methods should be applied before or after calculating the observed effects. In this study we first normalized the log-transformed expression level in each time point so that the variance in each time point and each allele is fixed (but the mean values remain unchanged). The observed effects were calculated only after this transformation.</p>

We calculate an empirical <italic>P</italic> value, defined as the proportion of permutation tests for which the DyVER score is larger than the observed (non-permutated) score. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s013">Figure S13</xref></bold> indicates that the DyVER score <italic>P</italic> value is indeed well-calibrated using a Q-Q plot analysis. Reported <italic>predicted association(s)</italic> are those with significant DyVER scores.</p>
<p>Notably, in standard genetic methods, the null model's input dataset is similar for different variants. For example, the null model of a regression analysis utilizes the same data values but with variant-specific predictors; the null model of an ANOVA test is variant-independent. In the same sense, the null model of the DyVER score is based on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that is calculated based on all possible pairs of strains regardless the variant under study. Alternative scores – focusing solely on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and omitting the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> component (e.g., <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s014">Figure S14</xref></bold>) – have not been used throughout this study since they are prone to attaining <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> datasets with an entirely different set of strains pairs for different variants.</p>
<p>In a post-processing step, it is also possible to evaluate the dynamic nature of DyVER's predicted associations. To this end, the <italic>dynamic association score</italic> may test the significance of the difference between the observed effects of the high-effect and the low-effect states (a <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic> value score). The partition into high-effect and low-effect states is determined by the predicted temporal two-state model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from eq. 6). <italic>Predicted dynamic associations</italic> are those predicted associations for which there is a significant dynamic association score. Whereas the DyVER score is a statistical genetics score that identifies an underlying genetic variant, the dynamic association score evaluates temporal changes for this variant.</p>
<p>Since the calculation of observed effect and likelihood measures are calculated in each time point independently of its neighbors (eqs. 1–6), and since our scoring scheme relies only on these measures, thus the input data in each time point may consists of a different population of strains with a different population size. In particular, as long as the input data consists of multiple synchronous strains in each time point, DyVER allows missing data without a requirement for data imputation. DyVER's executable and source code, including an option for an additional imputation based on flanking time points of the same strain, can be downloaded from csgi.tau.ac.il/dyver.</p>

<title>Synthetic data</title>
<p>To generate synthetic data we first generated 50 strains carrying 100 genetic variants, sampling one of the two alleles with equal probabilities. A single synthetic collection consists of 500 genes, of which 300 are associated with a certain variant over T time points. Overall, for a single dataset we generated 72 collections, constructed for all combinations of eight possible ‘effect sizes’ (defined below, ranging between 0.125 and 1) and nine different numbers of time points (ranging between 3 and 27). In all cases, the low-effect state represents the absence of effect (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the high-effect state represents the presence of an effect (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the effect size. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the simulated observed effect, which is generated by sampling <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from a Gaussian distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A dataset was constructed for each class of temporal effect patterns. For a single state transition effect pattern (here, sustained) we used a sigmoid function:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003984.e097"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, q = v = 0.5 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For an impulse effect pattern we used the product of two sigmoid function with five parameters<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> [24], where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the length of the impulse effect (here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>):<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003984.e104"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>To generate the complex pattern for T time points we concatenated two impulse patterns, each for T/2 time points. For the dataset of linear effect patterns, observed effects are sampled from a linear function: <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003984.e105"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>For the purpose of comparing predicted to gold-standard temporal two-state models (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>) we generated a different collection of synthetic sustained dataset as follows: we first generated the temporal two-state model by sampling from the corresponding distribution (from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003984.e043">equation 3</xref>) with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The observed effects were then generated by sampling from the corresponding Gaussian distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the mean of the high- and low-effect state, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To generate an input with a percentage of <italic>k%</italic> missing data, in each time point, we omitted the information for <italic>k%</italic> randomly selected strains (thus, each time point consists of a different list of strains).</p>
<p>An additional synthetic dataset was created similarly to the above datasets, but using previously published functions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Francesconi2">[11]</xref>. For each of the 300 associated genes in this synthetic dataset, we first randomly chose a function out of the 18 functions that were published in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; the observed effects were then sampled from this selected function.</p>
<p>The compared methods were implemented as follows. In the ‘naïve’ method we assumed a simple fixed effect model on each time point independently, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the observed expression level for strain <italic>j</italic> carrying genotype <italic>i</italic>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is fixed effect of genotype <italic>i</italic> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The most significant (minimal) ANOVA <italic>P</italic> value score is taken as the resulting <italic>P</italic> value. In the ‘PCA’ method, we project the <italic>T</italic>-dimensionality of each strain into the first principal component and then applies an ANOVA test assuming a fixed effect model <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the first principal component for strain j carrying genotype <italic>i</italic>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the fixed effect of genotype <italic>i</italic> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the first principle component was chosen since it performs better than the consecutive components, see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s015">Figure S15</xref></bold>). For the ‘expression dynamics’ method, we used the model <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the observed expression level in time point <italic>t</italic> for strain <italic>j</italic> carrying genotype <italic>i</italic>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are two fixed effects for genotype <italic>i</italic> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003984.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The formulation was implemented using the <italic>lme4</italic> R package. In all cases above, an <italic>F</italic>-test was used to test the model.

<title>Performance analysis using synthetic data</title>
<p>For each synthetic dataset, DyVER was applied to predict a genetic variant using the DyVER score (<italic>P</italic> values were Bonferroni-corrected for multiple variants). To quantify the ability to correctly predict such genetic variants, we define the accuracy measure. Genes are split into two groups: one contains genes that are associated with a genetic variant, and the other contains the remaining, non-associated genes. A mapping method may provide a negative prediction (i.e., a non-significant <italic>P</italic> value for all candidate variants), or alternatively, a positive prediction of either the correct variant or an incorrect variant. We define true positives as associated genes whose correct genetic variant is predicted with a significant <italic>P</italic> value. True negatives are non-associated genes that were not significantly associated with any variant. False negatives are associated genes that were not significantly associated with any variant. Finally, false positives are defined as erroneous significant predictions as a result of two possible scenarios, either a non-associated gene that is wrongly predicted to be associated with a certain variant, or alternatively, an associated gene whose predicted variant is incorrect. We adopt the standard formulations for sensitivity (number of true positives out of the total number of positives) and specificity (number of true negatives out of the total number of negatives).</p>
<p>Similarly to a standard ‘Receiver Operating Characteristic’ (ROC) analysis, we can plot the sensitivity against the 1-speificity across different <italic>P</italic> values, providing an overall view of the performance of the method: the higher the curve, the better the <italic>accuracy</italic> (defined as the area under the curve). Notably, using a standard sensitivity definition, sensitivity should increase with higher <italic>P</italic> value thresholds. In contrast, using our definition of sensitivity, it is dependent on the particular predicted variant. Thus, even with a very high <italic>P</italic> value threshold and many affected genes, the sensitivity of a random algorithm might remain close to zero. The accuracy therefore ranges between 0 (for a random prediction) and 1 (for a perfect prediction).</p>
<p>Finally, to quantify the ability of DyVER to correctly predict the temporal two-state model, we define the <italic>two-state pattern error rate</italic> (shortened to <italic>error rate</italic>) as the number of wrongly predicted temporal two-state models expressed as a proportion of the total number of (significant) correctly identified variants. We test two different rules for matching between the simulated and predicted model. In the stringent case, we require a fully correct two-state model, and in the flexible case, we require correct transitions between states but allow incorrect timing of transition.</p>

<title>Yeast and mouse dataset</title>
<p>We applied DyVER to genotyping data and gene expression data that were monitored during six time points following exposure to rapamycin in 95 yeast segregants and their two parental yeast strains: BY4716 (BY) and RM11-1a (RM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003984-Yeung1">[27]</xref>. DyVER was applied to the log expression of 2700 genes with the highest difference between the BY and RM parental strains. To ensure that the biological results are unbiased, DyVER was applied with penalty 0.5. Multiple testing was controlled as follows: DyVER score <italic>P</italic> values were first Bonferroni-corrected for multiple variants; the corrected DyVER score <italic>P</italic> values were then controlled for multiple testing of genes (FDR 6%). We then further filtered the genes based on the dynamic association score (FDR 15%). In total out of 2700 genes, we obtained 351 (13%) predicted associations (based on the corrected DyVER score <italic>P</italic> value) and 145 (5.3%) predicted dynamic associations (based on the dynamic association score). Next, we further removed 40 genes carrying linear-like patterns, based on strong correlation with a linear model (r&gt;0.95) and more than 5% change in genetic effect in any two consecutive time points (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003984.s016">Table S1</xref></bold>).
