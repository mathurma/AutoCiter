<p>A comparative analysis of cavities enclosed in a tertiary structure of proteins and interfaces formed by the interaction of two protein subunits in obligate and non-obligate categories (represented by homodimeric molecules and heterocomplexes, respectively) is presented. The total volume of cavities increases with the size of the protein (or the interface), though the exact relationship may vary in different cases. Likewise, for individual cavities also there is quantitative dependence of the volume on the number of atoms (or residues) lining the cavity. The larger cavities tend to be less spherical, solvated, and the interfaces are enriched in these. On average 15 Å<sup>3</sup> of cavity volume is found to accommodate single water, with another 40–45 Å<sup>3</sup> needed for each additional solvent molecule. Polar atoms/residues have a higher propensity to line solvated cavities. Relative to the frequency of occurrence in the whole structure (or interface), residues in β-strands are found more often lining the cavities, and those in turn and loop the least. Any depression in one chain not complemented by a protrusion in the other results in a cavity in the protein–protein interface. Through the use of the Voronoi volume, the packing of residues involved in protein–protein interaction has been compared to that in the protein interior. For a comparable number of atoms the interface has about twice the number of cavities relative to the tertiary structure.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During protein folding a polypeptide chain takes up a three-dimensional structure that is characterized by close packing of atoms. For cellular processes proteins need to interact, and the binding is also characterized by packing of complementary surfaces. Two types of binding can be envisaged—obligate and non-obligate—the former is exhibited by homodimeric molecules (in which two polypeptide chains are held together in permanent association) and the latter by protein–protein complexes (such as antigen–antibody, enzyme–inhibitor, etc.), which are more transient in nature. Cavities are observed as defects in atomic packing. We present an analysis of cavities within the structure of a protein chain, as well as interfaces formed by the association of two protein chains. For a comparable number of atoms the interface has about twice the number of cavities relative to the tertiary structure. The interfaces contain a higher percentage of larger cavities, which tend to be solvated. We have determined the relationships between the protein volume and the total volume of all the cavities in the structure, the volume of the cavity and the number of atoms (residues) lining it, and the size of the cavity and the number of waters in it.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Close atomic packing is an important metric for characterizing protein structures—the average packing density for the interior of proteins is similar to that for crystals of small organic molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Richards1">[1]</xref>. While the average value of packing density in the protein interior is close to 0.75, the efficiency may not be uniform over the whole structure, the density varying in the range 0.66 to 0.84 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Richards2">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Fleming1">[4]</xref>. The localized defects in packing show up as cavities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Connolly1">[5]</xref>, and when present they can reduce the stability of the structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Lee1">[6]</xref>. Protein binding has many similar features common to folding, such as the presence of a core in the interface region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Chakrabarti1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Bahadur1">[8]</xref> and complementarities of chemical characteristics of residues in contact across the interface and the nature of the specific interactions linking them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Tsai1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Saha1">[11]</xref>. Although the surfaces that form the interface in protein-protein interaction have complementary shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Lawrence1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Bahadur2">[13]</xref>, an issue that has not been addressed is whether the interface can harbor cavities, and their features relative to those present in the protein interior.</p>
<p>Voronoi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Voronoi1">[14]</xref> procedure has been used to assign a unique volume to individual atoms in a collection of atoms, such as in proteins. This has been used to calculate the volumes occupied by amino acid residues and their variation at individual sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Gerstein1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Pontius1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Tsai3">[17]</xref>. As to associate a volume of space to an atom the procedure relies on the location of all its neighbors, it works well when applied to atoms in the protein interior. Distinct from the surface atoms those in the interface have surrounding atoms from the interacting protein chains, and as such one can calculate the Voronoi volumes associated to interface atoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Cazals1">[18]</xref>, and compare these to those in the protein core.</p>
<p>Cavities in structures have also been looked into from the perspective of protein hydration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Hubbard1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Williams1">[21]</xref>. Water molecules are also located in the interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Rodier1">[22]</xref>. Buried water molecules are often conserved among members in a homologous family and are integral structural component of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Sreenivasan1">[23]</xref>. When located in cavities they can compensate for the destabilization of reduced hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Takano1">[24]</xref>. It is of importance to know the average volume occupied by water molecules in protein interior and interfaces and the nature of their interactions with the surrounding protein atoms.</p>
<p>Clefts or pockets on the surface are important for molecular recognition and protein function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Laskowski1">[25]</xref>. Distinct from them are the cavities, defined as enclosed space in the interior of the protein. However, they are sometimes considered together, for example, for defining interior and surface packing densities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Liang1">[26]</xref>. Internal cavities have been analyzed separately for monomeric proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Hubbard1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Williams1">[21]</xref>, as well as protein interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Hubbard2">[27]</xref>, but no attempt has been made to generalize their features from a common perspective. In this work we use a vastly enlarged repertoire of structures to quantify the geometrical characteristics of the cavities found in protein tertiary structures and interfaces—the latter being of two types—those involving obligate homodimeric assemblies and the non-obligate protein-protein heterocomplexes. Other features studied are the occurrence of solvent molecules in the cavities and their hydrogen bonding, the participation of different secondary structural elements in the cavities, the environment of cavity water in the interface, etc. Rather than being mere “packing defects” cavities are also known to play a role in assisting conformational changes between domains or subunit interfaces and in controlling binding and catalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Vallone1">[28]</xref>. Thus a comprehensive analysis of cavities would provide insight into our understanding of protein structure and function.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Cavities and atoms considered in the analysis are defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g001">Figure 1</xref>. For an interface cavity at least 20% of the CL (cavity-lining) atoms ought to belong to a different subunit. If the contribution is less, the cavity is assumed to be part of the tertiary structure of a subunit. The cavities of a single subunit of homodimers and those of monomers were pulled together to constitute the Ter_str (tertiary structure) cavities. The reasons for leaving out individual subunits of protein-protein heterocomplexes are: in some complexes one of the protein components may itself be multimeric; in a few, one component may be rather small to be considered a ‘typical’ protein.</p>

<p>A total of 3384 Ter_str cavities were detected within 219 individual subunits (5 had no cavity) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000188.s007">Table S1</xref>). The homodimer dataset contained 4438 cavities, out of which 615 (14%) are Inter_H (occurring between the homodimer subunits) and the remaining 3823 (86%) occur within (contributing to Ter_str). About 8% interfaces and 2% subunits in homodimers are without any detectable cavity. Protein-Protein complexes had 3944 cavities in total, of which 431 (11%) are Inter_C (occurring in heterocomplex interface). Consideration of volume indicates that 24% and 14% of the total cavity volume in the homodimer and complex datasets, respectively, are contributed by interface cavities. ∼20% interfaces in protein-protein complexes are devoid of detectable cavities. The detailed information on cavities in individual PDB entries is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000188.s008">Table S2</xref>.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Number of Cavities and Their Total Volume in Tertiary Structure and Interfaces</title>
<p>On average ∼15 cavities occur in the individual subunits in the monomer and the homodimer datasets and consequently these two categories were considered together to represent Ter_str (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000188-t001">Table 1</xref>). Compared to the tertiary structure the interfaces have about a third and a sixth number of cavities in homodimers and complexes, respectively. However, the total cavity volume is reduced to two-third and one-fifth in the two types of interfaces, indicating that the cavities in interfaces are larger in size than those in the tertiary structure.</p>

<p>Proteins are of different sizes; besides there is a lot of variation in the numbers of atoms constituting the tertiary structure and the interface. Consequently, we have also expressed the number of cavities and their total volume relative to an average-sized protein of 2000 atoms. Compared to Ter_str the interfaces have about 1.6 times the number of cavities, but the increase in total volume is 3.4 and 2.1 times in homodimers and heteocomplexes, respectively, again indicating the larger size of cavities in the interface, especially for homodimers. In general, the packing of residues in the interface leaves more cavities compared to that in the tertiary structure.</p>
<p>The total volume of Ter_str cavities in a subunit is well correlated to the size, as given by the protein volume (or the number of atoms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). If the size of an interface is defined by the number of atoms belonging to it, the correlation with the total cavity volume is poor for interface cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). However, when individual cavities are considered the correlation of volume is very strong with both the numbers of cavity lining atoms and residues in all the three categories of cavities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000188.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Both linear relationships and equations using power law can fit the data equally well (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000188-t002">Table 2</xref>), but the former would suggest a negative cavity volume when the number of CL atoms/residues is &lt;4. Using the latter set of equations about 5 atoms or 4 residues are needed to enclose a volume (∼11.5 Å<sup>3</sup>) large enough to accommodate one water molecule.</p>

<title>Cavity Shape</title>
<p>Rvs (defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) indicates how spherical a cavity is—for a perfect sphere the value would be 1.0, and would reduce in value as the cavity deviates from being spherical. The distribution of Rvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) indicates that more than 50% of all cavities are nearly spherical. To investigate if the aspherical shape of the cavity can result from the size we plotted the distribution for the cavities having volume greater than 100 Å<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). A peak near 0.75 indicates that such cavities are quite irregular in shape. Two small, spherical cavities (labels: 1 and 2) are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, in which the largest cavity (label, 5) deviates from the spherical shape.</p>

<title>Amino Acid Preferences</title>
<p>As cavities are embedded within the protein structure (or interface) we compared the distribution of the CL residue types with that observed over all the proteins (or interfaces). Amino acid preferences for the CL and NCNS (non-cavity-non-surface) regions across all the three classes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>. A large, positive (or negative) value indicates preference (or avoidance), and a value close to zero suggests an occurrence close to the general population. Charged residues (Lys, Glu, Asp, and Arg) are avoided in general. Ter_str cavities prefer hydrophobic residues, such as Cys, Leu, Ile, Phe, Met, and Val. The preference for the branched aliphatic side chains seems to be the common feature for all the categories of cavities. However, in contrast to Ter_str, interface cavities avoid Cys, Phe and Trp, and prefer Thr, Gln, Gly—possibly due to a higher percentage of interface cavities being solvated. Unlike the CL region the trend in propensities is quite similar in the NCNS region in both types of interfaces and tertiary structure.</p>

Residues which are preferred in empty cavities are Leu, Ile, Met, Phe, and Val, while Gly, Thr, and Tyr are more preferred in solvated cavities.

<title>Atom Type Preferences</title>
<p>The propensities of different atom types to occur in the CL, NCNS regions, solvated and empty cavities in the three cavity classes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g007">Figure 7</xref>. There is a distinct pattern in the atom preference for Ter_str cavities—main-chain atoms (C, N, and CA) are disfavored and the side-chain atoms (aromatic carbon, hydroxyl oxygen and amide nitrogen) are favored in CL as compared to NCNS regions. In the NCNS region all three categories exhibit similar features, for example, polar side-chain atoms (Oa, Oh, Na and Nc) are not preferred and the preference is for C, N, CA and aliphatic carbon (Cc). Polar atoms like oxygen and nitrogen are more preferred in solvated cavities than empty cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g004">Figure 4D</xref> illustrates a cavity with two water molecules, and out of six CL atoms 2 are oxygen and 3 nitrogen.</p>

<title>Distribution of Water Molecules in Cavities</title>
<p>There is a considerable variation in the cavity volume as a function of the number of water molecules contained in it. To discern any underlying trend we considered the Ter_str cavities, averaged the cavity volume containing a particular number of the solvent molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and based on the average numbers one can derive a linear relationship. Roughly, one water molecule can be accommodated in a volume of 15 Å<sup>3</sup> (observed value), and an increment of ∼40–45 Å<sup>3</sup> is needed for each additional molecule. On average a water molecule participates in 3.4 hydrogen bonds (the number includes those to other water molecules also; if hydrogen bonds to only protein atoms are considered the number is 2.6 for Ter_str cavities and 2.3 for interfaces). 15 Å<sup>3</sup> is about the smallest volume that can enclose a water molecule, and such a volume would need about 5 CL atoms (based on equations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000188-t002">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>, however, provides an example where a rather small cavity had six CL atoms, which could enclose two water molecules that participated in 4 and 2 hydrogen bonds, respectively.</p>

<title>Change in Voronoi Volume of Atoms in Interface Relative to Tertiary Structure</title>
<p>We first compare the Voronoi volume of the NCNS atoms in the interface to those in the protein tertiary structure (values are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000188.s009">Table S3</xref>). Most of the 13 atom types show an increase of value in the interface, though the change is usually &lt;5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). It should be mentioned here that for simplification we have grouped atoms together, for example all the aromatic atoms as Cr. However, it is known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Tsai3">[17]</xref> that there can be some variation between the volumes of these atoms within a given aromatic residue or between any two of them. As such the result would be affected by the atom composition in the datasets. Under these limitations, cases where the difference is more are worth mentioning. In complexes, S and aromatic atoms have smaller values in the interface, indicating that these are better packed relative to the tertiary structure. Fleming and Richards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Fleming1">[4]</xref> observed that in protein structures Cys and aromatic residues are better packed than the aliphatic ones. It appears that these residues (containing atoms types Cr and S) are still better packed in interfaces. On the other hand, N of Lys and Arg are lesser packed. For homodimers, CB atoms that link the main chain to the functional part of the side chain are also packed less efficiently.</p>

<p>As expected, if we compare the CL atoms instead of the NCNS atoms, there is an increase in volume (11–35%) compared to the atoms in the tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g009">Figure 9C</xref> one can see the difference in the Voronoi volume of CL atoms in solvated cavities, calculated including and excluding water molecules (blue and red bars, respectively). The difference in the volume of the polar atoms is to the extent of 12–25% as compared to 5–7% by the non-polar atoms. However, on including water the values of the polar atoms come to within 5%, indicating that the cavity water molecules are located closer to these CL atoms. One would have expected the bars corresponding to the empty cavities should match with the ones calculated without considering waters for the solvated cavities. But this is not quite correct, as they tend to have different sizes (solvated ones are bigger) and the propensities of atom-types (for example, compare Cr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>) to occur in them are also different.</p>

<title>General Features of Cavities and Dependence on Protein/Interface Size</title>
<p>Hubbard &amp; Argos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Hubbard2">[27]</xref> analyzed three classes of cavities: within domains, between domains and between protein subunits. Ter_str cavities considered here would include the first two classes, whereas the interfaces between subunits in obligate homodimers and protein-protein heterocomplexes substituted the last class. Interdomain and intersubunit cavities were on average found to be larger than those located within domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Hubbard2">[27]</xref>. Our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) comparing cavities in the tertiary structures and interfaces indicate that interface cavities, especially Inter_H, are indeed larger. However, if we distinguish between intradomain and interdomain cavities (of the 219 individual subunits considered by us 158 were single domain proteins and the rest multidomain) there is not much difference in the distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000188.s002">Figure S2</xref>). It can be mentioned that cavities with atomic surface components arising from more than one domain were deemed to be interdomain in the earlier study; however, we used a more stringent criterion of having at least 20% of CL atoms coming from a different domain. Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g002">Figure 2A</xref> indicates that the total cavity volume is a function of the protein volume, irrespective of the number of domains present.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the wide cavities form 0.002–1.55% of the volume of a protein (in a dataset of 75 monomeric proteins); however, no quantitative relationship could be established linking the two <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Williams1">[21]</xref>. A linear relationship was noted between the number of voids and pockets plotted against the number of residues in each protein, although the total pocket volume did not correlate well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Liang1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Liang2">[29]</xref>, possibly because no distinction was made between single and multiple subunit proteins, the latter containing tunnels or holes of large size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Liang1">[26]</xref>. From our analysis we could derive a linear relationship between the total volume of the cavities present and the total protein volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). From this one can derive that for two proteins of volume 30,000 and 50,000 Å<sup>3</sup>, the cavities will constitute 0.56 and 0.99% of the volume (the two values are 0.61 and 0.91, using the power law). The observed minimum and maximum values were 0.06 and 2.26%, respectively. Cavities are usually located close to the protein surface—considering the CL atoms, most of them belong to the surface of the molecule.</p>
<p>Cavities were found to cover 10% of a typical interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Hubbard2">[27]</xref>. Comparing the number of CL atoms to the total (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000188.s007">Table S1b</xref>) we find that 5.5% atoms of the tertiary structure and 13.8 and 10.5% of homodimeric and hetercomplex interfaces form cavities. That for a given number of atoms the interfaces have about twice the number of cavities as the tertiary structure can also be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000188-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Water in Cavities</title>
<p>For some structures the resolution of the data may be rather low, or the quality of the electron density too poor for the bound water molecules to be seen. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000188.s005">Figure S5</xref> indicates that there is an increase in the number of solvated cavities as the resolution improves from 2.5 Å till about 1.8 Å. If the water molecule is partially or completely disordered it cannot be located. Even with high resolution data detection of water molecules in cavities, especially if they are mobile due to the hydrophobic nature of the cavity, is rather tricky by conventional crystallographic analysis that neglects low resolution data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Yu1">[30]</xref> and as such, the average number of water molecules obtained could be an underestimate. Nevertheless, the average number of hydrogen bonds involving water in the solvated cavities—the number is 2.6 with protein atoms, and 3.4 if hydrogen bonding with other water molecules is also included—matches with the typical value of 3 hydrogen bonds made by a buried water molecule reported in literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Rashin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Williams1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Baker1">[31]</xref>. The cavity volume needed to enclose one water molecule is ∼15 Å<sup>3</sup>, however, each additional water requires an extra volume of ∼40–45 Å<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Preference of Secondary Structural Elements in Cavities</title>
<p>The propensity of the secondary structural elements to be associated with cavities indicates that β-strands have a high tendency and the non-regular regions (‘Others’) are disfavored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Interestingly, the packing densities of residues in turns, helices and strands were found to be 0.794, 0.744, and 0.723, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Fleming1">[4]</xref>, indicating the β-strands to be packed least efficiently, possibly due to the greater occurrence of cavities associated with them, examples of which can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g011">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g012">12A</xref>. Loops and turns with higher flexibility can adjust the structure locally to avoid/minimize any local packing defects.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that C<sup>β</sup> atoms do not cover an antiparallel β-sheet by a tightly packed layer, leaving holes equivalent to the size of a methyl group or water molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Finkelstein1">[32]</xref>. These holes are possibly not included in our analysis because of the volume cut-off used in the definition of cavities. Additionally, these would have had all the CL atoms residing on the β-sheet; however, the percentage of cavities exclusively lined by β-sheet atoms is very low (&lt;5%). The higher involvement of β-sheet residues in lining the cavities may have implications for the energetics of interaction. It has been observed that for protein-protein interactions, those having interfaces mostly made up of β-sheet have, on average lower free energy of binding compared to those having α- or αβ (mixed) classes of interfaces (Guharoy and Chakrabarti, unpublished). This observation may be understood in terms of the lowest packing efficiency of interfacial β structures, leading to lower van der Waals contacts and therefore lower binding free energies as well.</p>

<title>Interface Cavities and Water</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows that when there is a surface groove that is not matched by a bulge on the surface of the interacting protein this would result in the formation of a cavity in the interface. Water molecules in the groove cannot be squeezed out and remains trapped inside the interface. When we analyzed if the water molecules can have direct hydrogen bond contact with both the subunits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000188-t003">Table 3</xref>) we observed that such molecules are just 37% and 51% in Inter_H and Inter_C, respectively, a smaller number (10% and 5%) of water molecules do not form any bond with either subunit. Indeed, one can see from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g012">Figure 12A</xref>, where the cavity can be considered as a casket of water molecules, the majority of which form hydrogen bonds between themselves. Even when the cavities contain one or two water molecules, the large size of the cavity may preclude the solvent molecules to interact with both the protein components. However, if we consider contacts (instead of hydrogen bonds) made with both the sides, a greater number (72% and 84%) of water molecules bridge the two subunits.</p>

<title>Voronoi Volume and Packing of Atoms in Interface</title>
<p>The packing density at interfaces has been computed by comparing the Voronoi volume of the buried atoms in the interface to the reference atomic volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-LoConte1">[34]</xref>. Such a plot is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000188.s006">Figure S6</xref>, which also includes the distribution for the atoms in the tertiary structure in individual files—as a reference for the normal distribution. When Vr is larger than unity it indicates that the packing density at interfaces is lower than that in protein interiors, and a smaller value indicates a higher density. The average values of Vr for the interfaces in homodimers and heretocomplexes are slightly higher than 1.01(±0.06) reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-LoConte1">[34]</xref> for heterocomplex interfaces.

<title>Cavities Containing Ligand or Cofactor Molecules</title>
<p>The existence of any small molecule, other than water, in the cavities was found out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000188.s010">Table S4</xref>). In about 30% cases only 1–3 atoms of a much larger ligand are found to be inside the cavity, which are usually &lt;20 Å<sup>3</sup> in volume. These cavities cannot be considered as having a small molecule entrapped. Heterocomplex interfaces have just two cases where molecules used in the crystallization procedure found their way into the cavity. In general, biologically relevant molecules are not found in interface cavities—only two cases of cofactor molecules are found in Inter_H cavities. In the tertiary structure, there is an example of Mg ion being located in a volume of 16 Å<sup>3</sup>; cavities having Ca ion usually have a volume in the range of 17–18 Å<sup>3</sup> (one example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g012">Figure 12B</xref>) and a K ion is observed in 20 Å<sup>3</sup>. Metals such as Hg, Ni, and iron-sulfur clusters occupy a much larger volume. Water molecules usually accompany the ligand in the cavity; the largest of such a cavity is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g012">Figure 12C</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, in this work we have delineated the total volume expected to be occupied by cavities in a protein or a protein-protein interface of a particular size. A quantitative relationship has been derived for the volume of a cavity and the atoms/residues lining it. Of the secondary structural elements, β-strands have a higher inclination to be associated with cavities. For a comparable ensemble of atoms the interfaces contain about twice the number of cavities relative to the tertiary structure. It has been shown recently that a cavity of an appropriate size is the basis of peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase (PPIase) activity of an important class of enzymes (human FK506-binding protein 12) and that it is possible to create artificial PPIase activity by introducing such a cavity on barnase, a bacterial nuclease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Ikura1">[35]</xref>. A comprehensive understanding of the features of cavities in protein interiors and interfaces, as presented here, would facilitate such protein design experiments.</p>

For our work the cavities for each protein are identified using the CASTp (Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins) server <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Binkowski1">[44]</xref> located at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sts.bioengr.uic.edu/castp/" xlink:type="simple">http://sts.bioengr.uic.edu/castp/</ext-link>. The basic ingredients of computational geometry applied in CASTp are: Delaunay triangulation, alpha shape, and discrete flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Edelsbrunner1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Facello1">[48]</xref>. CASTp provides a full description of protein pockets and cavities, including volume, surface area, protein atoms that line the concavity, and features of pocket mouth(s) including identification of mouth atoms as well as measurement of mouth area and circumference. The default probe radius of 1.4 Å has been used for our calculations.</p>
<p>Three classes of cavities were identified: (a) Ter_str (cavities in monomeric proteins and within one subunit of homodimeric proteins); (b) Inter_H (those within homodimer interfaces); and (c) Inter_C (within protein-protein complex interfaces).</p>
<p>Surface pockets and cavities belonging to the subunit or interface are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000188-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Any residue contributing one or more atoms to the cavity-lining (CL) region is considered as a CL residue; the same is true for the NCNS (non-cavity-non-surface) region. Interface cavities should have at least 20% of the cavity-lining atoms from a different subunit. The same condition was also used to identify if any Ter_str cavity belonged to the interdomain region, after identifying the individual domain residues from SCOP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Andreeva1">[49]</xref>. As we have used the option in CASTp that defines cavities based on molecular surface (rather than ASA), a few atoms not identified by us as belonging to the interface were also found lining the interface cavities and these were counted as being associated with the cavity (as well as the interface). Only the cavities with volume&gt;11.5 Å<sup>3</sup> (the volume of a probe with radius 1.4 Å) were retained for analysis. Further the cavities were classified as solvated or empty based on the presence or the absence of crystallographically determined water molecules in them. Cavities were considered for the existence of embedded water molecules starting from the smallest one. When two cavities, one small and the other large and irregular have some common CL atoms, there could be ambiguity is assigning a water molecule that may lie close to the shared atom(s). As such the cavities were considered in the ascending order of volume. The location of water in a cavity was found out as follows. (i) It has to be within 4.5 Å of a CL atom. (ii) If such water exists, all CL atoms within 4.5 Å from the water are found. (iii) If the distance from the center of mass of the cavity to the water molecule is less than that to any of the CL atoms in contact (as obtained in ii), the water is assumed to belong to the cavity. The existence of any ligand in a cavity was found in a similar fashion. Hydrogen bonding involving a water molecule (to protein atoms, as well as to other water molecules in the cavity) was determined using HBPLUS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-McDonald1">[50]</xref>. The surface representation of the cavities was made using MSMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Sanner1">[51]</xref> and displayed with VMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000188-Humphrey1">[52]</xref>.</p>
