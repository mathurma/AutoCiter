Although molecular cell biology has substantially advanced cancer research, our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics that govern tumorigenesis is limited. This paper analyzes the computational implications of cancer progression presented by Hanahan and Weinberg in <italic>The Hallmarks of Cancer</italic>. We model the complexities of tumor progression as a small set of underlying rules that govern the transformation of normal cells to tumor cells. The rules are implemented in a stochastic multistep model. The model predicts that (i) early-onset cancers proceed through a different sequence of mutation acquisition than late-onset cancers; (ii) tumor heterogeneity varies with acquisition of <italic>genetic instability,</italic> mutation pathway, and selective pressures during tumorigenesis; (iii) there exists an optimal initial telomere length which lowers cancer incidence and raises time of cancer onset; and (iv) the ability to initiate angiogenesis is an important stage-setting mutation, which is often exploited by other cells. The model offers insight into how the sequence of acquired mutations affects the timing and cellular makeup of the resulting tumor and how the cellular-level population dynamics drive neoplastic evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Cancer can be viewed as an ecological system in which cells with different mutations compete for survival. In this work, the authors present a three-dimensional stochastic model of these complex interactions. Each cell is represented as an autonomous agent that follows simple rules governing its behavior, where behaviors change as cells gain cancerous mutations. The paper explores the timing of cancer onset, the order in which mutations are acquired, the diversity of tumors, and the competition and cooperation between cells in the tumor microenvironment. One key finding is that early-onset and late-onset tumors take different mutational paths to cancer.

Evidence strongly supports mutation as one of the dominant factors in setting rate-limiting steps in tumor progression, resulting in variation in the timing of progression between tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b002">2</xref>]. Tumorigenesis is thought to require four to six stochastic rate-limiting mutation events to occur in the lineage of one cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b005">5</xref>]. Hanahan and Weinberg suggest that six cellular alterations, or hallmarks, collectively drive a population of normal cells to become a cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>]. The six hallmarks are (i) <italic>self-sufficiency in growth signals (SG),</italic> (ii) <italic>insensitivity to antigrowth signals (IA),</italic> (iii) <italic>evasion of apoptosis (EA),</italic> (iv) <italic>limitless replicative potential (LR),</italic> (v) <italic>sustained angiogenesis (SA),</italic> and (vi) <italic>tissue invasion and metastasis</italic>. <italic>Genetic instability (GI)</italic> is defined as an “enabling characteristic” that facilitates the acquisition of other mutations due to defects in DNA repair. These hallmarks form a candidate set of rules that underlie the transformation of a normal tissue to a cancerous one. The quantitative ramifications of these rules are explored in this paper, and lead to a number of interesting phenomena and hypotheses.</p><p>We model a simplified view of cancer progression using a stochastic model of tumorigenesis based on the hallmarks. The complexity of cancer cannot be understood by considering individual mutations independent of their interactions. Rather, the effect of a mutation often depends on other mutations within the same cell, on other mutant cells within the tumor, and on the tumor microenvironment. Our model allows us to study the evolutionary dynamics of early mutations, which generally go undetected in clinical settings, and thereby examine the initial forces that drive neoplastic evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This paper extends earlier work using the hallmarks of cancer to study cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b008">8</xref>]. Here, we model the hallmarks phenotypically (one mutation, one hallmark) in a three-dimensional, agent-based model that resembles a stochastic cellular automaton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b008">8</xref>]. The computational grid contains a maximum of 10<sup>6</sup> cells (100 × 100 × 100) initialized with a single normal cell and a single blood source. As normal proliferation occurs, cells far from the blood supply signal for angiogenesis. The blood supply then extends in the direction of the requesting cell, creating a branching pattern of vascularization, which may pass through a cube with or without a resident cell. The nutrient available to each cell is the sum of the contributions from all capillaries. However, distant capillaries contribute little, as nutrient levels fall as a power law function of the distance from their source. This signaling and vascularization process continues until the cells fill the space established by two intersecting three-dimensional parabolas that represent angiogenic and growth factor constraints. Normal cells are able to signal for vascularization until they reach the angiogenic boundary, beyond which they are not able to signal for the resources needed to divide. Similarly, normal cells are able to divide only within the region containing growth factor. This intersection restricts normal tissue to 8.6 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells.</p><p>The event cycle for each cell defines the progression of the model. This cycle has a period defined as a random number drawn from a uniform distribution between five and ten time steps. At the beginning of this cycle, a normal cell will initiate cell division if there is unoccupied adjacent space. The parent cell “genome” is copied with a small probability of mutation (1/<italic>m</italic>), the telomere length (<italic>t</italic>) of both cells is decreased by a single unit, and the new daughter cell fills the empty neighboring space. If there is no adjacent space for a daughter cell, a normal cell will remain quiescent until the next cycle. During this cycle there is a small probability of random death (<italic>a</italic>) and a probability of death associated with acquired mutations (<italic>n/e</italic>, discussed below). This process continues until either 50,000 time steps have passed or the tissue has developed cancer. We define the onset of “cancer” to occur when the tissue grows beyond the normal tissue boundary to occupy 90% of the grid, or 9 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells, at which point the run terminates. As described in the first two sections under Results, we performed 1,000 runs of the model with the default parameter settings described below. Of these, 986 end in cancer before 50,000 time steps.</p><p>Normal cells require mitogenic growth signals to switch from a quiescent to a proliferative state. Cancer cells generate many of their own growth signals and are less dependent on exogenous stimulation. For example, activation of the Ras oncogene allows a cell to send ongoing mitogenic signals even without stimulation of the upstream regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>]. In the model, normal cells divide only if they are within the predefined spatial boundary that represents the growth factor concentration threshold. The acquired mutation <italic>SG</italic> allows cells to proliferate regardless of the concentration of growth factor. Therefore, this mutation is necessary for cells to proliferate beyond the normal tissue boundary.</p><p>In normal tissue, antigrowth signals maintain cells in a nondividing state. These antigrowth signals are often proliferation inhibitors that force cells into a quiescent or post-mitotic state by converging on the retinoblastoma protein, pRb, which controls progression from <italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub> into S phase. Cancer cells can also downregulate the expression of cell adhesion molecules that send antigrowth signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>]. Contact inhibition is a type of antigrowth signal that prevents cell division if a cell is surrounded by many other cells, thus preventing overcrowding. In the model, each cell has up to 26 neighbors (neighbors need only make contact at a corner). Normal cells do not divide if all 26 positions are occupied by other cells. The mutation <italic>IA</italic> allows cells to divide even when there is no space for the daughter cell. The daughter cell competes for survival with a randomly chosen neighbor with a 1/<italic>g</italic> chance of success. If successful, the daughter cell replaces the randomly chosen cell. The model could include structural changes to the tissue, such as crowding or expansion pressures. However, these issues and their associated assumptions about tissue architecture go beyond the intended scope of this model.</p><p>Cell populations are able to expand in number by inappropriate cell division as well as by lack of appropriate cell death (apoptosis). A cell monitors its own state and initiates apoptosis in response to signals such as DNA damage, oncogene overexpression, survival factor insufficiency, or hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b009">9</xref>]. Mutations to genes involved in apoptosis can change the balance between pro-death and pro-survival signals. For example, upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 can shift the signaling balance toward survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>]. In the model, cells are checked for the presence of mutations each cell cycle, and if a mutation is detected, the cell is eliminated. The probability of detecting genetic damage in the cell is <italic>n/e</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> = 0,...,6 is the number of mutations carried by the cell, and <italic>e</italic> is the probability of death. The mutation <italic>EA</italic> allows a cell to evade mutation detection and the subsequent death that would usually occur.</p><p>In cell culture, telomere shortening limits normal human cells to 25–70 doublings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b010">10</xref>]. However, 80% of human cancers show expression and activity of telomerase, an enzyme that lengthens telomeres and confers limitless replicative potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b011">11</xref>]. In the model, the initial cell is created with telomeres of length <italic>t,</italic> where <italic>t</italic> is 50 unless otherwise specified. At each cell division, the telomere length is decreased by one. When telomere length reaches zero in the model, the cell dies. The mutation <italic>LR</italic> allows the cell to divide indefinitely. The implications of this simplification are discussed in detail in the Results section.</p><p>Cells cannot survive at distances of more than 100 <italic>μm</italic> from a blood supply, which limits the size of human tumors to about 10<sup>6</sup> cells without angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b012">12</xref>]. For an incipient tumor to grow, cells must reinstate the angiogenic ability that was temporarily present during organogenesis. For example, when the concentration of nutrients and oxygen is low, cancer cells increase production of the pro-angiogenic signal, vascular endothelial growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>]. In the model, lack of oncogenic angiogenesis limits tumorigenesis until the mutation <italic>SA</italic> confers the ability to signal for growth of new blood vessels. Once cells acquire this mutation, they are able to signal for angiogenesis outside the previously established vascular system. This allows cells to acquire the nutrients necessary to expand beyond the normal tissue boundaries.</p><p>Cells maintain genomic and karyotypic integrity through a complex set of DNA monitoring proteins, DNA repair enzymes, and mitotic checkpoint proteins. Thus, the mutation rate in human cells is relatively low, estimated to be in the range of 10<sup>−7</sup> to 10<sup>−6</sup> mutations/gene/cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b013">13</xref>]. We define the mutation rate to be 1/<italic>m</italic> and choose <italic>m</italic> as the midpoint between 10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup>, such that <italic>m</italic> = <inline-formula id="pcbi-0020108-ex001"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020108.ex001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
				 = 5.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>. Loss of DNA repair signaling can increase the mutation rate by a factor ranging from 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b014">14</xref>]. In the model, cells that gain the mutation <italic>GI</italic> have their base mutation rate scaled up by <italic>i</italic>. We chose a midrange value, defining <italic>i</italic> as 10<sup>3</sup>.
			</p><p>We assume that cells experience some amount of random death due to causes not previously specified, such as injury or stress. In the model, every cell has a 1/<italic>a</italic> likelihood of dying at some point in the interval described by the uniform distribution discussed above. The three parameters <italic>g</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, and <italic>a</italic> were chosen via an informal sensitivity analysis such that the parameter plays an important role but does not dominate tumorigenesis. We selected <italic>g</italic> to be 5, <italic>e</italic> to be 20, and <italic>a</italic> to be 1,000. Finally, we do not model tissue invasion and metastasis, as the model represents a single tissue.</p><p>When modeling a complex biological process, it is always necessary to make simplifying assumptions.

					 <italic><sub>n</sub>P<sub>i</sub></italic> = 1,956 distinct sequences of mutation history. We are interested in the pathways cells take to become a tumor, and how particular pathways affect the dynamics of tumorigenesis. It is currently believed that it is not simply the accumulation of mutations, but also the order in which they are acquired, that determines the timing and extent of tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b015">15</xref>]. The model allows us to study the sequence in which mutations are accumulated. We find that the pathways leading to early-onset cancer (arising early in the life of the simulated tissue) are different from the pathways leading to late-onset cancer.
				</p><p>The importance of genetic instability in cancer progression is a controversial issue in cancer biology. Loeb and others argue that early acquisition of a mutator phenotype is necessary for tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b017">17</xref>], while Tomlinson, Bodmer, and others believe that increased cell division provides sufficient opportunities for mutation accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b020">20</xref>]. Although this question must ultimately be answered empirically, our model informs this debate in a new way by proposing a compromise between these two opposing theoretical viewpoints.</p><p>We find that <italic>GI</italic> is often the causative mutation in earlier onset tumors, while <italic>LR</italic> is often the causative mutation in later onset tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g002">Figure 2</xref>A shows that very early tumors (before 2,000 time steps) frequently result from acquiring <italic>GI</italic> as the first mutation. This can also be seen by defining the dominant tumor type to be the most common first two mutations in a given tumor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g001">Figure 1</xref> displays the frequency of each dominant tumor type as a function of the cancer onset time. As indicated in the figure, <italic>GI</italic> is the most common first mutation in the 0–5 K timeblock, as seen by summing the populations with <italic>GI</italic> as the first mutation. This is consistent with the fact that many early-onset cancers arise from inherited mutations in genes affecting the stability of the genome. These include xeroderma pigmentosum, ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, and Bloom syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b020">20</xref>]. Conversely, tumors acquiring <italic>GI</italic> late in their pathway gain little selective advantage, as the cells have already acquired most necessary mutations. Thus, in tumors where <italic>GI</italic> occurs late in the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), the frequency of this mutation is relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><fig id="pcbi-0020108-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020108.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The Timing of Cancer Onset Is Correlated with the Most Common First Two Mutations of a Tumor</title><p>The most common first two mutations of a tumor define the dominant tumor type. <italic>GI</italic> is the most common first mutation in the 0–5 K timeblock, as seen by summing the populations with <italic>GI</italic> as the first mutation.

For example, in the rare case that a cell on the tissue boundary acquires SG, the subsequent rapid clonal expansion provides ample opportunity for further mutations. This is illustrated by the prevalence of <italic>SG</italic> as a first mutation in early tumors.</p><p>Later onset tumors in the model, however, are initiated by the acquisition of <italic>LR</italic> followed by either <italic>IA</italic> or <italic>EA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g001">Figure 1</xref>, see <italic>LR IA</italic> and <italic>LR EA</italic>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For later onset tumors, the many rounds of cell division offer sufficient opportunity for mutation accumulation. However, by limiting the lifespan of the cell, telomere shortening prevents acquisition of a sufficient number of mutations. Without <italic>LR,</italic> mutations accumulate for only a limited number of cell divisions. Acquisition of <italic>LR</italic> immortalizes cells, allowing them to maintain a mutational line over the lifetime of the tissue. Clinical evidence supports our finding of <italic>LR</italic> as a relatively early event in tumor development, demonstrated by the presence of telomerase activity in many precancerous lesions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b021">21</xref>]).</p><p>Additionally, we find that <italic>EA</italic> is an important mutation to gain early in the pathway, regardless of when the tumor arises, as it prevents detection of acquired mutations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Indeed, it has been noted in the literature that evasion of apoptosis is not inherently mutagenic at the cellular level. Rather, the mutation allows for the perpetuation of mutant cells that would otherwise be removed, resulting in higher numbers of mutations at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b022">22</xref>].</p><p>The model underscores the importance of accumulating mutations in an individual cell. Due to the low probability of acquiring multiple mutations in a single cell, either the mutation rate must increase through <italic>GI,</italic> or <italic>LR</italic> must allow cells to live long enough to acquire multiple mutations. Thus, <italic>GI</italic> and <italic>LR</italic> were either the first or second mutation in the most common pathways of all but three of the 986 observed tumors (data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020108-st001">Table S1</xref>). Thus, the model suggests the following compromise in the mutator phenotype debate: genetic instability plays a key role in early-onset tumors, while for later tumors, limitless replicative potential provides sufficient opportunity to acquire an equal number of mutations by allowing an increased number of cell divisions.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Heterogeneity Varies with the Predominance of <italic>GI,</italic> Mutation Pathway, and Selective Pressures during Tumorigenesis</title><p>Tumor heterogeneity has important consequences for the progression and treatment of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b023">23</xref>].

This suggests that rapid proliferation allows for increased diversity upon which selection can act to choose the fittest cells, leading to a subsequent decrease in heterogeneity. The dynamic balance between the selective advantage of diversity and the selective pressure to homogenize may underlie a complex relationship between heterogeneity and tumorigenesis, which may have important clinical implications.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Initial Telomere Length Affects Cancer Onset Time and Incidence</title><p>Limited replication protects against indefinite proliferation of mutant cell lines. A majority of human cancers show expression and activity of telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b011">11</xref>], an enzyme that lengthens telomeres. Expression of telomerase is not found in most normal somatic tissues and confers unlimited replicative potential. Lengthened telomeres are thought to facilitate tumorigenesis by allowing cell lines to accumulate the mutations necessary to develop a tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>]. However, short telomeres can also promote tumorigenesis by creating chromosomal instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b021">21</xref>]. For instance, there is evidence that short telomeres are associated with an increase in malignancy in mice due to the resulting genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b028">28</xref>].</p><p>Karyotypic instability resulting from telomere shortening represents a deviation from normal cell behavior. Typically, normal cells with shortened telomeres stop dividing and enter senescence. However, cells with dysfunctional pRb and p53 tumor suppressor proteins are able to avoid senescence. These cells continue to proliferate until the fusion of the now naked chromosomal ends results in crisis, a state marked by widespread cell death due to karyotypic instability. A rare mutational event may activate telomerase, stabilizing the chromosomal ends, and giving the cell's lineage the selective advantage of immortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>Just as long and short telomeres can both contribute to tumorigenesis, our model reveals a similar tradeoff between long and short telomere lengths. However, we note that this finding may depend on an important simplification. To avoid complicating the model's simple representation of cellular aging and to maintain the explicit focus on intercellular rather than intracellular dynamics, senescence, crisis, and karyotypic instability were not modeled. These processes are not well-understood and would significantly increase the number of built-in assumptions. In many ways, telomere shortening deserves a model of its own, since the sequence of events, the contexts in which they occur, and the associated probabilities are complex. Instead, we make a conservative simplification, eliminating cells once their telomere length reaches zero. One might imagine that this approach would neutralize the deleterious effects of shortened telomeres, as these karyotypically unstable cells are prevented from developing. However, even the conservative model produces the same tradeoff between long and short telomere lengths as found in cells.</p><p>In a separate set of simulations, we vary <italic>t,</italic> the initial telomere length. We find that both long (90–170 units) and short (25–40 units) telomere lengths lead to higher incidence and earlier time of cancer onset than do intermediate lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, there exists a tradeoff between low early incidence and higher late incidence of cancer. The initial tumorigenic effects of long telomere length are due to the large replicative potential of the cells. As the cells continue to divide, their telomeres reach an intermediate length where there is lower cancer incidence. After more cell divisions, the cells' telomeres become very short, causing cell death. This increases cancer incidence in the model because additional mutations can occur during the cell divisions that replace the exhausted cells.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020108-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020108.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Initial Telomere Length Affects Incidence and Onset of Cancer</title><p>(A) Initial telomere length affects the pattern of incidence across time.

(i) Early-onset cancers proceed through a different sequence of mutation acquisition than late-onset cancers. Specifically, <italic>GI</italic> is the most common first mutation in early-onset cancers whereas <italic>LR</italic> is the most common first mutation in later-onset cancers. (ii) Heterogeneity varies with early acquisition of <italic>GI,</italic> mutation pathway, and selective pressures during tumorigenesis. (iii) There exists a range of optimal initial telomere lengths that lowers cancer incidence and raises the time of cancer onset. (iv) The ability to initiate angiogenesis is an important stage-setting mutation, which is often exploited by other cells and is therefore infrequently present in final tumors.</p><p>This model presents a first step toward predicting the fate of early precancerous mutations computationally. Early events responsible for neoplastic progression are difficult to investigate experimentally for the very reason that they have not yet been detected. The main limitation of the model is the difficulty of experimental validation. A thorough testing of the model would require periodically examining single cells for the presence of mutations in the hallmark categories, beginning before an animal has developed a clinically detectable cancer. Initiating testing for mutations once the animal has a palpable tumor ignores early mutation dynamics that, according to the model, are important for determining the timing and cellular makeup of the tumor that develops. In addition, the current technology of sequencing populations of tumor cells for mutations at various timepoints does not provide explicit support of the multistep model of tumorigenesis, which requires multiple mutations to be found in a single cell.</p><p>The work presented here relies on a number of simplifying assumptions, the most important relating to tissue architecture and molecular intracellular processes. For instance, we assume that all mutations fit into one and only one of the six hallmarks, whereas p53, for example, is known to be involved in cell cycle inhibition, apoptosis, genetic stability, and inhibition of blood vessel formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020108-b030">30</xref>]. However, we simplified the mapping because disaggregating the hallmarks allowed us to better study their interactions. Modeling simultaneous multiple hallmark acquisition would require knowledge of which combinations are possible and their probabilities of occurring. For example, although p53 is involved in several hallmarks, not every mutation to this protein causes the complete loss of p53 functionality. Additionally, as discussed in the Results section, a more complex model of cellular aging would more accurately reflect known biology. An advantage of our agent-based model is that alternative approaches can be easily tested by downloading and modifying the code that runs the model. Future work could address the above issues, and could implement mutations such as <italic>GI</italic> as a continuum rather than as a binary switch. Future research could also include extending the model to incorporate deleterious mutations to housekeeping genes, invasion and metastasis, and cancer stem cells.</p><p>Although simplifications are inevitable in a theoretical model, this work nevertheless reveals important consequences of the well-established concepts proposed by Hanahan and Weinberg. This type of model can uncover unexpected nonlinear interactions, such as those we find among the six hallmarks. The model provides insight into the early dynamics of neoplasia currently inaccessible to experimental investigation and thus serves as a tool for hypothesis generation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020108-st001" mimetype="application/pdf" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020108.st001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>The Number of Tumors as Categorized by the Most Common First Two Mutations</title><p>(22 KB PDF)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020108-st002" mimetype="application/pdf" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020108.st002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S2</label><caption><title>Mean, Standard Deviation, and Sample Size for Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020108-g002">Figure 2</xref>A</title><p>(15 KB PDF)</p></caption></supplementary-material><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The Entrez Gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez</ext-link>) GeneID accession numbers for the genes and gene products discussed in this paper are: BCL2 (GeneID 596), KRAS (GeneID 3845), RB1 (GeneID 5925), TERT (GeneID 7015), TP53 (GeneID 7157), and VEGF (GeneID 7422).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="ack"><title/><p>We thank Robert Abbott for supplying the CancerSim computer program.</p></sec></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>
