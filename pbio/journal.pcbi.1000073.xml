Activity in some neurons persists after the first (sample) stimulus is shown. This delay-period activity has been proposed as an important mechanism for working memory. In ITC neurons, intervening (nonmatching) stimuli wipe out the delay-period activity; hence, the role of ITC in memory must depend upon a different mechanism. Here, we look for a possible mechanism by contrasting memory effects in two architectonically different parts of ITC: area TE and the perirhinal cortex. We found that a large proportion (80%) of stimulus-selective neurons in area TE of macaque ITCs exhibit a memory effect during the stimulus interval. During a sequential delayed matching-to-sample task (DMS), the <italic>noise</italic> in the neuronal response to the test image was correlated with the <italic>noise</italic> in the neuronal response to the sample image. Neurons in perirhinal cortex did not show this correlation. These results led us to hypothesize that area TE contributes to short-term memory by acting as a matched filter. When the sample image appears, each TE neuron captures a static copy of its inputs by rapidly adjusting its synaptic weights to match the strength of their individual inputs. Input signals from subsequent images are multiplied by those synaptic weights, thereby computing a measure of the correlation between the past and present inputs. The total activity in area TE is sufficient to quantify the similarity between the two images. This matched filter theory provides an explanation of what is remembered, where the trace is stored, and how comparison is done across time, all without requiring delay period activity. Simulations of a matched filter model match the experimental results, suggesting that area TE neurons store a synaptic memory trace during short-term visual memory.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>To know whether one is looking at an object seen a few seconds ago or not depends on visual short-term memory. To study short-term memory, we recorded single neuronal activity from two brain areas of monkeys, the TE and the perirhinal cortex of the temporal lobe, known to be important in visual pattern recognition and memory. The monkeys performed a short-term visual memory task, a sequential match-to-sample. The monkeys had to signal when a sample stimulus reappeared in a short sequence of stimuli. In area TE only, small fluctuations occurring for a sample-elicited response were correlated with the responses when a match stimulus reappeared, as if a snapshot of the sample-induced response was stored and recalled. In our modeling, we propose that each TE neuron stores and compares the signals during short-term memory by storing the response to the sample in local and rapidly adapting synapses. Subsequent stimulus-elicited responses are then automatically multiplied by the locally stored signal. Here, we show that the match can be detected when the sum of the outputs of the population of TE neurons crosses a threshold. Correlated fluctuations will be a signature this type of local memory storage wherever it occurs in the brain.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of the NIMH and the NEI.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visual short-term, or working, memory is often tested with a sequential delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task. First an image to be remembered (the sample) is presented. Then a sequence of images (the tests), separated by short delays, is presented. The subject is supposed to respond when the remembered image reappears (the match trial). The comparison between images presented at different times requires the brain to compare its current neuronal response with the one that occurred earlier. How this memory task is performed is not well understood, but where it is performed is well known. Analysis of behavior following selective ablations has shown that two large brain regions are important for performing this task: inferior temporal cortex (ITC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Goldman1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Passingham1">[4]</xref>.

For example, after area TE ablation, memory at both short and long delays is impaired, whereas after ablations of perirhinal cortex only memory at long delays is impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Buffalo2">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Neurons in both area TE and perirhinal cortex are selective for visual patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Eskandar1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Miller2">[15]</xref>. In match-to-sample or stimulus-stimulus association tasks, the selective neuronal activity representing the sample or pair-associate image persists during the interstimulus interval for a minority of neurons in both area TE and in perirhinal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Fuster1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Yakovlev1">[19]</xref>. This delay period activity has been thought to play a critical role in maintaining short-term memory. However, the delay-period activity in perirhinal neurons is less consistently selective for the sample stimuli after distractors are presented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Miller2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Miller3">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Delay period activity during the DMS task is also found in lateral PFC, but in less than half of the neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Miller3">[20]</xref>.

In contrast, Eskandar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Eskandar2">[38]</xref> developed a multiplicative neural network model that successfully predicted the responses (of ITC neurons in area TE) to both matching and nonmatching test images. In their experimental data few neurons showed stimulus-selective delay-period activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Eskandar1">[12]</xref>. Thus, their model did not depend on a reverberating circuit, and in fact did not propose any mechanism for storing the memory trace. Instead, it proposed a generic model that used correlation of a stored sample response that was somehow “played back” and compared with each test response. Here we report data from a DMS task showing that single neurons in area TE, but not perirhinal cortex, of inferior temporal cortex, have significant trial-by-trial correlations in the fluctuation of their activity (noise) across sample and match periods. These correlations suggest that some proportion of the neuronal response elicited by the sample stimulus is stored locally, and acts on subsequent stimulus elicited activity.</p><p>We present a computational model, based on single-trial learning in a matched filter, showing that the observed correlations could arise from storage of a working memory trace using rapid, short-term synaptic plasticity, and show how the outputs of these neurons could be utilized to detect the match. In this model, the brain does not detect the noise correlations themselves, but simply looks at the total level of activity in the TE neurons to perform the DMS task. Nonetheless, the noise correlations are important because many models of brain function could reproduce the DMS behavior of the monkeys, hence correct performance by itself is not a good criterion for selecting a model. For example, consider recording music on either an analog magnetic tape or on a digital memory stick. If you play back either recording, they will both reproduce the music. And, if you repeat the recordings hundreds of times, the average sound reproduction across these trials will be the same from both. However, if you carefully analyze the sound from each trial, certain systematic anomalies will arise. The analog tape will not move at constant speed, giving rise to shifts in frequencies (wow and flutter), and the digital recording will show only a finite set of levels (quantization). These imperfections have nothing to do with the task of reproducing the sound, but are a unique signature of the recording mechanism and can be used to differentiate between them. Similarly, we argue that the noise correlations are a clue to the mechanism used in short-term visual memory. The matched filter is performing the DMS task by noticing when the overall response is high, but it is also leaving the signature of its mechanism on the responses in the correlated noise. Thus, we can use the correlated noise to infer something about the mechanism, even though it is an epiphenomenon unnecessary for the DMS task.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We collected responses from two different parts of ITC: 35 TE neurons and 11 perirhinal neurons from two monkeys performing a visual DMS task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) using eight familiar stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). About 45% of trials had no nonmatch stimuli (sample-match) and about 45% of trials had one nonmatch stimulus (sample-nonmatch-match); the other 10% of trials had two nonmatch stimuli (sample-nonmatch-nonmatch-match) to keep the monkeys attentive to the task. Each picture from the stimulus set was presented as the sample 7–82 times for TE neurons, and 3–82 times for perirhinal neurons. The sample stimulus elicited responses between 0 and 115 spikes/s (median = 10 spikes/s) for TE neurons, and between 0 and 78 spikes/s (median = 10 spikes/s) for perirhinal neurons. In TE, responses were excitatory in 20 neurons, inhibitory in 2 neurons, and either excitatory or inhibitory depending on stimulus pattern in 13 neurons (p&lt;0.05, paired Wilcoxon test). In perirhinal cortex, responses were excitatory in 7 neurons, and were either excitatory or inhibitory depending on stimulus pattern in 4 neurons.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000073-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000073.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Sequential delayed match-to-sample task.</title><p>(A) Event sequence.

When the image is the sample to be remembered, a learning command (<italic>Learn</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g004">Figure 4</xref>) causes each input synapse of a TE neuron to set its weight proportional to its current input (the learning mechanism is not specified here, but any short-term process that made the synaptic excitability high after strong inputs and low after weak inputs would be sufficient.) During the sample presentation of the <italic>i</italic>-th pattern, the image is sparsely encoded across all N axons that project to TE neurons. A non-exclusive subset of these N axons then project to a given TE neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

In the deterministic model no noise is added to the encoder's activity, so the input to the <italic>m</italic>-th synapse on the <italic>k</italic>-th neuron after the <italic>i</italic>-th pattern is simply:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000073.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>M</italic> is the total number of synapses on the <italic>k</italic>-th neuron.</p><p>In the stochastic model, which is used to predict the correlated noise seen in our experiments, several types of noise are added to the encoder's output. First, there is a common noise term (δ) that is added to each encoder output, representing a level of arousal. Each encoder also has two independent noise contributions drawn, for each synapse, from a distribution common across synapses: a multiplicative (α) and an additive (β) noise. The input to the <italic>m</italic>-th synapse on the <italic>k</italic>-th neuron is then:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000073.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>α<sub>km</sub></italic>, <italic>β<sub>km</sub></italic>, and <italic>δ</italic> are samples of independent noise sources (<italic>α</italic>has mean 1 and <italic>β</italic> and <italic>δ</italic> have mean zero), and <italic>M</italic> is the number of synapses on the downstream neuron. All noise in the stochastic model is referred to the output of the encoder neurons. The samples of noise are drawn each time they are needed (e.g., three times for sample-nonmatch-match trials).

For each subsequent image the output of the TE neuron will be the product of the encoder output elicited by the test stimulus and the synaptic weights that hold the memory trace. Thus, the output of each TE or perirhinal neuron is a correlation: the sum of the product of the input activity with the stored weights. The response of the <italic>k</italic>-th neuron to the pattern pair (sample <italic>i</italic>, test <italic>j</italic>) is simply the sum over all <italic>M</italic> synapses:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000073.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula></p><p>In the matched filter theory, the test image is considered as a match if the activity summed across neurons is above a threshold. Some subset of neurons will respond strongly (on average) to a given sample pattern. When a nonmatch stimulus is later presented, not all of these neurons will fire strongly, so the product of weights and inputs (Equation 5) for at least some of those neurons will be low (even though the weight is high), and the sum of all those responses will not exceed the threshold for recognizing a match. When a match stimulus is presented, each neuron in the subset will again fire strongly, and be multiplied by the high weight, giving a sum of responses across neurons that exceed the threshold for recognizing a match. Thus, to recognize matches, the matched filter relies on the fact that a neuron that responded strongly to a given stimulus once will, on average, respond strongly to that stimulus again. The matched filter simply relies on standard stimulus selectivity–different stimuli evoke different average responses.</p><p>The matched filter mechanism for detecting matches does not make use of, but does give rise to, the “noise” correlations observed in TE neurons in our data. As just explained, the matched filter relies on differences in the average response to different stimuli to detect a match. But the weight stored after presentation of the sample image depends not on the average response to the sample image, but on the individual response to that presentation. The response of a neuron to an individual presentation of the sample image can be higher or lower than the average across presentations for that image. If, on a given trial, the response of a TE neuron to the sample image is higher than average, the synaptic weight will be set higher than the average during that trial. When the match is presented, the encoder signal can be lower, higher, or the same as the average. However, the multiplicative interaction between the input and the weight will bias the average of many such interactions to be higher than average if the stored weight is higher than average. Similarly, lower sample responses lead to lower synaptic weights and a lower than average response to the match. Put another way, the deviations of the responses from their means for the sample and test patterns will be correlated within a trial. Note that whereas individual neurons can be above or below average for any given trial, these fluctuations will average out, and the total activity across the population will only be above threshold for the repeat of the sample image.</p><p>We test this model in two ways. First, a single-synapse (scalar) version of the deterministic model was applied to the average data collected in the experiment, to test the model's ability to perform the DMS task, on average, like the neurons. Tests with the average responses can not evaluate the correlation of the response noise across conditions, so a second test was needed. We used a stochastic vector model (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g004">Figure 4</xref>) with a simple visual encoder and two types of noise (additive and multiplicative) on the input to the downstream neuron's synapses. We also added a noise source shared by all synapses, to test the hypothesis that changes in arousal could explain the noise correlations in our TE data. The model was simulated and the noise parameters were adjusted to best fit the correlation between the noise in the responses to the sample and the noise in the responses to the test stimuli found in the experimental data. It is important to emphasize that this tuning only sets the relative size of the correlations; the fact that there is a correlation depends upon the matched-filter model's structure. Indeed, the same tuning did not create correlations in the stochastic model of the perirhinal neurons, because they have no memory trace.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Deterministic Model Simulation</title><p>The inputs to the model are unknown and must be estimated. It is possible to train a neural network to find the <italic>x<sub>ki</sub></italic> that solves Equation 5 (not shown). However, this approach yields a model with a very large number of free parameters, and thus provides only weak support for our hypothesis. We can make a stronger test of our hypothesis by noting that in the DMS task there is a special case, the response of a neuron to the matching image, which has the response:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000073.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula></p><p>To compare our model to the data, we can only consider scalar variables, because the single-unit recordings give only the spike count in the response to a stimulus.

Furthermore, Equation 7 is only a rough approximation, because it takes the square root of the sum, instead of the sum of the square roots, of the individual <italic>r<sub>kn</sub></italic>.

Thus, the deterministic model can only be used to predict the responses to sample and nonmatch stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For the population of TE neurons, the correlations between sample response and prediction (R = 0.74) and nonmatch response and prediction (R = 0.73) are significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; p&lt;0.001; <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.54 for TE sample predictions, and 0.53 for TE nonmatch predictions).

This can not be because of exogenous factors (e.g., slowly varying arousal) introducing correlated noise into the responses, because the noise was also better correlated between sample and match responses even when there was an intervening nonmatch stimulus, which thus increased the temporal separation of the sample and match stimuli. This suggested that the individual response to the sample picture, and not some average response, was being stored somehow and then recalled at the time that the match stimulus was presented. To interpret this finding, we hypothesize a synaptic storage and recall mechanism: the memory trace of the response to the sample image is held in rapidly adapting weights on the synapses of each TE neuron. TE then acts as a matched filter to compare the new signal with the old one. In a matched filter model, a new picture is broken into pieces by the encoder and distributed across a set of multiply-accumulator elements. Each piece is multiplied by a weight that was set when the sample stimulus was presented. These results are added and compared to a threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Eldar1">[40]</xref>. This converts the time-domain operation of correlating two pictures shown sequentially (referred to as signals) into a spatial operation on the second signal, with the first signal being spatially distributed in the filter's weights.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Exploiting an Epiphenomenon</title><p>The noise correlations arise because of the multiplication stage in the matched filter. The brain cannot detect these noise correlations; it only detects the total activity in the population after the test image is presented. The experimenter can observe the noise correlations in the data, and infer from them something about the mechanism that is acting. That these correlations are irrelevant to performing the task is obvious because of the large number of neurons involved. To make a match or nonmatch judgment, the brain must take some kind of average over a population of neurons. Furthermore, this population must contain about the same number of neurons responding above and below their average responses. Thus, over the population the correlated noise would average out.</p><p>Another inference follows from our observations: that the synaptic weights holding the memory trace must be on the TE neurons from which we are recording. The responses of TE neurons can not simply be reflecting an input from a different area, say prefrontal cortex, which was recalling the previous input. If another area held the memory, then they would have to be holding the previous output of area TE. The exact same cells that projected to each neuron in the memory area would have to receive a return projection from that neuron. In other words, the mapping from TE to the memory area would have to be 1:1. No cortical brain area we know of contains a 1:1 mapping. Instead, neurons seem to have a large degree of fan-out and fan-in, so each neuron connects with many others, and many others connect to it. In such a many:many mapping the exact value of the response of the TE neurons to the sample stimulus would be averaged out by the time it returned to TE during recall. But that would destroy the very noise correlations we observed. Thus, the synapses that hold the memory trace must be on the TE neurons themselves.</p><p>In our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g004">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), the “signals” are the neurons that provide inputs to TE, and the weights are encoded by the strength of their synapses onto TE neurons. Each neuron remembers only its own input, and thus learning happens locally, by the modification of synaptic weights. The model is biologically plausible–the multiplication, addition, and threshold operations are easily available to neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Dayan1">[46]</xref>–and no signals need to be transmitted to, or recalled from, any other part of the brain for comparison. Note that this model has only an implicit recall; there is no actual reconstruction of the original signal to compare with the current signal. However, one surprising feature of the matched filter is that when excited by a random signal (e.g., white noise inputs), the average of its response will be an approximation of the original signal (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g011">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p>Our model is similar to most others formulated to describe memory in that it uses synaptic plasticity to create a stored memory. Here we specifically propose using rapid synaptic plasticity gated by a learning command. Although this rapid type of synaptic plasticity has not been observed, its existence has been hypothesized by others when considering how working memory might arise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Sandberg1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-vonderMalsburg1">[48]</xref>. Our hypothesis only requires that synapses of TE neurons are altered according to their current input: if a particular input is high the weight is set high and if a particular input is low the weight is set low. The synapse therefore has a memory of the input, which consists of both signal (mean response) and noise (deviation from the mean). Every subsequent signal is multiplied by this adapted synaptic weight. This multiplication correlates the response with the remembered signal–the mean plus the deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Delay-Period Activity</title><p>Our hypothesis of memory storage does not require delay activity, which has been seen mainly in perirhinal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Miller2">[15]</xref> and, even there, only a relatively small proportion of neurons show this property <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Fuster1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Miyashita2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Yakovlev1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Lehky1">[49]</xref>.

A consequence of the matched filter model (Equation 5) is that the average response over the population shows match enhancement and nonmatch suppression. This is the basis for the filter's discrimination. For an individual member of that population, however, nonmatch responses can be larger than match responses, depending upon the selectivity of the neuron.

The threshold determines the sensitivity of the detector, and thus is probably under behavioral control. The noise correlations are observable only by the experimenter after the task, and not by the brain during the task. The noise correlations are thus a clue to the mechanism used to solve the DMS task, in this case, a multiplicative model.</p><p>Our findings and model here extend our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Eskandar1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Eskandar2">[38]</xref>. In those studies we found that “responses to the nonmatch stimuli carried significant amounts of information about the pattern of the previous sample stimuli.” This is consistent with our findings here, because the response of an inferior temporal (IT) neuron would be the product of the visual codes for the sample and test stimuli. We hypothesized then that “the role of IT neurons in visual memory tasks is to compare the internal representations of current visual images with the internal representations of recalled images.” This is exactly what we are proposing here, but now we have a specific hypothesis for the memory mechanism that eliminates the need for recalling the response to the sample image.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Other Types of Memory</title><p>This new theory is applicable in any area of the brain that depends upon synaptic changes, rather than persistent activity, to hold a memory trace. Other types of working memory should be studied with this in mind.

For example, Standing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Standing1">[53]</xref> studied free-recall or recognition tasks. He showed that thousands of pictures or words could be recognized as familiar after being seen only once. As Standing pointed out, this is different from the limited “memory-span” (about seven items) required to deal with ordered lists. Although the DMS task is more like a memory-span task than a familiarity task, our matched filter model may be applicable to recognition tasks as well. Some part of the brain would have to be organized as many little matched filters, and it would have to set the weights in a different matched filter for every picture on which the subject concentrated. Obviously, this area would need a huge capacity, but it would be much more efficient to build a large capacity memory out of synaptic weights than out of reverberating circuits. Then, during testing, the matched filter would implicitly test the incoming picture against all stored pictures simultaneously. If any little filter responded with a total power above some threshold, the familiar object would be recognized. Another advantage of this approach to recognition memory is that the recall is implicit, and thus in a sense, free. There is no computation other than the weighted sum of inputs performed by the biophysical properties of the soma. This could be vitally important to the animal, which otherwise would have to actively search through thousands of memories to find a match. No matter how large the number of matched filters, the time to test an incoming pattern is fixed regardless of memory size. In search schemes, the time would grow with memory size.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Synaptic Versus Reverberating Memory Trace</title><p>Delay period activity in prefrontal cortex during memory tasks, which is proposed as playing a critical role in storing sensory signals, has been an important discovery for unraveling neuronal mechanisms of working memory since the 1970s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Fuster2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Funahashi1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000073-Kubota1">[55]</xref>.

The output of TE could thus be used to make the match/nonmatch decision, simply by applying a threshold to the total population activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our hypothesis arose from the need to explain the noise correlation seen in our experimental data from area TE of inferior temporal cortex. If the correlations in our data were due to an artifact arising from some stimulus-dependence that remained after the mean was subtracted, we might have seen a similar pattern of correlations in perirhinal cortex. Also, breaking the serial relationships within single trials by shuffling the match responses within each stimulus pattern group should not have destroyed the correlations (cf. Results). If the correlations arose from a slowly varying signal having nothing to do with memory or the stimulus (e.g., due to arousal) the correlations should be higher between sample and nonmatch than between sample and match in sample-nonmatch-match trials. Thus, our explanation for the correlations between noise in sample and test responses in TE neurons is that they are a consequence of the multiplicative mechanism in a local, synaptic, short-term memory.</p><p>This model does not specify how a neuronal circuit might perform matched-filtering. Cortical architecture, connections and dynamics are all ignored. Nonetheless, this model does more than merely provide a representation of the data. Our data show only that cells are selective for stimuli, respond differently depending upon the condition (sample, nonmatch, match), and that there is correlated noise on their responses across sample-test presentations. The filter model demonstrates (thus, it is an existence proof) that the responses themselves (not the noise) could come from a multiplicative interaction between a synaptic memory trace and a current input. Note that this part of the model is parameter-free: there is no tuning or fitting involved. Thus, it is a very strong argument in favor of the matched filter theory of short-term memory, even without a biophysically detailed model. Furthermore, the matched filter hypothesis explains why the noise correlation exists, even though it makes no contribution to solving the memory task. It is important to remember that the noise-correlations are not built into the model by fitting it to the data (e.g, perirhinal neurons are fit the same way but have no such correlations). Thus, this “black-box” filter model, although simplistic with respect to cortical circuitry, provides a mechanistic explanation of how the noise correlations could arise, and thus is a plausible model for short-term memory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods</title><p>Two monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) were trained to perform a sequential delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task. The monkeys squatted in a primate chair 57 cm in front of a rear projection screen (90° visual angle) with a black and white random dot pattern. Trials began when the monkey touched a bar on the chair. A fixation point (0.5°×0.5°) appeared and the monkey was required to fixate loosely (within ±5° of the fixation spot) for the whole trial. When patterns used in the DMS task (8.5°×8.5°, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) appeared, it obscured the fixation point (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000073-g001">Figure 1A</xref> for timings). Because we were studying working memory, we used a set of very familiar visual patterns, ones that the monkeys had seen thousands of times each, to avoid any effects due to novelty. Over ninety percent of the trials were divided between trials with no nonmatches or one nonmatch. The other trials had two or more nonmatch stimuli to make it difficult for the monkeys to anticipate the match stimulus (the monkeys generally performed these trials correctly). Because the numbers of trials with 2 or more nonmatching trials were small (typically 1–4%), data were analyzed only from the trials with either zero or one nonmatch stimulus. An error was registered either when the monkey did not release the touch bar during the two seconds after the original stimulus reappeared (matching stimulus) or when the monkey moved its eyes beyond the fixation limit.

Because the variance of a neuronal response is often proportional to its amplitude, we used multiplicative encoder noise. The other noise sources were additive.

When K<sub>β</sub> was zero, the matched filter discriminated the match stimulus perfectly. As K<sub>β</sub> increased discrimination decreased. For each neuron, there is a draw of alpha and beta from the same distribution for each stimulus. A shared input noise, δ, the same for all neurons and all phases (sample, nonmatch, and match) in a single trial, was used to test the hypothesis that the noise correlations between sample and match came from exogenous sources. The δ noise was common to all the neurons, as might happen if the animal's attention or level of arousal changed from trial-to-trial.
