      <p>When we even bother to think about them, we usually regard the bacteria and other
                microbes that live in our guts and on our skin with disgust. However, recent
                discoveries about the roles the trillions of microbes living in the average
                person's gut play in obesity, cardiovascular disease, and immunity have led us
                to look upon our omnipresent bacterial symbionts with a less jaundiced eye. Mutually
                beneficial partnerships with bacteria are widespread throughout the animal kingdom:
                some types of squid have bioluminescent bacteria that help them to escape detection,
                while marine tubeworms harbor bacteria that provide their hosts with nutrients.</p>
      <p>A particularly fascinating example of symbiosis occurs between the tsetse fly
                    <italic>Glossina morsitans</italic> and the bacterium <italic>Wigglesworthia
                    glossinidia</italic> (named after Sir Vincent Wigglesworth, the entomologist
                with the best name ever). Tsetse flies are the sole vectors for the trypanosomes
                that cause about 10,000 new cases of sleeping sickness in Africa each year.</p>
      <p><italic>Wigglesworthia</italic>, which can only survive inside the gut of tsetse
                flies, has a minimal genome, since it lost much of its DNA as it coevolved with its
                tsetse host over the last 50–80 million years. These bacteria hang out
                exclusively within tsetse flies; the set-up provides the
                    <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> with protection and an energy source. In return,
                the bacteria perform a variety of services for their host, including vitamin
                synthesis and resistance to energetically costly trypanosome infections, both of
                which may be important for tsetse fly fertility.</p>
      <p>Previously, researcher Serap Aksoy and her colleagues discovered that tsetse flies
                that lack <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> are more susceptible to infection with
                trypanosomes. In a new study described in this issue of <italic>PLoS
                    Biology</italic>, Brian Weiss, Jingwen Wang, and Serap Aksoy explored how
                    <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> might affect the immune responses of tsetse
                flies. To do this, they produced larvae that lack <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic>
                        (<italic>Gmm<sup>Wgm−</sup></italic>) by feeding the antibiotic
                ampicillin to pregnant female flies (ampicillin selectively kills
                    <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> without affecting other kinds of bacteria living
                in the flies). As a handy challenge to the flies' immune system, they injected
                the flies with <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 bacteria. While mature adult (8-day-old)
                wild-type (WT) tsetse flies are resistant to infection with <italic>E.
                    coli,</italic> young (3-day-old) flies are quite susceptible. Compared to mature
                adult WT tsetse, after injection with <italic>E. coli,</italic> the age-matched
                        <italic>Gmm<sup>Wgm−</sup></italic> dropped like . . . flies.</p>
      <p>To figure out the basis of the <italic>Gmm<sup>Wgm−</sup></italic> flies'
                compromised immunity, the authors examined the expression of genes known to be
                involved in immune responses. They found that expression of these genes was
                virtually the same in uninfected WT and <italic>Gmm<sup>Wgm−</sup></italic>
                adults. However, when the flies were injected with <italic>E. coli</italic>,
                expression increased dramatically in WT flies compared to
                        <italic>Gmm<sup>Wgm−</sup></italic>. Most striking was the difference
                in expression of genes involved in cellular immunity processes such as phagocytosis
                (engulfment of pathogens by host hemocytes) and melanization (laying down of melanin
                to form a clot at wound sites).</p>
      <p>This led the authors to question whether adult WT flies would become more susceptible
                to infection when phagocytosis was blocked, so they injected tiny beads directly
                into the circulatory system of mature WT flies in order to divert the hemocytes and
                make them unavailable for phagocytosis. The bead-injected WT flies turned out to be
                highly susceptible to <italic>E. coli</italic> infection, indicating that
                phagocytosis is an important component of the flies' immune response.</p>
      <p>Next, to find out if <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> is necessary for melanization,
                the authors looked at the sites of <italic>E. coli</italic> injection. In
                        <italic>Gmm<sup>Wgm−</sup></italic>, the wound was still oozing
                hemolymph (insect blood) 30 minutes after the injection and no melanin was observed.
                Meanwhile, in WT flies there was no hemolymph visible and a melanin clot had formed
                at the wound.</p>
      <p>Hemocytes play a central important role in cellular immunity; not only do they
                phagocytose pathogens, but differentiated hemocytes called crystal cells also
                produce clot-forming melanin. Counting circulating and sessile hemocytes revealed
                that adult <italic>Gmm<sup>Wgm−</sup></italic> had far fewer hemocytes than
                their wild-type counterparts. The authors speculated that the absence of hemocytes
                in adult <italic>Gmm<sup>Wgm−</sup></italic> flies reflects a lack of blood
                cell differentiation during development. This was borne out by the drastically
                decreased expression in <italic>Gmm<sup>Wgm−</sup></italic> of two
                transcription factors known to be involved in hemocyte differentiation in
                    <italic>Drosophila.</italic></p>
      <p>Together, these results show that <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> must be present in
                immature tsetse flies so that the immune system can develop and function properly in
                adults. Thus, reminiscent of the relationship between humans and the bacteria in
                their guts, <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> and tsetse flies have coevolved to the
                point where they can't really survive without each other. The
                    <italic>Wigglesworthia–</italic>tsetse fly association is a great model
                system for studying the effect of symbionts on host immunity, because of the short
                generation times of the flies, which are easy and inexpensive to rear. Furthermore,
                the authors' findings could lead to new ways of modulating tsetse flies'
                immune response to trypanosomes, hopefully making them more resistant to infection
                and therefore less efficient vectors for these deadly pathogens.</p>
