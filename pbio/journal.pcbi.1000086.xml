Although intracellular signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks are highly integrated, previous analyses have largely focused on independent processes (e.g., metabolism) without considering the interplay that exists among them. However, there is evidence that many diseases arise from multifunctional components with roles throughout signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a flux balance analysis (FBA)–based strategy, referred to as integrated dynamic FBA (idFBA), that dynamically simulates cellular phenotypes arising from integrated networks. The idFBA framework requires an integrated stoichiometric reconstruction of signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes. It assumes quasi-steady-state conditions for “fast” reactions and incorporates “slow” reactions into the stoichiometric formalism in a time-delayed manner. To assess the efficacy of idFBA, we developed a prototypic integrated system comprising signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes with network features characteristic of actual systems and incorporating kinetic parameters based on typical time scales observed in literature. idFBA was applied to the prototypic system, which was evaluated for different environments and gene regulatory rules. In addition, we applied the idFBA framework in a similar manner to a representative module of the single-cell eukaryotic organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Ultimately, idFBA facilitated quantitative, dynamic analysis of systemic effects of extracellular cues on cellular phenotypes and generated comparable time-course predictions when contrasted with an equivalent kinetic model. Since idFBA solves a linear programming problem and does not require an exhaustive list of detailed kinetic parameters, it may be efficiently scaled to integrated intracellular systems that incorporate signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes at the genome scale, such as the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> system presented here.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cellular systems comprise many diverse components and component interactions spanning signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and metabolism. Although signaling, metabolic, and regulatory activities are often investigated independently of one another, there is growing evidence that considerable interplay occurs among them, and that the malfunctioning of this interplay is associated with disease. The computational analysis of integrated networks has been challenging because of the varying time scales involved as well as the sheer magnitude of such systems (e.g., the numbers of rate constants involved). To this end, we developed a novel computational framework called integrated dynamic flux balance analysis (idFBA) that generates quantitative, dynamic predictions of species concentrations spanning signaling, regulatory, and metabolic processes. idFBA extends an existing approach called flux balance analysis (FBA) in that it couples “fast” and “slow” reactions, thereby facilitating the study of whole-cell phenotypes and not just sub-cellular network properties. We applied this framework to a prototypic integrated system derived from literature as well as a representative integrated yeast module (the high-osmolarity glycerol [HOG] pathway) and generated time-course predictions that matched with available experimental data. By extending this framework to larger-scale systems, phenotypic profiles of whole-cell systems could be attained expeditiously.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>We thank the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (GM08715/NIH Biotechnology Training Grant) for funding EPG.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="20"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular biochemical networks are comprised of signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes. (Note that here we use “regulation” to refer specifically to transcriptional regulatory and protein synthesis networks, and “signaling” to describe intracellular reactions that drive responses to the extracellular environment.) Until recently, computational analyses focused independently on signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks. However, high-throughput experimental data coupled with computational systems analysis techniques have elucidated multifunctional components involved in fundamental disease processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Gianchandani1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Kim1">[4]</xref>. For example, signaling cascades are triggered by the presence of extracellular stimuli and often result in activation of transcription factors. These transcription factors function in regulatory networks, regulating the transcription of associated genes and the synthesis of various proteins used in signal transduction and metabolism. Cellular metabolism is responsible for the production of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the synthesis of amino acids among other biomass precursors, all of which are used elsewhere in the cell. Consequently, a key challenge in the post-genomic era is to consider the interconnectedness of biochemical networks and how extracellular cues affect highly integrated intracellular processes to elicit cellular responses such as growth or differentiation.</p><p>Dynamic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Famili1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Snoep1">[6]</xref> and structural analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Kauffman1">[7]</xref> have been employed to quantitatively analyze large-scale biochemical network modules. Typically, in dynamic analyses, a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the mass (balance) of each species in the system is constructed. Despite its generality, the application of this type of mechanistic model at a genome-scale is largely considered impractical because it necessitates the consideration of many pathways for which detailed reactions and their kinetic parameters are not yet known. Structural analyses like flux balance analysis (FBA) can calculate phenotypic properties of a biological network like a steady-state flux (i.e., reaction rate) distribution without detailed kinetic information. FBA requires a physiologically relevant objective function (e.g., in the case of metabolism, maximizing the growth rate or maximizing ATP production), mass-balance constraints (i.e., the stoichiometry of the reactions), and constraints on reaction directions and thermodynamics. Since the physicochemical constraints are readily defined (e.g., from the annotated genome sequence and measured enzymatic capacities), FBA has been used effectively to study large-scale biochemical networks, particularly metabolic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Price1">[8]</xref>. However, in general, the steady-state assumption of FBA prevents it from generating dynamic concentration profiles of intracellular species.</p><p>An additional challenge to the modeling of <italic>integrated</italic> systems is that time scales of intracellular biochemical networks generally span multiple orders of magnitude. Signaling and metabolic reactions typically occur rapidly. For example, kinase/phosphatase reactions, protein conformational changes, and most metabolic reactions occur on the order of fractions of a second to seconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Papin1">[9]</xref>. By contrast, receptor internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Lauffenburger1">[10]</xref> and regulatory events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Weng1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Kaznessis1">[12]</xref>, as well as end-stage phenotypic properties such as cellular growth or differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Alberts1">[13]</xref> can take several minutes to hours. These multiple time-scales pose computational challenges for the quantitative analysis of integrated systems. For instance, kinetic model-based strategies suffer from a scarcity of values for kinetic parameters as well as poor accuracy of known kinetic parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-vanRiel1">[14]</xref>. In addition, models of integrated systems are inherently “stiff,” i.e., they must include “fast” and “slow” reaction dynamics simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Gerdtzen1">[15]</xref>, and they are consequently difficult to simulate and extremely sensitive to modeling errors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Kumar1">[16]</xref>. Indeed, it is challenging to apply FBA to models of integrated systems because of the steady-state assumption intrinsic to FBA and the “fast” and “slow” reaction dynamics that coexist intracellularly. Due to these complexities, previous models and analyses have focused primarily on network modules rather than integrated systems. These include kinetic, stoichiometric, and causality analyses of modular signaling systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Hoffmann1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Papin2">[20]</xref>, metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Rizzi1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Mahadevan1">[25]</xref>, and regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Stelling1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Lee1">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Some preliminary dynamic analyses of integrated systems have been completed. Integrated analyses of regulatory and metabolic networks revealed novel mechanisms in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Covert1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Herrgard1">[30]</xref>. Metabolic reactions were represented stoichiometrically, and regulatory reactions were captured by representing gene regulatory rules using a Boolean formalism. FBA was implemented assuming quasi-steady-state conditions, i.e., the typical time constant of metabolic transients was relatively faster than the simulation time step for temporal integration of phenotypic variables (e.g., biomass as a measure of cellular growth). Recently, a kinetic model accounting for signal transduction, metabolism, and regulation was constructed to describe the response of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to osmotic shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Klipp1">[31]</xref>. This model connected specific outputs of one network (e.g., signaling) with the inputs of another network (e.g., metabolism) in a “sequential” fashion. The complete set of interactions among the biochemical networks, such as feedback and feed-forward of proteins expressed as a function of the regulatory network to signaling and metabolism, was not considered. Additionally, it required an exhaustive list of kinetic parameters (e.g., rate constants) for the reactions, and time-courses of individual modules (or collections of reactions) were evaluated separately. As reconstructions of large-scale signaling and metabolic networks are emerging, there is a growing need for the development of a framework to study these networks from an integrated perspective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Papin1">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to develop a FBA-based computational framework, termed integrated dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (idFBA), for the quantitative, dynamic analysis of cellular behaviors arising from signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks at the genome-scale.

It assumes quasi-steady-state conditions for “fast” reactions and incorporates “slow” reactions in a time-delayed manner. To assess the efficacy of idFBA, we developed a prototypic integrated system with topological features characteristic of those observed in existing signaling, metabolic, and regulatory network reconstructions as well as kinetic parameters reported in literature.

The prototypic signaling network is comprised of a set of reactions that attempts to mimic what is typical of biological signaling pathways such as phosphorelay and kinase cascade modules. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g001">Figure 1</xref> (top left), ligands (L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub>) bind to receptors (R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub>) to form ligand-receptor complexes (L<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub>R<sub>3</sub>). These complexes are subsequently either internalized or involved in phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation of signaling components takes place through a series of reactions involving ATP and other activated components. Any one signaling component can also activate multiple other signaling components; this activity represents the type of multi-functionality (e.g., crosstalk) that is often found in biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Papin3">[32]</xref>. Ultimately, activated transcription factors (T<sub>1</sub>p, T<sub>2</sub>p, and T<sub>3</sub>p), that are representative of phosphorylated proteins are the downstream effector molecules that result from the signaling pathways.</p><p>The model of signal transduction consists of a total of 45 reactions.

Most of the reactions in the prototypic signaling network are “fast” relative to transcriptional regulation; steady-state concentrations are achieved on the order of seconds.

In general, they describe the connections between environmental cues and transcriptional responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Gianchandani1">[1]</xref>. Inputs to regulatory networks are environmental cues, including the presence and absence of extracellular metabolites, reaction fluxes, and specific conditions such as pH values. The internal reactions, often not known in chemical detail, are represented by regulatory rules that describe the activation or inhibition of gene transcription in response to these environmental cues. The outputs are the synthesized protein products that result through a combination of the signaling inputs acting upon the regulatory rules as well as consequent transcription and translation.</p><p>These networks have been mathematically described using a Boolean formalism, in which the state of a gene is represented as either transcribed or not transcribed in response to regulatory signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Gianchandani1">[1]</xref>. This formalism employs Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to describe the dependence of gene transcription upon extracellular metabolites and transcription factors as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Covert2">[29]</xref>. Recently, a formalism that represents such regulatory rules in matrix form was developed, allowing for the systemic characterization of the properties of a transcriptional regulatory network and facilitating the computation of the transcriptional state of the genome under any given set of environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Gianchandani1">[1]</xref>. Furthermore, this “quasi-stoichiometric” matrix formalism enables regulatory networks to be represented alongside stoichiometric representations of signaling and metabolic networks: if a gene is repressed, fluxes of reactions involving the corresponding protein product are constrained to zero.</p><p>Studies on the dynamic behavior of regulation have involved constructing mass-balanced models of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, ribosomes, and proteasomes in order to quantitatively predict protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Stelling1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Klipp1">[31]</xref>. However, these approaches require estimation of rate constants that are difficult to measure experimentally. Furthermore, these descriptions of regulation are not complete because they do not account for the amino acids produced from metabolism and required for protein synthesis. In order to effectively couple regulation with other functional cellular modules, a more complete representation of the dynamic behavior of protein synthesis that facilitates balancing of input/output relationships across network modules is required.</p><p>The goal of the idFBA approach presented here, therefore, is to quantitatively account for the production and use of proteins throughout the cell. The transcriptional regulatory network is comprised of transcription factors that associate with specific genes, leading to the activation or inactivation of gene transcription. Activated genes yield proteins that participate in various intracellular signaling, metabolic, and regulatory reactions.

In general, yeast cells use the HOG pathway to accumulate glycerol under hyperosmotic conditions, to balance the osmotic pressure with the extracellular environment. Osmotic stress signals are communicated via the HOG signaling pathway, leading to the activation of Hot1 and other transcription factors. These transcription factors subsequently promote the expression of glycolytic enzymes, such as Stl1, Gpd1, and Gpp2, thereby catalyzing metabolic reactions leading to increased glycerol production.</p><p>As this model serves an illustrative purpose here, the HOG pathway was restricted to the key set of reactions necessary for its phenotypic function. Specifically, 26 reactions spanning 48 components were assimilated in stoichiometric matrix form, including 16 reactions across 33 components in signaling; a single transcription factor activating three regulated genes; and seven reactions across 12 components in metabolism. Inputs of this module included osmotic shock (signaling) and glucose (metabolism), and outputs included glycerol (metabolism). Key reactions connecting the underlying signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes were the translocation of the kinase Hog1 into the nucleus for the activation of transcription factor Hot1 (signal transduction and metabolism), and the synthesis of metabolic enzymes Stl1, Gpd1, and Gpp2 for reactions involved in the conversion of glucose to glycerol (transcriptional regulation and metabolism). Other reactions in the HOG pathway as previously experimentally characterized (e.g., inhibition of Hog1 by phosphatases Ptp2, Ptp3, and Ptc1, thereby allowing the cell to keep the HOG pathway in check and maintain osmotic balance) were excluded from the reconstruction used here for simplicity.</p><p>As with the prototypic system, the representative integrated yeast module was implemented using the idFBA framework as well as a kinetic model similar to the one in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Klipp1">[31]</xref>, and the two approaches were contrasted for validation purposes.

FBA is a constraints-based approach that attempts to derive a phenotype in the form of a steady-state flux distribution for the reactions in a given biological system.

If a particular reaction is included in the network at time <italic>t</italic> based on the user-defined rules and parameters (i.e., it has a non-zero flux at that time), the binary parameters <bold>I</bold>(<italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>t</italic>) for the reactions sharing components with the included reaction are set to zero at that time point and/or at future time points, depending on the specified time delays, indicating that they are not included in the network. Multiplying these zero-values by the upper bounds of the associated reaction fluxes nets a new upper bound of zero. As a consequence, fluxes through the reactions sharing components with an included reaction are set to zero at specific times in order to drive all the flux through the included reaction. In this way, the hypothesized network objective is maximized, all the while ensuring that flux is driven through all “active” reactions. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g004">Figure 4</xref>, including the receptor internalization reaction (L<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub> → L<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1,int</sub>) implies that the binary variables for the reactions (L<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub>+S<sub>1</sub> → L<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub> · S<sub>1</sub>) and (L<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub> → L<sub>1</sub>+R<sub>1</sub>) are set to zero. In this manner, a feasible flux distribution for a signaling network is obtained by maximizing for the activation of transcription factors.

T<sub>1</sub>p is produced through a series of reactions in the prototypic integrated system. Specifically, the ligand L<sub>1</sub> initiates a series of reactions leading to the production of T<sub>1</sub> and its eventual phosphorylation (T<sub>1</sub>p). The inactive T<sub>1</sub> can also be phosphorylated via a series of reactions initiated by ligand L<sub>2</sub> if T<sub>1</sub> is present in the system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g007">Figure 7(A)</xref> illustrates that, when L<sub>1</sub> is present, approximately 15 percent more biomass is produced (case 1, blue solid line).

For the kinetic model, representative kinetic parameters were obtained from literature, as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000086.s001">Text S1</xref>. As previously described, these two approaches are completely independent: the idFBA framework requires only stoichiometric constraints and approximates the dynamics of the system with time-delay information, whereas the kinetic model requires all of the kinetic parameters and yields a more detailed portrait of the system dynamics. For both implementations, we assumed an initial ligand concentration, 2.0 µM, for all three ligands. We note that the following dynamic parameters for slow reactions were identified from the kinetic model and implemented as τ<italic><sub>delay</sub></italic> and τ<italic><sub>duration</sub></italic> in idFBA: the degradation of transcription factors, 5 h, the delay in protein synthesis, 40 min, the degradation of proteins, 4 h, internalization, 5 h, and inhibition, 5 h. One striking result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g007">Figure 7C</xref>. The growth times calculated by both approaches are comparable (computed as 4.9 h for idFBA (blue solid line) and 5.1 h for the kinetic model (red dotted line)), with a difference of just two time steps over a 51-time-step simulation. The discrepancy in the amount of biomass synthesized is a consequence of the kinetic-based model itself. Unlike in idFBA which accounts for transcriptional regulation, all of the reactions in the metabolic network of the kinetic model are constitutively active. As a result, resources such as amino acids are used in other pathways, e.g., for the synthesis of surplus proteins, and consequently the amount of biomass produced is less than the value estimated by idFBA which simply maximizes for biomass production. One way to overcome this challenge is to further discretize the time domain in the idFBA implementation. In other words, as the level of discretization is increased (i.e., the length of each time step is decreased), the predictive precision of the idFBA framework improves, and vice-versa. At the same time, this increase in predictive precision must be balanced by an increase in computational complexity due to the additional calculations that are necessitated. Nevertheless, as illustrated with the prototypic system (and the representative integrated yeast module below), idFBA effectively approximates the dynamics of a system using purely the underlying network stoichiometry, efficaciously offering novel hypotheses that can serve as the basis for further experimental and computational study.</p></sec><sec id="s3a5"><title>Robustness to parameter values</title><p>To further assess the practicality of the idFBA framework at a large scale, we systematically evaluated how robust the framework was with respect to each of several parameters for the prototypic integrated system. Specifically, we considered the maximum carbon uptake rate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000086.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as well as the different time delays imposed on the system. In the case of the prototypic system, these delays included the degradation time of the transcription factors, the time delay due to transcription and translation, the degradation time of the proteins, and the time delay due to receptor-ligand internalization as well as lysosomal activity. For each of these five parameters, we varied the initial value used for the simulations described above by 10%, 50%, and 90% in each direction (up and down) and observed the resultant phenotypic variables, i.e., the concentrations of carbon and biomass, over time. The results of this robustness analysis for biomass synthesis are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g008">Figure 8</xref> (carbon consumption data not shown). The system was robust to changes in the degradation time of transcription factors and the delays associated with receptor-ligand internalization and lysosomal processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g008">Figure 8B and 8D</xref>, respectively). The change in the total amount of biomass synthesized was less than 12% for up to 90% change (up or down) in the values of these parameters. By contrast, changes to the maximum carbon uptake rate, the transcriptional delay, and the protein degradation time altered the time course of biomass synthesis more noticeably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g008">Figure 8A, 8C, and 8D</xref>, respectively), suggesting that increasing accuracy in these parameters corresponds to increasing confidence in the idFBA-based results. Similar observations were noted with the amount of carbon consumed under these varying conditions (results not shown). Interestingly, these results matched well with our expectations. For example, when the length of the transcriptional delay is decreased significantly (by 50% or 90% of the original value), the time it takes to attain maximal biomass falls as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, blue and red lines, respectively, versus black line). This finding further strengthens our confidence in the idFBA-based implementation of the prototypic integrated system.

For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g009">Figure 9A</xref>, both simulations suggested an initial delay in protein synthesis, likely due to transcriptional delays, followed by a rapid increase in glycerol concentration at between 1.5 and 2 h post-stimulation by osmotic stress. As stated above for prototypic system, differences in specific values of the different network components is a consequence of the kinetic-based model itself in which, unlike idFBA, reactions are constitutively active as implemented herein. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000086-g009">Figure 9(B)</xref>, the kinetic-based model suggests that an initial intracellular concentration of glycerol (5 µM) is exported out of the cell via the glycerol exchange reaction (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000086.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>); however, idFBA does not illustrate this result because all metabolic fluxes are constrained to zero at each time step since no glucose is taken up by the cell.

Additional work may include (1) a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters and (2) an evaluation of the effects of network perturbations, such as single- or double-gene (reaction) knockouts.

Instantaneous inclusion of “slow” reactions in a time-delayed fashion accounted for network interactions occurring over a wide range of time scales. Previous approaches based on FBA have only addressed the coupling of regulatory structure with metabolic systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Covert2">[29]</xref>, which do not account for the effects of extracellular signaling cues on cellular phenotype.</p><p>The key features and results described here include: (1) an explicit accounting of the protein synthesis demands of a transcriptional regulatory network in the context of signaling and metabolic functions; (2) a quasi-steady-state description of cellular signaling events, readily interfaced with metabolic and regulatory networks; (3) similar dynamic profiles of phenotypic variables (e.g., biomass production) between the idFBA framework presented here and an explicit kinetic model; and (4) applicability of the idFBA framework to actual biological systems through an illustrative example using yeast osmoregulation and agreement with published values. To implement idFBA, the objective function for the underlying optimization problem included, for signaling networks, the reactions associated with the activation of transcription factors. The subsequent analysis resulted in “excluded reaction fluxes” (e.g., receptor internalization and protein degradation). These reactions were specified as “active” to denote their participation in the reaction network by imposing simple constraints (<italic>v</italic> = 0) on their counterparts, as described in “Conceptual Methods and Framework.”</p><p>Comparison with the detailed kinetic model validates the idFBA approach. Specifically, approximating the temporal progression of “slow” reactions in signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks as steady-state constraints with time-delay and duration parameters provides acceptable predictions of the dynamic trends of a cell's phenotypic behavior. The primary motivation for comparing idFBA with a detailed kinetic model was to determine whether idFBA would yield comparable temporal behavior in spite of the inherent approximation it contained. Optimization-based approaches have provided accurate quantitative predictions of cellular growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Varma1">[24]</xref>. However, signaling networks have not previously been modeled at a scale comparable to that of metabolic and regulatory networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Papin1">[9]</xref>. Databases are increasingly available for signaling networks and efforts are ongoing to reconstruct larger, genome-scale signaling systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Papin3">[32]</xref>. As this information becomes available, the idFBA framework can be applied to cellular systems and be coupled with experimental assays to generate quantitative hypotheses and assist in an iterative model-building process for deriving emergent properties of these systems.</p><p>The idFBA framework optimizes the system at the current time step, <italic>t<sub>current</sub></italic>, according to the linear programming formulation of FBA (Equation 17).<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000086.e062" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(17)</label></disp-formula>Altering this framework to impose a multi-horizon formulation may facilitate the evaluation of different objective functions because the formulation naturally accounts for long-term effects of the calculated flux distribution at the current time step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Mahadevan1">[25]</xref>. The multi-horizon formulation is shown in Equation 18, where <italic>w<sub>j</sub></italic> is the weight associated with the objective after <italic>T<sub>j</sub></italic> sample times.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000086.e063" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(18)</label></disp-formula></p><p>The main assumption of a multi-horizon formulation is that the flux distribution at <italic>t<sub>current</sub></italic> is determined such that it maximizes a cellular objective within a certain future time period of interest. The resulting optimization problem, including a Boolean representation of the transcriptional regulatory network, becomes a multi-horizon, mixed-integer linear programming problem. Though the solution of such a problem needs further development for its scalability to large-scale systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Bemporad1">[64]</xref>, it may shed light on whether signal transduction at the current time step is optimally driven by a long-term objective. Currently, multi-stage optimization problems have been solved only for metabolic systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Mahadevan1">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, a method called Biological Objective Solution Search (BOSS) was developed for the inference of an objective function for a biological system from its underlying network stoichiometry as well as experimentally-measured flux distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Gianchandani3">[54]</xref>. This method identifies objectives from experimental fluxes by defining a putative stoichiometric objective reaction, adding this reaction to the existing set of stoichiometric constraints, and maximizing it via linear programming. This new approach is capable of inferring the objective functions of metabolic networks, as well as metabolic and regulatory networks for which the objective is not well-characterized experimentally. Therefore, utilizing BOSS to identify objectives for the signaling, regulatory, and metabolic networks would facilitate the identification of an <italic>in silico</italic> flux distribution for the integrated system, a key step in the idFBA framework.</p><p>The fact that different reactions occur on different time scales (e.g., signaling reactions are usually fast whereas regulatory reactions are usually slow) is readily handled within the idFBA framework. Reactions with time constants of more than a unit time step are considered “slow”. However, identifying the optimal discretization of the time domain would facilitate a more accurate simulation for systems with multiple time-scales. Given typical rate constants, model reduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Gerdtzen1">[15]</xref> and Monte Carlo sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Resat1">[65]</xref> techniques may help characterize representative time-scales of a given system as well.</p><p>As illustrated by the idFBA results for the prototypic integrated system and particularly the representative yeast module, the methodology and analyses afforded by this framework can provide insight into fundamental characteristics of biological systems, including network components and interactions. Evaluating how whole-cell systems respond to different perturbations, including modifications to environmental cues as well as intracellular reactions, can offer insights into disease mechanisms and possible therapeutic avenues. For example, assessing how genetic perturbations of signaling proteins affect the transcriptional program and metabolism of a cell is essential to fully appreciating the end-stage phenotypic effects of the perturbations on the whole cell. Furthermore, evaluating how modifications to an existing transcriptional regulatory program (e.g., altering the Boolean rules governing transcription of one or more genes) affect whole-cell behavior is essential in the design and engineering of metabolic systems. Such a complete picture of cellular response can drive accurate predictions of disease and drug discovery.</p><p>Additionally, unlike kinetic-based models and other similar approaches, the idFBA framework requires significantly fewer parameters and can facilitate an approximation of the dynamics of large-scale systems quickly and efficiently, given a stoichiometric network reconstruction. As has been hypothesized in the literature recently, our idFBA results support the theory that the structure of a network, rather than the detailed kinetic values that describe it, can drive the dynamics of its phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000086-Brandman1">[66]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, a novel technique called integrated dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (idFBA) has been developed to analyze integrated systems, and specifically to account for the interactions between signaling, metabolic, and transcriptional regulatory networks across many time scales. This approach facilitates the study of systemic effects of extracellular cues on cellular behavior in a quantitative manner. Additionally, the success of idFBA on a prototypic integrated system as well as a representative integrated yeast module serves as a benchmark for future analyses of integrated biochemical systems.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000086.s001" mimetype="application/pdf" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000086.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Text S1 - Prototypic Integrated System</label><caption><p>(0.06 MB PDF)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000086.s002" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000086.s002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Text S2 - Representative Yeast Module</label><caption><p>(0.55 MB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Markus W.
