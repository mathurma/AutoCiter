<abstract>
<p>The developmental transition from a vegetative to a reproductive phase (i.e., flowering) is timed by the seasonal cue day length or photoperiod in many plant species. Through the photoperiod pathway, inductive day lengths trigger the production of a systemic flowering signal, florigen, to provoke the floral transition. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), widely conserved in angiosperms, is a major component of the mobile florigen. In the long-day plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>FT</italic> expression is rhythmically activated by the output of the photoperiod pathway <italic>CONSTANS</italic> (<italic>CO</italic>), specifically at the end of long days. How <italic>FT</italic> expression is modulated at an adequate level in response to the long-day cue to set a proper flowering time remains unknown. Here, we report a periodic histone deacetylation mechanism for the photoperiodic modulation of <italic>FT</italic> expression. We have identified a plant-unique core structural component of an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. In long days, this component accumulates at dusk, and is recruited by a MADS-domain transcription factor to the <italic>FT</italic> locus specifically at the end of the day, leading to periodic histone deacetylation of <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at dusk. Furthermore, we found that at the end of long days CO activity not only activates <italic>FT</italic> expression but also enables HDAC-activity recruitment to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin to dampen the level of <italic>FT</italic> expression, and so prevent precocious flowering in response to the inductive long-day cue. These results collectively reveal a periodic histone deacetylation mechanism for the day-length control of flowering time in higher plants.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The timing of the developmental transition from a vegetative to a reproductive phase is critically important for reproductive success in flowering plants. Plants synchronize the timing of their floral transition with the changing seasons to flower at a suitable time. The change in day length, or photoperiod, is a key seasonal cue, especially at high latitudes. It is through the photoperiod pathway that day lengths trigger the production of a systemic flowering signal, florigen, to induce the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth and flowering. The FT protein is a major component of the mobile florigen signal. In the model flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>FT</italic> mRNA expression is rhythmically activated by the gene <italic>CONSTANS</italic>, which is the output of the photoperiod pathway, specifically at the end of long days. In this study, we aimed to address how the level of <italic>FT</italic> expression is modulated in response to the long-day cue to set the appropriate flowering time. We show that on long days a transcription factor recruits histone deacetylase activity to remove acetyl marks from histones at the <italic>FT</italic> gene specifically at dusk, thereby dampening <italic>FT</italic> mRNA expression upon its transcriptional activation by <italic>CONSTANS</italic>. This sets the correct level of <italic>FT</italic> expression at the end of long days, and thus prevents precocious flowering in response to the long-day cue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The timing of the developmental transition from a vegetative to a reproductive phase is critical for reproductive success in flowering plants. Plants synchronize their timings of floral transition with changing seasons to flower at a suitable time. The change in day length or photoperiod is a key seasonal cue, especially at high latitudes, and is perceived in leaves, leading to the production of florigen in leaf vasculature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Wigge1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Turck1">[2]</xref>. Florigen, a systemic signal, is transmitted through phloem from leaf to the shoot apical meristem (SAM), leading to flower formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Wigge1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Kobayashi1">[3]</xref>. Many plant species respond to day length changes through photoperiod pathways. According to their photoperiodic responses, plants are classified into long-day plants, i.e., flowering occurring only when the day becomes longer than a threshold length or accelerates when the day length increases, short-day plants whose flowering induced upon the day getting shorter, and day-neutral plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Imaizumi1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), first identified in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Kobayashi2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Kardailsky1">[6]</xref>, and FT homologs in other species are the major component of the mobile florigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Corbesier1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Jaeger1">[10]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a facultative long-day plant that flowers rapidly under inductive long days, the output of the photoperiod pathway <italic>CONSTANS</italic> (<italic>CO</italic>) activates <italic>FT</italic> expression in leaf veins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Turck1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Putterill1">[11]</xref>. The circadian clock sets a high <italic>CO</italic> mRNA expression in the late afternoon in long days, which coincides with light exposure resulting in CO protein accumulation towards the day's end, because light stabilizes the CO protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Turck1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Imaizumi1">[4]</xref>. The vasculature-expressed CO protein promotes <italic>FT</italic> expression activation in the phloem companion cells specifically at the end of long days, resulting in rhythmic <italic>FT</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Turck1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Imaizumi1">[4]</xref>. During night, CO is rapidly degraded by proteasomes and <italic>FT</italic> expression is repressed. Upon its production in dusk, the FT protein moves from phloem to SAM to induce flowering. FT and its function as florigen are conserved in the flowering plants so far examined; the level of <italic>FT</italic> expression at the end of long days in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plays a primary determining role for when a plant to flower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Wigge1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Turck1">[2]</xref>. To date, beside CO, other factors (if any) that directly regulate <italic>FT</italic> expression specifically at dusk remain to be identified.</p>
<p>Histone acetylation and de-acetylation can regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) add acetyl groups to core histone tails and typically function to promote transcription of target loci, whereas histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups and are often linked with transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Berger1">[12]</xref>. Recent studies of genome-wide binding sites of mammalian HATs and HDACs reveal that both are targeted to actively transcribed genes to control their expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Wang1">[13]</xref>. In addition, rapid and synchronous recruitment of HATs and HDACs to actively transcribed loci have been observed in yeast as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Govind1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Kremer1">[15]</xref>. At these loci HATs act typically to promote transcription, whereas HDACs deacetylate acetylated histones to maintain an adequate level of acetylation and/or reset the acetylation state of a target locus following transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Wang1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Kremer1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Histone acetylation is involved in plant gene regulation. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, functional disruption of HATs such as GCN5 and AtHAC1, or HDACs including HDA6 and HDA19, leads to pleiotropic abnormalities in growth and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Servet1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Han1">[19]</xref>. For instance, loss of <italic>AtHAC1</italic> or <italic>HDA6</italic> function causes upregulation of a potent floral repressor <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>), resulting in a delay in flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Deng1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Han1">[19]</xref>. Certain HATs (e.g., GCN5) and HDACs (e.g., HDA6) are involved in genome-wide regulation of gene expression, as revealed by transcript profiling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Servet1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Yu1">[18]</xref>, whereas others may control the expression of only a subset of loci. How a HAT or HDAC is recruited to its target loci remains elusive.</p>
<p>HDACs such as the reduced potassium dependency-3 (RPD3) type are often found in multiprotein co-repressor complexes, among which the yeast Sin3-HDAC complex has been well characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Ahringer1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Grzenda1">[21]</xref>. The core components of this complex typically include the master scaffold protein Sin3, the RPD3 HDAC, and several Sin3-associated structural components including Sin3-Associated Polypeptide 18 (SAP18) and Sin3-Associated Polypeptide 30 (SAP30); homologs of these components are also found in a mammalian Sin3-HDAC like complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Ahringer1">[20]</xref>. This complex does not bind to DNA directly and is often recruited to specific loci through association with DNA-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Grzenda1">[21]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are six <italic>Sin3</italic> homologs including <italic>SNL1–SNL6</italic> (<italic>SNL</italic> for <italic>SIN3-LIKE</italic>), and four close <italic>RPD3</italic> homologs including <italic>HDA19</italic>, <italic>HDA9</italic>, <italic>HDA7</italic>, and <italic>HDA6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Pandey1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Bowen1">[23]</xref>. In addition, there is only one <italic>SAP18</italic> homolog in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>AtSAP18</italic>, that has been shown to play a role in salt stress response and floral organ formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Liu1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Song1">[25]</xref>. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome does not encode an apparent homolog of the yeast SAP30; hence, whether there are Sin3-RPD3 like co-repressor complexes for histone deacetylation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> remains to be addressed.</p>
<p>Here we report that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> there are two functional relatives of the yeast SAP30, named as SAP30 FUNCTION-RELATED 1 (AFR1) and SAP30 FUNCTION-RELATED 2 (AFR2), acting as part of HDAC complexes (AFR1-HDAC or AFR2-HDAC) to modulate the acetylation level of <italic>FT</italic> chromatin upon <italic>FT</italic> activation at the end of long days (LDs) (16-h light/8-h dark). Both AFR1 and AFR2 proteins accumulate at the end of LDs, and bind to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at dusk, but not in the middle of the day. Moreover, we found that the MADS-domain transcription factor AGAMOUS LIKE 18 (AGL18) directly interacts with AFR1 and AFR2 and recruits these proteins and presumably AFR1/AFR2-HDAC to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin specifically at the end of LDs leading to histone deacetylation upon <italic>FT</italic> activation. The output of the photoperiod pathway <italic>CO</italic> at the end of LDs not only activates <italic>FT</italic> expression, but also enables the recruitment of AFRs to the <italic>FT</italic> locus to dampen <italic>FT</italic> expression and set it at an adequate level, preventing precocious flowering in response to the day length cue in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

<title>Two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Functional Relatives of the Yeast SAP30 (ScSAP30) Associate with Histone Deacetylases to Form HDAC Complexes</title>
    <p>In an effort to explore whether a Sin3-SAP30-RPD3 co-repressor-like complex in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> exists, we first examined whether <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has any functional relatives of ScSAP30 because it lacks of an apparent homolog of the full-length ScSAP30. In the C-terminal region of ScSAP30 there is a domain important for its function: the 30-amino acid Sin3-binding region (SBR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Xie1">[26]</xref>. We used C-SAP30 to BLAST the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein database and found that there are nine proteins containing a region with a similarity to SBR, among which AT1G75060 and AT1G19330 are the top two hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s001">Figure S1A</xref>; unpublished data). We reasoned that if these two proteins are functional relatives of SAP30, they would directly associate with SNLs, AtSAP18, and/or RPD3-type HDACs. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed to check direct interactions of AT1G75060 or AT1G19330 with SNL2 (SIN3-LIKE 2), AtSAP18, HDA9, and/or HDA19. Indeed, these proteins directly interacted with AT1G75060 and AT1G19330 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g001">Figures 1A, 1C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s002">S2</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, to confirm these interactions in plant cells, we conducted bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in which non-fluorescent N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) were fused to the full-length AT1G75060, AT1G19330, AtSAP18, or HDA19 proteins. When AT1G75060-cEYFP and nEYFP-AtSAP18 were simultaneously expressed in onion epidermal cells, in the nuclei fluorescence was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), demonstrating a direct interaction of AT1G75060 with AtSAP18. Similarly, we also examined and observed direct interactions of AT1G19330 with AtSAP18, AT1G19330 with HDA19, and AT1G75060 with HDA19 in the nuclei of onion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g001">Figure 1B and 1D</xref>). These results suggest that both AT1G75060 and AT1G19330 function like ScSAP30, namely, as an integral component of Sin3-RPD3 co-repressor like complexes, although there is little similarity of amino acid sequence between these proteins and ScSAP30 outside of the C-terminal SBR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Hence, the homologous AT1G75060 and AT1G19330 proteins were named as AFR1 and AFR2, respectively. In short, our findings collectively suggest that RPD3-type HDACs and AFRs together with other structural components such as SNLs and AtSAP18 form Sin3-SAP30-SAP18-RPD3 like complexes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>AFR1</italic> Acts Additively with <italic>AFR2</italic> to Repress the Floral Transition</title>
    <p>To elucidate the biological functions of <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic>, we identified their loss-of-function mutants, and each carries a transfer DNA (<italic>T-DNA</italic>) insertion. In <italic>afr1-1</italic> and <italic>afr1-2</italic>, a <italic>T-DNA</italic> is inserted into the first intron of <italic>AFR1</italic>, resulting in a great reduction, but not elimination of <italic>AFR1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s003">S3A</xref>). In both <italic>afr2</italic> alleles, full-length <italic>AFR2</italic> transcripts were not detected, but <italic>AFR2</italic> transcripts truncated at their 3′ ends were detectable in the <italic>afr2-2</italic> mutant, which are predicted to encode a protein containing the first 149 amino acids of AFR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Grown in LDs, <italic>afr1-1</italic>, <italic>afr1-2</italic>, and <italic>afr2-1</italic> mutants flowered moderately earlier than the wild type (WT) Col, as revealed by the total number of leaves formed prior to flower formation from the primary SAM of an examined line, the developmental standard for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowering-time measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). In short days (8-h light/16-h dark), all <italic>afr1</italic> and <italic>afr2</italic> mutants flowered earlier than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), and the early-flowering phenotypes of <italic>afr1-1</italic> and <italic>afr2-1</italic> were fully rescued by complementation with tagged <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Of note, <italic>afr2-2</italic> is a weak allele compared to <italic>afr1-1</italic>, and it is likely that the truncated AFR2 may retain some function in the <italic>afr2-2</italic> mutant. We further constructed the <italic>afr1 afr2</italic> double mutant (<italic>afr1-1 afr2-1</italic>), and found it flowered earlier than either single mutant in both LDs and short days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g002">Figures 2C, 2D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s005">S5A</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> act additively to repress the floral transition in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, indicating that the homologous AFR1 and AFR2 proteins do not function in one complex. In addition to early flowering, the <italic>afr1 afr2</italic> mutant exhibited a leaf phenotype: longer petiole, narrower leaf blade, and with a slightly increased leaf initiation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g002">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s005">S5C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> may also be required for proper leaf development.</p>

<title><italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> Downregulate <italic>FT</italic> Expression Specifically at the Day's End to Delay Flowering in LDs</title>
<p>There are several genetic pathways promoting flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, including the autonomous, photoperiod, vernalization, and thermosensory pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Turck1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Ausin1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Lee1">[28]</xref>. To explore in which genetic pathway <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> act to regulate flowering, we introduced the photoperiod-pathway mutation <italic>co</italic> or a null mutant of <italic>FVE</italic>, a component of the autonomous and thermosensory pathways, into the <italic>afr1 afr2</italic> double mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Ausin1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Lee1">[28]</xref>. The late-flowering phenotype of <italic>fve</italic> was partly suppressed by <italic>afr1 afr2</italic>, whereas the <italic>afr1 afr2 co</italic> triple mutant flowered at about the same time as <italic>co</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>); thus, the <italic>co</italic> mutation is epistatic to <italic>afr1</italic> and <italic>afr2</italic>. Furthermore, we found that <italic>ft</italic>, like <italic>co</italic>, is epistatic to <italic>afr1</italic> and <italic>afr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> act through the <italic>CO-FT</italic> regulatory module of the photoperiod pathway to control flowering.</p>

<p>Next, we examined <italic>CO</italic> expression upon loss of <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> function at the end of LDs (ZT16, 16 h after light on or dawn; Zeitgeber time [ZT]), because <italic>CO</italic> is highly expressed to activate <italic>FT</italic> expression at this time point. <italic>CO</italic> expression remained unchanged in the <italic>afr1 afr2</italic> double mutant compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g003">Figure 3C</xref>); additionally, loss of <italic>CO</italic> function didn't affect <italic>AFR1</italic> or <italic>AFR2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s006">Figure S6</xref>). We further examined <italic>FT</italic> expression in <italic>afr1</italic>, <italic>afr2</italic>, and <italic>afr1 afr2</italic> seedlings at the end of LDs. <italic>FT</italic> transcript levels were increased moderately in <italic>afr1</italic> and <italic>afr2</italic> single mutants and in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), consistent with that <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> act additively to repress flowering. In addition, <italic>FT</italic> expression was slightly upregulated in <italic>afr1 afr2</italic> in short days, though its transcript levels were very low in both WT and <italic>afr1 afr2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Taken together, these results show that <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> function additively to downregulate <italic>FT</italic> expression and so delay flowering. We further measured <italic>FT</italic> transcript levels in <italic>co</italic> and <italic>afr1 afr2 co</italic> seedlings at ZT16, and found that <italic>co</italic> completely suppressed <italic>FT</italic> up-regulation in the <italic>afr1 afr2</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Hence, <italic>CO</italic> is required for <italic>FT</italic> downregulation at ZT16 by <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>FT</italic> expression is activated by <italic>CO</italic> specifically at the end of LDs, and repressed at other times of the day, resulting in rhythmic <italic>FT</italic> mRNA expression at dusk in LDs. Several histone modifiers including the histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methytransferase CLF and the PKDM7B H3 lysine-4 demethylase (also known as JMJ14 or AtJMJ4), are required for continuous <italic>FT</italic> repression along day/night cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Jiang1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Yang1">[32]</xref>. We explored whether <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> could repress <italic>FT</italic> expression in other times of LDs beside ZT16. Upon loss of <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> function, <italic>FT</italic> expression in LDs was not affected from ZT0 through ZT14, but upregulated only from ZT14 to ZT20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g003">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s008">S8A</xref>). Thus, in LDs <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> downregulate <italic>FT</italic> expression specifically in the presence of CO activity at the day's end, to delay flowering.</p>

<p>Day length is perceived in leaves, leading to <italic>FT</italic> activation specifically in the phloem companion cells of leaf veins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Wigge1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Turck1">[2]</xref>. We asked whether <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> are expressed in leaf veins to downregulate <italic>FT</italic> expression. To this end, genomic <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> fragments (including 5′ promoter plus part of the coding region of each gene), were fused to the <italic>β-GLUCURONIDASE</italic> (<italic>GUS</italic>) gene in frame and the fusions were introduced into <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by transformation. Histochemical staining revealed that both <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> were strongly expressed in leaf vasculature in addition to root tips and shoot apices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To examine in which tissues <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> downregulate <italic>FT</italic> expression, we introduced <italic>afr1-1</italic> and <italic>afr2-1</italic> into an <italic>FT-GUS</italic> reporter line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Takada1">[33]</xref>, and found that the <italic>GUS</italic> expression directed by a <italic>FT</italic> promoter was upregulated only in leaf veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> downregulate <italic>FT</italic> expression in the leaf vasculature. Next, we examined the subcellular localization of both AFR1 and AFR2 proteins by fusing them with green fluorescence protein (GFP). Upon their expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots, these fusion proteins were specifically localized in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with that AFR1 and AFR2 act as part of nuclear AFR1/AFR2-HDAC complexes in leaf veins to downregulate <italic>FT</italic> expression.</p>

<title>AFR1 and AFR2 Proteins Accumulate and Directly Interact with the <italic>FT</italic> locus at the End of LDs</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the downregulation of <italic>FT</italic> expression by <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> in the presence of CO activity at the end of LDs may be attributed to AFR-HDAC binding to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin only at this time in LDs. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the diurnal expression patterns of <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> in LDs, and found that the expression of both genes peaked at the day's end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, using the functional AFR1:HA-expressing line and the functional AFR2:FLAG-expressing line (driven by their native promoters; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s004">Figure S4</xref>), we measured the abundance of both proteins every 4 h over a 24-h LD cycle. The levels of AFR1 and AFR2 proteins changed diurnally in LDs, and both proteins accumulated at the end of the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s009">S9</xref>). This indicates that AFR1/AFR2-HDAC may accumulate at the end of LDs.</p>
<p>We further explored whether AFR1 could bind to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin, and if so, at what time of the day. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using the AFR1:HA-expressing seedlings. We found that at the end of LDs (ZT16), AFR1 bound to the proximal <italic>FT</italic> promoter region, but not in the first exon or the first intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s010">S10A</xref>). Unlike at ZT16, AFR1 was not enriched at all in the <italic>FT</italic> locus in the middle of the day (ZT8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, using ChIP with the AFR2:FLAG-expressing seedlings, we uncovered that AFR2, like AFR1, bound to the proximal <italic>FT</italic> promoter region at ZT16, but not at ZT8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s010">S10B</xref>). The bindings of AFR1 and AFR2 to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at the end of LDs coincide well with that both proteins accumulate at this time. Taken together, these results suggest that in LDs AFR1/AFR2-HDAC binds to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin specifically at the day's end to modulate <italic>FT</italic> expression in the presence of CO activity.</p>

<title>AFR1 and AFR2 Mediate Periodic Histone Deacetylation at <italic>FT</italic> at the End of LDs</title>
<p>The recruitment of AFR1 and AFR2 to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at the day's end, may cause periodic histone deacetylation in LDs. To test this, we examined steady-state levels of histone H3 acetylation of <italic>FT</italic> chromatin in WT and <italic>afr1 afr2</italic> seedlings (and rosette leaves) at ZT8 and ZT16. Loss of <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> function led to an increase of steady-state level of acetylated H3 in the proximal <italic>FT</italic> promoter region, but not in the first exon or the first intron at ZT16, whereas at ZT8 there was no noticeable change in all three regions examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s011">S11</xref>). This is consistent with the binding of AFR1 and AFR2 to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin in the proximal promoter at the end, but not the middle of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Together, these results show that AFR1 and AFR2 (presumably as part of AFR1/AFR2-HDAC) mediate histone deacetylation at the <italic>FT</italic> locus to downregulate its expression at the end of LDs. Interestingly, there is no apparent increase of the steady-state acetylation levels of <italic>FT</italic> chromatin in WT at ZT16 relative to ZT8, although <italic>FT</italic> expression is activated at ZT16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g005">Figure 5</xref>; note that the relative acetylation level of each sample was normalized to the WT at ZT8). Therefore, there must be active histone acetylation by HAT(s) on <italic>FT</italic> chromatin to “counteract” the AFR-mediated histone deacetylation at the end of LDs.</p>

Using ChIP with the AGL18:FLAG-expressing seedlings, we found that at the end of LDs AGL18:FLAG, like AFR1, was apparently enriched in the proximal <italic>FT</italic> promoter region, in addition to a slight enrichment in the first exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). In the middle of LDs, AGL18 was not associated with <italic>FT</italic> chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, AGL18 directly interacts with the <italic>FT</italic> locus specifically at the end of LDs. Next, we investigated whether AGL18 is required for AFR1 recruitment to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at the end of LDs. The line expressing the functional AFR1:HA (in <italic>afr1-1</italic> background) was crossed to <italic>agl15 agl18</italic>, and the seedlings of <italic>afr1 AFR1:HA</italic> and <italic>agl15 agl18 afr1 AFR1:HA</italic> harvested at ZT16 were subjected to ChIP assays with anti-HA. We found that loss of <italic>AGL15</italic> and <italic>AGL18</italic> function nearly eliminated AFR1 binding to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at the end of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These results, together with the direct interactions of AGL18 and AGL15 with AFR1 and AFR2, led us to infer that these two MADS-domain transcription factors recruit AFRs (presumably AFR-HDAC) to the <italic>FT</italic> locus specifically at the end of LDs to dampen <italic>FT</italic> expression in the presence of CO activity.</p>

<title>CO Activity Is Required for the AFR1 Recruitment to <italic>FT</italic> Chromatin at the End of LDs</title>
<p>As we showed earlier, <italic>CO</italic> is required for <italic>AFR1</italic>- and <italic>AFR2</italic>-mediated <italic>FT</italic> downregulation at the end of LDs. We reasoned that the CO activity at the <italic>FT</italic> locus at the end of LDs may be required for AGL18/AGL15 recruiting AFRs to <italic>FT</italic>. To test this, first we crossed the AFR1:HA-expressing line (in <italic>afr1-1</italic>) to <italic>co</italic> and created <italic>co afr1 AFR1:HA</italic>. Next, we carried out ChIP assays with the <italic>AFR1:HA</italic>-expressing seedlings harvested at ZT16, and found that <italic>CO</italic>, indeed, is required for AFR1 binding to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at ZT16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Upon its accumulation towards dusk in LDs, CO directly binds to the <italic>FT</italic> proximal promoter to promote its expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Tiwari1">[37]</xref>. This raises a possibility that CO might directly interact with AGL18 and/or AFRs to recruit these proteins to the <italic>FT</italic> proximal promoter. Using the yeast-two-hybrid approach we found that CO didn't directly interact with AGL18, AFR1, or AFR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s015">Figure S15</xref>); hence, we conclude that the CO protein is not directly involved in the recruitment of AFRs to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin. Taken together, these results suggest that the CO-mediated transcriptional activation of <italic>FT</italic> at the end of LDs enables or gates the recruitment of AFR-HDAC by AGL18/AGL15 to the <italic>FT</italic> locus, leading to the dampening of <italic>FT</italic> expression and so preventing precocious flowering in response to the day-length cue.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have revealed that the plant-unique AFR1 and AFR2 mediate periodic histone deacetylation on the rhythmically expressed florigen gene <italic>FT</italic> to dampen its expression specifically at dusk in LDs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The output of the photoperiod pathway <italic>CO</italic> at the end of LDs not only activates <italic>FT</italic> expression, but also enables the recruitment of AFR-HDAC to the <italic>FT</italic> locus to dampen <italic>FT</italic> expression and set it at an adequate level, conferring a proper flowering time in response to the day length cue. The MADS-domain transcription factor AGL18 directly interacts with the AFR1 and AFR2 proteins that accumulate at dusk, and recruits AFR1 (presumably AFR1/AFR2-HDAC) to the <italic>FT</italic> locus at the end of LDs to modulate <italic>FT</italic> expression. Our findings collectively uncover a temporal chromatin mechanism, namely periodic histone deacetylation, for the day-length regulation of flowering time in higher plants.</p>

<title>Dynamic Cycles of Histone Acetylation and Deacetylation at the <italic>FT</italic> Locus</title>
<p>The histone acetylation mark added by HATs can be rapidly removed by HDACs. Both HATs and HDACs have been found to associate with actively transcribed genes in yeast and human, and are often synchronously recruited to certain target loci, leading to dynamic cycles of acetylation and deacetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Wang1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Kremer1">[15]</xref>. HATs can bind transiently to and add acetyl groups to certain loci where HDACs transiently bind to erase the acetylation mark, resulting in constant acetylation and de-acetylation cycles at these loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Wang1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Kremer1">[15]</xref>. Our study reveals that at the <italic>FT</italic> locus, accompanying rhythmic CO-mediated <italic>FT</italic> activation at the end of LDs, AFR1 and AFR2 (presumably AFR-HDAC) are recruited to the actively transcribed <italic>FT</italic> chromatin for histone deacetylation. Given that disruption of <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> function leads to an increase of steady-state level of acetylation on <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at the end of LDs, there must be a HAT (or HATs) to add acetyl groups, suggesting that constant cycles of acetylation and de-acetylation occur at the <italic>FT</italic> locus upon its activation by <italic>CO</italic> at dusk. AFR1/AFR2-HDAC is expected to act antagonistically to a HAT to regulate <italic>FT</italic> expression. Of note, the HAT(s) has not been identified yet.</p>
<p>The dynamic histone acetylation and deacetylation cycles in the proximal <italic>FT</italic> promoter may result from transient binding of HATs and AFR1/AFR2-HDAC to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin. Consistent with the transient or unstable AFR1-HDAC binding, our ChIP analysis shows that AFR1 is moderately enriched at the <italic>FT</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g004">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g007">7</xref>). The increase of steady-state acetylation level at <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>FT</italic> upregulation upon disruption of AFR1/AFR2 function, indicate that at the end of LDs histone acetylation promotes <italic>FT</italic> transcription, whereas histone deacetylation executed by AFR-HDAC acts to downregulate <italic>FT</italic> expression. It is very likely that when <italic>FT</italic> chromatin is actively transcribed upon transcriptional activation by <italic>CO</italic> at the end of LDs, AFR-HDAC may remove acetyl groups following each cycle of HAT activities associated with <italic>FT</italic> transcription to reset the acetylation state of <italic>FT</italic> chromatin, and functions to dampen <italic>FT</italic> expression at dusk. The AFR-HDAC activities at dusk may also serve to reset <italic>FT</italic> chromatin rapidly to a silent state with a low level of acetylation at night. Consistent with this notion, we have observed that upon loss of <italic>AFR1</italic> and <italic>AFR2</italic> function, it takes several hours longer to reset <italic>FT</italic> expression to a silent state at night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g003">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001649.s008">S8A</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the steady-state acetylation levels of <italic>FT</italic> chromatin, as measured by ChIP, remain largely unchanged from the middle to the end of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g005">Figure 5</xref>), although <italic>FT</italic> expression is switched on at dusk. Not surprisingly, this may reflect the dynamic cycles of histone acetylation and deacetylation upon <italic>FT</italic> expression induction by CO. In the budding yeast, during transcriptional induction of <italic>ARG1</italic> (encoding an argininosuccinate synthase), the Gcn5 HAT and several HDACs are synchronously recruited to <italic>ARG1</italic> chromatin, and these opposing activities result in no noticeable changes of steady-state acetylation levels at the <italic>ARG1</italic> locus, as measured by ChIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Govind1">[14]</xref>. A similar situation has been observed during the transcriptional induction of several heat-responsive genes by heat shock in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Kremer1">[15]</xref>.</p>

<title>Role of CO in Gating the Recruitment of AFR1/AFR2-HDAC to <italic>FT</italic> Chromatin at the End of LDs</title>
<p>In this study we have revealed that the MADS-domain transcription factor AGL18 and presumably AGL15 act to recruit AFR1/AFR2-HDAC to the <italic>FT</italic> locus at the end of LDs. <italic>AGL18</italic> is well expressed from ZT8 to ZT16 (unpublished data), but the AGL18 protein binds to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin (in the proximal promoter) only at ZT16. This indicates that the chromatin state of the <italic>FT</italic> locus may play a role for the AGL18 binding to it; for instance, the state may determine whether a <italic>cis</italic>-element such as a CArG motif, recognized typically by a MADS domain, in <italic>FT</italic> promoter is accessible to AGL18.</p>
<p>We found that the output of the photoperiod pathway <italic>CO</italic> is required for, but not directly involved in the recruitment of AFR1 to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at dusk. The CO protein directly binds to <italic>FT</italic> proximal promoter and also associates with NY-F transcriptional factors that bind to <italic>FT</italic> distal promoter, to promote <italic>FT</italic> expression specifically at the end of LDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Tiwari1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001649-Blackman1">[40]</xref>. Given the indirect role of CO for AFR1/AFR2 recruitment, we infer that at the end of LDs the binding of CO to the <italic>FT</italic> proximal promoter and/or consequent transcriptional activation of <italic>FT</italic> expression enable AGL18 recruiting AFRs to the <italic>FT</italic> locus. It is likely that CO activity may cause a change in <italic>FT</italic> chromatin state so that the <italic>cis</italic>-element(s) such as a CArG motif or its variant in the <italic>FT</italic> promoter become accessible by AGL18. In short, in the photoperiodic flowering regulation <italic>CO</italic> plays a dual role: activating <italic>FT</italic> expression and enabling AFR-HDAC-mediated <italic>FT</italic> downregulation to set a proper level of <italic>FT</italic> expression at the end of LDs.</p>
<p>The accumulation of both AFR1 and AFR2 at the end of LDs indicates that AFR1/AFR2-HDAC may accumulate at dusk, which may enable or enhance their recruitment by AGL18 to the <italic>FT</italic> proximal promoter. CO activity not only enables AGL18-AFR-HDAC binding to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin to dampen <italic>FT</italic> expression, but may also facilitate dynamic recruitment of a HAT to the <italic>FT</italic> locus to promote its expression given the dynamic nature of histone acetylation and deacetylation on <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at dusk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001649-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The opposing activities of HAT and AFR-HDAC at the end of LDs conceivably modulate the acetylation dynamics of <italic>FT</italic> chromatin and set <italic>FT</italic> expression at an adequate level at the right time.</p>

<title>A working model for control of <italic>FT</italic> expression by the dynamic cycles of histone acetylation and deacetylation at the end of LDs.</title>
<p>The coincidence of high <italic>CO</italic> mRNA expression with light exposure at the day's end leads to the CO protein accumulation towards dusk. CO directly binds to the <italic>FT</italic> proximal promoter, and CO activity at the <italic>FT</italic> locus may change the chromatin state and enables/gates AGL18 (and presumably AGL15) binding to the <italic>FT</italic> proximal promoter. AGL18 recruits AFR1/AFR2-HDAC to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at dusk. In addition, the CO activity may also enable the recruitment of a HAT to <italic>FT</italic> chromatin. The opposing activities of HAT and AFR-HDAC on <italic>FT</italic> chromatin at the end of LDs conceivably modulate the acetylation dynamics of <italic>FT</italic> chromatin and set <italic>FT</italic> expression at an adequate level at dusk. At night, CO is rapidly degraded by proteasomes, which prevents the actions of HAT and AFR-HDAC on <italic>FT</italic> chromatin, resulting in a “silent” chromatin state. In early day, <italic>FT</italic> chromatin remains ‘silent’ due to lack of the CO protein. Day and night are indicated with white and gray shadings, respectively.</p>
