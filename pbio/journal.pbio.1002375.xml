<p>In Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, binding of Hh to the Patched-Interference Hh (Ptc-Ihog) receptor complex relieves Ptc inhibition on Smoothened (Smo). A longstanding question is how Ptc inhibits Smo and how such inhibition is relieved by Hh stimulation. In this study, we found that Hh elevates production of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P). Increased levels of PI(4)P promote, whereas decreased levels of PI(4)P inhibit, Hh signaling activity. We further found that PI(4)P directly binds Smo through an arginine motif, which then triggers Smo phosphorylation and activation. Moreover, we identified the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Gprk2) as an essential component for enriching PI(4)P and facilitating Smo activation. PI(4)P also binds mouse Smo (mSmo) and promotes its phosphorylation and ciliary accumulation. Finally, Hh treatment increases the interaction between Smo and PI(4)P but decreases the interaction between Ptc and PI(4)P, indicating that, in addition to promoting PI(4)P production, Hh regulates the pool of PI(4)P associated with Ptc and Smo.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays important roles in both embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. A critical step in Hh signal transduction is the inhibition of Smoothened (Smo), an atypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), by the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc). It is a longstanding question how Ptc inhibits Smo and how Hh promotes Smo phosphorylation and activation. It is unlikely that Ptc inhibits Smo by direct interaction. Here, we uncover that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), a specific phospholipid, directly interacts with Smo through an arginine motif in the Smo C-terminal tail and promotes Smo phosphorylation, activation, and ciliary localization. Ptc also interacts with PI(4)P, which is inhibited by Hh stimulation, indicating that Hh triggers the release of PI(4)P from Ptc. We further uncover that Hh stimulation induces the overall production of PI(4)P, likely by regulating PI(4)P kinase and phosphatase. Finally, in addition to the direct role in regulating Smo phosphorylation, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Gprk2) facilitates PI(4)P interaction with Smo. This study suggest that PI(4)P acts as a special small molecule shuttling between Ptc and Smo to modulate Hh responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays important roles in both embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref003">3</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Hh signal is transduced through a receptor system at the plasma membrane, which includes the receptor complex Patched-Interference Hh (Ptc-Ihog) and the signal transducer Smo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref006">6</xref>]. Binding of Hh to Ptc-Ihog relieves the Ptc-mediated inhibition of Smo, which allows Smo to activate the cubitus interruptus (Ci)/Gli family of zinc finger transcription factors and thereby induce the expression of Hh target genes such as <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>), <italic>ptc</italic>, and <italic>engrailed</italic> (<italic>en</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref008">8</xref>]. Over the last 30 years, many Hh pathway components have been identified, including those that control transmission, propagation, receipt, and transduction of the Hh signal. However, it is still unclear how Ptc inhibits Smo to block the activation of the Hh pathway and how Ptc inhibition of Smo is relieved by Hh stimulation. It is unlikely that Ptc inhibits Smo by direct association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref010">10</xref>], as the inhibition occurs even when Smo is present in 50-fold molar excess of Ptc, and substochiometric levels of Ptc can repress Smo activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref011">11</xref>]. These findings suggest that the inhibition process is catalytic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref010">10</xref>]. The involvement of small molecules, rather than a protein ligand, has been proposed: Ptc may inhibit the production of positive regulators or promote the synthesis of inhibitory molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Smo, an atypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is essential in both insects and mammals for transduction of the Hh signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref013">13</xref>]. The activation of Smo appears to be one of the most important events in Hh signaling. Hh induces cell surface accumulation and phosphorylation of Smo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref009">9</xref>] by multiple kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA), casein kinase 1 (CK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref016">16</xref>], casein kinase 2 (CK2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref017">17</xref>], G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Gprk2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref018">18</xref>], and atypical PKC (aPKC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref019">19</xref>]. These phosphorylation events activate Smo by inducing a conformational change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref020">20</xref>] to promote Smo interaction with the Costal2-Fused (Cos2-Fu) protein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref023">23</xref>]. It is believed that Hh-induced phosphorylation counteracts the autoinhibition imposed by arginine clusters in the Smo C-terminal tail (C-tail), which induces an open conformation that promotes the dimerization of Smo proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref020">20</xref>]. Similar to other GPCRs, Smo cell surface accumulation is controlled by endocytic trafficking mediated by ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref025">25</xref>]. In mammals, Hh signal transduction depends on the primary cilium, and Smo accumulation in the cilium is required for Smo activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref028">28</xref>]. Therefore, the cilium represents a signaling center for the Hh pathway in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref029">29</xref>]. Phosphorylation by multiple kinases promotes the ciliary localization of mammalian Smo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref030">30</xref>], but it remains unclear how Smo cell surface or ciliary accumulation and intracellular trafficking are controlled. A previous study has shown that mutation in INPP5E, a lipid 5-phosphotase, results in signaling defects in primary cilium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref031">31</xref>], indicating a role for phospholipids to regulate the function of cilium. In the preparation of this manuscript, two studies found that phospholipids regulate ciliary protein trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref033">33</xref>]; however, it is unknown whether and how phospholipids directly regulate Smo.</p>
<p>A very well characterized system for studying Hh signaling is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc. Hh proteins expressed and secreted from the posterior (P) compartment cells act on neighboring anterior (A) compartment cells located adjacent to the A/P boundary to induce the expression of Dpp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref035">35</xref>]. As a morphogen, Dpp diffuses bidirectionally into both the A and P compartments to control the growth and patterning of cells in the entire wing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref038">38</xref>]. Other genes, including <italic>en</italic> and <italic>ptc</italic>, are also induced by Hh to specify cell patterning at the A/P boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref040">40</xref>]. Expression of <italic>dpp</italic> monitors the low levels of Hh activity, and <italic>ptc</italic> expression indicates higher levels of Hh activity, whereas <italic>en</italic> induction appears to be an indicator of the highest doses of Hh signaling activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref039">39</xref>]. The transcription factor Ci is only expressed in A compartment cells that receive the Hh signal.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that Hh stimulation increases the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) in both wing discs and cultured cells. We further found that PI(4)P activates Smo by promoting Smo phosphorylation. Mechanistically, we identified an arginine motif in the Smo C-tail that is responsible for the interaction of Smo with PI(4)P. Arginine to alanine mutation abolishes, whereas arginine to glutamic acid mutation elevates, Smo activity. We also found that, in addition to the kinase activity of Gprk2, its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain increases PI(4)P in wing discs and is required for Gprk2 to fully function in Hh signaling. The findings that Ptc interacts with PI(4)P and that Ptc inactivation increases the levels of PI(4)P indicate that PI(4)P acts downstream of Ptc to activate Smo in the Hh signaling cascade. Finally, we show that PI(4)P promotes phosphorylation and ciliary accumulation of mouse Smo (mSmo) in mammalian cells, and that PI(4)P prevents the ciliary accumulation of mouse Ptc1 and Ptc2. Taken together, our findings suggest that PI(4)P acts as a special small molecule shuttling between Ptc and Smo to modulate Hh responses.</p>

<title>Hh Promotes the Production of PI(4)P</title>
<p>In an effort to identify novel regulators in Hh signaling, we collected RNAi lines from the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center (VDRC) when the library was available and screened for kinases, phosphatases, and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases using the wing-specific <italic>MS1096</italic>-Gal4. We tested selected RNAi lines for the ability to modify the phenotype of Smo<sup>PKA12</sup>, a weak dominant negative form of Smo that results in a reproducible wing phenotype with partial fusion between Vein 3 and Vein 4 when combined with the <italic>C765</italic>-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s002">S1D Fig</xref>), which represents a very sensitive genetic background for screening Smo regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref041">41</xref>]. One of the “hits” was Stt4 kinase, the yeast homolog of PI4KIIIalpha required for the generation of PI(4)P. We found that, although knockdown of Stt4 alone did not produce any change in the wild-type wing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s002">S1B Fig</xref>), Stt4 RNAi combined with Smo<sup>PKA12</sup> expression enhanced the fusion of Vein 3 and Vein 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s002">S1E Fig</xref>). In contrast, inactivation of Sac1 phosphatase, which dephosphorylates PI(4)P to phosphatidylinositol (PI), attenuated the fusion phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s002">S1F Fig</xref>). These results suggest that Stt4 and Sac1 regulate the activity of Smo in the wing. Consistently, Sac1 RNAi partially rescued the abdominal cuticle loss caused by Hh RNAi, although Sac1 RNAi alone did not show any cuticle phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s002">S1G–S1J Fig</xref>). A recent study established a genetic link between Smo and Stt4-Sac1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref042">42</xref>]; however, the molecular mechanisms are unclear.</p>
<p>Smo accumulates in P compartment cells as well as A compartment cells near the A/P boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref015">15</xref>]. We found that the level of PI(4)P is elevated in the A compartment cells that abut the A/P border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting that Hh induces the accumulation of both Smo and PI(4)P in these cells. Consistently, the accumulation of Smo in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo correlated with the accumulation of PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s003">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>). We further found that PI(4)P levels were increased by the expression of Ci<sup>-3P</sup> and Smo<sup>SD123</sup>, the constitutively active forms of Ci and Smo, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s003">S2D and S2E Fig</xref>). To accurately measure and quantify the absolute concentration of PIP in cells, we established a mass spectrometry-based multiple reaction monitor (MRM) assay and examined whether Hh indeed induces the production of PIP. Based on a detailed method published recently for quantifying PIP<sub>2</sub> (PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), and PIP<sub>3</sub> (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref043">43</xref>], we optimized the conditions to examine PIP lipids. Trimethylsilyl diazomethane was used to protect the phosphate groups, which allowed for more efficient ionization of the methylated PIP species and a marked improvement in the sensitivity of the assay. We found that treatment of S2 cells with 60% Hh-conditioned medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref044">44</xref>] induced the formation of PIP in a timely manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, left panel). Consistent with this, treatment of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts with mouse sonic Hh N-terminus (ShhNp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref030">30</xref>] stimulated the production of PIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, right panel).

<p>To further characterize the regulation of PI(4)P by Hh, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and found that Hh stimulated the production of PI(4)P in S2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, left panel). In addition, knockdown of Stt4 downregulated, whereas knockdown of Sac1 upregulated, the production of PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, left panel), suggesting that the Hh-regulated formation of PI(4)P was mediated by Stt4 and Sac1. We further found that overexpression of Ptc prevented the production of PI(4)P, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of Ptc elevated production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, right panel), suggesting that Ptc regulates the levels of PI(4)P.

<title>PI(4)P Stimulates the Phosphorylation and Accumulation of Smo</title>
<p>The PH domain is a known phosphoinositide-binding module that is important for signal transduction by sensing alterations in the membrane lipid composition. To visualize PI(4)P pools in wing discs, we used an RFP-PH<sup>OSBP</sup> reporter that contains two copies of the PH domain from the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP), which is known to specifically bind PI(4)P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref045">45</xref>]. In wing discs, expression of RFP-PH<sup>OSBP</sup> accumulated PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), compared to the expression of RFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In cultured S2 cells, treatment with PI(4)P enhanced Smo activity, indicated by an elevated <italic>ptc</italic>-luc reporter activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s004">S3B Fig</xref>), thus prompting the question of whether PI(4)P regulates Smo phosphorylation, since phosphorylation promotes Smo activation. Indeed, we found that PI(4)P, but not other phospholipid forms, increased the levels of basal and Hh-induced Smo phosphorylation detected by a phospho-specific antibody (SmoP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref044">44</xref>] recognizing phosphorylation within the second PKA/CK1 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). In addition, PI(4)P treatment induced Smo phosphorylation to a lesser extent compared to Hh treatment, and the combination of Hh and PI(4)P induced hyperphosphorylation of Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Consistently, treatment with PI(4)P induced mSmo phosphorylation in cultured NIH3T3 cells, which was detected by a phospho-specific antibody (PS1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref030">30</xref>] recognizing mSmo phosphorylation at the first CK1/GRK cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). In an in vitro kinase assay using glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-Smo fusion protein containing Smo amino acids 656–755, we found that Smo phosphorylation by PKA and CK1 kinases was enhanced by the addition of PI(4)P, but not PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or PIP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2G</xref>), suggesting that PI(4)P directly regulates the phosphorylation of Smo. In support of this notion, we found that Smo interacted with the PH domain from OSBP, and that this interaction was enhanced by the treatment with either PI(4)P or Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2H and 2I</xref>).</p>

<title>PI(4)P Regulates Smo Phosphorylation through Direct Interaction with an Arginine Motif</title>
<p>It is possible that PI(4)P directly interacts with Smo and facilitates Smo interaction with the PH domain of OSBP.

<p>To identify the residues in the Smo C-tail interacting with PI(4)P, we used an in vivo approach to examine whether the activity of Smo is regulated by the PH domain expression. Membrane-tethered Smo C-terminal truncations by the myristoylation signal (Myr-SmoCT) possess the activity to induce ectopic <italic>dpp</italic>-lacZ expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref021">21</xref>]. We found that the membrane-tethered PH domain of OSBP (Myr-PH<sup>OSBP</sup>) increased the ectopic <italic>dpp</italic>-lacZ expression induced by Myr-Smo<sup>730-1035</sup> but did not change <italic>dpp</italic>-lacZ expression induced by Myr-Smo<sup>764-1035</sup> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3E to 3D and 3G to 3F</xref>), although Myr-PH<sup>OSBP</sup> itself had no effect on <italic>dpp</italic>-lacZ expression in the wing. This suggests that PH<sup>OSBP</sup> likely regulates Smo activity through aa 730–764. This domain of Smo contains one of the four positively charged arginine clusters, which are known to negatively regulate Smo activity by counteracting phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref020">20</xref>]. Surprisingly, using GST-Smo<sup>656-755</sup> in the solid-phase lipid-binding assay, we found that Smo<sup>WT</sup> strongly interacted with PI(4)P; however, an Arg to Ala mutation (GST-Smo<sup>RA4</sup>) abolished this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3H</xref>), suggesting PI(4)P interacts with only the fourth arginine cluster. In support of this finding, mutation in the fourth arginine cluster (R4) was sufficient to block PI(4)P binding in a PI(4)P beads pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). To further characterize R4, we generated the Arg to Ala mutation in Smo full-length (Myc-Smo<sup>RA4</sup>) and found that Myc-Smo<sup>RA4</sup> lost both the ability to bind PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3J</xref>) and the interaction with Cos2-Fu complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3K</xref>). In addition, phosphorylation of Smo<sup>RA4</sup> was no longer regulated by Hh and PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3K</xref>). Smo<sup>RA4</sup> also had no responsiveness to PI(4)P stimulation in the <italic>ptc</italic>-luc assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4E Fig</xref>). Using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay to test C-terminal CFP/YFP dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref044">44</xref>], we found that Smo<sup>RA4</sup> had a much lower FRET signal and was much less responsive to both Hh and PI(4)P stimulation compared to Smo<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4F Fig</xref>). RA4 mutation did not cause protein misfolding because there was no difference between Smo<sup>RA4</sup> and Smo<sup>WT</sup> regarding the expression and subcellular distribution in S2 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that Smo<sup>RA4</sup> is inactive. Indeed, driven by the <italic>tubulinα</italic> promoter that expresses Smo at a level close to endogenous gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref017">17</xref>], the expression of Smo<sup>RA4</sup> did not rescue <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>en</italic> expression in <italic>smo</italic> mutant cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">3L, 3M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4G</xref>). Furthermore, we found that overexpression of Smo<sup>RA4</sup> by <italic>MS1096</italic>-Gal4 did not induce ectopic expression of <italic>dpp</italic>-lacZ, as noted with Smo<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3N and 3O</xref>), and that an R&gt;A mutation in the constitutively active form of Smo (Smo<sup>SD123RA4</sup>) had lower <italic>ptc</italic>-luc activity compared to Smo<sup>SD123</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4E Fig</xref>) and was unable to induce <italic>en</italic> expression in ventral A compartment cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3R</xref>, compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3Q</xref>). These data suggest that Smo activity is compromised by R&gt;A mutation in the fourth arginine motif. In contrast, we found that R&gt;E mutation (Smo<sup>RE4</sup>), which mimics negative charges caused by PI(4)P binding, elevated Smo activity to induce higher levels of <italic>dpp</italic>-lacZ expression in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3P</xref>) and higher levels of <italic>ptc</italic>-luc activity, but had no responsiveness to PI(4)P stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4E Fig</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that the fourth arginine motif is required for Smo activation.</p>
<p>The binding position of PI(4)P in Smo is very critical, because fusion of the PH domain from OSBP to either the third intracellular loop (SmoL3PH) or the C-tail (SmoPH) retained PI(4)P with Smo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4A Fig</xref>) but compromised Smo activity in the wing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>, compared to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4B Fig</xref>) and resulted in loss of responsiveness to PI(4)P stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4E Fig</xref>). In comparison, fusion of CFP and YPF to the third intracellular loop and C-tail, respectively, did not change the activity of Smo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref020">20</xref>]. Our findings suggest that PI(4)P binds Smo in a position-dependent manner.</p>

<title>The PH Domain of Gprk2 Mediates Smo Regulation by PI(4)P</title>
<p>Considering that the PH domain of OSBP interacts with and activates Smo, we wondered whether a PI(4)P transport protein (PITP) facilitates the interaction between PI(4)P and Smo, since Smo itself does not contain a PH domain. We used RNAi lines from the VDRC to screen a total of 15 typical PH domain-containing PITPs in the fly genome for their ability to modulate Hh phenotypes; inactivation of these proteins by RNAi did not affect Smo accumulation in wing discs, although RNAi of some candidate PITPs modified the wing phenotype of <italic>C765</italic>-Smo<sup>PKA12</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s010">S1 Table</xref>). Interestingly, all Gprks contain a PH domain in their C-terminus, and this domain contributes to agonist-dependent translocation by facilitating interaction with lipids and other membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref048">48</xref>]. We next investigated whether the C-terminus PH domain of Gprk2 was important for its role in Hh signal transduction. Wild-type Gprk2 fully rescued <italic>en</italic> expression in <italic>gprk2</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, deletion of the PH domain in the Gprk2 C-tail (Grpk2<sup>ΔC</sup>) abolished its ability to rescue <italic>en</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), whereas replacing the PH domain in Gprk2 with the PH domain from OSBP (Gprk2-PH<sup>OSBP</sup>) restored this ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This is consistent with our previous finding that Gprk2KM, a kinase-dead form of Gprk2, has a kinase activity-independent role in regulating Smo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref018">18</xref>]. These findings suggest that the PH domain is required for Gprk2 to fully function in transducing the Hh signal. In support of these results, Gprk2, Gprk2<sup>ΔC</sup>, and Gprk2-PH<sup>OSBP</sup>, but not Gprk2KM, were able to phosphorylate mSmo in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), indicating that the removal or replacement of the PH domain does not affect the kinase activity. Thus, the function of the Gprk2 PH domain likely accounts for the kinase-independent role of Gprk2 in Smo regulation.</p>

<p>Because both Gprk2 transcription and Gprk2 protein expression are upregulated by Hh signaling, and Gprk2 is enriched at the A/P boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref049">49</xref>], we hypothesize that, in addition to promoting the production of PI(4)P, Hh may regulate PI(4)P accumulation by enhancing the expression of Gprk2 as the endogenous carrier for PI(4)P. To examine the ability of Gprk2 to enrich PI(4)P in vivo, we knocked down Gprk2 in the wing disc and found that the levels of PI(4)P were decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s006">S5A Fig</xref>). We also overexpressed Gprk2 or Gprk2<sup>ΔC</sup> and found that the expression of Gprk2 elevated the levels of both Smo and PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>), whereas the expression of Gprk2<sup>ΔC</sup> had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). Similar to RFP-PH<sup>OSBP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>), overexpression of PH<sup>Gprk2</sup> resulted in increased PI(4)P and Smo accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s006">S5B and S5C Fig</xref>). In addition, Gprk2 and PI(4)P were largely localized at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g004">Fig 4F and 4F′</xref>), whereas Gprk2<sup>ΔC</sup> was cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). These results suggest that the PH domain of Gprk2 is required for the enrichment of PI(4)P in vivo by localizing Gprk2 at the cell surface.</p>
<p>To further characterize the kinase activity-independent role of Gprk2 in regulating Smo, we examined Gprk2-regulated Smo phosphorylation in cultured S2 cells. We found that RNAi targeting the coding region of Gprk2, but not OSBP, attenuated PI(4)P-induced Smo phosphorylation detected by the anti-SmoP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). RNAi targeting the 3′-UTR region of Gprk2 consistently inhibited Smo phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, lane 4, top panel). We found that the expression of HA-Gprk2 or HA-Gprk2-PH<sup>OSBP</sup> rescued Smo phosphorylation inhibited by RNAi of Gprk2 3′-UTR but the expression of HA-Gprk2<sup>ΔC</sup> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), suggesting that the PH domain is responsible for Gprk2 to promote Smo phosphorylation increased by PI(4)P. We also found that deletion of the PH domain decreased the Gprk2-PI(4)P interaction in the PI(4)P beads pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Moreover, the PH domain of Gprk2 (PH<sup>Gprk2</sup>) interacted directly with PI(4)P; mutation of arginine (PH<sup>Gprk2RA</sup>) or phenylalanine (PH<sup>Gprk2FA</sup>) abolished this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Finally, similar to the PH<sup>OSBP</sup> interaction with Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2H and 2I</xref>), the PH<sup>Gprk2</sup> interaction with Myc-Smo<sup>WT</sup> was increased by Hh and PI(4)P treatments in cultured S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>). Taken together with the observation that deletion of the PH domain does not alter the kinase activity of Gprk2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and in cultured NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), our findings suggest that the Gprk2 PH domain plays a positive role in mediating Smo regulation by PI(4)P.</p>

<title>Hh Treatment Increases Smo-PI(4)P Interaction and Decreases Ptc-PI(4)P Interaction</title>
<p>The finding that expression of the PH domain from OSBP accumulated PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) prompted the notion that an endogenous protein may attract PI(4)P away from Smo in the absence of Hh. Ptc contains a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) and has structural similarity to the resistance, nodulation, division (RND) family of bacterial proton gradient-driven transmembrane molecular transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref050">50</xref>]. SSD was first identified in proteins implicated in cholesterol metabolism but is now more broadly associated with vesicle trafficking. The Ptc SSD is essential for suppression of Smo activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref051">51</xref>], and mutations of SSD abrogate the Ptc-mediated repression of Smo, although these mutations do not compromise either binding or internalization of Hh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref052">52</xref>]. It is possibe that the Ptc SSD controls the influx or the efflux of PI(4)P or attracts PI(4)P away from Smo. To test this hypothesis, we generated three vectors: HA-tagged wild-type full-length Ptc (HA-Ptc<sup>WT</sup>), HA-tagged Ptc lacking its SSD domain (HA-Ptc<sup>ΔSSD</sup>), and HA-tagged SSD domain (HA-SSD). We transfected S2 cells with these constructs and evaluated the ability of each to interact with PI(4)P. When expressed in S2 cells, all proteins were expressed at low levels, detected only after immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, top panel). We found that HA-Ptc<sup>WT</sup> and HA-SSD strongly bound PI(4)P, whereas HA-Ptc<sup>ΔSSD</sup> did not bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, lower panel).</p>

<title>Ptc SSD domain interacts with PI(4)P.</title>
<p>(A) S2 cells were transfected with the indicated HA-tagged Ptc constructs and then split in half. One half was used to detect Ptc protein by immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody and western blot analysis using the anti-HA antibody. The second half was used to detect PI(4)P bound Ptc by lipid beads protein pull-down assay using PI(4)P beads and western blot using anti-HA antibody. The SSD domain is responsible for Ptc binding to PI(4)P. (B) Ptc binding in a protein:lipid overlay assay. Lipids dotted strips were incubated with bacterially expressed His-tagged SSD (His-SSD), and bound-SSD was detected with an anti-His antibody. (C) A wing disc bearing <italic>ptc-/-</italic> mutant clones was immunostained for PI(4)P and GFP. Arrows indicate the mutant clone marked by the lack of GFP expression. (D–E) Wing discs expressing either PtcRNAi<sup>#28795</sup> or HA-Ptc<sup>WT</sup> were stained for PI(4)P and Ci. Arrows indicate the accumulation of PI(4)P by RNAi and overexpression of Ptc.

Purified proteins were then incubated with PI(4)P beads followed by western blot with the anti-Myc antibody to examine the bound Myc-tagged proteins. Hh treatment increases the level of PI(4)P-bound Smo and decreases the level of PI(4)P-bound Ptc. Similarly, Hh treatment promotes Smo–PI(4)P interaction and inhibits Ptc–PI(4)P interaction in an independent assay using PI(4)P liposomes. (G) In vitro kinase assay (left) and in vitro phosphatase assay (right) were carried out to examine Stt4 and Sac1 enzymatic activity regulated by Hh. Stt4 and Sac1 were purified from S2 cells transfected with Flag-Stt4 or HA-Sac1 with the treatment of either Hh-conditioned medium or control medium. The substrates were chromatographed on oxalate-pretreated silica gel plate and visualized by autoradiography (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s009">S1 Methods</xref> for details). The activity of Stt4 was enhanced by Hh treatment, indicated by the stronger signal (left panel, lane 3, compared to lane 2).

<p>To further determine whether the SSD domain from Ptc directly interacts with PI(4)P, we used the solid phase lipid-binding assay similar to that used for detecting Smo binding. We found that the SSD fragment protein purified from bacteria strongly associated with PI(4)P, but not with PIP<sub>2</sub> or PIP<sub>3</sub> phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between SSD and PI(4)P in the lipid beads protein pull-down assay is direct. The SSD association with PI(3)P or PI(5)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) suggests that the expression of a single SSD domain may lose specificity for interaction, or, alternatively, that such interaction may also promote Ptc regulation of PI(3)P and PI(5)P. We also found a very strong interaction between SSD and phosphatidic acid (PA) or phosphatidylserine (PS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6B</xref>); these may be nonspecific, as PA and PS binding to short protein fragments has often been considered questionable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref053">53</xref>]. Our findings in cultured cells led us to examine the correlation of Ptc and PI(4)P in the wing. We found that mutation of <italic>ptc</italic> or knockdown of Ptc by RNAi increased PI(4)P levels in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>), similar to the observation that Ptc inactivation elevates PI(4)P in the salivary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref042">42</xref>]. These indicate that the activation of Hh signaling by the inactivation of Ptc elevated the production of PI(4)P. Moreover, we found that the overexpression of Ptc<sup>WT</sup> also increased the level of PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), which is likely due to the ability of Ptc to accumulate PI(4)P. In support of these findings, Ptc<sup>ΔSSD</sup> overexpression had no effect on regulating the accumulation of Smo, Ci, and PI(4)P in wing discs.</p>
<p>In addition to promoting the production of PI(4)P, Hh may also regulate the pools of PI(4)P between Smo and Ptc. To test this hypothesis, we purified Smo and Ptc proteins from S2 cells treated with Hh-conditioned medium or control medium and accessed the protein interaction with PI(4)P. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, the level of PI(4)P-bound Smo was increased by the treatment of Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, left panel). In contrast, the level of PI(4)P-bound Ptc was decreased by Hh treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, right panel). These data indicate that Hh treatment releases PI(4)P from Ptc, suggesting an additional layer of regulation beyond Hh promoting PI(4)P production.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to understand how Hh regulates PI(4)P. However, we found that Hh treatment did not significantly change the mRNA levels of Stt4 and Sac1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s007">S6A Fig</xref>). In addition, Hh did not change the protein levels of the overexpressed Stt4 and Sac1 in P compartment cells of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s007">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>). Hh also did not regulate the accessibility of the Stt4/Sac1 to Smo or Ptc in an immunoprecipitation assay with S2 cells. To examine whether Hh regulates the activity of Stt4 or Sac1, or both, we carried out in vitro kinase/phosphatase assays using purified Stt4 and Sac1 combined with PI substrate. We found that the phosphorylation of PI was enhanced when using Stt4 from cells treated with Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6G</xref>, lane 3, compared to lane 2, left panel). In addition, Sac1 from cells treated with Hh had less activity to dephosphorylate the constitutive PI phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6G</xref>, lane 3, compared to lane 2, right panel). These data suggest that Hh elevates the activity of Stt4 and inhibits the activity of Sac1.</p>

<title>PI(4)P Promotes mSmo Activation and Localization in the Cilium</title>
<p>Next, we wondered whether PI(4)P plays a role in regulating mSmo, because PI(4)P induces mSmo phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2F</xref>).

<p>Similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo, mSmo contains arginine clusters in its C-tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref020">20</xref>]. We next examined whether the arginine motif(s) were responsible for regulation of mSmo by PI(4)P. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, PI(4)P treatment increased <italic>Gli</italic>-luc reporter activity, although to a lesser extent compared to Shh treatment in the control group of NIH3T3 cells. PI(4)P and Shh treatment consistently increased <italic>Gli</italic>-luc activity when cells were transfected with mSmo<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). However, R&gt;A mutations in R3 and R4 arginine clusters (mSmo<sup>RA3</sup> and mSmo<sup>RA4</sup>, respectively) attenuated the increased activity noted with PI(4)P, and mutations in both R3 and R4 (mSmo<sup>RA34</sup>) completely blocked the effect of PI(4)P on mSmo activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). These data suggest that R3 and R4 are responsible for the regulation of mSmo by PI(4)P.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation promotes ciliary accumulation of mSmo, which correlates with pathway activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref030">30</xref>], but the molecular mechanisms that control Smo ciliary accumulation are poorly understood. mSmo<sup>WT</sup> was found in about 5% of cilia, and Shh treatment increased Smo<sup>WT</sup> accumulation in 75% of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref030">30</xref>]. Treatment with PI(4)P induced mSmo<sup>WT</sup> accumulation in 47% of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>), which was correlated with changes in mSmo<sup>WT</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">Fig 2F</xref>) and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) induced by PI(4)P. In contrast, mSmo<sup>RA34</sup> had no response to PI(4)P treatment (4% of ciliary accumulation by PI(4)P treatment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>), although it had a low response to Shh stimulation (from 3% to 21% of ciliary localization). Consistent with these findings, mSmo<sup>RA34</sup> had much lower activity and much less responsiveness to Shh stimulation in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref020">20</xref>]. Our findings suggest that R3 and R4 clusters are responsible for PI(4)P-associated binding and activation of mSmo.</p>
<p>To determine whether Hh regulates the production of PI(4)P in vertebrate systems, using the ELISA assay combined with the anti-PI(4)P antibody, we examined the levels of PI(4)P in <italic>ptc1</italic> mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and found that, compared to control MEFs, <italic>ptc1</italic> MEFs had significantly increased PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). Consistently, Shh treatment increased, whereas Smo inhibitor decreased, the levels of PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s008">S7A Fig</xref>), indicating that Hh signaling activity promotes PI(4)P production in cultured cells. We further investigated the ciliary localization of Ptc1 and Ptc2 and found that the ciliary localization of both Ptc1 and Ptc2 was decreased by Shh treatment or PI(4)P treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7G</xref>), which was consistent with the previous study that Hh inhibits the ciliary localization of Ptc1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref054">54</xref>]. Similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ptc interaction with PI(4)P, we found that both Ptc1 and Ptc2 interacted with PI(4)P in the lipid beads protein pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">Fig 7H</xref>).

<title>PI(4)P regulates the phosphorylation and ciliary accumulation of Smo.</title>
<p>Models are based on this study and studies from recent publications. In the absence of Hh, Stt4 has low activity, whereas Sac1 has high activity, resulting in low levels of PI(4)P that interact with Ptc. In the vertebrate cilium, Ptc1/2 and Grp161 localize in the cilium to inhibit Hh signaling. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> accumulates in the cilium, but not PI(4)P. Upon Hh stimulation, PI(4)P production is increased and PI(4)P is also released from Ptc, allowing PI(4)P to bind and activate Smo by promoting Smo phosphorylation and dimerization. In the vertebrate cilium, PI(4)P levels are elevated by Hh, which promotes Smo phosphorylation and ciliary accumulation. PI(4)P elevated by Hh inhibits the ciliary localization of Ptc1/2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hh signal transduction has been widely studied; however, the longstanding questions of how Ptc inhibits Smo activity and how Hh promotes Smo phosphorylation and activation remain. These issues constitute a primary focus of this study. A genetic analysis indicates that inactivation of Stt4 downregulates Smo accumulation, whereas knockdown of Sac1 by RNAi elevates Smo levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref042">42</xref>], suggesting the involvement of phospholipids in Hh signal transduction. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which phospholipids regulate Hh signaling remain unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a direct role for PI(4)P in binding Smo and promoting Smo phosphorylation and activation. The mechanism by which PI(4)P interacts with arginine motifs in Smo is likely conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo and mouse Smo, as such motifs have been mapped in both species.</p>

<title>Kinase Activity-Independent Role of Gprk2 in Hh Signaling</title>
<p>To explore the possible involvement of a PITP protein to facilitate the interaction between Smo and PI(4)P, we unexpectedly found that the PH domain of Gprk2 is responsible for the accumulation of PI(4)P that activates Smo. It has been shown that Gprk2 is positively involved in Hh signaling by directly phosphorylating Smo C-tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref018">18</xref>]. In addition, Gprk2 forms a dimer/oligomer and binds Smo C-tail in a kinase activity-independent manner to promote Smo dimerization and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref018">18</xref>]. However, how Gprk2 promotes Smo dimerization and activation is unclear. In this study, we found that the function for Grpk2 PH domain to activate Smo is independent of its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>) and that the PH domain of Gprk2 is responsible for enriching PI(4)P that promotes Smo phosphorylation and dimerization. There are instances in which the binding of lipids to the PH domain promotes dimerization of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref056">56</xref>], raising the possibility that PI(4)P interaction with the PH domain of Gprk2 promotes its dimerization. Taken together, our findings suggest that the function of PH domain in Gprk2 accounts, at least in part, for the kinase activity-independent role of Gprk2 in Hh signaling, a deeper mechanism for Smo activation by Gprk2.</p>

<title>The Release of PI(4)P from Ptc in Response to Hh Stimulation</title>
<p>In the absence of Hh, Ptc inhibits Smo activity by promoting Smo endocytosis and turnover in intracellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref009">9</xref>]. Ptc likely inhibits Smo catalytically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref010">10</xref>], because substochiometric levels of Ptc are able to repress Smo activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref011">11</xref>]. Here, we found that Hh promotes the activity of Stt4 and inhibits the activity of Sac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6G</xref>), which, at least in part, explains the catalytic regulation.</p>
<p>A previous study proposed a model in which Ptc represses Smo by regulating lipid trafficking; Ptc recruits lipoproteins to endosomes, changing their lipid composition, in order to regulate Smo degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref057">57</xref>], but the class of lipids remains unidentified. In the presence of Hh, Smo is phosphorylated and accumulates at the cell surface, resulting in protein activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref008">8</xref>]. However, it is unknown how Ptc inhibition on Smo is relieved by Hh stimulation. The ability of the Ptc SSD domain to interact with PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>) raises the possibility that Ptc may control the pool of phospholipids regulating the accessibility of Smo to PI(4)P. Our finding that Hh treatment decreased the interaction between Ptc and PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6F</xref>) suggests the possibility that binding of Hh to Ptc results in a conformational change in Ptc and releases phospholipids. Thus, this study uncovers an additional layer of regulation by indicating the release of PI(4)P from Ptc, which may account for the optimal regulation of Smo.</p>

<title>The Location of Smo Motif Responsible for Binding PI(4)P Is Critical for Changing Smo Conformation</title>
<p>The structure of the Smo N-terminal, including the extracellular cysteine rich domain (CRD), has been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref059">59</xref>]. Unlike other GPCRs, no ligand-binding function has been identified. It has been shown that Smo-mediated signal transduction is sensitive to sterols and oxysterol derivatives of cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref062">62</xref>]. However, unlike vertebrate Smo, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo CRD does not interact with oxysterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref063">63</xref>]. In this study, we found that phospholipids activate both vertebrate and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo through binding to the arginine motif in the Smo C-terminus, although the C-tails have sequence divergence among species. Using the protein:lipid overlay assay, we found that PI(4)P directly binds Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and that mutation in the R4 arginine motif abolishes this direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">Fig 3H–3J</xref>). Importantly, R&gt;A mutation abolished the activity of Smo (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g003">3L, 3M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4G</xref>). It is likely that binding of PI(4)P to the arginine motif changes Smo conformation, thus allowing kinases to phosphorylate and activate Smo. In support of this notion, PI(4)P binding to specific arginine residues in specific locations is critical for Smo conformational change, because fusion of the PH domain to either the third intracellular loop or the C-terminus attracts PI(4)P to different locations in Smo, thus blocking Smo activation by PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on the regulation of Smo by PI(4)P and found that Hh regulates the accessibility of Smo to PI(4)P, evidenced by the Hh-promoted interaction between Smo and PH domain from either OSBP or Gprk2 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g002">2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g005">5E</xref>) and by the Hh-enhanced interaction between Smo and PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Binding of PI(4)P likely changes the conformation of Smo, leading to Smo phosphorylation by kinases. It should be noted that phosphomimetic Smo mutations (Smo<sup>SD123</sup> and mSmo<sup>SD</sup>) are still regulated by PI(4)P (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g007">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s005">S4E</xref>), suggesting that PI(4)P either promotes phosphorylation at other residues or has additional role(s) in activating Smo.</p>

<title>Mechanisms for Hh to Promote PI(4)P Production</title>
<p>Hh signaling activity promoted the production of PI(4)P that was detected by the mass-spec assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002375.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), which was a very sensitive approach. However, in a previous study, the overexpression of full-length wild-type Ci did not elevate the accumulation of PI(4)P in wing discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref042">42</xref>]. It is possible that low levels of Hh signaling activity induced by the expression of wild-type Ci are unable to induce detectable changes in PI(4)P accumulation in wing discs. The disc immunostaining with the anti-PI(4)P antibody might not be as sensitive as the mass-spec method. In support, by expressing Smo<sup>SD123</sup> or the constitutively active Ci<sup>-3P</sup>, in which three PKA sites in the phosphorylation clusters were mutated to block Ci processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002375.ref064">64</xref>], we found that PI(4)P was accumulated in wing discs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002375.s003">S2A Fig</xref>), likely due to the high levels of Hh signaling activity induced by the active forms of Smo and Ci.</p>

<title>PH domain fusion at the C-tail or the third intracellular loop compromised Smo activity.</title>
<p>(A) Illustrations of SmoPH and SmoL3PH are shown in the left panel. S2 cells were transfected with Myc-SmoPH or Myc-SmoL3PH and immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody to enrich Smo protein. Purified Smo proteins were incubated with PI(4)P beads to examine the interaction between PI(4)P and Myc-Smo (shown in the right panel). The high mobility shift of SmoL3PH, compared to SmoPH, was due to the additional PH domain inserted. (B–B”) A wing disc from flies expressing Myc-Smo<sup>WT</sup> was immunostained for Ci and Myc.
