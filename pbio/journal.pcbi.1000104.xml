Disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with sleep and neuro-behavioral impairments as well as cancer. To date, light is widely accepted to be the most powerful circadian synchronizer, motivating its use as a key control input for phase resetting. Through sensitivity analysis, we identify additional control targets whose individual and simultaneous manipulation (via a model predictive control algorithm) out-perform the open-loop light-based phase recovery dynamics by nearly 3-fold. We further demonstrate the robustness of phase resetting by synchronizing short- and long-period mutant phenotypes to the 24-hour environment; the control algorithm is robust in the presence of model mismatch. These studies prove the efficacy and immediate application of model predictive control in experimental studies and medicine. In particular, maintaining proper circadian regulation may significantly decrease the chance of acquiring chronic illness.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The robust timing, or phase, of the circadian clock is critical in directing and synchronizing molecular, cellular, and organismal behaviors. The clock's failure to maintain precision and adaption is associated with sleeping disorders, depression, and cancer. To better study and control the timing of circadian rhythms, we make use of systems theoretic tools such as sensitivity analysis and model predictive control (MPC). Sensitivity analysis is used to identify key driving mechanisms without having to fully understand or investigate the detailed mechanistic interconnections of the large complex circadian network. Contrary to intuition, sensitivity analysis of the circadian model highlights several <italic>non</italic>-photic control inputs (such as transcriptional regulation) that outperform light-based circadian phase resetting – light is known to accelerate protein degradation. Aside from targeting individual parameters as control inputs, our methods identify combinations of control targets that may further the efficiency of entrainment. We compare the phase resetting performance of our MPC algorithm among cases involving individual and multiple simultaneous control targets (in wild-type simulations). We then tailor the algorithm to correct continuously the phase mismatch that occurs in short and long period mutant phenotypes.

In our research, we couple systems theoretic tools (such as sensitivity analysis) with model predictive control, to better address phase resetting properties of nonlinear biological oscillators. Our work aims to alleviate circadian-related disorders (such as jet lag and advanced/delayed sleep phase syndromes) by investigating the phase resetting properties of an example circadian mathematical model. More specifically, we manipulate multiple control inputs (or target parameters) to drive the dynamic behavior of the system.</p><p>Many researchers have shown that the systematic application of light pulses may reset the phase of circadian clocks. This light pulse (input) to induced phase-shift (output) mapping is most notably characterized by the phase response curve (PRC). Daan and Pittendrigh studied the PRC to establish a relationship among circadian behavior (nocturnal vs. diurnal activity), free-running period, and maximum phase advance/delay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Daan1">[6]</xref>. The free-running period of an organism reflects its circadian behavior without the influence of entrainment factors such as environmental light∶dark cycles. The free-running period of nocturnal animals, for instance, is often less than 24 hours such that dusk triggers a phase delay and the onset of activity. Conversely, diurnal animals often exhibit free-running periods greater than 24 hours such that dawn triggers a phase advance and the onset of activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Daan1">[6]</xref>. Other researchers have made use of PRCs to establish light as a means to accelerate circadian entrainment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Boulos1">[7]</xref>, or as a means to start, stop, and reset the phase of simplified circadian models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Forger1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Ukai1">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In a previous study, we develop a closed-loop nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that minimizes the phase difference between a reference and a controlled system (each modeled as a single deterministic oscillator) through the systematic application of continuous light. Through use of MPC, circadian phase is recovered in almost half the time required by the natural open-loop sun cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Bagheri2">[4]</xref>. Next, we investigated how the MPC algorithm's tuning parameters might affect the model's phase resetting dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Taylor1">[12]</xref>. Here, we make use of sensitivity analysis to identify additional control inputs (or drug targets) that, when used by the MPC algorithm, outperform light-based circadian phase resetting. The target identification of single and multiple control inputs, coupled with the analysis of their respective performance, parallels efforts in the pharmaceutical industry to yield the greatest behavioral response with respect to the smallest system perturbation. In other words, our methodology may be used to identify optimal (and arguably non-intuitive) drug targets for therapy.</p><p>To establish an upper bound relating to the time required to recover phase differences, we begin by evaluating the open-loop control algorithm in the <italic>Open-Loop Phase Recovery</italic> section. The identification and manipulation of a set of single, dual, and triple control inputs are then used to minimize phase recovery dynamics of a wild-type circadian system (as described in the <italic>Single</italic>, <italic>Dual</italic>, and <italic>Triple Target Phase Resetting</italic> sections, respectively). This case is most similar to resetting a healthy organism's phase when subject to an environmental disturbance such as jet lag. In the <italic>Short and Long Period Mutants</italic> section, we further investigate how MPC may be used to alleviate chronic circadian disorders. More specifically, we apply the algorithm to circadian oscillator models that exhibit either short or long-period mutant phenotypes. Results suggest that organisms with such syndromes may track regular 24 hour rhythms through the systematic application of light. Our findings support this unique application of systematic drug target identification coupled with model predictive control for use in medicine and pharmacology (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Discussion</italic></xref> section).

To establish a phase resetting set point or upper bound (the maximum amount of time required to recover a given phase difference), we evaluate the open-loop control algorithm, where environmental light∶dark cycles serve as the only mechanism for phase re-entrainment. The phase recovery surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000104-g002">Figure 2</xref>) displays the time required for the open-loop case to recover from any possible initial condition and initial phase difference. The asymmetry of the surface may be attributed to the nonlinear effects of light, as characterized by the PRC. The input (light) to output (induced phase shift) mapping of the PRC is seldom symmetric.

Mandating the convergence of state trajectories is a tighter constraint than mandating only phase trajectories, since it incorporates amplitude characteristics. The algorithm, however, may be tuned to consider only strict phase measures. The maximum open-loop recovery time refers to a 9 hour initial phase difference whose control action begins at an initial condition of 15 hours. The initial condition, or start of entrainment, is described with respect to circadian time (CT). Interestingly, there is a stark difference between resetting a 3 to 6 hour initial phase difference versus an 18 to 21 hour initial phase difference (a −6 to −3 hour phase difference). In the former, phase recovers in over 100 hours; in the latter, phase recovers in fewer than 60 hours. Additionally, the open-loop algorithm recovers 9 hour phase differences in a fraction of the time required to correct for smaller phase difference. These properties may be attributed to the nature of the phase response curve and are discussed further in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Discussion</italic></xref> section. Experimental studies in mammalian SCN cells support this asymmetry: Reddy <italic>et al.</italic> show that circadian clock resetting from a 6 hour phase advance (IP6) is accompanied by dissociation of cellular gene expression and may take up to 1 week to recover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Reddy1">[18]</xref>. Conversely, resetting a 6 hour phase delay (IP18) is accompanied by coordinated gene expression and requires only 2 days of recovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Reddy1">[18]</xref>. Our simulations support these experimental conclusions as the cumulative protein concentrations in the former case diverge and require several days to converge to the nominal trajectory. In the latter, cumulative protein concentrations oscillate with smaller amplitude until they converge to the nominal trajectory within a couple days. An example of the corresponding simulations is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000104.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Closed-Loop Phase Recovery</title><p>The MPC algorithm (described in the <italic>Model Predictive Control</italic> section) minimizes the normalized difference between the cumulative protein complex concentration over a prediction horizon of 48 hours, by admitting control action during the first 8 hours of the simulated trajectory.

We attribute this steep recovery gradient to the PRC as it depicts a greater region of phase delay than it does a phase advance. For this reason, it is more beneficial if the organism delays its phase to recover from a 12 hour initial phase difference. Furthermore, recall that a phase delay is incurred if the organism is to receive a photic input in the late evening hours. Hence, recovering from a phase difference via a set of delaying control inputs is most efficient if control action begins around the late subjective evening. Thus, if we observe phase resetting behavior corresponding to a small phase difference (such that the subjective day of the controlled system and reference are similar), we expect it to have the shortest recovery time near an initial condition of 12 hours, or dusk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000104-g003">Figure 3(D)</xref>).

We would even argue that the recovery times associated with the dual input strategy may lessen if the genetic algorithm based optimizer were run over a greater number of generations. We limit the number of generations in the genetic algorithm – 15 for the single input, 75 for the dual input, and 250 for the triple input – to reflect the limited resources and time constraints evident in real world applications.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Triple target phase resetting</title><p>Just as the dual input case, we expect the triple input strategy to recover phase just as effectively as the single input strategy.

If we omit this data point as an outlier, this triple input strategy requires 42 hours to recover a 12 hour phase difference beginning at IC6. Assuming abundant computational resources and time, the triple input strategy may further outperform the dual input strategy since the MPC algorithm acquires greater flexibility (a greater number of control options) with each additional target. Each of these control inputs produces a unique PRC that allows the algorithm to further manipulate the set of targets such that the combination may yield a phase delay or advance at any time of the circadian day. In the case of a single light (or <italic>ν</italic><italic><sub>d</sub></italic> target) input, for instance, the algorithm must wait for the subjective morning to force a phase advance, or the subjective night to force a delay. The advantage gained through additional control targets, however, is not clear. Given the finite horizon over which the algorithm optimizes phase synchrony, in addition to the nonlinear response of the model, we can not expect a monotonic improvement of phase recovery dynamics with an increase in the number of manipulated variables. For instance, the algorithm may choose a sequence of multiple inputs that yields lower cost in the short term (as compared to a single input) with a greater cost in the long term, leading to a point of no return. This scenario may also attribute to the 59 hour recovery observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000104-g004">Figure 4(D)</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Short and Long Period Mutants</title><p>Mutant phenotypes of the circadian oscillator represent cases in which nominal light∶dark cycles are unable to maintain synchrony. For this reason, the MPC tuning parameters must be re-evaluated according to this phase resetting problem. In wild-type, for instance, we can afford to be more aggressive with control penalties since nominal light∶dark cycles (or, no control) will eventually entrain the system. In mutants, the weights used to penalize the state error and control inputs prove to be more influential since nominal light∶dark cycles will not entrain the system. Therefore, we set both the move and prediction horizon to 24 hours and reduce the penalty of state error and control to ones. To counter the computational expense incurred with a longer move horizon, we set the time step to 4 hours. Through MPC, we identify a more suitable light∶dark cycle that synchronizes organisms exhibiting abnormally short and long free-running periods (22 and 27 hours, respectively, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000104-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Determining the complete range of entrainment (which is likely wider than the 22 to 27 hour period) is non-trivial. In a previous study, we found that (i) the predicted range of entrainment may be very sensitive to the employed performance metric, and (ii) the control/light input strength may also play a dominant role in defining the bounds of this range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000104-Doyle1">[23]</xref>.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000104-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000104.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Model mis-match.</title><p>Continuous phase resetting for the short-period mutant phenotype (dotted lines) and long-period mutant phenotype (dashed lines) are depicted with respect to an initial condition of 0 and 12 hours.

Hence, for open-loop control action to be most effective, environmental daylight should occur during the controlled system's subjective night (at CT15). In cases with small initial phase difference (such that the subject's internal time is nearly equal to environmental time), however, daylight begins entrainment once the subjective day is around CT12, by inducing small phase delays. This delay reduces the overlap between environmental daylight and the subjective night since re-entrainment of the initial phase difference began before subjective night. The opposite occurs with small <italic>negative</italic> phase differences, where an 18 hour (or −6 hour) phase difference may be recovered via a light pulse admitted at CT21. In this case, environmental daylight affects the controlled system at the start of day while it has not yet begun entrainment, maximizing the phase advancing effect of light. For this reason, open-loop entrainment via phase advances requires less recovery time despite the fact that a single pulse of light may induce a greater phase delay than advance.</p><p>More generally, we find that any given initial phase difference is more readily recovered if open-loop entrainment begins between CT0 and CT9; the rate of re-entrainment depends on the initial condition. To correct initial phase differences of 0 to 9 hours (by inducing a phase delay), daylight is most effective at the end of the day, suggesting greater performance if the algorithm were to begin control action around CT6. To correct initial phase differences of 0 to −6 hours (by inducing phase advances), daylight is most effective at the start of the day, suggesting greater performance if the algorithm were to begin around CT0. In the former case, daylight overlaps with the delay region of the subject's PRC, while in the latter it overlaps with the advance region. Resetting an initial condition of 12 to 15 hours, however, presents an interesting control dilemma as environmental daylight may induce both a phase delay and phase advance. For this reason, the open-loop control algorithm requires several days to correct for such phase differences. If light were accessible to entrain the system continuously throughout the day and night (in other words, if we were to <italic>close the loop</italic>), phase recovery dynamics would be less extreme since phase resetting would rely less on the initial condition.</p><p>Additional phase resetting properties may be inferred through investigation of the simulated PRCs.
