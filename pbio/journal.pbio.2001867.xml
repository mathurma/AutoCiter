<abstract>
<p>Individual cells take lineage commitment decisions in a way that is not necessarily uniform. We address this issue by characterising transcriptional changes in cord blood-derived CD34+ cells at the single-cell level and integrating data with cell division history and morphological changes determined by time-lapse microscopy. We show that major transcriptional changes leading to a multilineage-primed gene expression state occur very rapidly during the first cell cycle. One of the 2 stable lineage-primed patterns emerges gradually in each cell with variable timing. Some cells reach a stable morphology and molecular phenotype by the end of the first cell cycle and transmit it clonally. Others fluctuate between the 2 phenotypes over several cell cycles. Our analysis highlights the dynamic nature and variable timing of cell fate commitment in hematopoietic cells, links the gene expression pattern to cell morphology, and identifies a new category of cells with fluctuating phenotypic characteristics, demonstrating the complexity of the fate decision process (which is different from a simple binary switch between 2 options, as it is usually envisioned).</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Hematopoietic stem cells are classically defined as a specific category of cells at the top of the hierarchy that can differentiate all blood cell types following step-by-step the instructions of a deterministic program. We have analysed this process, and our findings support a much more dynamic view than previously described. We apply time-lapse microscopy coupled to single-cell molecular analyses in human hematopoietic stem cells and find that fate decision is not a unique, programmed event but a process of spontaneous variation and selective stabilisation reminiscent of trial–error processes. We show that each cell explores (at its own pace and independently of cell division) many different possibilities before reaching a stable combination of genes to be expressed. Our results suggest, therefore, that multipotency seems to be more like a transitory state than a feature of a specific cell category.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) give rise to all the cellular components of blood. The major stages of differentiation and the key genes participating in this process are now well characterised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref001">1</xref>]. According to the classical view, haematopoiesis is a hierarchically organised process of successive fate commitments, in which differentiation potential is progressively restricted in an orderly way over cell divisions. There are several variants of the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref006">6</xref>]. In all cases, the first fate decision is a binary choice taken by multipotent progenitors (MPPs), which leads to 2 different committed progenitors (for the purpose of simplicity, these progenitors are designated here as common myeloid progenitors [CMP] and common lymphoid progenitors [CLP]). In molecular terms, the choice is believed to be the result of the strictly regulated activation of master regulator genes and their underlying transcriptional network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref007">7</xref>]. However, the strict hierarchical logic of classical models has recently been challenged by a number of in vivo and in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref010">10</xref>]. Single-cell gene expression studies have revealed a much higher heterogeneity of cell subtypes than can be detected using a combination of surface markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref011">11</xref>]. It is not surprising that the number of identifiable cell types increases with the resolution of the detection method. Although correct cell type classification is a key step in understanding the cell fate decision issue, it cannot reveal the dynamic features of the fate commitment process and leaves a number of unanswered questions. Do different phenotypic forms represent different cell types or different stages of the same process? How does the transition between the forms occur? How long does it take?</p>
<p>Until recently, fully deterministic explanations were predominant, but recent studies have suggested other alternatives. Two different possibilities have been put forward. According to the first, the commitment process starts with the sporadic, independent activation of genes within the same cell. The simultaneous stochastic expression of regulatory genes specifying different lineages creates a multiprimed intermediate state that enables these cells to choose 1 of the lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref016">16</xref>]. A coherent lineage-specific expression profile would then emerge from this metastable state. According to the second, commitment is preceded by transcriptome fluctuations between different lineage-biased states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref019">19</xref>]. Surprisingly, the time scale of transformations related to the cellular fate decision process remains largely unexplored. The transcriptome of the same cell can be analysed only once, because the cell is destroyed by RNA extraction. Therefore, indirect approaches are required to identify trends and patterns in time series.</p>
<p>We addressed the issue of the dynamics and the time scale of the commitment process by integrating single-cell quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), cell division history, and morphological changes determined by time-lapse analysis. Contrary to the common strategy consisting of isolating defined cell subpopulations with the help of specific surface markers and characterising their gene expression profiles at the single-cell level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref020">20</xref>], we used an alternative approach. Individual cells were randomly isolated from the heterogeneous cord blood CD34+ cell fraction at different time points after cytokine stimulation, and their gene expression profiles were determined using single-cell qRT-PCR. The data provided a series of snapshots, showing the actual statistical distribution of single-cell gene expression patterns across the whole population. The structure of the population at the successive time points was revealed by unsupervised classification of the expression profiles according to their similarity using multiparametric approaches. The progression of the fate commitment process was deduced from the evolution of the population structure. At the same time, using time-lapse microscopy, we tracked randomly isolated individual CD34+ cells and their progeny for several days after cytokine stimulation. We recorded the division history and the morphological changes of each cell in the clones. The population structure was deduced on the basis of the statistical analysis of these observations. The efficiency of the time-lapse approach in investigating cell fate decisions has recently been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref021">21</xref>]. To reinforce this approach, the time-lapse and gene expression data were integrated into a coherent scenario. This was done by using CD133 protein expression levels to isolate cells with 1 transcription profile or the other and directly record their dynamic phenotype, thereby providing a direct link between dynamic phenotype and transcription profile.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results revealed that fate decision is a dynamic, fluctuating process that is more complex than a simple binary switch between 2 options, as it is usually envisioned.</p>

<p>The transcriptional profile of individual cord blood CD34+ cells was determined at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after the beginning of cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Single-cell qRT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels of 90 different genes. A set of 32 genes was selected for their known function in the early differentiation of hematopoietic cells and was expected to inform on the functional state of the cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s010">S1 Table</xref>). A second set of 54 genes was chosen randomly from a list of genes known to be expressed in the hematopoietic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref023">23</xref>]. These genes provided an assessment of the overall transcriptional activity of the genome. Five additional genes were added to the list for their role in maintaining the pluripotent state in embryonic stem cells. A heat map of all data and a violin plot of the expression profile of each gene at the 4 separate time points are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. The normalized single-cell quantitative gene expression data obtained for the different time points were merged into a single database and screened for subpopulations by k-means clustering. The number of statistically distinguishable groups was inferred using gap statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref024">24</xref>]. The groups were visualised on heat maps and on a 2D plot using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref025">25</xref>]. Although every cell had a unique gene expression pattern, this approach enabled us to clearly identify subgroups of cells in the population on the basis of the statistical similarity of their gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcriptional profile of cord blood-derived CD34+ cells at t = 0 h, t = 24 h, t = 48 h, and t = 72 h after the beginning of the experiment.</title>
<p>(A) CD34+ cells were isolated from human cord blood and cultured in serum-free medium with early acting cytokines. Single-cell quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyse single-cell transcription at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. At the same time, individual clones were continuously monitored using time-lapse microscopy. (B) t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) map of single-cell transcription data. The 4 panels show analysis of the same data set, with each point representing a single cell highlighted in different colours depending on the given time point. The 2 clusters identified by gap statistics at t = 48 h and t = 72 h are surrounded by an ellipse and numbered #1 and #2 for multipotent and common myeloid progenitor (CMP)-like cells. Note the rapid evolution of the expression profiles. (Underlying data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s011">S1 Data</xref>.) (C) A heat map representation of the expression levels of a subset of genes that strongly contributed to the differentiation of the different groups (as detected by principal component analysis [PCA]; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and cluster analysis of expression profiles at the different time points show the rapid evolution of gene expression. The list of the genes used (shown on the right) includes well-known genes acting during hematopoietic differentiation but also many randomly selected genes. The colour code for expression levels is indicated below. (Underlying data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s011">S1 Data</xref>.) (D) Pairwise correlations between the genes analysed using single-cell quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Only the gene pairs with a Pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0.8 are indicated for each time point. The 2 clusters identified at t = 48 h and t = 72 h are represented separately. Note the transient increase of the average correlation in cluster #2 at t = 48 h, indicating a state transition.

<p>Nonstimulated CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood represented the t = 0 h time point. A heat map of the single-cell transcriptional profiles of genes contributing significantly to the identification of subgroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) showed that this population of cells was heterogeneous. Several genes reported to play a role in self-renewal, quiescence, and other stem cell functions (CD71, CD133, CXCR4, GATA2, and FLT3) were expressed sporadically and at variable levels in a fraction of cells. Genuine pluripotent stem cell genes were also expressed at low levels in a fraction of cells (NANOG, OCT4, KLF4). Nevertheless, no correlation was found between these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), and the statistical analysis did not reveal distinguishable expression patterns that could define cell types. The only detectable differences were donor-associated and probably reflected differences related to the processing of individual blood samples. Donor-specific differences disappeared at later stages.</p>
<p>The gene expression profile 24 h after the onset of cytokine stimulation was found to be fundamentally different to t = 0 h cells. Almost every cell responded to cytokine stimulation by increasing transcript levels and generating a unique gene expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). When represented on the 2D t-SNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and principal component analysis (PCA) plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), the cells formed a single but dispersed cluster, well separated from the t = 0 h cells. In a fraction of cells, moderate to high transcription of previously nonexpressed hematopoietic regulator genes was observed in addition to that already seen at t = 0 h. For example, the expression of GATA1, GATA2, PU1, CD71, FOG1, CD133, or EPOR increased or was more frequent than at t = 0 h. In some cells, all these genes were expressed simultaneously. Nevertheless, no distinct subpopulations could be identified at the resolution of our approach. The pairwise correlation coefficients between genes remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). It is therefore likely that the patterns observed at 24 h resulted from essentially uncoordinated up-regulation of gene transcription and led to a highly heterogeneous cell population. This is a transition state reminiscent of the reported multilineage primed state with simultaneous expression of lineage-affiliated genes specifying alternative cell fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The first signs of coordinated differential gene expression appeared at t = 48 h after cytokine stimulation. At this stage, 2 distinct gene expression patterns emerged from the highly variable background of earlier stages. The 2 clusters are clearly distinguishable on the t-SNE plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and identified by gap statistics. They are also easily seen on the heat map representing gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Cluster #2 comprised cells with simultaneous expression of genes characteristic of CMPs such as GATA1 and EPOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref007">7</xref>]. The expression profile of the cells in cluster #1 was characterised by the strong expression of genes reported for multipotent cells (CD133, GFI1, KLF4, or FLT3) and the lack of expression of GATA1 and EPOR. Although this pattern is reminiscent of a self-renewing, multipotent profile, it is difficult to determine the exact identity of these cells at the level of resolution used in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref026">26</xref>]. Typical genes for pluripotent stem cells like NANOG and OCT4 were expressed at moderate levels in many cells from both clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Randomly selected genes were also good predictors for the 2 groups of cells. Only a small fraction of cells could not be classified in 1 of the 2 main clusters at t = 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The tendency observed at t = 48 h was further reinforced by t = 72 h. The cells in cluster #2 with CMP-like profiles represented more than half of all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). We observed a strong but transient increase in the number of highly correlated genes in this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Such an increase in the overall gene-to-gene correlation is a typical hallmark of imminent state transition in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref029">29</xref>]. Indirectly, this suggested that the cluster #1 profile was more in continuity with the previous profile observed at t = 24 h and that the cluster #2 profile at t = 48 h represented a transition to a new pattern.</p>
<p>Taken together, these single-cell gene expression observations revealed that the cell fate decision process in cytokine-stimulated CD34+ cord blood cells occurred during the first 2 d. Initially, each cell responds to cytokine stimulation with an uncoordinated change in gene expression, which is followed by the emergence of 2 distinct gene expression patterns reminiscent of the 2 known major types of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Although indications of this second change may appear as early as 24 h after stimulation, the 2 distinct gene expression patterns are clearly distinguishable at 48 h and consolidated by 72 h. By this stage, almost every cell seems to have adopted 1 profile or the other.</p>

<title>Time-lapse tracking studies</title>
<p>In order to integrate the gene expression snapshots into a dynamic scenario, we made time-lapse records of individual CD34+ cells under in vitro conditions identical to those in the single-cell gene expression studies. We imaged individual cells in microwells at a rate of 60 frames per hour for 7 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Using a semiautomatic image analysis approach, we established individual clonal pedigrees and recorded cell cycle durations and major morphological changes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>, the pedigrees of individual clones were highly variable but shared some general features. Some clones produced only a few cells during the observation period, while others proliferated faster and produced up to 30–40 siblings. We focused our attention on the first 3 generations. As reported for cells cultured in early acting cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref030">30</xref>], the first cell cycle was exceptionally long in all clones. The division of the founder cell occurred between 35 h and 80 h after the start of culturing, with the median cell cycle length being 58 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We questioned whether the culturing of isolated cells in microwells, in which direct contact with the other cells was not possible, influenced cell cycle length. To measure the division rate in a population context, the cells cultured together were labelled using CellTrace Violet (CTV). The results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) showed that the cells had similar division profiles regardless of whether they were cultured individually or in population. The unusually long first cell cycle was particularly important when interpreting results. It implied that the transition from the initial to the multilineage primed transcription profile followed by 1 of the 2 types of progenitor-like profiles observed at 24 h and 48 h after CD34+ cell stimulation occurred during the life of the founder cell, before the first mitosis.</p>

<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that there is a connection between cell morphology and the differentiation potential of CD34+ cells. Two major morphological forms have been described in the CD34+ cord blood cell fraction. Polarised cells are capable of active motion with the help of lamellipodia and possess, on their opposite end, large protrusions called uropods. These cells have been found to retain primitive self-renewing and stem cell functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref032">32</xref>]. The second morphological type is round. These cells have been considered as already engaged in differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Time-lapse records revealed that the 2 cell morphologies were not permanent; most cells were able to switch between forms several times during the cell cycle. After recovering from the stress of isolation and manipulation, founder cells acquired polarised morphologies within a few hours, developing uropods and starting to move actively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s014">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s016">S3</xref> Movies). During the first cell cycle, cells mostly conserved the polarised form, and switches between the 2 morphologies were rare. As indicated above, the first cell division occurred (on average) at 58 h, and the average lengths of subsequent cell cycles were around 20 h to 22 h. The daughter (second generation) and granddaughter (third generation) cells were able to switch between the 2 morphologies at a much higher frequency compared to the founder cells. In order to quantify these events, we manually tracked each cell and recorded each switch. Representative profiles are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s005">S5 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to compare quantitatively the dynamic phenotype of cells, we calculated 3 parameters based on their dynamic profiles. The first parameter was calculated as a ratio of the time a given cell spent in a round shape compared to the time spent in a polarised shape. This parameter was close to 0 for stable polarised cells and 1 for stable round cells. Intermediate values correspond to the fraction of time cells spent in round shape. The second parameter was the frequency of morphological switches during the cell cycle. This parameter expressed the cell’s ability to maintain a stable morphology. The third parameter was the cell cycle length. When cells were represented as individual points in the space determined by the 3 parameters, we identified 3 major categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The first category included cells with mainly polarised shapes; the second category was composed of cells with predominantly round shapes; the cells in the third category switched shape frequently, generally fluctuating between both morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantitative analysis of dynamic phenotypes as determined by time-lapse data.</title>
<p>(A) Association between the morphology, switch frequency, cell cycle length, and the type of cell divisions of second- and third-generation cells. Each point represents a single cell. Siblings with different dynamic behaviour and morphology (in green) are usually characterised by high switch frequencies. Siblings with similar dynamic behaviour and morphologies are shown in blue. The morphology is given as a ratio of time spent in round/polarised shape by a cell during the cell cycle. Switch frequency is given in number of morphological transformations per hour. Cell cycle length is in hours. (B) Dynamic phenotype change during the first 2 cell divisions as determined on the basis of time-lapse records. Three different dynamic phenotypes were identified: stable polarised, frequent switchers, and stable round. Cells tended to transmit dynamic phenotypes to daughter cells during cell division. Polarised and frequent switchers produced round cells, and frequent switchers were always produced by polarised mothers. Phenotypic change is not associated with asymmetric division; it can occur at any time in the cell cycle. Since round cells always produce round daughters, the whole process is biased and the proportion of this phenotype increases. (Underlying data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s012">S2 Data</xref>.)</p>

<p>When sister cell pairs were examined, it became obvious that many displayed very similar dynamic phenotypes. In some cases, periods of stable morphology and switching events coincided almost perfectly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). In other cases, the 2 sister cells behaved differently. In the most extreme cases, 1 sister cell adopted a stable round form and the other a stable polarised form immediately after division.</p>
<p>We calculated the frequency with which a cell with a given dynamic phenotype was produced by a mother cell with similar or dissimilar phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Maternal cells clearly tended to transmit the dynamic phenotype to daughter cells. We also observed the regularity with which phenotype changes occurred in daughter cells. Polarised cells were systematically produced by polarised cells. At lower probabilities, both polarised and fluctuating cells could produce stable round phenotype cells. Round cells always gave rise to round siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Following these simple rules, the cumulative outcome of the process was the gradual increase of round cells in the population. Cells with fluctuating morphologies appeared to be an intermediate form between polarised and round cells. Since 25% of daughter cells conserved this phenotype, the fluctuating intermediate cells persisted in the population. On static snapshots, however, this category remained undetectable: only polarised and round cells were observed. A polarised form was considered to be a feature of multipotent cells and the round form a committed myeloid progenitor phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<title>Coupling the molecular and cellular scales</title>
<p>The dynamically fluctuating behaviour we have described here for the first time represents a transition between the 2 states and reflects a ‘hesitant’, incomplete fate-determination process. Since we detected only 2 major transcription profiles but observed 3 different dynamic behaviours, it is possible that ‘hesitant’ cells are not characterised by a clearly distinct transcription pattern. Morphology fluctuations may be accompanied by fluctuations in the transcript or protein levels of at least some key genes.</p>
<p>To test this assumption, we took advantage of the observation that the gene coding for the CD133 cell surface protein was expressed preferentially in 1 of the 2 transcription patterns detected at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Previous reports have established that CD133 protein is typically present in cells with polarised forms and accumulates in the uropod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref033">33</xref>]. We confirmed this using image cytometry and immunohistochemistry on fixed cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Cells expressing high levels of CD133 were mostly polarised, while those with low levels of CD133 were round (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). This observation explicitly established a direct link between the cell morphology and the transcription patterns detected by single-cell qRT-PCR.</p>
<p>We therefore used the CD133 protein as a proxy for the isolation of a cell fraction enriched in either polarised or round cells and recorded their dynamic phenotype. The ‘high’, ‘medium’, and ‘low/negative’ CD133-expressing cell fractions were isolated 48 h after cytokine stimulation, put in culture, and tracked using time-lapse microscopy for an additional 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The fraction of the time the cell spent in round or in polarised shape, the switch frequency, and the division asymmetry of the tracked cells were quantified. The ‘high’ CD133-expressing cells and their progeny reproduced the 3 types of cells observed previously but in different proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Most of the cells displayed stable polarised morphologies or were frequent switchers; only a few cells displayed stable round morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). By contrast, the ‘low/negative’ cells produced either stable round progeny or cells with fluctuating morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The ‘medium’ CD133-expressing cells had a higher switch frequency, and both shapes were represented in a more equilibrated manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>These observations confirmed the idea that cells with stable round shapes were derived from cells with polarised shapes and high CD133 levels following a period in which they had a fluctuating phenotype. The fluctuations occurred in a bi-stable manner; the cells switched from 1 morphology to another and back rapidly without stable intermediate states (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s014">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s016">S3</xref> Movies). The process of transformation did not correlate with the cell cycle; some cells reached a stable morphology rapidly, while others fluctuated over several cycles. The process was accompanied by a gradual decrease in CD133 protein levels in cells. We found no evidence that asymmetric divisions played a direct role in this process.</p>
<p>Next, we isolated individual cells with high, medium, and low/negative CD133 protein levels using a cell sorter and performed single-cell qRT-PCR analysis using the same gene panel used previously on the unsorted population. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g005">Fig 5A</xref> shows the t-SNE representation of the single-cell gene expression profiles. The heat map representation of the full set of gene expression results is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s007">S7 Fig</xref> together with the PCA analysis. The ‘high’ and ‘low’ CD133 cells displayed different transcription profiles similar to clusters #1 and #2, respectively, found in cells of the unsorted population at t = 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The cell fraction isolated on the basis of intermediate CD133 levels contained a large number of cells with intermediate transcription profiles, again supporting their dynamic transitory phenotype. When expression pattern of individual genes is examined (for example, CXCR4, CXCR2, DVL2, FOXO3, NANOG, ZNF665, or TSPYL5 [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s008">S8 Fig</xref>]), some of them displayed a very different distribution in the ‘medium CD133’ compared to the ‘high’ and ‘low’ CD133 cells. This further demonstrates that the ‘medium’ CD133 cells are more than simple intermediates between the ‘high’ and ‘low’ cells; they have their own dynamic transcription profile. One can conjecture that if the cell shape correlates with the CD133 level that correlates with the transcription profile, then those cells that change shape must also change transcription profile.</p>

<p>PU1 and GATA1 are well-known transcription factor-coding genes that play an important role in the specification of granulocytic–monocytic and erythroid–megakaryocitic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref034">34</xref>]. It has been proposed that PU1 and GATA1 can cross-inhibit each other’s activity and generate a bi-stable switch between the 2 lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref035">35</xref>], but more recent observations challenged this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref021">21</xref>]. Our analysis showed that ‘high’ CD133 cells express only PU1; ‘medium’ CD133 cells express PU1 only or coexpress the 2 genes; and ‘low’ CD133 cells express PU1 only, coexpress the 2 genes, or express GATA1 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<title>Single-cell transcription profile of the multipotent stage</title>
<p>In order to determine which of the observed phenotypes correspond to the multipotent stage, we took advantage of recent observations demonstrating that the inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity with a pharmacological agent resulted in a substantial increase in their incidence in the CD34+ cord blood population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref037">37</xref>]. We anticipated that this would increase the proportion of cells with transcription profiles typical of the multipotential phenotype. Since valproic acid (VPA) was shown to be the most efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref036">36</xref>], we used this agent to treat CD34+ cord blood cells stimulated by cytokines as above, before sampling transcription profiles. The increase of the CD90 marker (as analysed by flow cytometry) confirmed that the VPA effect was already visible after 24 h and gradually grew stronger during subsequent steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). The expression of CD34 and CD38 markers remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Although we did not analyse the in vivo potential of these cells, based on previous reports, we considered them enriched for bona fide multipotent cells. We performed single-cell qRT-PCR at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the start of the experiment, as in control cells. At all 4 time points, cell populations were very heterogeneous. At each time point, the cells displayed a unique transcription profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), and no identifiable transcription patterns appeared during the 72 h of the experiment, despite slight profile evolutions. Overall, transcription patterns in individual cells were reminiscent of the uncoordinated multilineage primed profile detected in control cells at 24 h, but the 2 groups clustered separately on t-SNE maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Since the cells did not divide during the first 48 h, the increase observed in the multipotent cell fraction could not result from the selective proliferation of an initially small subpopulation of cells. Instead, this occurred because cells already present in the population changed the expression of many genes in response to the VPA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we aimed to identify the initial stages of fate commitment in the CD34+ cell fraction of human cord blood and determine the typical time scale for these events. Without cytokine stimulation, CD34+ cells remain quiescent and die after a few days in culture. Early acting cytokines allow these cells to survive, become metabolically active, and enter the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref038">38</xref>] without showing overt signs of differentiation during the first few days. This creates ideal conditions for studying early events. Our experimental design combined continuous time-lapse observations with snapshots of high-resolution single-cell transcriptome analysis. The data can be integrated in a dynamic fate-decision process scenario. Fate decision is necessarily accompanied by a change in the gene expression pattern. This is a multistep process. First, upon stimulation, cells rapidly reach the multiprimed state, which is characterised by a promiscuous gene expression pattern and predominantly polarised morphologies. This is an unstable phase, and 2 distinct transcription profiles start to emerge before the end of the first cell cycle. The process by which cells relax from a multiprimed to a more stable state is continuous and of variable length. Some cells reach stable morphology and a coherent, lineage-affiliated transcription profile by the end of the first cell cycle, which they then transmit to daughter cells. Other cells divide into unstable daughter cells with dynamic, ‘hesitant’ behaviour. This behaviour is characterised by fluctuations between polarised, actively moving amoeboid and round morphologies over several cell cycles, suggesting that instability can be transmitted mitotically. Although we have no formal evidence that the transcriptome of these cells also fluctuates, 2 observations suggest that this could be the case. First, we only found 2 established transcription profiles that correspond to polarised and round morphologies with ‘high’ and ‘low’ CD133 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, we observe 3 dynamic phenotypes, 1 of which is fluctuating. Second, cells isolated on the basis of having ‘medium’ CD133 protein levels represent a transition between the stable polarised and round morphology. We propose a dynamic scenario in which the initial stochastic multilineage primed state is followed by a period of relaxation and uncertain ‘hesitant’ phase of variable length with fluctuating transcriptomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref017">17</xref>] before a stable lineage committed state is reached. In addition, this scenario is also in accordance with the recent proposal that there exists a fraction of low-primed, undifferentiated cells called ‘CLOUD’-HSPCs in which that can fluctuate without passing through fixed, discrete states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Increased stochastic variation in gene expression may be responsible for the rapid shift away from the initial quiescent state and lead to the uncommitted multilineage primed state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref016">16</xref>]. Cell division is not required for this process; it occurs during the first cell cycle following stimulation. Cells on the path toward the new phenotype represent the committed state. The critical moment in this process is the transition between the 2 phenotypes, when the old gene network has broken down but the new network is not yet assembled. We consider that cells with fluctuating morphologies represent this transition state. The rapidity of the transition may be dependent on the time required for the new gene expression network to settle into a stable state. Since phenotypic stability of a cell lineage largely depends on the frequency of transcription initiation and the stability of the resulting mRNAs and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref040">40</xref>], the observed ‘hesitant’ phenotype might be the consequence of stochastic fluctuations due to rapid mRNA and protein turnover. The consolidation of the chromatin structure appears to be an essential element in this process, because, as shown in single-cell transcription studies, the HDAC inhibitor VPA delays the transition and blocks cells in a promiscuous gene expression pattern typical of a multilineage primed state. Indeed, HDAC inhibitors have been shown to increase gene expression stochasticity by increasing chromatin acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, in this study, we identified the earliest phases of fate commitment in human cord blood CD34+ cells and assigned a time scale to this process. We demonstrated that the rapid initiation of the process occurs within a single cell cycle and is followed by a dynamic transition state of variable length that may span several cell cycles. Since experimental conditions were constant, the changes observed are likely to reflect cell-intrinsic processes, whereas the convergence toward a similar endpoint may reflect the constraints imposed by these conditions. From this perspective, fate decision appears to be a process of spontaneous variation/selective stabilisation reminiscent of trial–error learning, in which each cell explores many different possibilities at its own pace by expressing a large variety of genes before finding a stable combination corresponding to the actual environment. This is in remarkable agreement with earlier theoretical predictions and experimental work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref046">46</xref>]. At least 3 independent theoretical models predicted the existence of an initial fluctuating phase during differentiation. According to the first theory, cell differentiation is a variation/selection process analogous to evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref043">43</xref>]. Variations are created by stochastic fluctuations of gene expression, and some patterns are selectively stabilised through interactions with the environment and neighbouring cells. Another approach envisions cell phenotype as an attractor state in the parameter space defined by the gene expression network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref047">47</xref>]. Differentiation is seen as a transition from 1 attractor to another and governed by the stochastic dynamics and self-organisation of the gene network. Finally, a dynamic system view of differentiation was independently proposed by Kaneko [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref048">48</xref>]. A common theme of these approaches is the prediction that differentiating cells must necessarily go through a dynamically fluctuating phase with oscillating gene expression. Several recent studies have reported on the existence of gene expression fluctuations during the critical state transitory phase of the differentiation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001867.ref051">51</xref>]. Our study goes a step further by demonstrating that the cellular phenotype also fluctuates during the critical transitory phase.</p>

This rapid increase cannot be explained by the selective proliferation of the CD90+ cells and is the result of the de novo synthesis of the CD90 protein, because as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001867.g002">Fig 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001867.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, cells do not divide before 72h.
