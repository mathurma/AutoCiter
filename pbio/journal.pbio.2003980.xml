<abstract>
<p>Effective transfer of genetic information during cell division requires a major reorganization of chromosome structure. This process is triggered by condensin, a conserved pentameric ATPase essential for chromosome condensation. How condensin harnesses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to promote chromatin reorganization is unknown. To address this issue, we performed a genetic screen specifically focused on the ATPase domain of Smc4, a core subunit of condensin. Our screen identified mutational hotspots that impair condensin’s ability to condense chromosomes to various degrees. These mutations have distinct effects on viability, genome stability, and chromosome morphology, revealing unique thresholds for condensin enzymatic activity in the execution of its cellular functions. Biochemical analyses indicate that inactivation of Smc4 ATPase activity can result in cell lethality because it favors a specific configuration of condensin that locks ATP in the enzyme. Together, our results provide critical insights into the mechanism used by condensin to harness the energy of ATP hydrolysis for the compaction of chromatin.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, the deletion of a single copy of most genes shows little or no detectable phenotype under standard proliferative conditions. This implies that a large reduction in the level of a gene product can be tolerated by eukaryotic organisms and that a “reserve capacity” is built in the protein machinery that drives most cellular processes. Here, we test if the main effector of chromosome condensation—the condensin complex—operates with a reserve enzymatic capacity in the execution of its multiple functions in vivo. To achieve this, we created an allelic series of mutations that selectively inactivate condensin ATPase activity in a graded manner. We show that many core functions of condensin can be maintained even at low levels of ATPase activity. Our data also reveal the existence of various thresholds of ATPase activity that are necessary and sufficient for the execution of different cellular functions by condensin. Notably, loss of genome stability at repetitive DNA is only observed when condensin ATPase activity is severely impaired. Taken together, our results reveal key insights into the process of ATP hydrolysis by condensin and how the energy it releases promotes genome remodeling and stability during cell division.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chromosomes must undergo a major structural reorganization to allow the efficient and error-free segregation of genetic information during mitosis. This process is known as chromosome condensation and is promoted by the condensin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref003">3</xref>]. The condensation of chromosomes has been described more than a century ago, and yet the molecular mechanism by which amorphous chromatin is reorganized into highly compact chromosomes is still poorly understood. The main effector of this reorganization is the condensin enzyme, a nuclear complex composed of two structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins (Smc2 and Smc4), a kleisin subunit (Brn1/chromosome-associated protein H [CAP-H]), and two HEAT repeat–containing subunits (Ycg1/CAP-G and Ycs4/CAP-D) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref004">4</xref>]). Condensin is a multifunctional enzyme that can bind and reanneal nucleic acids, as well as constrain knots and supercoils in the primary structure of DNA, which likely affect the topological configuration of chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref008">8</xref>]. Importantly, the role of condensin during chromosome condensation depends largely on its mechanochemical properties and inherent ATPase activity.</p>
<p>The catalytic core of the condensin complex is formed by two SMC family subunits, a group of proteins involved in sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and chromosome condensation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref009">9</xref>]). SMC proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes, and they are also found in other domains of life. The domain organization of this group of proteins is essential for function and is characterized by three globular domains (an N-terminal ATPase, a central hinge, and a C-terminal ATPase) separated by two alpha-helical segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref004">4</xref>]. To allow interactions between the terminal globular regions and create a functional ATPase “head domain,” individual SMC proteins fold back on themselves into a structure resembling a twisted hairpin, as suggested in early studies from the Earnshaw laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref011">11</xref>] and later confirmed by electron microscopy imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref012">12</xref>]. Within condensin, interactions between the head domains of Smc2 and Smc4 create a bipartite ATPase unit that shares significant similarity with the extensively studied ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref011">11</xref>]. In the case of ABC transporters, global structural rearrangements associated with the hydrolysis of ATP allow the translocation of small molecules through membranes. Despite the deep similarities between the ATPase domains of SMC proteins and ABC-type transporters, it has been difficult to extrapolate how condensin ATPase activity might promote chromosome compaction from our knowledge of the mode-of-action of ABC transporters.</p>
<p>The functional relevance of ATPase activity has also been studied in other SMC complexes, most notably in cohesin. This complex, composed of a catalytic core of Smc1 and Smc3 proteins, is required to hold the sister chromatids together during mitosis and meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref004">4</xref>]. In cohesin, ATP and its hydrolysis are necessary for DNA entrapment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref014">14</xref>] and for tethering cohesin to chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref016">16</xref>]. More recently, it has been shown that Smc3 can sense the presence of DNA and induce cohesin ring opening thanks to its ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, Çamdere and colleagues have suggested that Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase head domains may work in a cooperative manner at different steps of the cohesion process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref016">16</xref>]. The distinct molecular functions associated with different ATPase head domains could explain some of the asymmetry observed among SMC proteins within their cognate complexes, as previously observed with ABC transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>With respect to condensin, it is known that ATP hydrolysis plays an essential role in its function, as the abrogation of this activity leads to cell inviability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref019">19</xref>]. Moreover, condensin activity is required even after chromosome assembly is apparently completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref020">20</xref>], suggesting that its ATPase activity must be continually active throughout mitosis to maintain chromosome structure. With respect to the mechanism of action, condensin binding to DNA is ATP independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref018">18</xref>], whereas its ability to constrain positive superhelical tension in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) requires ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref007">7</xref>]. Based on these observations, it has been suggested that ATP binding and hydrolysis may promote conformational changes in condensin that would allow DNA entrapment within its structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Ultimately, a key question for chromosome biology is how condensin uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to convert amorphous chromatin into highly compacted chromosome in vivo. Since all ATPase-specific mutants tested so far in condensin are inviable (e.g., mutations in Walker A/B and C-motifs required for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis), it has been difficult to delineate the specific contribution of condensin ATP hydrolysis to the process of chromosome condensation. To address this important question, it is necessary to identify weakened or hypomorphic alleles of condensin that, despite being catalytically active, are defective enough to stabilize intermediate states in the process of chromosome compaction. To achieve this goal, we report here the characterization of an extensive collection of <italic>smc4</italic> mutants specifically defective in condensin ATPase activity.</p>

<p>The ABC-type ATPase domain is a characteristic feature of SMC proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref011">11</xref>]. This family of ATPase domain is relatively uncommon in eukaryotes and is defined by the presence of 6 unique sequence motifs (A-, R-, Q-, D-, H-loops, and C-motif) in addition to the Walker A (P-loop) and Walker B consensus sequences found in most ATPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Also conserved in ABC-type ATPase are the Pro-loop and C-helix regions adjacent to the Walker B and C-motifs, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref027">27</xref>]. The latter two regions have recently been connected to the hydrolysis of nucleotides and thus appear to be bona fide ATPase motifs. The ABC-type ATPase domain is most frequently found in membrane transporters, and an alignment of the amino acid sequence of typical human ABC transporters (MDR1 and CFTR1) with the ATPase domains of condensin SMC subunits reveals a strong evolutionary conservation of the ABC-specific sequence motifs in SMC proteins from various eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In fact, only the region encoding the H-loop and adjacent C-terminal sequence of the domain appears to diverge significantly in primary sequence among ABC-family ATPases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The role of most ABC-specific ATPase motifs has not been extensively characterized in SMC proteins. In contrast, the specific contribution of these motifs to the mode of action of ABC transporters is well documented (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref029">29</xref>]). These studies showed that the D-loop and the signature motif of one ATPase “head domain”/monomer cooperates with the active sites of the opposite ATPase head domain to allow the hydrolysis of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref034">34</xref>]. With respect to the role of each motif, the A-, P-, and H-loops contribute to the position and binding of ATP and cofactors required for catalysis, whereas the Walker B, D-loop, Q-loop, and C-motif are directly involved in ATP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref029">29</xref>]. These analyses, together with the strong sequence conservation in ABC motifs, allowed us to predict the positions of Smc4 residues involved in ATP hydrolysis, as described schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g001">Fig 1C</xref>.</p>
<p>To further validate the putative nucleotide–enzyme interactions, we also modeled Smc4 ATPase domain using crystallographic information from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Smc1 (<italic>ScS</italic>mc1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref035">35</xref>]. <italic>ScS</italic>mc1 was used as a template because it shows substantial sequence identity to Smc4 (38% identity over their ATPase domains), and a high-resolution structure is available for its ATPase head domain. Overlap of known SMC structures from <italic>Sc</italic>Smc1 and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>furiosus</italic> Smc (<italic>Pf</italic>Smc) illustrates a high degree of conservation in structural organization within this family of proteins, even when primary sequence identity is weaker than that shared by Smc1 and Smc4 (i.e., 31% sequence identity in <italic>Sc</italic>Smc1 and <italic>Pf</italic>Smc ATPase head domain; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Importantly, our in silico model of Smc4 head domain points to a number of key residues that might interfere with ATP binding and/or hydrolysis when mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Based on this information, we selected residues at 24 distinct positions within Smc4 ATPase domain for in-depth mutagenesis and phenotypic characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; positions marked with dots). These positions encompass all canonical ABC-type motifs as well as other residues that are predicted to be involved in catalysis. Of these, 18 correspond to residues that were not previously analyzed in SMC proteins (positions previously mutagenized are marked with a star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We focused on residues that were highly conserved in each motif, as well as adjacent residues that are less conserved to avoid potential lethal mutations. We also mutated 2 regions not related to conserved ABC motifs, namely Ile1364-Val1365 and Gly1396, both of which are conserved in Smc4 but not in Smc2. Mutagenesis of Gly1396 was of particular interest because this residue is conserved in all eukaryotic Smc4s and prokaryotic SMCs but not in Smc2 nor ABC transporters (see alignment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). It was previously suggested that SMC proteins can be classified in two different subgroups based on sequence similarity between Smc1/4 and Smc2/3 at their most C-terminal sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref036">36</xref>]. Mutation of Gly1396 was designed to test this notion and the functional importance of the more divergent sequences at the extreme C-terminus of Smc4 ATPase head domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Overall, this structural analysis provided a rationale for the creation of a total of 51 different mutations affecting Smc4 catalytic domain. We expected this collection of mutant alleles to cause defects of various severities in condensin ATPase activity, from mild to severe impairment in ATP hydrolysis in vivo.</p>

<title>Targeted mutations in ABC-type motifs identify the H-loop and C-helix as mutational hotspots to generate thermosensitive alleles</title>
<p>To facilitate the creation and analysis of a large collection of mutant alleles of <italic>SMC4</italic>, we used a gene replacement strategy in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Specifically, we constructed a series of heterozygous ATPase mutants in diploid cells and uncovered the phenotype associated with these <italic>smc4</italic> mutations after sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Despite affecting residues highly conserved in ABC-type ATPases, most of the haploid mutants we generated were viable and showed normal growth at 23 °C. Only 18 out of the 51 mutants gave rise to tetrads with a 2:2 lethality phenotype cosegregating with <italic>smc4</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g002">Fig 2</xref>). As expected, we isolated fully inactivating and/or lethal mutations in all the conserved motifs analyzed, except for the C-helix and R-loop (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref> for viable mutants). Much to our surprise, motifs proposed to be directly involved in ATP hydrolysis, such as the A-, R-, and Q-loops, could accommodate severe changes without strong effects. This tolerance was exemplified by Gln302 in the Q-loop, a position that tolerated mutation to negatively charged amino acids without detectable growth phenotype (i.e., <italic>smc4-Q302E/D</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Likewise, introducing uncharged amino acids (Ala or Met) at the position of the critical arginine in the R-loop did not give rise to noticeable phenotypes. Only the charge-reversal substitution of Arg to Asp at position 210 in the R-loop resulted in a mild growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This tolerance to mutation was in contrast to many other positions whose mutation gave rise to more consequential effects of viability. For instance, the position encoding Gly1396 at the extreme C-terminus of Smc4 was very sensitive to changes in amino acid (see lethality of <italic>smc4-G1396P/Q</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Interestingly, this conserved position is unique to Smc4 and bacterial homologs of SMC proteins, and our result revealed the critical importance of this position for cell viability. Together, these results substantially expanded the known repertoire of structural motifs important for Smc4 ATPase activity and viability in budding yeast.</p>

<p>Next, we conducted a thorough analysis of the phenotype of viable mutants in our collection. First, we characterized the proliferative potential of viable Smc4 ATPase alleles using a 5-fold dilution series assay and monitored the ability of yeast to grow under progressively more challenging/suboptimal temperatures. From this collection of ATPase mutants, we identified 9 strains that showed thermosensitive growth behavior consistent with varying degrees of Smc4 inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). When compared to a known conditional allele, <italic>smc4-22</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref037">37</xref>], 3 ATPase mutants appeared to be acutely defective in Smc4 catalytic activity, as they showed severe proliferation defects even at optimal growth temperature (<italic>smc4-L1335G; smc4-L1333A-L1335A</italic> and <italic>smc4-Q1377A-F1378A</italic>). Several other mutants showed defects only at high temperature (37 °C), including strong (<italic>smc4-L1333I-L1335A</italic>; <italic>smc4-L1333V-L1335A</italic> and <italic>smc4-A1376S-Q1377A</italic>), intermediate (<italic>smc4-L1335A</italic> and <italic>smc4-Q1377A</italic>), and mild defects (most mutations affecting Smc4 R210 residue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We noticed that some mutants exhibited stronger proliferation defects after spore germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g002">Fig 2</xref>) when compared to normal vegetative growth conditions (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., <italic>smc4-Q302E</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This likely reflects the fact that germination and normal vegetative growth are physiologically different states in yeast, and germination has unique genetic requirements relative to normal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref038">38</xref>]. Among the viable mutants, we were unable to identify clear hypomorphic alleles affecting the Pro-loop and D-loop, despite the fact that these motifs are known to be important for ABC transporter and SMC protein functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref039">39</xref>]. Interestingly, all the thermosensitive mutations that showed intermediate or strong phenotypes are located in the C-terminal globular domain, in proximity to Leu1335 or Gln1377, key residues in the H-loop and C-helix motifs. A number of mutants in our ATPase collection also showed cold-sensitive growth at 18 °C, including <italic>smc4-Q302E</italic>, <italic>smc4-A1376S-Q1377A</italic>, and <italic>smc4-N1386D</italic>, but these phenotypes were relatively mild. Surprisingly, we found alleles that were cold-resistant, including all those containing mutations affecting the Pro-loop, as well as others scattered in various ABC motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Taken together, this structure-guided collection of mutations in the H-loop and C-helix motifs of Smc4 created many conditional alleles consistent with mutational hotspot regions in the protein. We then used this allelic series to explore the role of Smc4 ATPase activity in vivo.</p>

<title>Conditional inactivation of Smc4 ATPase domain impairs chromosome condensation</title>
<p>What is the contribution of Smc4 ATPase activity to chromosome condensation? Previous studies have shown that full inactivation of condensin ATPase activity is incompatible with cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref018">18</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether the lethality associated with these mutations is a consequence of chromosome condensation defects or defects affecting other essential processes carried out by condensin. To address this issue, we took advantage of the fact that thermosensitive alleles of condensin can be inactivated specifically in mitosis, allowing one to delineate the effect of Smc4 ATPase mutations on chromosome condensation without interference from other processes. To achieve this, we monitored the ability of conditional ATPase mutants (<italic>smc4-R210D</italic>; <italic>smc4-L1335A</italic>; <italic>smc4-L1333I-L1335A</italic>; <italic>smc4-L1333V-L1335A</italic>; <italic>smc4-Q1377A</italic>; and <italic>smc4-A1376S-Q1377A</italic>) to condense the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus in a nocodazole-induced early-mitotic arrest using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The phenotype of these cells was compared to that of wild-type <italic>SMC4</italic> and cells carrying <italic>smc4-7A</italic> and <italic>smc4-22</italic>, moderate and strong mutants of condensin, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref037">37</xref>]. The analysis of rDNA morphology by FISH is a sensitive approach to monitor chromosome condensation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, since the conformation of this locus changes dramatically during the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref040">40</xref>]. While wild-type <italic>SMC4</italic> cells synchronized in metaphase could condense DNA efficiently, as shown by the typical condensed “loop” configuration of the rDNA locus at 37 °C, <italic>smc4-22</italic> and <italic>smc4-7A</italic> presented uncondensed “puff” rDNA signal at restrictive temperature, as expected. With respect to the ATPase mutants, we observed condensation defects in all mutants except for the <italic>smc4-R210D</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). The condensation-defective alleles can be classified into mild (<italic>smc4-L1335A</italic> and <italic>smc4-Q1377A</italic>) and moderate mutants (<italic>smc4-L1333I-L1335A</italic>; <italic>smc4-L1333V-L1335A</italic> and <italic>smc4-A1376S-Q1377A</italic>) according to the fraction of cells that exhibited uncondensed “puff” rDNA morphology (i.e., less or more than a threshold of 50% uncondensed rDNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s008">S1 Table</xref>). However, none of the Smc4 ATPase alleles were as defective in rDNA loop formation as <italic>smc4-22</italic> (i.e., 75.7% “puff” phenotype), which was expected because their proliferation defect was weaker than <italic>smc4-22</italic> at nonpermissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These results, together with the cell proliferation assay, highlight the existence of a clear correlation between the severity of the thermosensitive phenotype and the condensation defects in <italic>smc4</italic> ATPase mutants.</p>

<p>To investigate the biological relevance and contribution of the ATPase activity of condensin to genome stability, we conducted experiments to assess chromosome segregation fidelity in <italic>smc4</italic> mutants. We took advantage of a nonessential chromosome that carries a dominant suppressor (<italic>SUP11</italic>) as an assay to monitor chromosome loss during cell division. Specifically, cells that efficiently segregate this chromosome during mitosis maintain a white colony color due to the suppression of the <italic>ade2-1</italic> allele in the strain background, whereas cells that lose the chromosome generate red pigments/sectors in yeast colonies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref041">41</xref>] (see inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). As expected, many of the ATPase-deficient strains of <italic>smc4</italic> showed significant increases in red sector formation/chromosome loss during cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). In particular, mutants that showed the strongest defects in chromosome condensation—such as <italic>smc4-L1333I-L1335A</italic>, <italic>smc4-L1333V-L1335A</italic>, and <italic>smc4-A1376S-Q1377A</italic>—were also the most defective in the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis. These results demonstrated that the ultimate biological consequence associated with the impairment of condensin ATPase activity is an inability to effectively segregate chromosomes during cell division.</p>
<p>Since condensin complex formation is essential for viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref042">42</xref>], we wished to investigate whether the defects we observed in cells expressing ATPase mutants of Smc4 were caused by a loss of ATPase activity per se or were a reflection of indirect effects on protein stability and/or complex formation in vivo. Purification of the ATPase mutants of Smc4 showed that they assemble with all other subunits of the enzyme into condensin holocomplexes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s004">S4 Fig</xref> below). In contrast, immunoblot analysis revealed that many of the <italic>smc4</italic> ATPase alleles exhibited reduced protein levels compared to wild-type Smc4 when cells were shifted from 23 °C to 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). This result prompted us to assess whether Smc4 levels might underpin the chromosome condensation defect of condensin ATPase mutants. To address this issue, we down-regulated wild-type Smc4 abundance using an auxin inducible degron (AID) allele (i.e., Smc4-AID) and monitored chromosome condensation in those cells. When Smc4 levels were reduced to the same extent as that of the most severe ATPase mutants we created, we did not detect any defect in chromosome condensation (i.e., no increase in the rDNA “puff” phenotype; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the condensation defect observed in ATPase mutants is not the sole consequence of reduced Smc4 protein levels at restrictive temperature and instead reflects an additional loss of function in ATPase activity. These results are consistent with the previous observation that cells express an excess of Smc4 protein under normal conditions and that reduction of Smc4 levels to under 10% wild-type levels does not affect cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref037">37</xref>]. Finally, we investigated if the localization of ATPase mutants of condensin was altered in cells. Analysis of Smc4 signals on chromatin spreads revealed that all but one ATPase mutant of Smc4 were properly localized on yeast chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Specifically, only the Smc4-L1335A mutant appeared to be present at lower levels on chromatin spread relative to wild-type Smc4. Taken together, these results indicated that the phenotype of ATPase-defective mutants of Smc4 was not a consequence of condensin mislocalization in vivo.</p>

<title>Severe inactivation of Smc4 ATPase domain leads to a contraction of the rDNA array</title>
<p>Among the collection of Smc4 ATPase mutants we isolated, a subgroup showed very severe growth defects, even at permissive temperature, and were completely inviable at 37 °C (i.e., <italic>smc4-L1335G</italic>, <italic>smc4-L1333A-L1335A</italic>, and <italic>smc4-Q1377A-F1378A</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Analysis of rDNA morphology in these three ATPase mutants revealed an rDNA FISH signal that was significantly less intense than that of wild-type cells under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The probe we used to detect the budding yeast rDNA locus recognizes the 100–200 repeats of a 9.1 kb sequence (<italic>RDN1</italic>) carried on chromosome XII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref044">44</xref>]. Since FISH signal at this locus directly correlates with rDNA copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref045">45</xref>], one explanation for the weaker rDNA signal we detected in ATPase mutants might be that they have lost some of their rDNA repeats. Previous work has shown that condensin interacts directly with the rDNA locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref046">46</xref>] and that its activity is necessary to maintain copy number stability in the rDNA array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref045">45</xref>]. In light of this, we examined whether severe mutations in Smc4 ATPase domain led to rDNA array contraction at permissive temperature. We used quantitative PCR to assess the number of rDNA repeats in mutant strains relative to wild-type cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, the three <italic>smc4</italic> mutants with the lowest FISH signal exhibited a reduction of more than 70% in rDNA copy number when compared to wild-type cells. Consistent with this estimation, the ATPase mutants also contained more <italic>RDN1</italic> copies than a control strain that was engineered to carry approximately 25 copies of the rDNA repeat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref047">47</xref>].

These results indicate that strains expressing ATPase-defective Smc4 experience additional defects in chromosome morphology and/or stability.

<title>Phenotype of condensin mutants carrying an “ATPase-dead” mutation</title>
<p>The conditional lethal mutants identified above are viable at permissive temperature, suggesting that the encoded proteins are not completely defective in condensin ATPase activity. It is also conceivable that some enzymatic activity is retained at nonpermissive temperature or that the mutant proteins act as dominant negatives, thus hiding the true phenotype associated with complete loss of ATPase function in condensin complexes. To reveal the full phenotype associated with abrogation of condensin enzymatic activity, we expressed an “ATPase-dead” allele of <italic>SMC4</italic>, <italic>smc4-K191M</italic>, in the background of a strong temperature-sensitive mutant of the same gene (<italic>smc4-22</italic>; inviable at approximately 30–32 °C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). An analogous mutation in other SMC proteins is known to fully abrogate ATP hydrolysis in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref039">39</xref>]. The <italic>smc4-22</italic> mutant was allowed to establish chromosome condensation at permissive temperature (23 °C) and was subsequently inactivated by shifting to 30 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This experimental regimen impaired rDNA condensation after the temperature shift in the <italic>smc4-22</italic> mutant but not in cells expressing wild-type <italic>SMC4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). In contrast, expression of the ATPase-dead <italic>smc4-K191M</italic> allele in this context did not alleviate the condensation defect and inviability of the <italic>smc4-22</italic> mutant at 30 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>).

<title>Conditional mutants in the H-loop and C-helix of Smc4 specifically affect ATP hydrolysis</title>
<p>We next wished to determine whether the phenotype of the ATPase mutants that we created could be attributed to impaired ATPase activity in condensin. To achieve this, we purified condensin complexes containing wild-type Smc4, the 5 ATPase mutants showing significant condensation defects and, as a negative control, a previously described ATPase-dead mutant, Smc4-K191M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref039">39</xref>]. We used a rapid overexpression approach to purify these complexes from yeast in order to bypass low viability issues associated with the expression of ATPase-defective alleles of <italic>SMC4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref049">49</xref>]. We then assayed the ATPase activity of these complexes using a luminescence assay that monitors production of ADP upon ATP hydrolysis. In this assay, wild-type condensin hydrolyzed 1.69 mol of ATP per mol of enzyme per minute, which is very similar to the value previously reported for the holocomplex using radioactive ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref050">50</xref>]. On the other hand, the ATPase-dead control (Smc4-K191M) was severely reduced for ATPase activity (0.24 mol ATP hydrolyzed per mol of condensin per minute). When we compared ATPase motif mutants of condensin with controls, all exhibited far less ATP hydrolysis than the wild-type complex, and the more severe mutants exhibited enzymatic activity similar to that of condensin complexes containing Smc4-K191M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Interestingly, while a general correlation was observed between the extent of ATPase dysfunction and the severity of the condensation defects in H-loop mutants, no such correlation was observed with the C-helix mutants. Specifically, complexes containing Smc4-L1335A and Smc4-A1376S-Q1377A mutants showed ATPase activity comparable to that of the ATPase-dead control while maintaining cell viability (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g008">8A</xref>). One possible explanation for this result is that different mutations in the C-helix of Smc4 acted as separation-of-function alleles or, alternatively, that the C-helix mutants had a minimal threshold of ATPase activity required to maintain cell viability (whereas Smc4-K191M did not meet this threshold). It is also possible that the Smc4-K191M ATPase-dead allele gained a novel dominant activity that impaired cell viability independently of its catalytic defect per se.</p>

<p>To explore the nature of this conundrum, we used a UV cross-linking approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref019">19</xref>] to monitor the ATP-binding capacity of condensin complexes containing normal (Smc4), moderate (Smc4-Q1377A), and low (Smc4-L1335A) ATPase activity. This approach revealed that Smc2 and Smc4 bound equally well to radiolabeled ATP in wild-type condensin, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s003">S3 Fig</xref>; long exposure). In contrast, complexes containing Smc4-L1335A and Smc4-Q1377A showed a marked reduction in Smc4 nucleotide binding compared to Smc2, consistent with their reduced ATPase activity. Surprisingly, Smc2 showed a large—and somewhat paradoxical—increase in ATP retention in condensin complexes containing the ATPase-dead mutant Smc4-K191M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s003">S3 Fig</xref>; short exposure). This result suggested that the lethality of <italic>smc4-K191M</italic> allele could be due to condensin complexes being dominantly and/or constitutively locked in a deleterious conformation that traps ATP in Smc2. This interpretation would be in line with the fact that yeast carrying the <italic>smc4-L1335A</italic> allele were viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>), whereas those carrying <italic>smc4-K191M</italic> were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g002">Fig 2</xref>), despite both mutants showing comparable ATP hydrolysis defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). This result raised the possibility that the ATPase activity of condensin may impact or otherwise regulate other biochemical activities of the complex. One activity that is likely to be regulated by ATP hydrolysis is the ability of condensin to bind DNA and chromosomes. To test this possibility, we conducted fluorescence anisotropy experiments to monitor the affinity of condensin complexes for short DNA substrates. First, with respect to the control complexes, we observed that both the wild-type condensin and the ATPase-dead control (Smc4-K191M) were able to bind 60-nt single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). However, the affinity of the ATPase-dead control for short ssDNA was significantly higher (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> ≈ 76 nM) than that of the wild-type complex (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> ≈ 251 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g008">Fig 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Likewise, when we analyzed the DNA-binding capacity of condensin complexes containing our ATPase mutants, we observed that all mutant proteins were able to bind DNA effectively. Moreover, all ATPase mutants showed an affinity for DNA that was slightly higher (Smc4-L1335A, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> ≈ 193 nM; Smc4-L1333V-L1335<italic>A</italic>, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> ≈ 147 nM; Smc4-Q1377A, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> ≈ 215 nM; Smc4-A1376S-Q1377A, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> ≈ 171 nM) or much higher (Smc4-L1333I-L1335A, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> ≈ 92 nM) than that shown by wild-type condensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g008">Fig 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Since all Smc4 mutants tested could bind to DNA, we next asked whether the binding was reversible. To monitor this property, we conducted competition experiments in which condensin complexes prebound to labeled ssDNA were incubated in the presence of an excess of nonlabeled ssDNA. Under this condition, all condensin complexes were able to release prebound-labeled ssDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, condensin complexes containing the Smc4-K191M exchanged ssDNA at lower concentration than the wild-type complex, consistent with the affinity displayed in binding assays. Taken together, our biochemical analyses indicated that the mutations we introduced in the H-loop and C-helix of Smc4 decreased the rate of condensin ATP hydrolysis without compromising the ability to bind DNA tightly. Importantly, the effects we observed were not due to major changes in subunit stoichiometry in the mutant complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s004">S4C Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Condensin was first described as an ATPase required for the organization of chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref010">10</xref>]. After its discovery, it was shown that condensin ATP hydrolysis activity is essential, since mutation of key residues in canonical ATPase motifs of the SMC subunits led to cell death [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref051">51</xref>]. More recent in vitro studies have shown that condensin is necessary for both establishing and maintaining the condensation state of mitotic chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref020">20</xref>]. However, it is still unknown how the complex uses the energy released during nucleotide hydrolysis to reconfigure chromosome morphology in vivo. To understand this fundamental question, it is important to identify condensin mutants that compromise ATP hydrolysis while preserving enough activity to sustain cell viability and allow visualization of the consequences associated with impaired ATPase activity. In this study, we have generated an extensive allelic series specifically targeting Smc4 ATPase motifs to explore the role of ATP hydrolysis in condensin function. Our results show, for the first time, that it is possible to significantly reduce the ATPase activity of condensin while maintaining cell viability. Moreover, our findings reveal the existence of unique thresholds for condensin activity in the execution of its diverse functions in cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s009">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Revealing the contributions of ABC-type ATPase motifs in chromosome morphogenesis</title>
<p>SMC complexes have two defining structural characteristics, a ring-like architecture and the presence of a bipartite ATPase domain of the ABC family. In this study, we show that mutations in most of the ABC-type ATPase motifs of Smc4—with the notable exception of the R-loop and C-helix—can severely compromise budding yeast viability, thereby demonstrating their relevance to the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by condensin. Interestingly, our results also show that in spite of the highly conserved nature of the ABC-type motifs in Smc4 ATPase domain, the importance of specific conserved residues for nucleotide catalysis does not appear to be equivalent in all cases. For instance, the D-loop and its characteristic Asp1358 residue represent a good example of conservation in both structure and function. This position has been shown to form the ATP hydrolysis site in ABC transporters and also in cohesin SMC subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref052">52</xref>]. We observed that mutation of this residue in Smc4 had dramatic consequence for yeast viability. On the other hand, the conserved Arg210 in the R-loop is an example of structural but not functional conservation. This position has been implicated in the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by DNA in <italic>Pf</italic>Smc and Rad50 complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref032">32</xref>]. However, introducing multiple different residues at this position in yeast Smc4 did not significantly decrease cell viability. Since the ATPase activity of condensin is also enhanced in the presence of DNA, we envision that the stimulatory effect of DNA is mediated by a different region/motif in the protein. An alternative explanation for the lack of effect of specific mutations could be that Smc4 is structurally resilient and adaptable, thereby buffering protein activity from otherwise deleterious mutations. It is also possible that evolutionary specialization in the function and mode of action of SMC proteins leads to different specific roles for the ABC-type motifs in their cognate complexes. For instance, while <italic>Pf</italic>Smc R-loop is critical for ATPase activation in the presence of DNA (14-fold stimulation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref023">23</xref>], the stimulation of yeast condensin ATPase by DNA is more modest (4-fold stimulation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref053">53</xref>]. The fact that some ATPase motifs appear to be very resilient to mutations (e.g., the previously mentioned R-loop or the Pro-loop), whereas others are highly sensitive to mutagenesis (e.g., the Walker B or the C-motif), may reflect the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. For instance, the capacity of some ATPase motifs to tolerate mutations may indicate that they are not intimately involved in catalysis per se, but they may instead fulfill ancillary or supporting roles in catalysis (i.e., analogous to the C- and R-spines in kinase domains; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref054">54</xref>]). An unexpected group of yeast mutants identified in our allelic series are those that confer cold-resistant growth properties. This type of allele is rarely reported, partly because cellular proliferation at cold temperatures is not frequently tested, and the molecular determinants that lead to this type of phenotype are still poorly understood. It is conceivable that cold-resistant mutations give rise to faster growth kinetics by stimulating enzyme catalysis or stabilizing protein–protein interactions via hydrophobic interfaces, two processes that are negatively impacted by lower temperatures. The molecular basis of cold-resistant growth in condensin mutants remains to be determined.</p>
<p>The main goal of our structure-guided genetic analysis was to investigate for the first time the relative importance and contribution of ABC-type ATPase motifs to the mode-of-action and cellular functions of condensin. Importantly, our study identified 5 new residues in Smc4 ATPase head domain that play important roles in the establishment of chromosome morphology. These residues are located in 2 motifs of the SMC ATPase domain that have been poorly studied and show a remarkable resilience to mutation, namely the C-helix (Leu1333 and Leu1335) and H-loop (Ala1376, Gln1377 and Phe1378). With respect to the C-helix, we observed a correlation between the length of the hydrophobic lateral chain of Leu1333/1335 and the severity of the DNA condensation defects. When we reduced the length of the side chain at these positions, we observed an increase in severity of the phenotype. Such correlation could reflect a reduction or even loss of intramolecular interactions involving these positions, for example, by perturbing the position of the C-motif within the ATPase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref052">52</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Indeed, when we tested this notion with more dramatic changes that replaced both Leu1333 and Leu1335 for Ala, the resulting mutant was extremely sick and contracted its rDNA array. Likewise, mutations in the H-loop—in particular, at the positions encoding Gln1377 and its adjacent residues—also had major consequences for mitotic chromosome organization. Again, we observed a positive correlation between thermosensitive phenotypes associated with these alleles and the degree to which they affected chromosome condensation. In this case, the phenotypes are more severe when the typical polarity of this region is removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). In both C-helix and H-loop, alanine mutations resulted in a contraction of the rDNA array and extremely sick mutants. Importantly, in vitro characterization of the purified condensin complexes carrying these mutations confirmed that their condensation defects are associated with decreased ATPase activity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while the correlation between the compaction and ATPase defects is maintained in H-loop mutants, this is not the case with C-helix mutants, since strains carrying the Smc4-L1335A mutation are less thermosensitive than stains bearing the double L1333I-L1335A mutations, and yet the latter shows higher ATPase activity than the former. This loss of correlation likely indicates that the final phenotype of C-helix mutants may be the result of changes in other properties of condensin, for example, DNA binding. In particular, when Leu1335 residue is mutated, introduction of isoleucine at 1333 seem to act as a “second-site suppressor” in biochemical terms but not in genetic terms. This reverse relationship is consistent with the proposed catalytic mechanism of SMC proteins. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the ATPase activity of SMC proteins is a multistep process that involves structural changes upon binding of ATP to the SMC ATPase heads, followed by further changes in conformation after ATP hydrolysis and ADP release from the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref009">9</xref>]. It is therefore likely that the L1333I “second-site suppressor” mutation relieved some of the structural constraints imposed by the L1335A mutation and improved ATPase activity by moving forward the enzymatic reaction past its initial stage (as observed in in vitro experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). However, the resulting enzyme might not be able to complete its catalytic cycle and may be trapped in a nonproductive conformation that would not allow effective compaction of chromatin in cells (thus explaining the more severe in vivo phenotype observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This rationale predicts that the Smc4-L1333I-L1335A mutant has gained a novel biochemical property relative to the L1335A mutant and wild-type protein. Consistent with this view, we observed that mutation of both Leu1333 and Leu1335 significantly increased the affinity of the complex for ssDNA relative to the wild-type enzyme. A similar effect was also observed in the ATPase-dead mutant Smc4-K191M, suggesting that some mutations in the ATPase head domain might lock the enzyme in a specific configuration that promotes tight binding to DNA. Persistent binding to DNA might interfere significantly with condensin function in vivo and explain why the phenotype of Smc4-K191M and Smc4-L1333I-L1335A mutants is more severe than predicted solely by their defects in ATPase activity. It is interesting to note that Smc2 binds more avidly to ATP in condensin complexes containing the Smc4-K191M mutant, consistent with condensin adopting a specific configuration incompatible with viability in cells expressing this mutant. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that the C-motif of ABC-type ATPases contributes to ATP hydrolysis by different ATPase head domains in trans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref055">55</xref>] and that loss of ATP hydrolysis in Smc4 may stabilize ATP molecules on Smc2 and result ultimately in the stabilization of a specific configuration of the ATPase head domains of Smc2 and Smc4 in condensin. The ATP-binding result we obtained with condensin complexes containing the Smc4-K191M mutant may appear surprising at first glance because a similar mutation in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> SMC resulted in complete abrogation of ATP binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref019">19</xref>]. However, bacterial SMC complexes are homodimeric, and mutations that prevent ATP binding on one SMC subunit will have similar effects on the other subunit. This will not be the case for SMC subunits of eukaryotic condensins, because they are heterodimeric, and it is conceivable, if not likely, that ATPase mutations in one SMC subunit could stabilize an ATP molecule on the other SMC member of the complex. Further structural work will be necessary to address this possibility and the nature of its functional consequences on condensin activity.</p>

<title>Condensin ATP hydrolysis represents a limiting factor in mitotic chromosome organization</title>
<p>Our study reveals that cells contain an excess of condensin activity relative to the levels required for normal chromosome condensation during mitosis. In fact, protein down-regulation experiments show that Smc4 protein levels—and by extension, total condensin activity in cells—can be artificially reduced by more than 90%, and neither rDNA condensation nor viability is affected if the ATPase activity of the complex remains unperturbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref037">37</xref>]. This result is consistent with previous observations that cohesin activity can be reduced significantly without impairing its sister-chromatid cohesion activity in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref056">56</xref>]. Likewise, a recent study taking advantage of a rapid-degradation allele of <italic>SMC2</italic> has shown that metazoan condensins can be depleted to approximately 5% wild-type levels without major disruption of chromatin compaction in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref057">57</xref>]. It thus appears the notion that condensin ATPase activity is in excess in relationship to many of its cellular functions holds true over large evolutionary distances in eukaryotes (at least under optimal growth conditions). However, when condensin ATPase activity is fully compromised, chromosome condensation becomes completely defective in mitosis, and cells die, thus revealing different minimal thresholds of ATP activity required to execute different cellular functions. Comparative analysis of ATP hydrolysis rate in ATP-dead mutants (<italic>smc4-K191M</italic>) and other condensin ATPase mutants provides crucial insight into the contribution of ATP hydrolysis to the process of chromosome condensation. Indeed, mutation of the key lysine in the P-loop/Walker A motif is known to impair ATP binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref019">19</xref>], which explains the inviability of cells expressing this mutant. However, 2 of the mutants generated in this study (<italic>smc4-L1335A</italic> and <italic>smc4-A1377S-Q1378A</italic>) show an ATP hydrolysis rate similar to the ATPase-dead allele and yet are capable of sustaining cell viability. This suggests that the <italic>smc4-K191M</italic> mutant leads to a dominant (or semidominant) condensation defect because this specific mutation traps the enzyme in a deleterious configuration during the process of ATP hydrolysis. This hypothesis is consistent with the lethality we observed for transition state mutants like <italic>smc4-E1352D/Q</italic>, which is known to prevent disengagement of the head–head interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref058">58</xref>]. These observations do not mean, however, that all constitutive lethal mutations that we identified in <italic>SMC4</italic> act in a dominant manner, since it appears likely that many mutants will be inviable as a result of a recessive defect in chromosome condensation and/or segregation. Beyond these mechanistic considerations, our observation that condensin ATP hydrolysis rate can be reduced significantly while maintaining viability suggests a model in which cells require minimal condensin ATPase activity to compact chromosomes under normal circumstances, independently of the total number of condensin molecules.</p>
<p>In closing, we note that the results of our study may have a number of implications for cancer treatment. Interrogation of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref059">59</xref>] revealed that partial deletions of the ATPase domain of human Smc4 have been observed in a number of cancer patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). We have introduced 1 cancer-specific deletion mutation at the homologous position of <italic>SMC4</italic> (i.e., <italic>Arg1384*</italic>) in diploid yeast and showed that this leads to lethality after sporulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). A more modest deletion of the C-terminus of yeast Smc4 (i.e., <italic>Lys1410*</italic>; similar to a truncation made in <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</italic> SMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref060">60</xref>]) did lead to a viable but sick yeast strain, suggesting that a partial loss of sequence at the C-terminal ATPase domain is possible and functionally impairs condensin activity. The COSMIC database also revealed that human <italic>SMC4</italic> is frequently overexpressed in cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). This, together with our observation that normal cells express an excess of condensin activity (relative to their normal need for chromosome condensation), suggests that targeting condensin with inhibitors of its ATPase activity might be an effective therapeutic approach to kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. Moreover, many cancer cells suffer from severe aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref061">61</xref>], a condition that we predict would impose an additional burden on the chromosome condensation machinery. In light of this, we propose that moderate inhibition of condensin ATPase activity might selectively kill aneuploid cells without affecting normal cells, thus providing a unique therapeutic window to target cancer cells. Consistent with this notion, it has been recently shown that Smc4 protein levels correlate with an aggressive phenotype in tumor cells, establishing a link between condensin levels and tumor progression in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref063">63</xref>]. Assessment of condensin inhibition in a therapeutic setting will require the identification of inhibitors of the ATPase activity of this essential enzyme.</p>

<title>Smc2 shows increased nucleotide retention after UV cross-linking in condensin complexes containing Smc4 ATPase mutants.</title>
<p>(Top) The ATP-binding ability of Smc4, Smc4-K191M, Smc4-L1335A, and Smc4-Q1377A mutants were compared using equal amounts of protein. The two upper panels correspond to autoradiograms of [P<sup>32</sup>]ATP-labeled condensin subunits (long and short exposure), whereas the lower panel shows a Coomassie staining of the different condensin complexes used in this experiment. Data shown in this figure are from a representative experiment. (Bottom) The histogram on the left shows the relative ATP-binding activity of Smc4 with respect to that of Smc2 and Ycs4. Note that Smc2 and Ycs4 migrate at a similar position in SDS-PAGE and cannot be discriminated on standard gel, which is why the data is expressed relative to the combined signal of these two proteins. However, only Smc2 and Smc4 have the ability to bind ATP in the condensin complex. Error bars represent SD (<italic>n</italic> = 3 for all complexes). The histogram on the right reports the quantification of ATP bound to condensin complexes normalized for protein abundance (i.e., from the Coomassie-stained gel shown in the top panels). Error bars represent SD (<italic>n</italic> = 3 for all the complexes). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003980.s007">S1 Data</xref> for primary data. Note that the ATP-binding bands under Smc2/Ycs4 are likely to be chaperones, since they are known to bind ATP strongly, and they also associate with condensin under normal purification conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003980.ref075">75</xref>]. Their increased abundance in Smc4-Q1377A- and Smc4-K191M-containing condensin likely reflects the mutated/partially distorted configuration of these complexes.</p>

<title>Condensin mutants bind ssDNA in a reversible manner.</title>
<p>(A) DNA binding of Smc4, Smc4-K191M, and the H-loop and C-helix mutants was assessed as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003980.g008">Fig 8B</xref>.
