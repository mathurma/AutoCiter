<abstract>
<p>Differentiation of CD4+ T cells into effector or regulatory phenotypes is tightly controlled by the cytokine milieu, complex intracellular signaling networks and numerous transcriptional regulators. We combined experimental approaches and computational modeling to investigate the mechanisms controlling differentiation and plasticity of CD4+ T cells in the gut of mice. Our computational model encompasses the major intracellular pathways involved in CD4+ T cell differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17 and induced regulatory T cells (iTreg). Our modeling efforts predicted a critical role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in modulating plasticity between Th17 and iTreg cells. PPARγ regulates differentiation, activation and cytokine production, thereby controlling the induction of effector and regulatory responses, and is a promising therapeutic target for dysregulated immune responses and inflammation. Our modeling efforts predict that following PPARγ activation, Th17 cells undergo phenotype switch and become iTreg cells. This prediction was validated by results of adoptive transfer studies showing an increase of colonic iTreg and a decrease of Th17 cells in the gut mucosa of mice with colitis following pharmacological activation of PPARγ. Deletion of PPARγ in CD4+ T cells impaired mucosal iTreg and enhanced colitogenic Th17 responses in mice with CD4+ T cell-induced colitis. Thus, for the first time we provide novel molecular evidence <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrating that PPARγ in addition to regulating CD4+ T cell differentiation also plays a major role controlling Th17 and iTreg plasticity in the gut mucosa.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>CD4+ T cells can differentiate into different phenotypes depending on the cytokine milieu. Due to the complexity of this process, we have constructed a computational and mathematical model with sixty ordinary differential equations representing a CD4+ T cell differentiating into either Th1, Th2, Th17 or iTreg cells. The model includes cytokines, nuclear receptors and transcription factors that define fate and function of CD4+ T cells. Computational simulations illustrate how a proinflammatory Th17 cell can undergo reprogramming into an anti-inflammatory iTreg phenotype following PPARγ activation. This modeling-derived hypothesis has been validated with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Experimental data support the modeling-derived prediction and demonstrate that the loss of PPARγ enhances a proinflammatory response characterized by Th17 in colitis-induced mice. Moreover, pharmacological activation of PPARγ <italic>in vivo</italic> can affect the Th17/iTreg balance by upregulating FOXP3 and downregulating IL-17A and RORγt. In summary, we demonstrate that computational simulations using our CD4+ T cell model provide novel unforeseen hypotheses related to the molecular mechanisms controlling differentiation and function of CD4+ T cells. <italic>In vivo</italic> findings validated the modeling prediction that PPARγ modulates differentiation and plasticity of CD4+ T cells in mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The CD4+ T cell differentiation process activates the transcriptional and secretory cellular machinery that helps orchestrate immune modulation in infectious, allergic and immune-mediated diseases. Upon antigen presentation, naïve CD4+ T cells become activated and undergo a differentiation process controlled by the cytokine milieu in the tissue environment. For instance, interleukin-6 (IL-6) in combination with transforming growing factor β (TGF-β) trigger a naive CD4+ T cell to become a T helper 17 (Th17) cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-McGeachy1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Bettelli1">[2]</xref>. In contrast, TGF-β alone can activate regulatory pathways leading to differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into an induced regulatory CD4+ T cell (iTreg) phenotype, which in turn tightly dampens effector and inflammatory responses.</p>
<p>CD4+ T cell differentiation was once viewed as a rigid process whereby a naive cell differentiated into terminal phenotypes. However, mounting evidence supports the tissue environment-dependent plasticity of CD4+ T cell subsets and suggests the emergence of new phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Li1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Levings1">[5]</xref>. At the molecular level, plasticity is achieved by a cytokine-driven reprogramming of signaling pathways and targeted activation of master regulator transcription factors which results in gene expression changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Yang1">[6]</xref>. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) influence T cell differentiation through antigen presentation, co-stimulation and cytokine secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Hoechst1">[7]</xref>. The crosstalk between T cell phenotypes has been fully characterized in terms of classical Th1 versus Th2 differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Zhou1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Huang1">[11]</xref>. Indeed, a logical network model of CD4+ T cell differentiation process centered around Th1 versus Th2 differentiation was published by Mendoza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Mendoza1">[12]</xref>. However, this logical model did not consider the Th17 or iTreg cell subsets. In the last decade, Th17 has emerged as an extremely plastic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Yang1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Nistala1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Lee1">[15]</xref> that can acquire regulatory functions following changes in the local cytokine milieu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Lopez1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Zhou2">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, human iTreg cells become interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing Th17 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Koenen1">[20]</xref>, thereby supporting the concept that Th17 plasticity is a two-way process. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are incompletely understood.</p>
<p>Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγt) is a master regulator transcription factor required for Th17 differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Ivanov1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Manel1">[22]</xref> and it has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target to suppress Th17 responses in autoimmune diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Solt1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Huh1">[24]</xref>. Similar to RORγt, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors and members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. PPARγ is highly expressed in CD4+ T cells and it has been reported to modulate Th1 and natural Treg (nTreg) function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Clark1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Lei1">[27]</xref>, but limited information is available regarding its role in modulating the Th17 and iTreg phenotypes. The loss of PPARγ in CD4+ T cells enhanced antigen-specific proliferation and overproduction of interferon γ (IFN-γ) in response to IL-12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Hontecillas1">[28]</xref>. In addition, the deficiency of PPARγ in nTreg cells impairs their ability to prevent effector T cell-induced colitis following transfer of naïve CD4+ T cells into SCID recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Hontecillas1">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, pharmacologic activation of PPARγ prevents removal of the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors' co-repressor from the RORγt promoter in T cells, thus interfering with RORγt transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Klotz1">[29]</xref>. While previous studies shed some light on the role of PPARγ in Th17 differentiation, this is the first study to investigate the role of PPARγ in controlling Th17 to iTreg cell plasticity in the gut mucosa.</p>
<p>Computational approaches have become a powerful tool that allows concurrent multiparametric analysis of dynamic biological processes and diseases. The emerging use of systems modeling in combination with experimental immunology studies <italic>in vivo</italic> can help integrate existing knowledge and provide novel insights on rising trends and behaviors in biological processes such as CD4+ T cell differentiation and function. Of note, bioengineering studies demonstrated the predictive value of a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Karr1">[30]</xref>. These multi-mode calibrated models demonstrate an emerging strategy to answer questions about fundamental cell-based processes <italic>in silico</italic> and help focus experimental designs of animal pre-clinical and human clinical studies.</p>
<p>We combined computational modeling and mouse adoptive transfer studies to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the modulation of CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity at the intestinal mucosa of mice. Our sensitivity analyses highlighted the importance of PPARγ in the regulation of Th17 to iTreg plasticity. Indeed, <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence demonstrates that PPARγ is required for the plasticity of Th17 promoting a functional shift towards an iTreg phenotype. More specifically, PPARγ activation is associated with upregulation of FOXP3 and suppression IL-17A and RORγt expression in colonic lamina propria CD4+ T cells. Conversely, the loss of PPARγ in T cells results in colonic immunopathology driven by Th17 cells in adoptive transfer studies.</p>

<title>Mathematical modeling of intracellular cytokine pathways controlling CD4+ T cell differentiation</title>
<p>Cytokines are small molecules secreted in response to external stimuli, which are key in cell-to-cell communication. Cytokine signaling is fast and canonical, consisting of 1) binding to cytokine cell surface receptor, 2) activation of receptor-associated kinase, 3) STAT phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus and 4) activation of gene expression. In naïve CD4+ T cells cytokine signaling leads to the expression of transcription factors that upregulate gene subsets that shape cell phenotype and function. As an output of this process, differentiated cells preferentially secrete phenotype–associated cytokines, such as IL-17 produced by Th17 cells or IFNy produced by Th1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To facilitate a comprehensive representation of the dynamics associated with the major pathways activated by cytokines which control CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity, we constructed an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based computational model including cytokines, membrane receptors and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Knowledge discovery involved an iterative process that fully integrated computational modeling and <italic>in vivo</italic> experimentation in mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The CD4+ T cell differentiation model consists of 60 ODEs, 52 reactions and 93 species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The mathematical model was engineered to ensure proper modulation of intracellular pathways and cell phenotypes via external cytokines representing the cytokine milieu. The Hill Function and mass action equations were used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Goutelle1">[31]</xref>. While the Hill Coefficient allowed us to quantify the effect of a ligand binding a macromolecule through cooperative binding, mass action laws can represent dynamic equilibriums for elementary reactions, considering products as a proportion of the participating molecules in the reaction. Experimental data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s014">Table S1</xref>) was used to calibrate and adjust model parameters to ensure correct dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s015">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s016">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s004">Figure S4</xref>). A list of modeling assumptions can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s017">Table S4</xref>. Among the four possible phenotypes in this mathematical model, to induce Th17 differentiation from a naïve CD4+ T cell, external IL-6 and external TGF-β were added in combination and demonstrated upregulation of RORγt, IL-17 and STAT-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s005">Figure S5</xref>) as followed by our table of initialization fates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s018">Table S5</xref>).

<title>PPARγ plays an essential role in modulating CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity in a dose-dependent manner</title>
<p>Based on the results of the sensitivity analysis we performed computer simulations aimed to further characterize the role of PPARγ on Th cell differentiation <italic>in silico</italic>. Following induction of the computational model towards a Th17 phenotype by adding external TGF-β and external IL-6 <italic>in silico</italic>, modeling efforts predicted that increasing concentrations of PPARγ in Th17 cells led to downregulation of RORγt and IL-17 and upregulation of FOXP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), thus, displaying a phenotype switch from Th17 to iTreg. A list of computational modeling derived predictions can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s019">Table S6</xref>. To validate the results of our computational simulations, we first isolated and sorted naïve CD4+ T cells from spleens of wild-type and T cell-specific PPARγ null mice. Deletion of PPARγ via a transgenic expression of Cre under control of the <italic>CD4</italic> promoter (PPARγ<sup>fl/fl</sup>; CD4-Cre+) allowed us to use loss-of-function approaches to characterize the role of PPARγ in Th17 differentiation. Cells were polarized towards a Th17 phenotype with recombinant mouse IL-6 and TGF-β. IFNγ and IL-4 were eliminated to block Th1 and Th2 differentiation respectively with neutralizing antibodies. After 60 hours of culture, cells were treated with increasing amounts of pioglitazone (PIO), a synthetic PPARγ agonist of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of anti-diabetic drugs. Before starting pioglitazone treatment, at t = 60 h, IL-17 and RORγt expression were significantly upregulated in PPARγ null when compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Following pioglitazone treatment for 24 h., Th17 cells from wild-type mice showed increasing levels of FOXP3 and downregulation of RORγt and IL-17A with increased concentration of the exogenous PPARγ agonist in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), but this effect was not observed in PPARγ null Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting the role of PPARγ in the modulation of these molecules. The same study was repeated three times with very similar trends on these behaviors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s007">Figure S7</xref>). These results provide <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that PPARγ significantly dampens Th17 differentiation and slightly enhances FOXP3 expression. Interestingly, uncoupling between suppressed Th17 responses and enhanced iTreg cells suggests that a T cell-extrinsic mechanism (i.e., APC-derived signals) might be contributing to this Th17 plasticity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

The loss of PPARγ <italic>in silico</italic> caused upregulation of RORγt and IL-17 in Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and down-regulation of FOXP3 in iTreg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) compared to wild-type CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g003">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>).

The transfer of CD4+ T cells lacking PPARγ resulted in significantly greater accumulation of IL-17-producing Th17 cells and lower levels of FOXP3+ iTreg cells in spleen, MLN and colonic LP of recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s009">Figure S9</xref>).

<title>Pharmacological activation of PPARγ favors a switch of Th17 cells towards an iTreg phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To determine whether PPARγ activation played an essential role in converting fully differentiated Th17 cells into iTreg cells, the computational model was induced to Th17 with the addition of IL-6 and TGFβ and PPARγ was activated when the cell was a fully differentiated Th17. Results show that following induction of Th17 and subsequent PPARγ activation, IL-17, STAT-3 and RORγt were dramatically downregulated, whereas FOXP3 was upregulated, thereby demonstrating a phenotypic switch from a Th17 to an iTreg phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To ensure that parameter space scan and time-course were linked and the changes in PPARγ were being observed in a time-dependent manner, a combination of both was run, reiterating the phenotype switch with increasing concentrations of PPARγ over time observing an upregulation of FOXP3 and a downregulation of IL-17, RORγt and STAT3-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). To address this hypothesis, we sorted CD4+ CD25- CD45RB<sup>high</sup> naïve T cells from spleens of donor wild-type mice and transferred 4×10<sup>5</sup> viable cells to RAG2<sup>−/−</sup> recipients. When clinical signs of disease and colitis appeared, a subset of mice was sacrificed and spleen, MLN and colons were extracted to examine Th17 and Treg levels (baseline results). After verifying the presence of Th17 cells in colon, MLN and spleen, half of the mice were received a daily treatment of 70 mg/kg of pioglitazone given orally to activate PPARγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). During the treatment period, mice treated with pioglitazone recovered weight and their disease activity scores dropped significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s010">Figure S10</xref>) compared to mice treated with PBS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Histopathological examinations also showed that colons from recipient mice treated with pioglitazone had a significantly lower lymphocytic infiltration and crypt hyperplasia than those from non-treated recipients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s012">Figure S12</xref>). Untreated mice maintained a predominant Th17 response characterized by increased levels of CD4+ T cells expressing RORγt and IL-17A. In contrast, pioglitazone-treated mice not only recovered from colitis and its associated weight loss, but also showed a switch from a predominant Th17 into an iTreg phenotype characterized by increased expression of FOXP3 and decreased IL17-A and RORγt in CD4+ T cells of the colonic LP and MLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g005">Figure 5D and 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s013">Figure S13</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Computational models can help to synthesize and integrate existing knowledge and narrow the experimental design prior to costly <italic>in vivo</italic> experimentation. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms controlling CD4+ T cell differentiation, we first compiled and integrated existing literature knowledge and data related to the cytokines and intracellular signaling pathways involved in the differentiation of a naïve CD4+ T cell into effector and regulatory cell subsets. To determine whether the model predictions regarding novel mechanisms of immunoregulation in Th17 and Treg cells were sensitive to the model parameters we performed a sensitivity analysis of the signaling pathways controlling Th17 and iTreg phenotypes. Our simulations reproduced known CD4+ T cell differentiation behaviors for Th1, Th2, Th17 and iTreg, and predicted novel mechanisms of T cell-mediated immunoregulation. By simulating the cytokine milieu that surrounds a CD4+ T cell <italic>in silico</italic>, we dissected crucial signaling pathways and their transcriptional regulation programs involved in differentiation and plasticity of CD4+ T cells. While computational predictions carry certain uncertainty given by the topology of the network, computational modeling approaches applied to CD4+ T cell differentiation have proven useful in characterizing the importance of dual waves of expression of T-bet and sequentially acting positive feedback loops of TCR-IFNγ-STAT1-Tbet and IL-12-STAT4-Tbet signaling in Th1 differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Schulz1">[32]</xref>. A central question in T cell biology involves improving the understanding of instructive versus selective factors that regulate the differentiation process. Selective factors include competition for cytokines by competing clones of CD4+ T cells in an expanding population. For example, regulatory T cells are able to outcompete for IL-2 and deprive effector T cells of this survival signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Feinerman1">[33]</xref>. While the computational model presented herein comprehensively addresses the instructive factors (i.e., the impact of cytokine combinations on T cell phenotypes), stochastic simulations and multiscale modeling are needed to adequately model selective factors by linking molecular-level intracellular signaling sub-models and tissue-level cell-cell interaction models. Some studies have addressed selective factors by focusing on the crosstalk in molecular pathways in an expanding Th1 population using <italic>in vitro</italic> data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Klinke1">[34]</xref> but only one phenotype has been computed and with a limited scope. The study presented here is the first to comprehensively investigate at the systems level the mechanisms controlling CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity between Th17 and iTreg cells, presenting a model that computes not only one but four of the CD4+ T cell phenotypes.</p>
<p>Several distinct signals regulate CD4+ T cell activation and differentiation: a signal from the T cell receptor (TCR) interacting with MHC, a co-stimulatory signal (i.e., CD28 interacting with B7.1 or B7.2 on antigen presenting cells), and a cytokine-driven signal. Other studies have more narrowly focused on CD4+ T cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Graw1">[35]</xref>, TCR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Hong1">[36]</xref> or co-stimulatory signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Ying1">[37]</xref>. Our mathematical approach more comprehensively studies the non-cognate interactions (i.e., cytokine milieu) and instructive factors controlling CD4+ T cell differentiation. Future studies will leverage the modeling efforts described here to construct multi-scale hybrid models driven by high-performance computing strategies that integrate sub-models of intracellular signaling pathways such as the CD4+ T cell model and tissue-level models that can simulate cell-cell interactions. These integrative approaches will provide an avenue for incorporating stochasticity as well as the modulation of phenotype and function of immune cells at sites of inflammation or infection by selective and instructive factors.</p>
<p>Sensitivity analyses and computational simulations using the CD4+ T cell differentiation model predicted that the nuclear receptor PPARγ modulates the balance between Th17 and iTreg cells, by controlling both the initial differentiation from a naïve CD4+ T cell as well as plasticity between phenotypes. Activation of PPARγ <italic>in silico</italic> favored differentiation of iTreg and antagonized Th17 differentiation by down-modulating RORγt and IL-17. These findings are in line with previous reports demonstrating that the pharmacologic activation of PPARγ selectively controls Th17 differentiation in mice and humans by interfering with RORγt transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Klotz2">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, ciglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, significantly enhanced generation of iTreg cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Wohlfert1">[26]</xref> and PPARγ induced potent and stable FOXP3 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Lei1">[27]</xref> resulting in the suppression of effector CD4+ T cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Hontecillas1">[28]</xref>. Our <italic>in silico</italic> results demonstrate that the upregulation of FOXP3 and downregulation of RORγt and IL-17 in CD4+ T cells is modulated by PPARγ and behaves in a dose-dependent manner. Indeed, our <italic>in vitro</italic> results support the dose-dependent effect in the suppression of Th17, although not accompanied by a similar increase in FOXP3+ iTreg cells. However, our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings further demonstrate that pioglitazone treatment favors a switch of fully differentiated Th17 cells into an iTreg phenotype by increasing activation of PPARγ. Thus, our plasticity modeling efforts are more predictive of <italic>in vivo</italic> than <italic>in vitro</italic> behaviors of CD4+ T cells, suggesting a missing component, possibly provided by APCs in the widely utilized <italic>in vitro</italic> system. For instance, all trans retinoic acid, which <italic>in vivo</italic> is produced by APC-derived, increased and maintained FOXP3 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Lu1">[39]</xref>. Conclusively, the mechanisms by which T cell extrinsic factors modulate CD4+ T cell plasticity are yet not fully understood. Here, however, we propose PPARγ as a novel candidate for such modulation.</p>
<p>The CD4+ T cell mathematical model predicted an upregulation of RORγt and IL-17 in Th17 cells lacking PPARγ when compared to the wild-type counterparts. In complete correspondence to this modeling prediction, our <italic>in vitro</italic> results show that following Th17 differentiation, CD4+ T cells lacking PPARγ exhibit a more dramatic upregulation of RORγt and IL-17A than wild-type cells. Also, we have also observed a marginal upregulation of FOXP3 in wild-type cells. The uncoupling between the dramatic downregulation of RORγt and the more limited upregulation of FOXP3 observed <italic>in vitro</italic> could be attributed to external factors that play an important role in this process, which are not fully mechanistically understood or not included in the <italic>in vitro</italic> system used (i.e., APCs). As opposed to the <italic>in vitro</italic> results, the <italic>in vivo</italic> findings in mice with CD4+ T cell-induced colitis were more consistent with the modeling predictions. Recent studies show that changes in the cytokine environment mediate the conversion of iTreg into Th17 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Yang1">[6]</xref>. Notably, different subsets of myeloid cells in humans can orchestrate the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into either effector or regulatory phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Hoechst1">[7]</xref>. Myeloid APCs are essential for the induction of IL-17A+ FOXP3+ T cells from memory CCR6+ T cells or Treg cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Kryczek1">[40]</xref>. At the colonic mucosa, numbers and functions of IL-17-producing cells are tightly controlled by PPARγ, and its modulation of the dual roles of Th17 cells as effectors of pathogenic, tissue-damaging versus pathogen-clearing responses has been investigated in the context of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> and enteroaggregative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Viladomiu1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Philipson1">[42]</xref>. However, the mechanisms controlling CD4+ T cell plasticity at the gut mucosa remain largely unknown, including the essential and dispensable regulators of these processes.</p>
<p>Herein, we combined computational and experimental approaches to investigate for the first time the role of PPARγ in the re-programming of fully differentiated Th17 cells into an iTreg phenotype in the gut mucosa. Of note, the presence of FOXP3 RORγt double-positive cells with suppressive actions on effector CD4+ T cell subsets has been associated with the plasticity of Th17 and iTreg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Tartar1">[18]</xref>. TGF-β is a common inductor of Th17 and iTreg that can upregulate FOXP3, but in combination with IL-6, it upregulates IL-17 and dramatically downregulates FOXP3 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Bettelli1">[2]</xref>. Other cytokines, such as IL-23, modulate plasticity by restraining FOXP3+ Treg activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Morrison1">[14]</xref>. Clinically, inhibition of IL-17 promotes differentiation of stable iTreg cells in patients with autoimmune hepatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Longhi1">[43]</xref>. However, IL-17+FOXP3+ cells were identified in inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), but not in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Hovhannisyan1">[44]</xref>, the two clinical manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, in line with our sensitivity analysis and computer simulations, results of our adoptive transfer studies in mice indicate that activation of PPARγ by oral pioglitazone administration favors a switch from Th17 to iTreg in MLN and colonic LP of mice with CD4+ T cell-induced colitis, thereby demonstrating that PPARγ is implicated in the modulation of CD4+ T cell plasticity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The loss of PPARγ favored Th17 differentiation and reduced the conversion of IL-17A-producing Th17 cells into CD4+FOXP3+ T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Adoptive transfer studies using T cell-specific PPARγ null naïve T cells demonstrate that PPARγ is needed for suppressing effector responses at sites of inflammation such as the colonic LP in a mouse model of chronic colitis. Interestingly, FOXP3 inhibits Th17 by antagonizing the function of the transcription factors RORγt and RORα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Yang1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Zhou2">[19]</xref>. This suggests a potential interaction of RORγt with FOXP3 in larger transcriptional complexes, which could explain why RORγt is more rapidly down-regulated than FOXP3 is increased. More specifically, the decrease of RORγt could result from a synergism between the inhibition exerted by PPARγ and the parallel inhibition caused by FOXP3, which in turn is enhanced when PPARγ is activated. The observation that PPARγ may interact with FOXP3 and RORγt suggests a cross-talk between transcriptional programs of crucial importance to the regulation of immune responses and clinical outcomes during infectious and immune-mediated diseases.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that activation of PPARγ results in reprogramming of the CD4+ T cell molecular pathways that control the Th17 phenotype, leading to the induction of an iTreg phenotype. This phenotype switch is associated with protection from CD4+ T cell-induced colitis during adoptive transfer experiments in mice. Thus, the balance between Th17 and Treg cells helps delineate the outcome of immunological processes from effector inflammation to regulatory tolerance. Our modeling approaches allowed us to narrow the design of experiments and to better understand the molecular mechanisms of action controlling CD4+ differentiation. This new mechanistic knowledge is broadly applicable to the development of immune therapeutics for infectious, allergic and immune-mediated diseases. More specifically, we propose that PPARγ is a promising therapeutic target for chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases where Th17 cells contribute to the gut immunopathogenesis.</p>

<title>Mathematical modeling</title>
<p>To facilitate a comprehensive representation of the dynamics associated with the major non-cognate pathways controlling CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity, we constructed an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based computational model of the cytokines, receptors and transcription factors controlling CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003027-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s021">Text S1</xref>). The mathematical model was engineered to ensure proper modulation of intracellular pathways and cell phenotypes via external cytokines representing the cytokine milieu. The mathematical model constructed was based on experimental findings and illustrates intracellular pathways controlling a naïve T cell differentiation into Th1, Th2, Th17 or iTreg phenotypes. The model comprises 60 differential equations representing 52 reactions and 93 species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The COmplex PAthway SImulator software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Hoops1">[45]</xref> (COPASI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.modelingimmunity.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.modelingimmunity.org/</ext-link>) was used for model development, sensitivity analysis, and calibration. Sensitivities of the steady-state fluxes of reactions were derived with respect to the reaction rates in the system. These sensitivities were normalized and represented flux control coefficients according to Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Heinrich1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Kacser1">[47]</xref>. In this case, sensitivities were performed with respect to PPARγ pathway-controlling parameters and levels of different species were assessed. The model was calibrated to experimental data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s014">Table S1</xref>), which varied external concentration of cytokines and resulted in different phenotypes described by varying levels of transcription factors and proteins. We used the ParticleSwarm algorithm implemented in COPASI to determine unknown model parameter values and fully calibrate the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s015">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s016">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The resulting model adequately computes the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into the four phenotypes: Th1 with external IFNγ, IL-12, IL-18 and αIL-4 addition, Th2 with IL-4 and αIFNγ addition and iTreg with IL-2 and external TGFβ addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003027.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Also, to induce Th17 differentiation from a naïve CD4+ T cell, external IL-6 and external TGF-β were added in combination and demonstrated upregulation of RORγt, IL-17 and STAT-3. <italic>In silico</italic> simulation consisted of time-courses or parameter scans. Also, the combination of both was performed. In this last case, each plotted line has an incremented concentration of the parameter being scanned. Thus, differential patterns of expression of molecules, either upregulated or downregulation, over time can be observed by looking at the arrows in each molecule.

<p>Splenocytes obtained from CD4 null PPAR-γ fl/fl or C57BL/6J (wild-type) mice were enriched in CD4+ T cells by magnetic negative sorting using the I-Mag cell separation system (BD Pharmingen). Cells were incubated with a mixture of biotinylated Abs followed by a second incubation with streptavidin particles and exposed to a magnet to remove unwanted cells. The purity of the CD4+-enriched cell suspension was between 93 and 96%. CD4-enriched cells were used for adoptive transfer, or further purified by FACS. For FACS sorting, cells were labeled with CD45RB, CD4, and CD25 and separated into CD4+ CD45RB<sup>high</sup> CD25- cells (i.e., effector T cells) in a FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The purity of the FACS-sorted CD4+ subsets was ≥98%.</p>

<p>CD4+CD62L+ cells from either wild-type or T PPARγ null (CD4Cre+) mice were sorted using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec) and stimulated with plate bound anti-CD3 (5 µg/ml, BD Biosciences) under Th17 conditions with 2.5 ng/ml hTGF-β1 (R&amp;D Systems), 25 ng/ml IL-6 (Peprotech), 10 µg/ml anti-IL-4 (clone 11B11, R&amp;D Systems), and 10 µg/ml anti-IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2, R&amp;D Systems). 60 hours after activation, an aliquot was obtained to check purity and DMSO-diluted pioglitazone (PIO, Cayman Chemicals) was added to the media at 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 40 or 80 µM. Control (0 µM PIO) was treated with DMSO only. 24 hours after treatment Th17 cells were restimulated with PMA (50 ng/mL, Acros Organics) and ionomycin (500 ng/mL, Sigma) in the presence of BD GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) for 6 h, after which intracellular staining was performed. The experiment was repeated three times for consistency. Co-stimulation of with CD28 has been described to downregulate Th17 development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Ying1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003027-Bouguermouh1">[48]</xref>. We also performed optimization studies for Th17 differentiation using CD28 as a co-stimulatory signal and the addition of recombinant IL-23 in the cytokine cocktail, however, no differences were observed. Co-stimulation signaling optimization studies were run adding either 0 or 2.5 µg/mL of αCD28 in the media. No differences were found. Thus, the data presented are with αCD3 stimulation only.</p>

<title>Histopathology</title>
<p>Colonic sections were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin, later embedded in paraffin and then sectioned (5 µm) and stained with H&amp;E stain for histological examination. Colons were graded with a compounded histological score including the extent of (1) leukocyte infiltration, (2) mucosal thickening and (3) epithelial cell erosion. The sections were graded with a score of 0–4 for each of the previous categories, and data were analyzed as a normalized compounded score.</p>
