        <p>Energy parasitism by ATP/ADP transport proteins is an essential, common feature of intracellular bacteria such as chlamydiae and rickettsiae, which are major pathogens of humans. Although several ATP/ADP transport proteins have so far been characterized, some fundamental questions regarding their function remained unaddressed. In this study, we focused on the detailed biochemical analysis of a representative ATP/ADP transporter (<italic>Pam</italic>NTT1), from the amoeba symbiont <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Protochlamydia amoebophila</named-content> (UWE25) to further clarify the principle of energy exploitation. We succeeded in the purification of the first bacterial nucleotide transporter (NTT) and its functional reconstitution into artificial lipid vesicles. Reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 revealed high import velocities for ATP and an unexpected and previously unobserved stimulating effect of the luminal ADP on nucleotide import affinities. Latter preference of the nucleotide hetero-exchange is independent of the membrane potential, and therefore, <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 not only structurally but also functionally differs from the well-characterized mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers. Reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exhibits a bidirectional orientation in lipid vesicles, but interestingly, only carriers inserted with the N-terminus directed to the proteoliposomal interior are functional. The data presented here comprehensively explain the functional basis of how the intracellular <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. amoebophila</named-content> manages to exploit the energy pool of its host cell effectively by using the nucleotide transporter <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1. This membrane protein mediates a preferred import of ATP, which is additionally stimulated by a high internal (bacterial) ADP/ATP ratio, and the orientation-dependent functionality of the transporter ensures that it is not working in a mode that is detrimental to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. amoebophila</named-content>. Heterologous expression and purification of high amounts of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 provides the basis for its crystallization and detailed structure/function analyses. Furthermore, functional reconstitution of this essential chlamydial protein paves the way for high-throughput uptake studies in order to screen for specific inhibitors potentially suitable as anti-chlamydial drugs.</p>

          <p>Diverse members of the bacterial order Chlamydiales cause severe diseases in humans. Chlamydiales cannot survive and reproduce outside of host cells, due to the complete loss of several biosynthetic pathways, but rely on specialized transport systems to import the corresponding metabolites from the host. We performed a detailed biochemical analysis of a purified recombinant ATP/ADP transporter from the <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-related bacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Protochlamydia amoebophila</named-content> (<italic>Pam</italic>NTT1). Our studies revealed that <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 favours ATP import into vesicles loaded with ADP, whereas the exchange of ATP in the opposite direction is negligible. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1, in contrast to the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, is independent of a membrane potential. The identified biochemical characteristics of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 appear to be a sophisticated adaptation to the requirements of the intracellular lifestyle of <italic>P. amoebophila,</italic> serving to facilitate effective energy parasitism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Members of the bacterial orders Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales gained attention because they comprise several human pathogenic species causing severe diseases like typhus, pneumonia, trachoma, or sexually transmitted infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b002">2</xref>]. The obligate intracellular lifestyle of these bacteria depends upon the continuous import of a large number of metabolites from the host cell cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b008">8</xref>]. Consequently, both metabolism and genome size of intracellular bacteria are typically and substantially reduced compared with those of free-living bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b011">11</xref>]. For example, genome sequencing of several rickettsial and chlamydial species revealed that these bacteria show restricted nucleotide metabolism. This restriction is characterized by the inability for de novo synthesis of certain nucleotides and an impaired ability to regenerate the universal energy currency ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b013">13</xref>]. To compensate for these limitations, specific nucleotide transport proteins (NTTs) are used, mediating either net uptake of nucleotides, the import of NAD<sup>+</sup>, or the counter-exchange of ATP and ADP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b019">19</xref>]. The latter process has been termed “energy parasitism” and is considered fundamental for the survival of these metabolically impaired intracellular bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b022">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>In addition to intracellular bacteria, nucleotide transport proteins have also been found in plant chloroplasts where they import cytosolic ATP under certain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b020">20</xref>]. This limited occurrence of nucleotide transport proteins in only few, largely unrelated groups of intracellular bacteria and plant plastids suggests an unusual evolutionary history for these proteins. Indeed, phylogenetic analyses showed that nucleotide transport proteins are of ancient origin (and have evolved at least 700–1,000 million years ago), and early gene duplications and lateral transfer from rickettsiae to chlamydiae or from chlamydiae to rickettsiae and (via the cyanobacterial ancestor of chloroplasts) to plants has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b025">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>The model plant <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> possesses two isoforms of plastidic ATP/ADP transporters (<italic>At</italic>NTT1 and <italic>At</italic>NTT2). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant plants, which lack these non-mitochondrial nucleotide transporters, are retarded in plant development and exhibit a chlorotic phenotype and spontaneous necrotic lesions under short-day conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b027">27</xref>]. The physiological and morphological differences between the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant plants and the wild type were compensated by extended light conditions (long day or high light intensity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b027">27</xref>]. Furthermore, reduction of <italic>ntt</italic> transcript in potato caused remarkable effects in heterotrophic but not in autotrophic tissues (ginger shaped tubers with reduced starch contents) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b028">28</xref>]. Latter observations underline the importance of plant NTTs in photosynthetic-inactive heterotrophic plastids and in chloroplasts during periods of reduced or missing photosynthetic activity.</p>
      <p>Biochemical analyses of the recombinant <italic>At</italic>NTT1 and <italic>At</italic>NTT2 revealed that these transporters are highly specific for the substrates ATP and ADP. Site-directed mutagenesis of a lysine in a region that is conserved in several NTTs resulted in a markedly reduced capacity of <italic>At</italic>NTT1 for ATP but not for ADP import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b029">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>To fulfil the essential physiological role of energy exploitation, all bacterial ATP/ADP transport proteins have to catalyze the import of host-derived ATP in counter-exchange with endogenous ADP. However, one key question that has not been satisfactorily explained yet is how the required net uptake of energy into intracellular living bacteria is maintained while external ATP and ADP might compete at the binding site. This problem is even more puzzling given that all bacterial ATP/ADP transporters characterized (by heterologous expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content>) so far exhibit nearly similar apparent affinities and transport velocities for ATP and ADP (an overview is given in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b018">18</xref>]). Thus, in theory, ATP/ADP transporters could also export bacterial ATP if the infected host cell exhibits a reduced energy state.</p>
      <p>Adenine nucleotide exchange across the mitochondrial membrane is mediated by specific ADP/ATP carriers (AACs). Latter, well-characterized proteins are phylogenetically, structurally, and physiologically completely different from bacterial (and also plastidic) NTTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b033">33</xref>]. Whereas most NTTs catalyze ATP import into the bacterial cell (or into the organelle), AACs mediate export of ATP synthesized in the mitochondrion to provide cellular metabolism with energy. In this respect, a very interesting feature of mitochondrial AACs is the regulatory influence of the membrane potential on nucleotide exchange, which was analyzed in detail by the help of artificial lipid vesicles containing the purified AAC from beef heart mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b034">34</xref>]. In the absence of a membrane potential (in “de-energized” mitochondria), ADP and ATP transport rates are nearly similar, whereas generation of a membrane potential (in “energized” mitochondria) stimulates ADP import in exchange with ATP. Whether bacterial nucleotide exchange is regulated by a similar mechanism is an interesting and still open question.</p>
      <p>Physiological studies on native bacterial ATP/ADP transporters were hampered by the need to isolate intracellular living bacteria from eukaryotic host cells, and all attempts to cultivate metabolically stable cells outside the host failed. Because existing paralogs and possible contamination by mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers have to be taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b035">35</xref>], and because purification of the native protein is still impossible, most NTTs characterized so far were analyzed by heterologous expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b037">37</xref>]. However, to determine the catalytic activity of a single isoform (rather than of a mixture of carriers present in a native bacterial membrane), to study the detailed effect of a counter-exchange substrate required to drive an antiport process, and to examine the biochemistry of a carrier uncoupled from metabolic fluxes in the living bacterial cell, it is necessary to incorporate the purified protein into artificial lipid vesicles. In the current study, we established the purification procedure of the heterologously expressed ATP/ADP transporter NTT1 from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. amoebophila</named-content> (<italic>Pam</italic>NTT1), a chlamydial endosymbiont of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Acanthamoeba</named-content> sp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b038">38</xref>]. This protein is an excellent and interesting candidate for further biochemical analyses, because (i) it is structurally and functionally similar and phylogenetically related to ATP/ADP transport proteins from important human pathogenic chlamydial species, (ii) it is involved in energy exploitation, and (iii) it is a recombinantly synthesized protein that is functionally inserted into the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> membrane at high amounts.</p>
      <p>The purification of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 provided the basis for the functional integration into liposomes. To further clarify the mechanism of energy exploitation, special focus was laid on uptake kinetics of the reconstituted protein in the presence of internally applied ATP and ADP and also a possible influence of the membrane potential on nucleotide exchange was analyzed. Our results demonstrate that reconstitution of the purified transporter <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 represents a highly sophisticated tool to gain new and detailed insights into biochemical characteristics and into orientation–function relationships of this transport protein.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the data revealed an unexpected influence of the type of loaded substrate (present at the liposomal interior) on nucleotide import. In general, ATP import (ATP<sub>im</sub>) in exchange with internal ADP (ADP<sub>ex</sub>) (ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub>) was about two times faster than ATP import into ATP-loaded vesicles (ATP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub>), and ADP homo-exchange (ADP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub>) was about ten times faster than ADP import in counter-exchange with ATP (ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> was rapid and nearly equilibrated at 30 min (at about 2,000 nmol/mg protein). Compared with the ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> hetero-exchange, ATP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> homo-exchange was slower, and the rate declined progressively until 20–30 min, when no further substantial accumulation of radioactivity was detectable (at about 700 nmol/mg protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1-mediated ADP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> homo-exchange was slower than ATP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> homo-exchange and obviously approached equilibration after about 30 min. Remarkably, ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> hetero-exchange was only slightly stimulated when compared with the corresponding control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> was equilibrated at about 20 min (at only 60 nmol/mg protein) and appeared (in the linear phase of uptake) at least 20 times slower than in the reciprocal transport mode (ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>To further characterize the function of substrates present at the liposomal interior on nucleotide import, additional uptake studies were performed at different luminal ADP/ATP ratios (10 mM final nucleotide concentration; nucleotide import into ATP-loaded liposomes was set to 1). Increasing ADP/ATP ratios in the proteoliposomes resulted in higher ATP uptake rates with a 2.34-times increase for the exclusive presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t001">Table 1</xref>). As described above, the nature of the luminal adenine nucleotide exhibited an even more noticeable effect on the relative ADP import affinities. Accordingly, a substantial increase of the ADP uptake rate becomes obvious in dependence on rising luminal ADP/ATP ratios, sole luminal ADP led to a 12-times increased <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1-mediated ADP uptake (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>To analyze whether the lack of the favoured counter exchange substrate ADP or the presence of ATP at the proteoliposomal interior caused the lowered nucleotide import capacity, the accumulation of radioactivity into liposomes loaded with different concentrations of ADP in the absence of any additional nucleotide (ADP-NTP) or in the presence of the nonsubstrate GTP (ADP+GTP) was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The resulting data were normalized to the import into liposomes loaded with 10 mM ADP (=100%). In general, both loading conditions (ADP-NTP and ADP+GTP) led to nearly comparable uptake rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Decrease of the internal ADP concentration to about 5 mM caused no significant reduction of nucleotide uptake into ADP-NTP– and ADP+GTP–loaded liposomes when compared to the corresponding import into proteoliposomes loaded with 10 mM ADP (100%). However, at an interior concentration of 2.5 mM ADP, a slight reduction of the nucleotide-import capacity of ADP-NTP– and ADP+GTP–loaded proteoliposomes was observed, probably caused by the limitation of counter-exchange substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Mixed ADP+ATP–loaded liposomes led to lower uptake rates when compared with the corresponding import into solely ADP- or ADP+GTP–loaded vesicles, and decreasing internal ADP/ATP ratios reduced ADP uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) to a higher extent than did ATP uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Because sole presence of GTP at the proteoliposomal interior caused slight nucleotide uptake, we assume that either GTP contains minor contaminations with adenine nucleotides or that very high concentrations of GTP may also function as substrate of the <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1.</p>

        <p>Our results demonstrate that reduction of import into the differently ADP+ATP–loaded liposomes is rather caused by the presence of the additional export substrate ATP than by a limitation of the counter-exchange substrate ADP.</p>
        <p>In most previous experiments, substrates were internally applied at high concentrations (2.5 to 10 mM), and the externally nucleotides were present at significantly lower concentrations (50- to 200-fold), which results in a nucleotide gradient across the liposomal membrane. To analyze whether this gradient causes the observed preference of ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> exchange and the low rates of the ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> transport, we analyzed nucleotide uptake into liposomes in the presence of a low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">4</xref>B), and in the absence of a nucleotide gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">4</xref>D). In general, nucleotide transport was slower and equilibrium was reached faster in proteoliposomes with a reduced nucleotide gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">Figure 4</xref>) when compared with uptake measurements under saturating interior nucleotide concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This is due to limiting counter-exchange substrate concentrations at the proteoliposomal interior. For example, 100 μM ATP<sub>im</sub>/1 mM ADP<sub>ex</sub> transport was equilibrated after 20 to 30 min at about 300 nmol/mg protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), and 50 μM ATP<sub>im</sub>/50 μM ADP<sub>ex</sub> transport was equilibrated after 15 min at about 80 nmol/mg protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). In the linear time phase, <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exhibited about 1.5 times higher transport rates for ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub>, when compared with the ATP homo-exchange, and ADP homo-exchange is at least two times higher than the ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">4</xref>).

        <title><italic>Pam</italic>NTT1-Mediated Nucleotide Exchange Is Independent of the Membrane Potential</title>
        <p>It is well known that transport characteristics of mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers are regulated by the membrane potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b034">34</xref>]. To analyze whether the potassium gradient in the applied system causes the observed preferred ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> transport, we determined transport activity of reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 in the presence of different potassium concentrations at the liposomal interior or exterior.

        <p>We also compared the exchange rates of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 and of mitochondrial AAC from yeast in the absence and the presence of a membrane potential. To minimize a possible leakage of potassium across the proteoliposomal membrane, which would result in the generation of a membrane potential, the same buffer media were applied at the interior and exterior side of the proteoliposome (30 mM potassium gluconate, 100 mM tricine, pH 7.5). Hetero- and homo-exchange of ATP and ADP in the absence of a potassium gradient were measured and set to 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g005">Figure 5</xref>). A membrane potential was generated by the application of the ionophore valinomycin. The direction and extent of the potential depends on the difference in the potassium concentrations at the interior and exterior side of the membrane. For the liposomes applied in this study, an external positive (theoretical) membrane potential of about +40 mV (30 mM K<sup>+</sup> external/150 mM K<sup>+</sup> internal: potassium efflux) and an external (theoretical) negative membrane potential of −40 mV (150 mM K<sup>+</sup> external/30 mM K<sup>+</sup> internal: potassium influx) were calculated, respectively. Transport measurements revealed that neither a positive nor a negative membrane potential substantially influenced nucleotide exchange of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1, which was purified and reconstituted in presence of DDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g005">Figure 5</xref>) or Triton (Triton-X-100) (unpublished data). However, mitochondrial AAC-mediated ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> transport was stimulated (to about 160%) by an external positive membrane potential, and ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> exchange was stimulated (to about 190%) by an external negative membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

        <title>Affinities, but Not Maximal Velocities of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1, Are Considerably Influenced by the Type of Counter-Exchange Nucleotide</title>
        <p>To analyze in more detail the effect of the export substrate ADP on <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1-mediated nucleotide import, we determined the kinetic parameters of this protein in ATP-, mixed (ATP+ADP)–, or ADP- (10 mM) loaded proteoliposomes. Rising concentrations of exogenously supplied ATP led to increased rates of nucleotide uptake, reaching saturation at about 23,000 nmol (mg protein)<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> in the differently loaded proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">Table 2</xref>). In presence of varied internal ADP/ATP ratios, the maximal transport velocities for ADP uptake (of about 6,000 to 8,000 nmol (mg protein)<sup> −1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) resembled the maximal velocities of the import into solely ADP- or ATP-loaded liposomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, estimation of the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) values showed that <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exhibited different substrate affinities depending on the type of counter-exchange nucleotide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">Table 2</xref>). At a substrate concentration of 17 μM, <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exhibited a half-maximal velocity of ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub>, whereas a six-times-higher ATP concentration was required when solely ATP was internally present. Furthermore, the affinity of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 for external ADP was at least ten times higher in the homo-exchange mode of transport (ADP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub>) when compared with the hetero-exchange mode (ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub>) (≥918 μM). Approximately equivalent <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values were estimated for the ADP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> and ATP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> homo-exchange mode of transport (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">Table 2</xref>). Analyses of kinetic parameters of ATP or ADP import into mixed (ATP+ADP)–loaded liposomes revealed intermediate affinities when compared with solely ADP- or ATP- loaded liposomes. Decreasing internal ATP/ADP ratios led to overall enhanced affinities of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 for nucleotide import. The determination of kinetic parameters for ADP uptake was problematic in the presence of high internal ATP concentrations, and the resulting <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values are therefore possibly underestimated. Taken together, these data demonstrate that <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 imports ATP at highest maximal velocity (<italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>) independent of the loaded nucleotide and at highest affinity only if ADP, but not ATP, is present at the proteoliposomal interior.</p>

        <title>Is the ATP Import Defying all Competition?</title>
        <p>Because of the high affinity and maximal velocity, the ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> seems to be the favoured exchange.

The presence of 50 μM ATP (1/3 of the exterior ADP concentration) led to a significant inhibition of the 150 μM [α<sup>32</sup>P] ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> to about 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) and of the 150 μM [α<sup>32</sup>P] ADP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> to about 66% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>B) when compared to the corresponding nonaffected ADP import.

Although the inhibition pattern of nonlabelled ADP on [α<sup>32</sup>P] ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>C) resembles the influence of nonlabelled ATP on [α<sup>32</sup>P] ADP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>B) the rate of ADP import-inhibition by competing ATP is generally higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">6</xref>C).

Therefore, it is not surprising that ATP can most effectively compete with ADP for import into ATP-loaded liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) and that a 20-fold excess of ADP caused only a slight reduction (to about 75%) of the second-best [α<sup>32</sup>P] ATP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). These data demonstrate that in accordance with the determined kinetic parameters, lowest concentrations of ATP (1/3 of the ADP concentration) are sufficient to effectively displace the import substrate ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) and that high concentrations of ADP are unable to significantly suppress [α<sup>32</sup>P] ATP import in counter-exchange with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>D).</p>

        <title><italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 Exhibits a Bidirectional Orientation in Proteoliposomes Independent of the Luminal Counter-Exchange Substrate</title>
        <p>The foregoing data demonstrate that <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 imports ATP with the highest velocity and exhibits the highest nucleotide ATP import affinity when ADP is present at the proteoliposomal interior. In contrast, <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exhibits a low import velocity and a very low import affinity when ADP is present at the exterior and ATP at the opposite side. At first glance, this effect is hard to understand if <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 is inserted in a bidirectional (nearly 1:1) orientation into the liposome. To examine whether the presence of either ATP or ADP during preparation of proteoliposomes might affect the insertion of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 into the vesicle, we analyzed the efficiency of reconstitution and the orientation of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 in differently loaded liposomes by protease treatment, SDS-PAGE, and immunostaining.</p>

        <p>To ascertain the orientation of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 in the vesicles, unloaded or ADP- or ATP-loaded proteoliposomes were incubated with factor Xa. Proteolysis of the recombinant <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 by factor Xa resulted in the removal of a 2.4-kDa peptide containing the His tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g007">Figure 7</xref>). After factor Xa treatment, the ratio of uncut to cut protein is comparable in the differently loaded liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g007">Figure 7</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g007">7</xref>C; lanes 2, 5, 8). Proteolysis of reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 was only partial even over prolonged incubation (unpublished data). However, destruction of the proteoliposomal integrity by the application of a high detergent concentration (2% DDM) resulted in an almost complete cleavage of the N-terminal His tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g007">Figure 7</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g007">7</xref>C; lanes 3, 6, 9).</p>
        <p>Thus, a (by eye) estimated amount of about 50% of the reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 protein was not accessible to factor Xa and therefore obviously exhibited an orientation with the His tag directed to the lumen of the proteoliposome.

        <p>The preferred ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> transport and the marginal transport rates of the opposite exchange (ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub>) seem to argue against a bidirectional (nearly 1:1) orientation of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 in proteoliposomes.

        <p>To gain additional insights into orientation/function relationships of the reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1, we analyzed the influence of endoprotease Asp-N treatment on the transport rate of the reconstituted transport protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g009">9</xref>).

Although, the amino acid sequence of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exhibits 16 potential cleavage sites located in different hydrophilic regions of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g010">Figure 10</xref>), a fraction of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 obviously persisted protease treatment for at least 16 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g008">Figure 8</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g008">8</xref>C). To clarify whether the Asp-N–protected or the cleaved portion of reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 corresponds to the functional protein, we determined the import capacity of protease treated ADP-loaded (and unloaded) proteoliposomes by transport measurements. Interestingly, no decrease of ATP transport was observed after 2 h of proteolysis, and even an extended incubation with Asp-N resulted only in a slight reduction of ATP uptake (maximal 7%) when compared with the control (ATP import into untreated proteoliposomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g008">Figure 8</xref>D). An accumulation of radioactively labelled ATP caused by a possible leakage of the liposomes due to protease treatment was ruled out, because Asp-N–treated as well as untreated unloaded proteoliposomes exhibited comparable, low background values (less than 8 % of ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub>). This analysis demonstrates that only a minor fraction of totally reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 mediates nucleotide transport and that this functional protein is protected against Asp-N digestion.</p>

        <p>Consequently, it was necessary to determine the orientation of the Asp-N–protected, functional <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 proteins in liposomes. Therefore, we subsequently incubated reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 with the endoproteases factor Xa and Asp-N, and we analyzed proteolysis of the carrier protein by SDS-PAGE and immunostaining. Treatment of the proteoliposomes with factor Xa allowed us to distinguish between the two orientations of the protein, and the subsequent use of Asp-N protease resulted in the identification of the functional protein. Thus, this approach is suitable to determine the orientation of the functional fraction of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1.</p>
        <p><italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 extended by the His tag exhibited a single band at about 47.5 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g009">Figure 9</xref>; lane 1). In the presence of a high detergent concentration, both proteases completely digested <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g009">Figure 9</xref>; lanes 2–4). Incubation of intact proteoliposomes with factor Xa resulted in the cleavage of the N terminus in about 50% of the reconstituted protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g009">Figure 9</xref>; lane 5). Factor Xa–treated liposomes were subsequently digested with protease Asp-N for 2 and 4 h, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g009">Figure 9</xref>; lanes 6 and7). The resulting single band was still detectable by the His tag–specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g009">Figure 9</xref>C; lanes 6 and 7); it exhibited a molecular weight of about 47.5 kDa and therefore corresponds to the undigested <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1, whereas the truncated <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 (lacking the His tag) was completely fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g009">Figure 9</xref>B; lanes 6 and 7). These experiments demonstrate that the functional portion of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 is Asp-N resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, the insensitivity of functional <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 towards factor Xa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g009">Figure 9</xref>) implies that the N terminus of this fraction is directed into the proteoliposomal lumen.</p>

      <p>Chlamydial symbionts of free-living amoebae, such as <italic>P. amoebophila,</italic> exhibit remarkable similarities to human pathogenic Chlamydiaceae, including <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Chlamydia trachomatis</named-content> or <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae,</italic> and thus can serve as model systems for the analysis of the interaction between intracellular bacteria and their host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b039">39</xref>]. An essential common feature of both groups, and also of the parasitic Rickettsiales, is the capacity to perform nucleotide import and energy parasitism by specialized NTTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b024">24</xref>]. In contrast to all other bacterial ATP/ADP transporters analyzed so far, the recombinant homolog from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. amoebophila</named-content> (<italic>Pam</italic>NTT1) investigated in this study meets the requirements for a detailed biochemical characterization, especially because purified <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g001">Figure 1</xref>) exhibited an extraordinarily high specific activity.</p>
      <p>The reconstituted carrier showed significant import of ATP or ADP into liposomes loaded with counter-exchange substrates (ADP or ATP), whereas transport was absent in unloaded proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">4</xref>). This provides evidence for the strict coupling of nucleotide import and export and confirms the previously described counter-exchange mode of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b018">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exhibited a favoured import of ATP in exchange with ADP and moderate transport rates for the ATP and ADP homo-exchange, the import of ADP in exchange with ATP was only slightly in excess of the background, observed in unloaded liposomes. The preference of the ATP import in counter-exchange with ADP and the low activity of the opposite hetero-exchange were independent of the detergent applied during purification and reconstitution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050231-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) and of the nucleotide gradient across the liposomal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Additional analyses confirmed that also the position of the His tag (whether C-terminal or N-terminal) did not affect the observed substrate preference pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050231-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
      <p>The determination of the kinetic parameters revealed higher affinities of reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 for both adenine nucleotides when ADP, instead of ATP, was present at the proteoliposomal interior (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 generally exhibited higher maximal velocities for ATP than for ADP import, unaffected by the type of exported substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">Table 2</xref>). Influence of the exported substrates on nucleotide import was investigated in more detail. Interestingly, vesicles loaded with increased ADP concentrations in the absence of ATP or in the presence of the nonsubstrate GTP led to higher import rates when compared with the corresponding transport into liposomes loaded with both substrates ATP and ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, increase of the ADP concentration and simultaneous decrease of the ATP concentration in the proteoliposomes resulted in intermediate kinetic parameters and shifted the low affinities for nucleotide import in counter-exchange with ATP towards the high import affinities of the nucleotide uptake into ADP-loaded vesicles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, decrease of nucleotide import in the presence of rising internal ATP/ADP ratios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t001">Table 1</xref>) is a consequence of the reduction of the import affinities by the exported substrate ATP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">Table 2</xref>). Because <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1-mediated nucleotide transport into liposomes loaded with decreasing ADP concentrations in absence of ATP was always substantially higher than the corresponding transport in presence of rising concentrations of the additional interior substrate ATP, a possible limitation of the counter-exchange substrate ADP (from 10 mM up to about 2.5 mM) was ruled out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>The stimulation of nucleotide import affinities by rising ADP/ATP ratios is in agreement with the physiological function of the carrier. A low-energy state of the bacterium (simulated by a high ADP/ATP ratio in the liposome) would consequently promote total nucleotide import, and would additionally stimulate ATP import to a higher extent than ADP import. Since not only the bacterial ATP level is subject to fluctuations, the effect of different external ADP/ATP ratios on nucleotide uptake was analyzed to mimic different energy states of the host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The determined competition pattern indicates that not even high concentrations of ADP could markedly affect ATP import into ATP-loaded proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>D), whereas ADP import into ATP-loaded proteoliposomes was already exceedingly suppressed by low concentrations of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). The biochemical characteristics of the reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 facilitate an effective accumulation of ATP in the liposome—even in the presence of exceeding amounts of exterior ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g006">Figure 6</xref>)—and in particular when the internal ATP/ADP ratio is low (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">2</xref>).</p>
      <p>These results confirm and mechanistically explain the postulated physiological role of this carrier, and at the first glance not only argue for only one mode of orientation in the liposomal membrane but also for a directed insertion, which corresponds to the native state.</p>
      <p>One important step towards the characterization of reconstituted proteins is the identification of their orientation in the vesicle. However, directionality of protein insertion varies with the method of reconstitution used (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b042">42</xref>]). Orientation analyses of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 showed that this protein in the applied system consistently exhibits a bidirectional, nearly 1:1 orientation in the lipid vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g007">Figure 7</xref>). An extended analysis by the combination of endoproteases Asp-N and factor Xa, accompanied by additional transport measurements, revealed that only the fraction of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 orientated with the N-terminally located His tag towards the liposomal lumen is functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g009">9</xref>). In this fraction of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1, the exterior Asp-N cleavage sites are obviously not accessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g010">Figure 10</xref>). On closer inspection, a small fraction of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 that was directed with the N terminus towards the interior also seems to have been digested by Asp-N. Since this cleavage has no influence on the transport activity, we assume that some of the carriers are correctly oriented but not functionally inserted. The calculated molecular weight of the largest fragment resulting from Asp-N cleavage of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 inserted with the His tag to the exterior is 27 kDa. The complete digestion of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exposing the His tag to the exterior into fragments substantially smaller than 27 kDa argues for the accessibility of additional cleavage sites and leads to the assumption that a significant fraction of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 is not correctly (completely) inserted. Because the calculated specific activity refers to the total protein applied for reconstitution, the high activity of reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 is even underestimated.</p>
      <p>Additionally, in the applied liposomal system, the orientation of ADP/ATP carriers from yeast mitochondria was analyzed by the help of the specific inhibitors bongkrekic acid (BKA) and carboxyatractyloside (CAT). AAC-mediated transport was strongly inhibited by 10 μM CAT (to 52%) or by 10 μM BKA (to 20%) when used separately, and was completely inhibited (to about 0.5%) when both inhibitors where applied simultaneously (unpublished data). This reveals that the reconstituted mitochondrial AACs exhibited a nearly 1:1 orientation and that the right-side-out as well as the inside-out oriented carriers were functional under conditions used for the orientation analyses of the reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1.</p>
      <p>Until now, the sense of integration of the <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. amoebophila</named-content> has been unknown, and therefore, a comparison of the orientation of the reconstituted functional protein with the native state was impossible. However, an analysis of the topology of proteins in membranes revealed that most of them exhibit an accumulation of positively charged amino acids at the cytosolic side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b043">43</xref>]. In compliance with the predicted topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g010">Figure 10</xref>), the hydrophilic loops connecting the transmembrane domains 6, 7, 10, and 11 of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 contain a remarkable accumulation of positively charged amino acids, and therefore these positively residues are probably exposed to the cytosol of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. amoebophila</named-content>. The demonstrated orientation of the functional fraction of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 in the lipid vesicles is consistent with the predicted orientation of the native transporter. Whether <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exhibits 11 (as given in the current model) or 12 transmembrane-spanning helices (as previously described for structurally related NTTs) will be analyzed in future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b029">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that the biochemical properties of the reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 are in line with the physiological function of this carrier in <italic>P. amoebophila,</italic> the obtained results are surprising. Given that at a pH 7.5, ATP and ADP exist mainly as the species ATP<sup>4−</sup> and ADP<sup>3−</sup><sub>,</sub> a 1:1 stoichiometry of the hetero-exchange would consequently generate a charge difference across the membrane of the vesicle.</p>
      <p>The electrogenic ADP/ATP exchange across the mitochondrial membrane was shown to be regulated by the energy state of the organelle. In energized mitochondria, the gradient of the substrate concentration across the inner mitochondrial membrane as well as the membrane potential (positive outside) supports the import of ADP<sup>3−</sup> in exchange with ATP<sup>4−</sup><sub>,</sub> whereas the absence of a membrane potential results in similar transport rates for both adenine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g005">Figure 5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b034">34</xref>]. In contrast to the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide exchange, NTT-mediated transport seems to be unaffected by the membrane potential and therefore electroneutral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>The parasitic protist <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Entamoeba histolytica</named-content> has reduced mitochondria homologs that lack an electron transport chain. The mitosomal AAC was shown to facilitate an electroneutral ADP/ATP exchange possibly by the uptake of a positive counter ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b044">44</xref>].</p>
      <p>Isolated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Rickettsia prowazekii</named-content> cells prefer ATP instead of ADP import in diverse buffer media lacking phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b045">45</xref>]. However, rising concentrations of phosphate stimulated ADP import. Because rickettsiae are able to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, the capacity to import ADP in the presence of phosphate is disadvantageous in a host cell that suffers from the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b045">45</xref>]. The reduced expression of the ATP/ADP translocase gene in heavily infected host cells could prevent the loss of rickettsial ATP in exchange for host-derived ADP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b047">47</xref>].</p>
      <p>Until now, it has not been clear whether <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 compensates the charge difference occurring due to ATP/ADP exchange by the transport of a counter ion. However, since the buffer media used for reconstitution and uptake measurements contained no phosphate (apart from possible traces by contamination), transport of ADP and phosphate in exchange with ATP is unlikely.</p>
      <p>Our studies revealed that the biochemical characteristics of the reconstituted <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 differ in some aspects from the results obtained with the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> system expressing <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 and homologous NTT proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b018">18</xref>]. It is known that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> expressing recombinant carrier proteins suffer and exhibit a comparably high cytosolic ADP/ATP ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b048">48</xref>]. In the proteoliposomal system, such conditions favour ATP import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">2</xref>), whereas <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> exhibits nearly identical apparent affinities for both adenylates in the presence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b018">18</xref>] and the absence of phosphate (unpublished data). Thus, in contrast to the ATP/ADP transporter from <italic>R. prowazeckii, Pam</italic>NTT1-mediated ADP import seems to be unaffected by phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b045">45</xref>].</p>
      <p>Analysis of the substrate spectrum revealed that <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 is highly specific for ATP and ADP, independent of the applied system (unpublished data and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b018">18</xref>]). At this stage, it is not possible to decide which system is closer to the native state, because the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> system as well as proteoliposomes are in vitro models. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> differs considerably in form, size, and lipid composition from liposomes, and these differences might be the cause of the observed alterations in the biochemical properties of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1.</p>
      <p>It is remarkable that the recombinant <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 exhibits a “sided-ness,” which allows an efficient import of ATP in exchange with ADP when reconstituted into liposomes but not when measured in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>, in particular since the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> system at a first glance seems to be closer to the native environment. In fact, some points could also argue for the liposomal system as a better model for studying <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1. First of all, both <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 proteoliposomes and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. amoebophila</named-content> are smaller than <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b038">38</xref>], and therefore, an influence of the membrane curvature on <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1 function can also be assumed. Second, it was shown that trafficking of host-derived phospholipids to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. trachomatis</named-content> occurs, and thus the intracellular bacterium in contrast to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> harbors (about 40%) eukaryotic phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b051">51</xref>]. Whether there is a possible correlation between the membrane curvature or the phospholipid PC and the functionality (in particular the “sided-ness”) of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1-mediated transport is the topic of our future studies.</p>
      <p>Taken together, heterologous expression of nucleotide transport proteins in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> is clearly suitable in identifying basic functional properties and mode of transport of these proteins, whereas the complexity of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> cell prevents a more detailed functional analysis, which becomes feasible in the liposomal system.</p>
      <p>We suggest that the sophisticated, stimulating effect of the exported substrate ADP on import affinities of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1, which was observed (under diverse conditions) in the less-complex liposomal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g002">Figures 2</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050231-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050231-sg001">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050231-sg002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050231-t002">2</xref>), is an intrinsic characteristic of the native <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1. This characteristic allows energy import into a bacterial cell that exhibits a reduced energy state even under conditions of a high ADP/ATP ratio in the host cell. Therefore, it also becomes evident why bacterial ATP/ADP transport proteins fundamentally differ in structure from mitochondrial AACs, which mediate energy export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b052">52</xref>].</p>
      <p>Interestingly, an influence of the exported substrate on import characteristics of an NTT protein has been previously observed on intact <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> cells. The recombinant NAD<sup>+</sup>/ADP transporter from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. amoebophila</named-content> (<italic>Pam</italic>NTT4) mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> import in counter-exchange with ADP and also ADP and NAD<sup>+</sup> homo-exchange, respectively, whereas the physiologically unfavourable import of ADP in counter-exchange with NAD<sup>+</sup> was nearly unobservable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050231-b016">16</xref>]. Whether the observed biochemical characteristics of <italic>Pam</italic>NTT4 are also caused by different kinetic parameters at interior and exterior and by a stimulating influence of the exported substrate ADP on import affinities and whether the trans-stimulating effect of ADP is a common feature of all bacterial and plastidic ATP/ADP transporters remains to be investigated.</p>
      <p>The establishment of an expression, purification, and reconstitution protocol for a representative NTT from intracellular living bacteria and the generated <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1-specific antibodies are fundamental prerequisites for crystallization; detailed structure–function analyses in the future and will also provide important guidance for NTT inhibitors, which might represent suitable drugs for specific anti-chlamydial therapy.</p>

          <p>(A) ATP uptake into ADP-loaded liposomes was set to 100% and the remaining exchanges were calculated accordingly. <italic>Pam</italic>NTT1-mediated ATP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> transport is given in nmol (mg protein)<sup> −1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> above the corresponding white bar. ATP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> (light grey bars), ADP<sub>im</sub>/ADP<sub>ex</sub> (grey bars), ADP<sub>im</sub>/ATP<sub>ex</sub> (dark grey bars). The given data represent the net nucleotide import calculated by subtraction of the control (uptake into unloaded proteoliposomes).</p>
