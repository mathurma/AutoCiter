				<article-title>A New Role for a Long-Studied DNA-Wrangling Enzyme</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Chromosome segregation requires sister chromatid resolution. Condensins are essential for this process since they organize an axial structure where topoisomerase II can work. How sister chromatid separation is coordinated with chromosome condensation and decatenation activity remains unknown. We combined four-dimensional (4D) microscopy, RNA interference (RNAi), and biochemical analyses to show that topoisomerase II plays an essential role in this process. Either depletion of topoisomerase II or exposure to specific anti-topoisomerase II inhibitors causes centromere nondisjunction, associated with syntelic chromosome attachments. However, cells degrade cohesins and timely exit mitosis after satisfying the spindle assembly checkpoint. Moreover, in topoisomerase II–depleted cells, Aurora B and INCENP fail to transfer to the central spindle in late mitosis and remain tightly associated with centromeres of nondisjoined sister chromatids. Also, in topoisomerase II–depleted cells, Aurora B shows significantly reduced kinase activity both in S2 and HeLa cells. Codepletion of BubR1 in S2 cells restores Aurora B kinase activity, and consequently, most syntelic attachments are released. Taken together, our results support that topoisomerase II ensures proper sister chromatid separation through a direct role in centromere resolution and prevents incorrect microtubule–kinetochore attachments by allowing proper activation of Aurora B kinase.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>Successful cell division requires that chromosomes are properly condensed and that each sister chromatid is self-contained by the time the sister pairs are segregated into separate daughter cells. It is also essential that the kinetochores at the centromeres of each pair of sister chromatids bind microtubules from opposite spindle poles. Topoisomerase II is a highly conserved enzyme that removes interlinks from DNA and is known to be essential to proper chromosome segregation during cell division. In this work, we have used state-of-the-art four-dimensional fluorescent microscopy to follow progression through mitosis in living cells depleted of topoisomerase II. We find that when the enzyme is absent, the two sister centromeres do not separate, and chromosomes missegregate. Moreover, the inappropriate centromere structure that results prevents the correct activation of the Aurora B kinase, which forms part of a regulatory mechanism that monitors correct segregation of chromosomes; as a result, cells exit mitosis abnormally.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ordered segregation of the genome during cell division requires bipolar attachment to spindle microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b001">1</xref>] and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion until anaphase onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b002">2</xref>]. Cohesin provides a physical link between sister chromatids, and cleavage of cohesin subunits results from separase activation after the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is satisfied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b003">3</xref>]. However, before segregation occurs, proper chromosome condensation and sister chromatid resolution must be completed. The condensin complex has been shown to play a key role in these processes by organizing an axial structure where topoisomerase II (TOPO II) localizes and decatenates entangled DNA strands that result from replication or transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b005">5</xref>]. Indeed, the requirement of TOPO II activity in mitosis has been amply documented. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>, circular DNA molecules accumulate as catenated dimers in top2 mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b006">6</xref>], and TOPO II activity prevents nondisjunction and DNA breakage during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b009">9</xref>]. Injection of antibodies against TOPO II in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b010">10</xref>], the addition of TOPO II inhibitors or RNA interference (RNAi) in mammalian culture cells and <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b014">14</xref>] caused severe defects in chromosome segregation during anaphase. More specifically, TOPO II activity has been suggested to affect normal centromere structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b015">15</xref>] where the protein normally accumulates in its catalytically active form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b020">20</xref>]. These data strongly suggest that prior to segregation, TOPO II has a general role in promoting the resolution of sister chromatids. However, how this correlates with TOPO II activity at the centromeres remains a critically unanswered question.</p>

        <title>Characterization of Cells Depleted of TOPO II or Inhibited with Anti–TOPO II Drugs</title>
        <p>To study the function of TOPO II during mitosis, we first analyzed the consequences of depleting the enzyme by RNAi or treating <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells with specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Significant levels of TOPO II depletion were obtained by RNAi treatment as shown by western blot analysis in which the protein is barely detectable after 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). However, we found that these cells apparently progress normally through early stages of mitosis but show severe segregation defects during anaphase and telophase, and cell proliferation is significantly inhibited without altering the mitotic index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g001">Figure 1</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g001">1</xref>D). Quantification of chromosome segregation abnormalities shows that after long RNAi treatment, a significant proportion of cells display either chromatin bridges or lagging chromatids during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g001">1</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g001">1</xref>F). Immunofluorescence analysis of chromosome morphology with antibodies against condensin subunits reveals that depletion of TOPO II does not significantly affect mitotic chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). Cells were also treated with the TOPO II inhibitor ICRF-187, a bisdioxopiperazine-type chemical that has been shown to interfere with the catalytic activity of TOPO II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b021">21</xref>]. However, treatment of cells with ICRF-187 results in a more pronounced alteration in chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g001">Figure 1</xref>H). The exact role of TOPO II in mitotic chromosome structure remains highly debatable. This is due to the fact that the use of different procedures to disrupt TOPO II function and localization in several model organisms has led to conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b022">22</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies have shown that TOPO II inhibitors may also result in the activation of the G2 checkpoint because they block the activity of the enzyme in different conformation states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b023">23</xref>]. Therefore, we have resorted to depleting TOPO II by RNAi for most of our study.</p>

            <p>(A) Depletion of TOPO II over time was monitored by western blot. α-Tubulin (α-TUB) was used as a loading control. TOPO II protein was barely detectable 72 h after the addition of dsRNA.</p>

            <p>(E and F) The phenotype associated with TOPO II depletion, both chromatin bridges (E) and chromatin lagging (F), start to become consistently observed 72 h after the addition of the dsRNAi. This time point correlates to higher levels of depletion quantified by western blotting and with the beginning of an effect in cell cycle proliferation.</p>
            <p>(G) Immunolocalization of SMC4 (red), TOPO II (green), and DNA (blue) on S2 mitotic cells treated with hypotonic shock were performed in control (Top) or TOPO II–depleted (bottom) cells. SMC4 localizes to the central axis of the TOPO II–depleted chromosomes similar to control cells, suggesting that condensin localization to the central axis of chromosomes is independent of TOPO II.</p>
            <p>(H) Immunolocalization of SMC4 (red) and TOPO II (green) in S2 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells control and treated with 50 μg/ml ICRF-187. Compared to the control, the chromosomes of cells treated with the TOPO II inhibitor are longer extended. During anaphase, extensive bridges are also observed. Although the chromosome morphology is altered after incubation with the inhibitor, both SMC4 and TOPO II are still associated with chromatin. Scale bar represents 5 μm.</p>

        <title>TOPO II Has an Essential Role in Centromere Disjunction during Mitosis</title>
        <p>To directly assess whether TOPO II function is required at centromeres, we depleted the single TOPO II isoform from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells stably expressing fluorescent markers for chromatin (mRFP-H2B) and centromeres (CID-GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b024">24</xref>] by RNAi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv001">Videos S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv004">S4</xref>). In order to visualize individual sister centromeres at high temporal and spatial resolution, TOPO II–depleted cells were imaged by four-dimensional (4D) time-lapse fluorescence microscopy in which the distance between the optical layers of the <italic>Z</italic>-stack was kept to less than 1 μm. In control cells, chromosomes congression occurs normally, and as anaphase starts, CID-GFP pairs disjoin and move poleward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv001">Video S1</xref>). However, in TOPO II–depleted cells, while chromosomes appear to exhibit normal congression, centromeres of sister chromatids remain on the same side of the metaphase plate, fail to disjoin, and move towards the same pole during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g002">2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv002">Video S2</xref>). Nevertheless, in many cells after 72 h of RNAi treatment, chromatin bridges presumably linking chromosome arms are clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv003">Video S3</xref>). At later times after RNAi treatment (96 h), most cells show chromosome nondisjunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv004">Video S4</xref>). Noteworthy, most of the analysis after TOPO II depletion was carried out in cells that did not show extensive polyploidy, as ascertained by chromosome and centromere labeling, indicating that they had not undergone multiple cell cycles. After long RNAi treatment, a small proportion of polyploid cells were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). These cells are characterized by the presence of chromosomes that are attached by their nondisjoined centromeres, as would be expected if in the previous cycles, proper centromere separation failed. This effect is apparently not due to a failure to replicate centromeric DNA as shown by Southern blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>In the Absence of TOPO II, Chromosomes Show Syntelic Kinetochore Attachments</title>
        <p>In order to determine why sister centromeres fail to disjoin after TOPO II depletion, cells stably expressing GFP-α-tubulin and CID-mCherry to specifically label spindle microtubules and centromeres were treated with RNAi, and mitotic progression was followed by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv005">Videos S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv006">S6</xref>). As expected, in control cells, chromosomes show mostly amphitelic attachments, congression occurs normally, and bundles of spindle microtubules are easily observed associated with individual kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv005">Video S5</xref>). However, 72 h after TOPO II RNAi, most chromosomes show syntelic attachment and are oriented towards the same spindle pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv006">Video S6</xref>). To confirm these observations, we performed an assay designed to quantify the nature of microtubule–kinetochore interactions in S2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b025">25</xref>]. For this assay, cells were arrested in mitosis with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and subjected to a high dose of Taxol, which over a short period of time causes the collapse of the bipolar spindle into a monopolar configuration. This monopolar structure now contains the chromosomes distributed at the periphery of the aster, and microtubule–kinetochore interactions can be easily scored (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). We find that in control and TOPO II–depleted cells, more than 95% of the chromosomes had both kinetochores attached to microtubules in a syntelic configuration soon after significant depletion of TOPO II occurs. If these cells are analyzed when the two asters are in the process of collapsing, it is possible to ascertain whether the attachment is amphitelic, with chromosomes localized between the asters, or syntelic/monotelic, when located at the periphery of the aster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">3</xref>H). In control cells (<italic>n</italic> = 24), most chromosomes (78%) exhibited a clear amphitelic configuration, whereas in TOPO II–depleted cells (<italic>n</italic> = 20), most chromosomes (65%) localized at the periphery of the two asters with a clear syntelic configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">3</xref>G). Consistently, CID fluorescence intensity for the centromere marker CID in TOPO II–depleted cells is almost double that of control cells (unpublished data), and intercentromere distances never increase during mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Analysis of microtubule–kinetochore interactions after TOPO II depletion was also performed in asynchronous cells. For this, either control or TOPO II–depleted cells were fixed and stained for CID, α-tubulin, and CENP-meta, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CENP-E homolog, a kinetochore motor protein whose levels decrease significantly at kinetochores during anaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>I–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">3</xref>O). As expected, we find that CENP-E is present at kinetochores of control and TOPO II–depleted cells in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">3</xref>L), but when chromosomes move poleward, CENP-E is undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>N), indicating that all kinetochores are attached to spindle microtubules. Rendering these images for the staining of CID and tubulin confirms that in the absence of TOPO II, kinetochore bundles are associated with pairs of CID dots, unlike control cells in which they associate with single CID dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>J, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">3</xref>M, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">3</xref>O).

        <title>TOPO II Activity Is Required to Establish Amphitelic Kinetochore Attachment</title>
        <p>Long-term inhibition of TOPO II with drugs affects S2 cells during G2 and mitotic entry, resulting in severe abnormalities in chromosome structure that prevented us from using inhibitors to carry out a thorough analysis of the role of TOPO II during mitotic progression. However, we hypothesized that short incubations with the inhibitors might allow us to study its effects in living cells as they enter mitosis. Accordingly, cells were treated for short periods of time with ICRF-187. S2 cells stably expressing GFP-α-tubulin and CID-mCherry were imaged by 4D microscopy during ICRF-187 treatment, before and after establishment of the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv007">Videos S7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv009">S9</xref>). We find that inhibition of TOPO II activity after chromosomes have reached the metaphase plate and established bipolar attachment does not have an effect on the kinetochore–microtubule interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g004">4</xref>B). However, if the TOPO II inhibitor is added before nuclear envelope breakdown, as inferred by the exclusion of GFP-α-tubulin from the nucleus (unpublished data), during prometaphase, we observe that 62.5% of chromosomes/cell (<italic>n</italic> = 12) exhibit syntelic chromosome attachments, with kinetochore pairs moving poleward without separating their centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). These observations not only confirm our live-cell analysis of TOPO II–depleted cells after RNAi, but also indicate that TOPO II activity at early stages of mitosis plays an important role at centromeres to promote normal chromosome biorientation. However, once amphitelic attachments are achieved, TOPO II activity is not required for their maintenance.</p>

        <title>TOPO II Is Required for Centromere Separation Independently of the Cohesin Complex</title>
        <p>Previously, it has been demonstrated that as cells progress through late prometaphase and metaphase, cohesin is removed from the chromosome arms, remaining only at the centromere until the metaphase–anaphase transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b029">29</xref>]. Therefore, it remains possible that sister centromeres fail to disjoin after depletion of TOPO II due to an inappropriate accumulation of cohesin. In order to test this hypothesis, we determined the localization of the cohesin subunit RAD21/SCC1 in control and TOPO II–depleted cells before and after incubation with colchicine. In control cells at metaphase or after colchicine incubation, cohesin localizes as a clearly defined stripe between centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), but after depletion of TOPO II, cohesin shows a very abnormal distribution, which extends into the chromosome arms even after mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). To test whether the inappropriate localization of cohesin accounts for the observed centromere nondisjunction in TOPO II–depleted cells, we performed simultaneous depletion of TOPO II and RAD21 by RNAi and followed mitotic progression and sister chromatid segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Although both proteins were efficiently depleted, cells progressed through mitosis, showing lagging chromatids or chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). The 4D microscopy studies of mitotic cells stably expressing CID-GFP and RFP-H2B after simultaneous depletion of TOPO II and RAD21 show that the behavior of sister chromatids is identical to that of cells depleted of TOPO II alone and very different from RAD21 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g005">Figure 5</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv010">Videos S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv011">S11</xref>). Cells depleted of RAD21 enter mitosis with separated sister chromatids and arrest in a prometaphase-like state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sg005">Figure S5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sv012">Video S12</xref>) because they fail to inactivate the SAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b031">31</xref>]. However, in cells depleted of both TOPO II and RAD21, closely paired sister chromatids reach the metaphase plate and, during anaphase, fail to disjoin, segregating together to the same spindle pole. These results demonstrate that inappropriate localization of RAD21 is unlikely to be responsible for the centromere nondisjunction phenotype observed after depletion of TOPO II.</p>

        <title>TOPO II–Depleted Cells Are Able to Satisfy the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint</title>
        <p>Together with the data, our results strongly suggest that depletion of TOPO II causes the formation of a physical linkage between sister centromeres, likely provided by DNA concatameres, which is not resolved during the metaphase–anaphase transition. As a consequence, TOPO II–depleted cells segregate entire chromosomes rather than sister chromatids. Apparently, this is not due to the inability of TOPO II–depleted cells to satisfy the SAC since they showed no significant mitotic delay and anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C)-dependent proteolysis of RAD21 and cyclin B occurs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). If depletion of TOPO II causes failure to resolve sister chromatids and syntelic attachments, how then do these cells satisfy the SAC? To address this question, we first determined the localization of SAC proteins after TOPO II RNAi. We find that in prometaphase, BubR1 accumulates strongly at kinetochores, while during anaphase, the level of BubR1 was significantly reduced, suggesting that TOPO II–depleted cells are able to inactivate the SAC, just like control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g006">6</xref>B). To further determine whether syntelic chromosomes undergo proper tension during mitosis, TOPO II–depleted cells were immunostained with the 3F3/2 monoclonal antibody that specifically detects kinetochore phosphoepitopes in the absence of tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b034">34</xref>]. We find that control and TOPO II–depleted cells behave very similarly so that 3F3/2 kinetochore phosphoepitopes are strongly labeled in prometaphase, become significantly reduced during prometaphase/metaphase, and are undetected in anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g006">6</xref>D). These results indicate that SAC satisfaction in TOPO II–depleted cells with syntelic attachments correlates with the dephosphorylation of 3F3/2 epitopes but does not require extensive interkinetochore stretching.</p>

(C) During early prometaphase, 3F3/2 centromere staining is intense, but in late prometaphase, the intensity decreases significantly except in kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes (see boxes). After anaphase onset, 3F3/2 staining is absent. (D) In TOPO II–depleted cells, 3F3/2 staining localizes over the chromosomes in early prometaphase although its localization can also be observed as discrete dots at the kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes at the poles (see boxes). The 3F3/2 signal at the kinetochores is reduced during prometaphase–metaphase and is absent in anaphase similarly to controls. Scale bar represents 5 μm.</p>

        <title>TOPO II–Depleted Cells Show Mislocalization of Chromosomal Passenger Proteins</title>
        <p>Previously, it has been shown that the correction of improper microtubule–kinetochore attachments requires Aurora B kinase activity as part of a tension-sensing mechanism on centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b001">1</xref>]. Aurora B is part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) that localizes to the inner centromere during prometaphase/metaphase and transfers to the spindle midzone at anaphase onset and the mid body in telophase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b035">35</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed whether the localization of CPC proteins after TOPO II depletion was compromised and could be responsible for the inability of these cells to release syntelic attachments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In control cells, Aurora B localizes to the inner centromere region during prometaphase/metaphase and is transferred to the spindle midzone when cells initiate anaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). However, in TOPO II–depleted cells Aurora B localization is abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). In prometaphase, Aurora B remains associated with sister kinetochores, does not stretch across the metaphase plate, remains associated with inner centromeres of syntelic chromosomes during anaphase, and fails to transfer to the spindle midzone. A very similar abnormal pattern of localization was also observed for INCENP, a member of the CPC, which regulates Aurora B activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g007">7</xref>D). These observations indicate that TOPO II is essential for the organization of the inner centromere so that the CPC can show a normal pattern of localization during mitosis.</p>

        <title>Depletion of TOPO II Causes a Significant Reduction in Aurora B Kinase Activity</title>
        <p>Previous studies in human cells have shown that chromosomes with syntelic attachments experience significant distortion of their centromeres and are not easily identified by the SAC, and that these errors are enhanced when aurora B kinase activity is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b037">37</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown that Aurora B is normally enriched at sites associated with erroneous microtubule attachments where it promotes microtubule depolymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b038">38</xref>]. Since in TOPO II–depleted cells Aurora B remains associated with syntelic attachments throughout mitosis, it would be expected that these erroneous attachments would be corrected, unless Aurora B activity is compromised due to structural changes resulting from TOPO II depletion. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the levels of phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser 10 (PH3), a known Aurora B substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b039">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that after TOPO II depletion at 96 h, PH3 levels were reduced almost by half (41%) when compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">Figure 8</xref>B) and not much different from the reduction (62%) observed after RNAi depletion of Aurora B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">Figure 8</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">8</xref>B). Similar results were obtained after treatment of cells with the TOPO II inhibitor ICRF-187 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060207-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Western blot of total protein extracts of TOPO II– and Aurora B–depleted cells confirmed that PH3 levels were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">Figure 8</xref>C). However, although TOPO II–depleted extracts show a significant reduction in PH3 reactivity, the total Aurora B levels appear unaffected, suggesting that depletion of TOPO II specifically affects the kinase activity of Aurora B. To directly address this possibility, Aurora B was immunoprecipitated from total protein extracts from control or TOPO II–depleted cells and its kinase activity tested in vitro with unphosphorylated histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">Figure 8</xref>D). We find that phosphorylation of histone H3 is reduced by half relative to controls when Aurora B is immunoprecipitated from TOPO II–depleted cells. This indicates that either directly or indirectly, TOPO II is required to promote Aurora B kinase activity. To further analyze how TOPO II regulates Aurora B activity at centromeres, we turned to HeLa cells. Cells were treated with the TOPO II inhibitor ICRF-187, and Aurora B kinase activity was quantified by measuring the phosphorylation of Ser7 of the centromeric protein CENP-A that has been found to be a direct substrate of Aurora B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b040">40</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">Figure 8</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">8</xref>F). In control cells, we find that P-Ser7CENP-A immunoreactivity is very high in most kinetochores during prometaphase, revealing the normal activity of Aurora B at this stage of mitosis. As cells reach metaphase and kinetochore–microtubule interactions become stabilized, P-Ser7CENP-A immunoreactivity is significantly reduced, suggesting that Aurora B kinase activity is normally down regulated at this stage. However, after inhibition of TOPO II, we find that cells in prometaphase display a significant reduction in the level of P-Ser7CENP-A immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">Figure 8</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g008">8</xref>G), and more than 60% of chromosomes per cell (<italic>n</italic> = 26) display syntelic attachment. These results indicate that TOPO II is also required to establish amphitelic attachment in HeLa cells, similar to what we observed for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and further demonstrate that TOPO II activity regulates Aurora B kinase activity on chromosomes and more specifically at centromeres.</p>

            <p>(A) Immunofluorescence analysis for histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation (PH3) in control, TOPO II–, and Aurora B–depleted cells. In control cells, both TOPO II and PH3 localize throughout chromosomes. In TOPO II–depleted cells, PH3 levels are significantly lower than in control. More significantly, in Aurora B–depleted cells, PH3 levels are even lower than in the TOPO II–depleted cells.</p>
            <p>(B) Quantification of the mean pixel intensity for PH3 signals in control, TOPO II–, and Aurora B–depleted S2 cells every 24 h at each time point of the experiment. Differences between the control and the samples of the two RNAis start to be observed at 72 h of depletion. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of the average. Compared to the control cells, the differences in levels of PH3 96 h after depletion of TOPO II (59.1%) or Aurora B (62,1%) are significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) and (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), respectively.</p>
            <p>(C) Depletion of TOPO II and Aurora B was also monitored by western blot. Both TOPO II and Aurora B protein were barely detectable 72 h (&gt;80% reduction) after the addition of dsRNAs. In Aurora B–depleted cells, the reduction of Aurora B levels parallels the reduction in the levels of PH3 reactivity. Note that after depletion of TOPO II, the level of Aurora B is not affected, but PH3 levels are reduced. Below, the quantitative analysis of PH3 reactivity is shown. The values represent the ratio of total pixel intensity of PH3 band to that of α-tubulin.</p>
            <p>(D) Aurora B kinase assay was performed with immunoprecipitated Aurora B from control and TOPO II–depleted extracts (72 and 96 h). Kinase activity was measured by quantification of histone H3 phosphorylation normalized for the amount of Aurora B immunoprecipitated in each assay. Below, the quantification of PH3 reactivity from the in vitro kinase assay is shown. Note the severe reduction in Aurora B kinase activity after 96 h of TOPO II depletion.</p>
            <p>(E) Immunolocalization of phospho-CENPA (P-CENPA; green and white separated channel), anticentromere antibody (ACA; red) and DNA or α-tubulin (blue) in control HeLa and ICRF-187–treated HeLa cells. In control cells, phospho-CENPA localizes strongly to the (white arrows) unaligned kinetochores (upper figure and insets). In metaphase, the chromosomes are amphitelically attached to the microtubules (white arrows), and in agreement, they exhibit lower levels of phospho-CENPA at the kinetochores (middle and magnifications of boxes). HeLa cells after TOPO II depletion consistently show lower levels of phospho-CENP-A at their kinetochores. The kinetochores that are syntelically bound to the microtubules (white arrows) (bottom and magnifications) do not stain for phospho-CENPA.</p>
            <p>(F) Quantification of phospho-Ser(7)CENPA mean pixel intensity at each kinetochore pair/cell in control and in ICRF-187–treated HeLa cells. In control cells, the P-CENPA intensity at the kinetochore is consistently higher in prometaphase (8.43, <italic>n</italic> = 10 cells) than in metaphase (3.28, <italic>n</italic> = 14). In ICRF-187–treated HeLa cells, P-CENPA levels quantified are more reduced (1.36, <italic>n</italic> = 16). The differences in P-CENPA levels between controls cells and cells treated with TOPO II inhibitor are highly significant (triple asterisks [***] indicate <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
            <p>(G) Quantification of amphitelic and syntelic chromosomes per cell both in control and ICRF-187–treated HeLa cells. In control HeLa cells, chromosomes preferentially bind amphitelically to microtubules both in prometaphase (76.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 14; undetermined 7.9%) and in metaphase (93.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 10; undetermined 5.0%). However, in ICRF-187–treated cells, kinetochore pairs interact with microtubules mainly syntelically (66.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 26; undetermined 12.1%), and only 21.5% are found with a bipolar attachment to microtubules. The differences observed in the type of kinetochore–microtubule interactions between ICRF-187–treated HeLa cells and control cells both in prometaphase and metaphase are significant (triple asterisks [***] indicate <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).

        <title>Codepletion of BubR1 and TOPO II Restores Histone H3 Phosphorylation and Releases Syntelic Attachments</title>
        <p>The observations described above demonstrate that TOPO II activity at the centromere is required for the normal function of Aurora B. However, these studies do not distinguish whether TOPO II controls Aurora B kinase activity directly or indirectly. Previous studies showed that inhibition of Aurora kinase activity suppresses the misalignment/attachment defects in BubR1-depleted cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b041">41</xref>]. This effect was shown to be due to an increase in Aurora B kinase activity after BubR1 depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b041">41</xref>]. Similarly, small interfering RNAi (siRNAi) depletion of Aurora B in cells where BubR1 was also knocked down, results in more stable kinetochore attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b042">42</xref>]. Therefore, given that in the absence of TOPO II, sister centromeres appear unable to resolve, bind microtubules syntelically, and segregate to the same pole, we tested whether BubR1 might be responsible for negatively regulating Aurora B activity in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">Figure 9</xref>). To address this issue, we measured microtubule–kinetochore attachment using the Taxol-MG132 assay, as well as mitotic PH3 reactivity in control, BubR1-, TOPO II–, and TOPO II/BubR1–depleted S2 cells. Single or double RNAi treatments were carried out and the respective protein levels quantified by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">Figure 9</xref>G). As described before, the Taxol-MG132 assay shows that in control or TOPO II–depleted cells, most chromosomes are attached to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g003">Figure 3</xref>), but when BubR1 is depleted alone, many cells show either unattached or mono-oriented chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b025">25</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">Figure 9</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">9</xref>B). Interestingly, when BubR1 and TOPO II are simultaneously depleted, we observed a large increase in the number of unattached kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">Figure 9</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">9</xref>B). This result indicates that removing BubR1 from TOPO II–depleted cells can reactivate the correction mechanism and allow the release of syntelic attachments. To determine whether this was the result of Aurora B kinase activity, we then analyzed PH3 levels by immunofluorescence microscopy. The results show that depletion of BubR1 in the absence of TOPO II is able to restore normal PH3 levels on chromatin, suggesting that Aurora B kinase is now active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">Figure 9</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">9</xref>D). We also analyzed the localization of Aurora B during mitotic exit of cells after simultaneous depletion of TOPO II and BubR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">Figure 9</xref>E). Interestingly, during early anaphase, Aurora B is found tightly associated with the centromeres but in late anaphase is no longer detected and accumulates in the spindle midzone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">Figure 9</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g009">9</xref>F). These results suggest that TOPO II is unlikely to have a direct role in regulating the kinase activity of Aurora B. Instead, the abnormal configuration of the centromere resulting from TOPO II depletion appears to cause inappropriate inhibition of Aurora B through BubR1.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our live-cell studies show that TOPO II has a central role in promoting structural changes of the centromeric DNA that are essential for their individualization and separation at metaphase–anaphase transition. This process is clearly independent of the cohesin complex since depletion of RAD21 causes a SAC-dependent prometaphase-like arrest with separated sister chromatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b043">43</xref>], which can be overcome by simultaneous depletion of condensin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b004">4</xref>] or TOPO II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060207-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, whereas the role of cohesin degradation in defining the initial steps of sister chromatid separation is well established, it is clear that these events must be tightly coordinated with TOPO II activity. Although it was previously suggested that TOPO II might have a role at the centromere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b044">44</xref>], previous functional studies have failed to detect any effect on centromere separation during mitotic exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b045">45</xref>]. Therefore, our results provide the first direct evidence that TOPO II activity is required for centromere disjunction during mitosis.</p>
      <p>Our results further show that the structural changes of centromeric DNA resulting from the decatenation activity of TOPO II appear to be essential for the establishment of amphitelic microtubule–kinetochore attachments. In the absence of TOPO II, the SAC appears unable to detect sister kinetochores that are attached to the same pole. One possible explanation is that in TOPO II–depleted cells, Aurora B kinase activity is down-regulated, and given its role in activating the SAC in response to loss of tension, cells cannot respond properly and therefore do not activate the correction mechanism. Interestingly, it has been shown that during exit from meiosis I, when sister chromatids do not disjoin, Aurora B and INCENP remain at the inner centromere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b046">46</xref>], similar to what we observe after depletion of TOPO II. Thus, chromosome segregation in TOPO II–depleted cells resembles the first meiotic division when both sister kinetochores are oriented towards the same pole, suggesting that TOPO II may play a role in modulating centromere structure required for proper bivalent biorientation.</p>
      <p>The functional interaction between TOPO II and Aurora B has been explored before. In human cells, TOPO II was demonstrated to be an in vitro substrate of Aurora B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b047">47</xref>]. Here, we show that depletion of TOPO II causes a down-regulation of Aurora B kinase activity. We observed that the levels of chromosome-associated PH3 staining during prometaphase and metaphase are significantly reduced after depletion of TOPO II but also find that after treatment of S2 cells with a TOPO II inhibitor ICRF-187, which compromises TOPO II activity without changing its chromosomal localization, PH3 reactivity is also significantly reduced. In agreement, inhibition of TOPO II catalytic activity in human cells also results in a dramatic reduction on the phosphorylation levels of Ser 7 CENP-A phosphoepitope, indicating that Aurora B activity is affected not only on chromosomes, but also specifically at centromeres.</p>
      <p>The reduction in Aurora B kinase activity could either result from a direct effect of TOPO II or, more likely, through an alteration of the structure of the centromere that occurs as a consequence of TOPO II depletion, and therefore likely represents an indirect effect. We addressed this issue by codepleting BubR1, a SAC protein thought to be involved in inhibiting Aurora B at kinetochores, and find that indeed, codepletion of TOPO II and BubR1 restores normal Aurora B kinase activity and releases syntelic chromosome attachments. Previous work in HeLa cells has shown that either inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b041">41</xref>] or depletion of Aurora B by RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b042">42</xref>] suppresses the misalignment/attachment defects observed in BubR1-depleted cells. In agreement, an increase in Aurora B kinase activity has been reported in the absence of BubR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b041">41</xref>]. Taken together, our results suggest that BubR1 is able to inhibit Aurora B when in close proximity, so that in early stages of prometaphase, when microtubule attachment is being established and there is not sufficient tension, Aurora B is not activated. However, the increase in tension upon chromosome biorientation, which increases the distance between BubR1 and the centromere during prometaphase, allows Aurora B activation. Indeed, after TOPO II depletion, sister centromeres remain very close, and therefore BubR1 could be responsible for inhibiting Aurora B. Depletion of both BubR1 and TOPO II results in reactivation of Aurora B kinase activity, release of syntelic attachments, and the formation of unattached or mono-oriented chromosomes. These data support recent observations suggesting that activation of microtubule–kinetochore correction mechanisms during mitosis is dependent on centromere plasticity, but not on centromere elasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060207-b048">48</xref>]. In summary, our observations demonstrate that TOPO II is required for structural changes at the centromere during their resolution, and in turn, this allows normal function of Aurora B, maintenance of SAC activity, and eventual activation of the mechanisms that correct abnormal microtubule–kinetochore attachments.</p>

          <p>(B) In TOPO II–depleted cells, chromosomes are observed as larger clusters of chromatids with interconnecting chromatin and broad CID staining at the primary constriction (individual channel on the right).</p>
          <p>Fluorescent in situ hybridization with dodeca-satellite DNA, a heterochromatic pericentromeric sequence, was used to specifically identify chromosome 3 in (C) control or (D–F) TOPO II–depleted cells.</p>
          <p>(C) In control cells, we observed two clearly defined regions of hybridization per chromosome that localize close to the primary constriction.</p>
          <p>(D) In TOPO II–depleted cells at 96 h, several chromosomes (60%, <italic>n</italic> = 60) exhibit four dodeca-satellite regions of hybridization, suggesting that they correspond to diplochromosomes.</p>
          <p>(E and F) In TOPO II–depleted cells, larger clusters of homologous chromosomes can also be observed.</p>
          <p>(G–I) Fluorescent in situ hybridization with dodeca-satellite DNA (green and separated white channel) was also performed in asynchronous cells, both in control (G) and TOPO II–depleted cells (H and I). At the metaphase plate, chromosomes can be observed individually either in control (G) or in TOPO II–depleted cells (H). However, in anaphase, unseparated centromeres are observed only in TOPO II–depleted cells (I). Most of the chromatin segregate as unseparated chromatids, although a few diplochromosomes can also be observed.</p>
          <p>(J) Southern blot was performed for genomic DNA from control S2 cells and TOPO II–depleted cells 96 h after the addition of dsRNA. The ribosomal DNA (rDNA), a heterochromatic sequence localizing specifically to the X centromere proximal region, was used as probe as well as <italic>Zw10</italic>, a single gene also from the X chromosome. <italic>Zw10</italic> was used as an internal control to normalize for the number of X chromosomes. Intensity of ZW10 and rDNA bands was determined by measuring the mean pixel intensity. The ratio for the intensities obtained for the gene and rDNA sequence is the same for the genomic DNA extracted from control and TOPO II–depleted cells. This result indicates that replication of rDNA occurs at the same ratio as the euchromatic genes, suggesting that heterochromatin replication is not specifically affected in the absence of TOPO II.

          <p><italic>Z</italic>-stacks are composed of ten optical sections covering 10 μm and were acquired every 20 s. Each Z-stack is 10 μm and composed of ten optical sections. Anaphase onset corresponds to time 0 s. Merge color images of RFP-H2B (red) and CID-GFP (green) channels are shown on the left. The CID-GFP (white) channel is shown alone on the right. The two CID-GFP pairs of each centromere were identified and labeled in every layer composing the <italic>Z</italic>-stacks at the different time points. The mean distance between CID-GFP dots is approximately 1 μm. Tracking of kinetochore pairs was performed using a plug-in for the Image J software. In the video, each CID-GFP pair is labeled with the same color.</p>
