<p>Neurons display a wide range of intrinsic firing patterns. A particularly relevant pattern for neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity is burst firing, the generation of clusters of action potentials with short interspike intervals. Besides ion-channel composition, dendritic morphology appears to be an important factor modulating firing pattern. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and the impact of morphology on burst firing remains insufficiently known. Dendritic morphology is not fixed but can undergo significant changes in many pathological conditions. Using computational models of neocortical pyramidal cells, we here show that not only the total length of the apical dendrite but also the topological structure of its branching pattern markedly influences inter- and intraburst spike intervals and even determines whether or not a cell exhibits burst firing. We found that there is only a range of dendritic sizes that supports burst firing, and that this range is modulated by dendritic topology. Either reducing or enlarging the dendritic tree, or merely modifying its topological structure without changing total dendritic length, can transform a cell's firing pattern from bursting to tonic firing. Interestingly, the results are largely independent of whether the cells are stimulated by current injection at the soma or by synapses distributed over the dendritic tree. By means of a novel measure called mean electrotonic path length, we show that the influence of dendritic morphology on burst firing is attributable to the effect both dendritic size and dendritic topology have, not on somatic input conductance, but on the average spatial extent of the dendritic tree and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the dendritic membrane potential. Our results suggest that alterations in size or topology of pyramidal cell morphology, such as observed in Alzheimer's disease, mental retardation, epilepsy, and chronic stress, could change neuronal burst firing and thus ultimately affect information processing and cognition.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Neurons possess highly branched extensions, called dendrites, which form characteristic tree-like structures. The morphology of these dendritic arborizations can undergo significant changes in many pathological conditions. It is still poorly known, however, how alterations in dendritic morphology affect neuronal activity. Using computational models of pyramidal cells, we study the influence of dendritic tree size and branching structure on burst firing. Burst firing is the generation of two or more action potentials in close succession, a form of neuronal activity that is critically involved in neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity. We found that there is only a range of dendritic tree sizes that supports burst firing, and that this range is modulated by the branching structure of the tree. We show that shortening as well as lengthening the dendritic tree, or even just modifying the pattern in which the branches in the tree are connected, can shift the cell's firing pattern from bursting to tonic firing, as a consequence of changes in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the dendritic membrane potential. Our results suggest that alterations in pyramidal cell morphology could, via their effect on burst firing, ultimately affect cognition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurons exhibit a wide range of intrinsic firing patterns with respect to both spike frequency and spike pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Llins1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Contreras1">[3]</xref>. A distinct type of firing pattern that is critically involved in neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity is burst firing, the generation of clusters of spikes with short interspike intervals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Krahe1">[4]</xref>. Bursts can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of neuronal responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Eggermont1">[5]</xref> and may convey specific stimulus-related information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-MartinezConde1">[6]</xref>. Bursts of spikes can be more effective than single spikes in inducing synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Thomas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-YunS1">[8]</xref>, or can even determine whether LTP or LTD (long-term depression) occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Birtoli1">[9]</xref>. In synapses with short-term facilitation, bursts can be transmitted more reliably than isolated spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Swadlow1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Electrophysiology, in combination with computational modeling, has elucidated the ionic mechanisms underlying intrinsic neuronal burst firing. Two main classes of mechanisms have been distinguished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Krahe1">[4]</xref>. In so-called dendrite-independent mechanisms—responsible for bursting in thalamic relay neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-McCormick1">[11]</xref>, for example—the fast, spike-generating conductances and the slow, burst-controlling conductances are co-localized in the soma. Conversely, in dendrite-dependent mechanisms—involved in pyramidal cell burst firing—these conductances are distributed across the soma and dendrites, with the interaction between somatic and dendritic conductances playing an essential role in burst generation. Dendritic voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels, which promote propagation of action potentials from the soma into the dendrites, cause the dendrites to be depolarized when, at the end of a somatic spike, the soma is hyperpolarized, leading to a return current from dendrites to soma. The return current gives rise to a depolarizing afterpotential at the soma, which, if strong enough, produces another somatic spike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Williams1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Wang1">[13]</xref>. This whole process was described by Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Wang1">[13]</xref> as ‘ping-pong’ interaction between soma and dendrites.</p>
<p>Although ion channels play a pivotal role in burst firing, dendritic morphology also appears to be an important factor. In many cell types, including neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mason1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Bilkey1">[17]</xref>, neuronal firing patterns and the occurrence of bursts are correlated with dendritic morphology. Results from modeling studies also suggest a relationship between dendritic morphology and firing pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mainen1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Krichmar1">[21]</xref>. However, these studies are mainly correlative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Krichmar1">[21]</xref>, focus on morphologically very distinct cell classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mainen1">[18]</xref>, use only the physiologically less appropriate stimulation protocol of somatic current injection, and do not investigate the impact of topological structure of dendritic arborizations. Consequently, the effects of dendritic size and dendritic topology on burst firing, and the underlying mechanisms, remain poorly known.</p>
<p>Considering that dendritic morphology can undergo significant changes in many pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Yamada1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Moolman1">[23]</xref>, mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Kaufmann1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Dierssen1">[25]</xref>, epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Teskey1">[26]</xref>, and chronic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Sousa1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Cook1">[29]</xref>, it is important to examine the implications of altered morphology for neuronal firing. Using computational models of neocortical pyramidal neurons, we here explore in a systematic and rigorous way the impact of a cell's dendritic morphology on the ping-pong mechanism of burst firing, under either somatic current injection or synaptic stimulation of the apical dendritic tree. Importantly, we thereby distinguish between the effects of size and topology of the apical dendrite. Furthermore, we identify the underlying mechanism by which morphology affects burst firing in the model.</p>

<p>The pyramidal cell is activated by either somatic or dendritic stimulation. For somatic stimulation, the cell is continuously stimulated with a fixed current injection of 0.2 nA at the soma. For dendritic stimulation, the cell is stimulated by synapses that are regularly distributed across the apical dendrite, with a density of 1 synapse per 20 µm<sup>2</sup>. For this synaptic density, the total input current, based on the current transfer at a single synapse, is approximately the same as with somatic stimulation.</p>
<p>The excitatory synaptic input is mediated by AMPA receptors.

<p>The firing patterns were recorded from the soma. Each simulation lasted 10000 ms, of which the first 1000 ms were discarded in the analysis in order to remove possible transient firing patterns.</p>
<p>In studying the influence of pyramidal cell morphology on burst firing, we distinguish between dendritic size and dendritic topology. The size of a dendritic tree is the total length of all its dendritic segments. The segment between the soma and the first branch point is called the root segment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Dendritic segments between two branch points are intermediate segments, and segments between a branch point and a terminal tip are terminal segments. The topology of a dendritic tree is the way in which the dendritic segments are connected to each other. For example, a tree with a given number of terminal segments can be connected in a fully asymmetrical or a fully symmetrical way (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, dendritic trees 1 and 23, respectively).</p>

At the right is the description of this tree in the notation we employed to order the trees.</p>

<p>To investigate how the dendritic size of the pyramidal cell influences burst firing, we varied the total length of the cell's apical dendrite according to two methods. In the first method, we successively pruned terminal segments from the apical dendritic tree. Starting with the full pyramidal cell morphology, in each round of pruning we randomly removed a number of terminal segments from the apical dendritic tree. Each terminal segment had a chance of 0.3 to be removed. From the reduced dendritic tree, we again randomly cut terminal segments, and so on, until in principle the whole apical dendrite was eliminated. This whole procedure was repeated 20 times. The density of synapses was kept constant during pruning, so with dendritic stimulation pruning also changed the total input to the cell. With somatic simulation, the total input to the cell did not change when the apical dendrite was pruned.</p>
<p>In the second method, we kept the dendritic arborization intact and changed the size of the apical dendrite by multiplying the lengths of all its segments by the same factor. Thus in this way the entire apical dendritic tree was compressed or expanded. For dendritic stimulation, we kept the total synaptic input to the cell constant by adapting the density of the synapses. So, both with somatic and dendritic stimulation, the total input to the cell did not change when the size of the apical dendrite was modified.</p>
<p>To examine the impact of the cell's dendritic branching structure on burst firing, we varied the topology of the apical dendritic tree by swapping branches within the tree. The apical dendritic trees that were generated in this way all have exactly the same total dendritic length and other metrical properties such as total dendritic surface area and differ only in their topological structure. The total input to the cell, both with somatic and dendritic stimulation, did not change when the topological structure was altered.</p>

<title>Morphologically simplified cells</title>
<p>To facilitate a systematic analysis of the role of dendritic size and dendritic topology in shaping burst firing, we also use a set of morphologically simplified neurons. The neurophysiological complexity of these neurons is similar to that of the full pyramidal cell model. For a systematic study, one must use trees with a relatively small number of terminal segments, because otherwise the number of topologically different trees becomes so large that simulating all of them becomes impossible. For a tree with only 12 terminal segments, for example, there already exist as many as 451 different tree topologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-VanPelt1">[34]</xref>. Here, we use a set of 23 neurons consisting of all the topologically different trees with 8 terminal segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The trees may also be thought of as representing the backbones of potentially much larger dendritic arborizations.</p>
<p>All segments in the tree (intermediate and terminal segments; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) have the same length, so that the different tree topologies do not differ in total dendritic length.

For the specific rate functions for each current, we refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mainen1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>As in the pyramidal cell model with full morphological complexity, the neurons are activated by either somatic or dendritic stimulation. All the tree topologies receive the same input. For somatic stimulation, the neurons are continuously stimulated with a fixed current injection of 0.03 nA (0.1 nA for the non-Rall neurons, in which segment diameter is equal throughout the dendritic tree). For dendritic stimulation, the cells are stimulated by 600 synapses, with on each terminal or intermediate segment (in total 15 segments for a tree with 8 terminal segments) 40 uniformly distributed synapses. With this number of synapses, the total input current, based on the current transfer at a single synapse, is approximately the same as with somatic stimulation. The synaptic input is mediated by AMPA receptors, with the same parameters as in the full pyramidal cell model. Also as in the full pyramidal cell model, each synapse is randomly activated according to a Poisson process, with a mean activation frequency of 1 Hz.</p>
<p>The simulations were performed in NEURON <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Hines1">[31]</xref>. The firing patterns were recorded from the axosomatic compartment. Each simulation lasted 10000 ms, of which the first 1000 ms were discarded in the analysis in order to remove possible transient firing patterns.</p>
<p>To examine how the size of the dendritic tree influences firing pattern, we changed the total dendritic length of a given tree topology by multiplying the lengths of all its segments by the same factor. For dendritic stimulation, the number of synapses on the tree was thereby kept constant. So, both with somatic and dendritic stimulation, the total input to the cell did not change when the size of the dendritic tree was modified.</p>
<p>For presenting the firing patterns from the different tree topologies, we ordered the trees according to the degree of symmetry of their branching structure. To do this, we used a variant of the ranking scheme proposed by Harding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-VanPelt1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Harding1">[40]</xref>. A binary tree can be described by denoting at each node, i.e., a branch point or the root, the sizes of the subtrees (in number of terminal segments) it carries. For example, a tree of size 1 is simply denoted as 1. A tree of size 2 is denoted as 2(1,1). For trees of size 3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), there are two possibilities, 3(1,2(1,1)) and 3(2(1,1),1), but they do not represent topologically different trees, because the only difference is the order of the two subtrees. For trees with four terminal segments, there are two topologically different trees, 4(2(1,1),2(1,1)) and 4(3(2(1,1),1),1). Note that the last tree can also be written in several other ways, e.g., 4(3(1,2(1,1)),1).</p>
<p>To obtain a unique notation, we applied the following two rules. First, if the subtrees at a particular node have a different size, the largest subtree is put left of the comma. So we write 3(2(1,1),1) instead of 3(1,2(1,1)). Second, to order (sub)trees of equal size, we consider to be larger the tree that has the highest number at the first figure in which the tree descriptions differ. So of the following two trees, 4(2(1,1),2(1,1)) and 4(3(2,1),1), the second one is considered to be larger (since 3&gt;2). Thus, in a description of an 8-terminal tree of which these two trees are the subtrees, the second subtree is put first, i.e., 8(4(3(2,1),1),4(2(1,1),2(1,1))).</p>
<p>Once all tree topologies were written in a unique form, they were ordered according to their size (in the extended sense, as described above), whereby the largest one was put first in the list. Since two trees can now be ordered simply by looking at the first figure in which their descriptions differ, this ordering is called a reverse lexicographical ordering. Applied to trees of the same size, it puts trees in order of symmetry, with the most asymmetrical tree first and the most symmetrical tree last. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> shows the ordering of the 23 topologically different trees of 8 terminal segments. Note that the ordering is only used for presentation purposes and does in no way affect the results.</p>

<title>Quantifying burst firing</title>
<p>Bursting is defined as the occurrence of two or more successive spikes with short interspike intervals followed by a relatively long interspike interval. To quantify bursting, we used the burst measure developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-VanElburg1">[41]</xref>. This measure is based solely on spike times and detects the correlated occurrence of one or more short (intraburst) interspike intervals followed by a long (interburst) interspike interval. It quantifies the extent of bursting in the whole spike train; it does not try to identify individual bursts, as some other approaches do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-CocatreZilgien1">[42]</xref>. The burst measure is based on the following notion (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000781.s009">Text S1</xref>). If a spike train consists of spikes with independent successive interspike intervals, the variance of the sum of two successive interspike intervals [<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000781.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000781.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the time of the <italic>i</italic>th spike in the spike train] is twice the variance of the single interspike intervals [<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000781.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>]. If bursting occurs, successive intervals are no longer independent, and this relation is violated. Thus, the difference between the two variances is a measure for bursting. If we divide this difference by the squared average interspike interval, we obtain a normalized burst measure (called <italic>B</italic>) that is sensitive only to the relative sizes of the interspike intervals and not to the average interval size:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000781.e045" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000781.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> means <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000781.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000781.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> stands for taking the expectation or average value of the interspike intervals between two successive spikes in the spike train.

<p>Employing a standard model of a bursting pyramidal cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mainen1">[18]</xref>, we investigated how dendritic morphology influence burst firing by varying either the size or the topology of the apical dendrite. The neurons were activated either at the soma with a fixed current injection or along the dendritic tree with random synaptic input. To facilitate a more comprehensive analysis, we also examined a set of morphologically simplified cells with systematic differences in dendritic topology.</p>

<title>Dendritic size</title>
<p>To investigate how pyramidal cell size influences burst firing, we changed the total length of the apical dendrite according to two methods. In the first method, we successively pruned terminal branches of the apical dendrite. Regression of pyramidal apical dendrities has been observed in response to, for example, chronic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Sousa1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Cook1">[29]</xref> (see further <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref>). The results show that both with somatic and with dendritic stimulation, the degree of bursting decreases as the dendritic tree becomes shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000781.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). Reducing the size of the apical dendrite ultimately transforms the bursting pyramidal cell into a tonically firing cell. The removal of only a few small terminal segments can thereby be enough to completely change the firing state of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Because of the random activation of synapses, the changes in the degree of bursting are more gradual with dendritic than with somatic stimulation. For the rest, the results obtained under both stimulation regimes are similar.</p>

<p>In the second method, we kept the dendritic arborization intact and varied the size of the apical dendritic tree by multiplying the lengths of all its segments by the same factor. Thus, the entire apical dendritic tree was compressed or expanded. Both with somatic and with dendritic stimulation, and in line with the previous results, burst firing disappears as the total dendritic length is decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Interestingly, the pyramidal cell also does not exhibit burst firing when the apical dendrite becomes too large. Only when the length of the apical dendrite remains within a certain range are bursts generated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g004">Fig 4B</xref> shows the firing patterns of the pyramidal cell at increasing lengths of its apical dendrite. When the dendrite is small, the cell does not produce bursts. At a higher dendritic length, the tonic pattern is converted into a burst pattern. Further enlarging the apical dendrite changes the frequency and fine structure of the bursts, until the cell reverts to a non-bursting state.</p>

<p>With somatic stimulation, the transitions from tonic firing to bursting and from bursting to tonic firing occur quite abruptly as dendritic length is modified. As with pruning, this implies that a small change in dendritic length can have a large effect on the firing state of the cell. Because of the stochastic nature of the activation of synapses, the shifts in firing state are more gradual with dendritic than with somatic stimulation, especially from bursting to tonic firing. However, the results obtained under both stimulation regimes are very much comparable, with even the onset and cessation of bursting taking place at approximately the same dendritic sizes.</p>

Thus all the dendritic trees that were generated in this way have exactly the same total length and other metrical properties such as total surface area and differ only in the way their branches are connected. In this set of pyramidal cells, we find cells that produce firing patterns ranging from tonic firing to strongly bursting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Just remodeling the topology of the apical dendrite can completely change the firing state of the cell and turn a bursting cell into tonically firing cell or vice versa. Interestingly, dendritic topology not only affects whether a cell exhibits bursting or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g005">Fig. 5A–C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g005">Fig. 5D–F</xref>), but also influences the fine structure or degree of bursting. The cell displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g005">Fig. 5A</xref> generates (with somatic stimulation) two-spike bursts alternating with single spikes. The cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g005">Figs. 5B and 5C</xref> both produce a pattern of two-spike bursts, but the relative sizes of the interspike intervals between and within bursts are different. Although dendritic stimulation introduces irregularities in firing pattern because of the stochastic nature of the activation of synapses, we find that somatic and dendritic stimulation yield very much comparable results. This is rather surprising because the dynamics of action potential propagation into the dendrites and the return of current back into the soma, which underlies the ping-pong mechanism for burst generation, may completely alter with widespread synaptic stimulation of the dendritic tree owing to changes in the activation states of dendritic ion channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Spruston1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Hoffman1">[46]</xref>.</p>

<p>Using the cell from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, we varied the topology of the apical dendritic tree by swapping branches within the tree. Thus, all the pyramidal cells shown have exactly the same total dendritic length and dendritic surface area and differ only in the topology of their apical dendrite (basal dendrites are the same). Voltage traces for three bursting cells (A–C), and three non-bursting cells (D–F). Scale bar: 100 ms, 50 mV. Scale bar (anatomy): 100 µm.

<title>Morphologically simplified cells</title>
<p>To facilitate a better understanding of our findings obtained with the pyramidal cell model and to analyse more precisely the role of dendritic morphology in shaping burst firing, we also investigated a set of 23 morphologically simplified neurons consisting of all the topologically different trees with 8 terminal segments. Because the cells have relatively few terminal segments, the impact of dendritic topology on burst firing can be studied in a systematic way.</p>

<title>Somatic stimulation</title>
<p>To show how both dendritic length and dendritic topology affect bursting, we plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> for all the 23 tree topologies the degree of bursting, under somatic stimulation, as a function of the total length of the dendritic tree. The total length of a given tree topology was varied by changing the lengths of all the segments in the tree by the same amount. As in the full pyramidal cell model, bursting occurs only for a certain range of tree sizes. Interestingly, this range depends on the topology of the dendritic tree: trees with an asymmetric branching structure start bursting at a lower total dendritic length than trees with a symmetric branching structure, and also stop bursting at a lower total dendritic length. The transitions from tonic firing to bursting and from bursting to tonic firing are not gradual but occur quite abruptly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g006">Fig 6B</xref>) as the dendritic tree is enlarged. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g006">Fig 6D</xref> shows the firing patterns in a fully asymmetrical tree (topology 1) at different tree sizes. With increasing size, the firing pattern goes from high-frequency tonic firing to bursting to low-frequency tonic firing.</p>

<p>Because different tree topologies start and stop bursting at different total lengths, a change in the topology of the tree, while keeping the size of the tree the same (i.e., a change along a vertical line through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), can already shift the firing pattern from bursting to non-bursting or vice versa. For example, with somatic stimulation and at a total dendritic length of 1750 µm, the firing pattern shifts from bursting to tonic firing as the topological structure is changed from asymmetric to symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>

<title>Dendritic stimulation</title>
<p>As with somatic stimulation, with dendritic stimulation there is also only a range of tree sizes where bursting occurs and this range depends on topological structure, with asymmetric trees starting bursting at lower total lengths than symmetric trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). For each tree topology, the onset of bursting takes place at approximately the same total length as with somatic stimulation. As in the full pyramidal cell model, the firing patterns are more irregular and the transitions in firing state more gradual than with somatic stimulation, especially from bursting to tonic firing. For a given tree topology, the firing pattern goes from high-frequency tonic firing to bursting to low-frequency tonic firing as dendritic size is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g007">Fig 7D</xref> shows that dendritic size can also affect the number of spikes per burst. When the dendritic tree is large enough that the cell is capable of generating bursts, it does so with two-spike bursts. Further increasing the dendritic length then yields a firing pattern with up to 4 spikes per burst. As with somatic stimulation, a change in only the topology of the dendritic tree can markedly change the degree of bursting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g007">Fig. 7A and C</xref>).</p>

<title>Dendritic trees with uniform segment diameters</title>
<p>To analyse further how dendritic morphology controls burst firing, we also studied the set of 23 tree topologies with all dendritic segments of a tree having exactly the same diameter. If dendritic diameters obey Rall's power law, as they do in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g006">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g007">7</xref>, asymmetrical topologies have a higher total surface area than symmetrical topologies (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). Therefore, we might hypothesize that dendritic surface area, which affects the input conductance at the soma, underlies the influence of dendritic topology on burst firing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, in which all segment diameters are uniform and all tree topologies consequently have exactly the same total surface area, shows that this is not the case. We observe the same impact of dendritic topology (and size) on burst firing as in the trees obeying Rall's law, with again asymmetric trees starting bursting at lower total lengths than symmetric trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). Note that this is also in agreement with our findings in the pyramidal cell with full morphological complexity, in which all the permutated branching structures have exactly the same total surface area (and length) and nevertheless exhibit different firing patterns.</p>

<title>Input conductance and mean electrotonic path length</title>
<p>Although in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g008">Fig. 8</xref> the total dendritic surface area, for a given dendritic length, is equal for all tree topologies, the tree topologies still differ in input conductance, because of the connectivity structure of the dendritic segments. In asymmetrical trees, the dendritic segments are connected more in series than they are in symmetrical trees, so that the input conductance of asymmetrical trees is lower than that of symmetrical trees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-VanOoyen1">[20]</xref>. Consequently, differences in input conductance might still be responsible for the effect of dendritic topology on burst firing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g009">Fig. 9</xref>, we plot, for trees with uniform segment diameters, the degree of burst firing (color coded) for different dendritic topologies and tree sizes, together with contour lines of equal input conductance.

Thus, differences in input conductance cannot account for the influence of dendritic morphology on burst firing.</p>

<p>What instead appears to be a critical factor is the electrotonic extent of the dendritic tree, as measured by the mean electrotonic path length. The mean electrotonic path length of a dendritic tree is the sum of all electrotonic dendritic path lengths measured from the tip of a terminal segment to the soma divided by the total number of terminal segments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). For trees with uniform segment diameters, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g009">Fig. 9</xref> depicts the degree of burst firing for different topologies and tree sizes, together with contour lines of equal mean electrotonic path length. This reveals that both the onset and the cessation of bursting are strongly related to mean electrotonic path length, with burst firing occurring only within a certain range of values.</p>
<p>We now return to the set of tree topologies in which the segment diameters obey Rall's power law, to see whether mean electrotonic path length is also a determining factor for dendritic trees with a more realistic distribution of diameter sizes. For both somatic and dendritic stimulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g010">Fig. 10</xref> shows that there is indeed a remarkably strong correlation between onset of bursting and mean electrotonic path length. Burst firing occurs when the mean electrotonic path length is higher than a certain critical value. At the same total dendritic length, asymmetrical trees have a higher mean electrotonic path length than symmetrical trees, and consequently reach this critical value earlier than symmetrical trees as dendritic length is increased. The cessation of bursting, especially with somatic stimulation, is also clearly related to mean electrotonic path length, albeit less precise than for the onset of bursting. Thus, the combined effect of dendritic size and dendritic topology on burst firing can be captured to a large extent by the mean electrotonic path length of the dendritic tree.</p>

<title>Importance of electrotonic distance and dendritic topology for burst firing</title>
<p>We next provide an explanation for the importance of mean electrotonic path length for bursting, which is further supported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g011">Fig. 11</xref>. In the burst firing mechanism of pyramidal cells, a somatically generated action potential propagates into the dendritic tree and depolarizes the dendrites, creating a potential difference between distal dendrites and soma. This leads to a return current from dendrites to soma, which, if strong enough, produces another somatic spike (‘ping-pong’ mechanism) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Williams1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Wang1">[13]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>). The arrival of the backpropagating action potential in the dendritic tips marks the onset of the return current (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g011">Fig. 11</xref>). The dendritic tips are, as it were, the reflection points of the backpropagating action potential, where the current starts to move back to the soma. If these return currents reach the soma when the delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> conductance is still high, it will be difficult for the soma to depolarize and produce a spike. Since the propagation velocity of voltages and currents is proportional to the electrotonic length constant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Koch1">[44]</xref>, the mean electronic path length is a measure for the average time it takes for a backpropagating action potential to travel to the dendritic tips (and for the return current to move to the soma). Thus, if the mean electronic path length is too small, the return current will arrive too early at the soma, when the delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> conductance is still high, so that it cannot produce another spike—that is, no bursting.</p>

<title>The importance of electrotonic distance for burst firing and the impact of dendritic topology illustrated with a fully asymmetrical and a fully symmetrical tree.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>, At this dendritic size, the asymmetrical tree (<bold>A</bold>) generates bursts, whereas the symmetrical tree (<bold>B</bold>) produces single spikes. The segment diameters in the trees obey Rall's power law, and both trees have the same total dendritic length (1600 µm). Scale bars: 100 ms, 20 mV. The ticks on top of the action potentials in A and B indicate the spikes that are shown at t+0 and t+13 in panel C. <bold>C</bold>, The membrane potential evolution over time in the asymmetrical tree (<italic>top row</italic>) and the symmetrical tree (<italic>bottom row</italic>) along the dendritic paths indicated in A and B. Time is relative to the first spike (at 0 ms), and membrane position on the x-axis runs from soma to the tip of the terminal segment. Because the distance between soma and terminal segment is smaller in the symmetrical than in the asymmetrical tree, the membrane potential evolution in the symmetrical tree has less spatial differentiation, the membrane potential reaches a lower value at the distal end, and the distal membrane potential start decreasing earlier in time, so that the return current from dendrites to soma reaches the soma at a time when the delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels are still open, preventing the generation of a second spike. See further <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000781.g011" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Furthermore, if the electrotonic distance between soma and distal dendrites is too small, the large conductive coupling will lead to currents that quickly annul membrane potential differences between soma and distal dendrites. This prohibits a strong and long-lasting differentiation in membrane potential between soma and distal dendrites, which is the generator of the return current that lies at the heart of the ping-pong mechanism of bursting. In the limiting case, with very small electrotonic distance, soma and dendrites can be considered as a single compartment with a uniform potential.</p>
<p>If the electrotonic distance between soma and distal dendrites is too large, bursting will also not occur. Note that even in the absence of a return current, the cell will generate a next spike as a result of the external (somatic or dendritic) stimulation. So, what the return current in fact does when it causes bursting is to advance the timing of the next spike. If the electronic distance is too large, the return current will arrive too late—that is, not before the external stimulation has already caused the cell to spike. Furthermore, if the electrotonic distance is too large, the potential gradient between distal dendrites and soma will become too shallow for a strong return current. In summary, for the soma and distal dendrites to engage in a ping-pong interaction, the electrotonic distance between the two should be neither too small nor too large.</p>
<p>Thus, when the mean electrotonic path length becomes too small or too large as the total size of the dendritic tree is varied, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g009">Figs. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g010">10</xref>, bursting will not occur. Importantly, the mean electrotonic path length depends also on the topology of the dendritic tree, which accounts for the influence of dendritic topology on burst firing. In asymmetrical trees, the terminal segments are on average further away from the soma than in symmetrical trees. Consequently, at the same dendritic size, asymmetrical trees have a higher mean electrotonic path length—as well as ‘normal’ mean path length—than symmetrical trees. As a result, asymmetrical trees reach the critical values of mean electrotonic path length from where bursting starts, and from where it stops, at lower dendritic sizes than symmetrical trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g009">Figs. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g010">10</xref>).</p>
<p>To illustrate the importance of electrotonic distance for bursting and the impact of topological structure, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g011">Fig. 11</xref> the potential evolution over time along the dendrites of a fully asymmetrical and a fully symmetrical tree. Both trees have the same total dendritic length. At this dendritic size, the asymmetrical tree exhibits burst firing and the symmetrical one does not. The spatiotemporal dynamics of membrane potential along the dendrite of the symmetrical tree shows two main differences compared with that of the asymmetrical tree. First, the potential evolution has less spatial differentiation. In the asymmetrical tree, the electrotonic (and normal) distance between soma and distal dendrites is large enough for a full propagating wave to develop (between <italic>t</italic>+0.75 and <italic>t</italic>+1.5), whereas in the symmetrical tree it is not. The membrane potential at the distal end also reaches a lower value than in the asymmetrical tree. Second, although the membrane potential at the distal end of the symmetrical tree decreases between <italic>t</italic>+1.5 and <italic>t</italic>+3, this does not result in an increase in the membrane potential at the soma. In the symmetrical tree, the distal membrane potential start decreasing earlier in time than in the asymmetrical tree, so that the return current from the dendrites will arrive at the soma when the delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels are still open, hampering somatic depolarization. Consequently, the membrane potential is not raised enough to trigger another spike, whereas in the asymmetrical tree it is (between <italic>t</italic>+12.25 and <italic>t</italic>+13.75).</p>
<p>We now return to the pyramidal cells with full morphological complexity, to see whether burst firing is also there related to mean electrotonic path length. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g012">Fig. 12</xref>, we plot the mean electrotonic path length against the degree of bursting for the set of permutated pyramidal cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. All these cells have exactly the same total dendritic length and dendritic surface area and differ only in the arrangement of their branches. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g012">Fig. 12</xref> shows that burst firing indeed strongly correlates with mean electrotonic path length, for both somatic and dendritic stimulation.</p>

<p>In general, the results obtained with dendritic stimulation are comparable to those produced with somatic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g003">Figs. 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g006">Fig. 6</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g010">Fig. 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g012">Fig. 12</xref>). In the ping-pong mechanism of burst firing, the sequence and timing of events start when a somatic action potential propagates into the dendritic tree. How this action potential is generated in the first place, by current injection into the soma or as a result of summation of dendritic synaptic inputs, appears not to be crucial. The dynamics of action potential propagation and the return of current back into the soma may be modulated by synaptic stimulation of the dendritic tree, but also under dendritic stimulation the mean electrotonic path length serves as the functionally relevant measure for the time it takes for the propagation of signals between soma and dendritic tips.</p>

<p>Given the crucial role of bursts of action potentials in synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling, it is important to determine what factors influence their generation. Using a standard compartmental model of a reconstructed pyramidal cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mainen1">[18]</xref>, we have investigated how size and topology of dendritic morphology affect intrinsic neuronal burst firing.</p>
<p>We have shown that either shortening or lengthening the apical dendrite tree beyond a certain range can transform a bursting pyramidal cell into a tonically firing cell. Remarkably, altering only the topology of the dendritic tree, whereby the total length of the tree remains unchanged, can likewise shift the firing pattern from bursting to non-bursting or vice versa. Moreover, both dendritic size and dendritic topology not only influence whether a cell is bursting or not, but also affect the number of spikes per burst and the interspike intervals between and within bursts.</p>
<p>The influence of dendritic morphology on burst firing is attributable to the effect dendritic length and dendritic topology have, not on input conductance, but on the spatial extent of the dendritic tree, as measured by the mean electrotonic path length between soma and distal dendrites. For the spatiotemporal dynamics of dendritic membrane potential to generate burst firing, this electrotonic distance should be neither too small nor too large. Because the degree of symmetry of the dendritic tree also determines mean electrotonic path length, with asymmetrical trees having larger mean path lengths than symmetrical trees, dendritic topology as well as dendritic size affects the occurrence of burst firing.</p>
<p>In Mainen and Sejnowski's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mainen1">[18]</xref> two-compartment model for explaining the role of dendritic morphology in shaping firing pattern, the spatial dimension of morphology was completely reduced away. Although the model is able to reproduce a wide range of firing patterns, it does not capture the essential influence of dendritic morphology on burst firing, in which, as we have shown here, the spatial extent of the dendritic tree and the resulting spatiotemporal dynamics of the dendritic membrane potential are crucially involved.</p>
<p>The effect of dendritic size and topology on burst firing and the correlation of burst firing region with mean electrotonic path length are robust to changes in model properties, including morphology, strength of input stimulus, ion channel densities, and keeping the number of ion channels constant as morphology is changed. The specific range of dendritic sizes that supports burst firing, as well as the impact of dendritic topology, does not strongly depend on the strength of the input stimulus, especially with somatic stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000781.s001">Figs. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000781.s002">S2</xref>). More importantly, the overall way in which dendritic morphology influences burst firing is independent of stimulus strength. Likewise, the impact of dendritic morphology is qualitatively insensitive to the value of the branch power used in the morphologically simplified cells: even in dendritic trees in which the segment diameters are uniform we observe the same effect of dendritic length and topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000781-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
<p>In changing dendritic size or topology, we held the density of ion channels constant (i.e., the conductances were fixed), which implies that the total number of ion channels also changed when dendritic morphology was varied. Keeping the conductances fixed seems biologically the most appropriate choice, since removing membrane to shrink the dendritic tree (as well as adding membrane to enlarge it) will include the membrane's ion channels and is therefore not expected to affect ion channel density. But even if we hold the number of ion channels constant, by adjusting the values of the conductances as the surface area of the dendritic tree is changed when dendritic topology or total length is varied, we obtain surprisingly similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000781.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Although the precise values of mean electrotonic path length that support burst firing are slightly different, the overall effect of dendritic size and topology on burst firing and the correlation of burst firing region with mean electrotonic path length remain the same.</p>
<p>Since recent studies have shown that the same firing patterns can be produced by different combinations of conductances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Prinz1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Achard1">[48]</xref> and even by different combinations of conductances and morphological properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Weaver1">[49]</xref>, it is important to ensure that our results are not specific for the particular choice of conductance values in the Mainen and Sejnowski model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mainen1">[18]</xref>. Provided the model supports the ping-pong mechanisms of burst firing, our main findings are indeed robust to considerable changes in ion channel densities, both under somatic and under dendritic stimulation. Although the range of tree sizes that supports burst firing may be different for different ion channel densities, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000781.s004">Figs. S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000781.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000781.s006">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000781.s007">S7</xref> show that the general impact of dendritic size and topology on burst firing, as well as the correlation of burst firing with mean electrotonic path length, is maintained for a wide range of dendritic ion channel densities. Interestingly, the value of the mean electrotonic path length where burst firing commences, going from small to large trees, is not affected by ion channel density, as opposed to the value of the mean electrotonic path length where burst firing stops. This suggests that when the dendritic tree is reduced in size so that the cell no longer exhibits burst firing, compensatory changes in ion channel conductances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Weaver1">[49]</xref> may not be able to bring back the cell to a bursting mode. In contrast, when the dendritic tree is enlarged beyond the range where the cell bursts, compensatory changes in ion channel conductances (e.g., increased dendritic <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000781.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) may be able to restore burst firing.</p>
<p>Since it has experimentally been shown that removal of the apical dendrite abolishes bursting in layer 5 pyramidal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Bekkers1">[50]</xref> and pathological conditions often affect the apical dendrite, but not the basal dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Cook1">[29]</xref>, we focused in this study on the morphology of the apical dendritic tree. The simulations with the morphologically simplified cells, which do not have basal dendrites, show that basal dendrites are not essential for burst firing. In the pyramidal cell and the simplified cells, burst firing is similarly affected by dendritic morphology, which again emphasizes the robustness of our findings.</p>
<p>Compared with other modeling studies investigating the relationship between dendritic morphology and firing pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mainen1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Krichmar1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Washington1">[51]</xref>, our study is unique in that it focuses on burst firing, adopts a systematic approach, investigates morphological changes within a cell type, considers not only somatic stimulation but also physiologically more appropriate dendritic stimulation, and especially examines the impact of topological structure of dendritic arborizations. Moreover, our study is not just correlative but provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the influence of morphology on firing pattern.</p>
<p>We stimulated the cells either by a current injection at the soma, as is done in most experimental and modeling studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mainen1">[18]</xref>, or by synapses distributed over the dendritic tree, which is physiologically more relevant. Importantly, we found that the influence of dendritic morphology on burst firing is essentially the same under both stimulation regimes.</p>
<p>Our study confirms a suggestion by Krichmar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Krichmar1">[21]</xref> that dendritic branching structure might have a direct influence on neuronal firing activity. In simulation studies, they found that although dendritic size could account for much of the differences in neuronal firing behavior between CA3 pyramidal cells, it did not provide a complete explanation for the observed electrophysiological variability.</p>
<p>Our results are in accord with empirical observations suggesting that pyramidal cells should have reached a minimal size to be capable of burst firing. In weakly electric fish, the tendency of pyramidal cells to fire bursts is positively correlated with the size of the cell's apical dendritic tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Bastian1">[52]</xref>. In rat prefrontal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Yang1">[16]</xref> and visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Mason1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Larkman3">[53]</xref>, the classes of pyramidal cells that exhibit burst firing have a greater total dendritic length than the other classes.</p>
<p>In addition, the developmental time course of bursting shows similarities with that of dendritic morphology. In rat sensorimotor cortex, the proportion of bursting pyramidal cells progressively increases from postnatal day 7 onwards, while at the same time the dendritic arborizations become more complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Franceschetti1">[54]</xref>. In pyramidal cells from rat prefrontal cortex, the total lengths of apical and basal dendrites increase dramatically between postnatal days 3 and 21, with neurons capable of burst firing appearing only from postnatal day 18 onwards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Zhang1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Dgentais1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Direct experimental testing of the influence of dendritic morphology on burst firing could be done by physically manipulating the shape or size of the dendritic tree, e.g., by using techniques developed by Bekkers and Häusser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Bekkers1">[50]</xref>. They showed that dendrotomy of the apical dendrite indeed abolished bursting in layer 5 pyramidal cells.</p>
<p>Dendritic morphology can undergo significant alterations in many pathological conditions, including chronic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Sousa1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Cook1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Magarios1">[57]</xref>, epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Teskey1">[26]</xref>, hypoxic ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Ruan1">[58]</xref>, Alzheimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Yamada1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Moolman1">[23]</xref>, and disorders associated with mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Kaufmann1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Dierssen1">[25]</xref>. Functional consequences of these morphological changes are usually interpreted in terms of loss or formation of synaptic connections as a result of a diminished or expanded postsynaptic surface area. Our modeling results indicate that alterations in dendritic morphology can directly modify neuronal firing, irrespective of changes in total synaptic input.</p>
<p>Chronic stress, as well as daily administration of corticosterone, induces extensive regression of pyramidal apical dendrites in hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Sousa1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Magarios1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Woolley1">[59]</xref> and prefrontal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Radley1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Cook1">[29]</xref>. As a result of a decrease in the number and length of terminal branches, the total apical dendritic length can reduce by as much as 32% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Cook1">[29]</xref>, while basal dendrites are not affected. Similarly large alterations have been observed in response to mild, short-term stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Brown1">[60]</xref>. Our results predict that stress and the accompanying reduction in apical dendritic length could turn a bursting neuron into a non-bursting one. Indeed, Okuhara and Beck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Okuhara1">[61]</xref> found that two weeks of high corticosterone treatment caused a decrease in the relative number of intrinsically bursting CA3 pyramidal cells. Since burst firing of CA3 pyramidal cells is critically involved in LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Bains1">[62]</xref>, this could have profound functional consequences for hippocampal information processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Pavlides1">[63]</xref>.</p>
<p>With regard to epilepsy, a significant decrease in total dendritic length and number of branches has been found in pyramidal cells following neocortical kindling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Teskey1">[26]</xref>. In line with our results, Valentine et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Valentine1">[64]</xref> reported that activity of single cells recorded from the primary auditory cortex of kindled cats showed a reduction in the amount of burst firing and a decrease in the number of spikes per burst.</p>
<p>In Alzheimer's disease, various aberrations in dendritic morphology have been observed— including a reduction in total dendritic length and number of dendritic branches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Yamada1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Moolman1">[23]</xref> and alterations in the pattern of dendritic arborization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Arendt1">[65]</xref>—which may contribute to the abnormal neurophysiological properties of Alzheimer pyramidal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Stern1">[66]</xref>. The anomalies in morphology could influence the cells' ability to produce burst, and, because of the role of burst firing in LTP and LTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-YunS1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Birtoli1">[9]</xref>, ultimately affect cognition. In disorders related with mental retardation, the observed alterations in dendritic length and pattern of dendritic branching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Kaufmann1">[24]</xref>, e.g., changes in the degree of symmetry of the apical dendrite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Belichenko1">[67]</xref>, may likewise be hypothesized to contribute to impaired cognition. Importantly, our results indicate that dendritic sprouting—which too has been observed in Alzheimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Scheibel1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Masliah1">[69]</xref>—may also be able to change neuronal burst firing.</p>
<p>Since firing patterns characteristic of different classes of neurons may in part be determined by total dendritic length, we expect on the basis of our results that a neuron may try to keep its dendritic size within a restricted range in order to maintain functional performance. Indeed, Samsonovich and Ascoli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Samsonovich1">[70]</xref> have shown that total dendritic size appears to be under intrinsic homeostatic control. Statistically analyzing a large collection of pyramidal cells from hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, they found that, for a given morphological class and anatomical location, fluctuations in dendritic size in one part of a cell tend to be counterbalanced by changes in other parts of the same cell, so that the total dendritic size of each cell is conserved.</p>
<p>We predict that dendritic topology may similarly be protected from large variations. In fact, there could be a trade-off between dendritic size and dendritic topology. In a set of bursting pyramidal cells, we expect that apical dendritic trees with a lower degree of symmetry are shorter in terms of total dendritic length or have thicker dendrites to reduce electrotonic length than those with a higher degree of symmetry.</p>
<p>Although changes in dendrite morphology of pyramidal cells have been observed in response to environmental enrichment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Volkmar1">[71]</xref> and learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Black1">[72]</xref>, recent long-term in vivo imaging studies have demonstrated remarkable stability of dendrites in adult animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Trachtenberg1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Grutzendler1">[74]</xref>. Like the homeostatic control of dendritic size, this stability may point to the functional relevance of dendritic topology.</p>
<p>An intriguing possibility is that firing pattern and dendritic morphology could mutually tune each other during development, as a result of a reciprocal influence between dendritic growth and neuronal activity. Dendritic morphology affects firing pattern, and neuronal activity in turn is known to modulate dendritic growth and branching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Konur1">[75]</xref>, with, interestingly, firing frequency and firing pattern having distinct effects on outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Fields1">[76]</xref>.</p>
<p>As our study underscores, differences in neuronal firing properties may not necessarily reflect differences in ion channel composition. In some cases, variability in dendritic morphology may even have a relatively bigger effect on firing pattern than variability in membrane conductances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Weaver1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000781-Schaefer1">[77]</xref>. Our results show that alterations in either the size or the topology of dendritic arborizations, as have been observed in many pathological conditions, could have a marked impact on pyramidal cell burst firing and, because of the critical role of bursting in neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity, ultimately affect cognition.</p>

<p>The mean electrotonic path length correlates with the region of burst firing also when the number of ion channels is kept constant as the topology or total length of the tree is changed. To implement a constant number of ion channels, we decreased (increased) the ion channel densities (i.e., maximal conductances, expressed in pS µm∧−2) as the total surface area of the dendritic tree increased (decreased). The total dendritic surface area of the fully symmetrical tree (topology 23) at dendritic length 2500 µm was thereby taken as reference. Thus, g_x new = g_x * (surface area of the symmetrical tree at 2500 µm)/(surface area of the tree under consideration), where g_x is the standard maximal conductance as given in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> and the index x indicates channel type.
