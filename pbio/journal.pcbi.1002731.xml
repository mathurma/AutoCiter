      <abstract>
        <p>There is accumulating evidence that prior knowledge about expectations plays an important role in perception. The Bayesian framework is the standard computational approach to explain how prior knowledge about the distribution of expected stimuli is incorporated with noisy observations in order to improve performance. However, it is unclear what information about the prior distribution is acquired by the perceptual system over short periods of time and how this information is utilized in the process of perceptual decision making. Here we address this question using a simple two-tone discrimination task. We find that the “contraction bias”, in which small magnitudes are overestimated and large magnitudes are underestimated, dominates the pattern of responses of human participants. This contraction bias is consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis in which the true prior information is available to the decision-maker. However, a trial-by-trial analysis of the pattern of responses reveals that the contribution of most recent trials to performance is overweighted compared with the predictions of a standard Bayesian model. Moreover, we study participants' performance in a-typical distributions of stimuli and demonstrate substantial deviations from the ideal Bayesian detector, suggesting that the brain utilizes a heuristic approximation of the Bayesian inference. We propose a biologically plausible model, in which decision in the two-tone discrimination task is based on a comparison between the second tone and an exponentially-decaying average of the first tone and past tones. We show that this model accounts for both the contraction bias and the deviations from the ideal Bayesian detector hypothesis. These findings demonstrate the power of Bayesian-like heuristics in the brain, as well as their limitations in their failure to fully adapt to novel environments.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In this paper we study how history affects perception using an auditory delayed comparison task, in which human participants repeatedly compare the frequencies of two, temporally-separated pure tones. We demonstrate that the history of the experiment has a substantial effect on participants' performance: when both tones are high relative to past stimuli, people tend to report that the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone was higher, and when they are relatively low, they tend to report that the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was higher. Interestingly, only the most recent trials bias performance, which can be interpreted as if the participants assume that the statistics of stimuli in the experiment is highly volatile. Moreover, this bias persists even in settings, in which it is detrimental to performance. These results demonstrate the abilities, as well as limitations, of the cognitive system when incorporating expectations in perception.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Perception is a complex cognitive process, in which noisy signals are extracted from the environment and interpreted. It is generally believed that perceptual resolution is limited by internal noise that constrains our ability to differentiate physically similar stimuli. The magnitude of this internal noise is typically estimated using the 2-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm, which was introduced to eliminate participants' perceptual and response biases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Green1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Macmillan1">[2]</xref>. In this paradigm, a participant is presented with two temporally-separated stimuli that differ along a physical dimension and is instructed to compare them. The common assumption is that the probability of a correct response is determined by the physical difference between the two stimuli, relative to the level of internal noise. Performance is typically characterized by the threshold of discrimination, referred to as the Just Noticeable Difference (JND). Thus, the JND is a measure of the level of internal noise such that the higher the JND, the higher the inferred internal noise.</p>
      <p>However, the idea that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the JND and the internal noise is inconsistent with theoretical considerations which postulate that participants' performance can be improved by taking into account expectations about the stimuli in the process of perception or decision-making. If the internal representation of a stimulus was uncertain, the prior expectations should bias the participant against unlikely stimuli. The larger the uncertainty, the larger the contribution of these prior expectations should be. The Bayesian theory of inference describes how expectations regarding the probability distribution of stimuli should be combined with the noisy representations of these stimuli in order to optimize performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Knill1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In fact, expectations, formalized as prior distribution of stimuli used in the experiment, have been shown to bias participants' responses in a way that is consistent with the Bayesian framework (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Krding1">[4]</xref>). In particular, responses in the 2AFC paradigm have been shown to be biased by prior expectations: when the magnitudes of the two stimuli are small relative to the distribution of stimuli used in the experiment, participants tend to respond that the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus was larger, whereas they tend to respond that the 2<sup>nd</sup> stimulus was larger when the magnitudes of the two stimuli are relatively large <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Berliner1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Ashourian1">[7]</xref>. In a previous study we have shown that this bias, known as the “contraction bias”, can be understood in the Bayesian framework: following the presentation of the two stimuli, the participant combines her noisy representations of the two stimuli with the prior distribution of the stimuli to form two posterior distributions. Rather than comparing the two noisy representations of the stimuli, the participant is assumed to compare the two posteriors in order to maximize the probability of a correct response. The contribution of the prior distribution to the two posteriors is not equal. The larger the level of noise in the representation of the stimulus, the larger is the contribution of the prior distribution to the posterior. The level of noise in the representation of the magnitude of the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus is larger than the level of noise in the representation of the magnitude of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stimulus because of the noise associated with the encoding and maintenance of the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus in memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Bull1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Wickelgren1">[9]</xref>. As a result, the posterior distribution of the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus is biased more by the prior distribution than the posterior distribution of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stimulus. If the prior distribution is unimodal, both posteriors are contracted towards the median of the prior distribution. Because the posterior of the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus is contracted more than the posterior of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stimulus, participants' responses are biased towards overestimating the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus when it is relatively small and underestimating it when it is relatively large <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Ashourian1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One limitation of the Bayesian model is that it relies heavily on the assumption that the prior distribution of stimuli is known to the observer. While this assumption may be plausible in very long experiments comprising a large number of trials (e.g. thousands in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Krding2">[10]</xref>) or in experiments utilizing natural tasks (e.g., reading, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Norris1">[11]</xref>), it is unclear how Bayesian inference can take place if participants have less experience in the task.</p>
      <p>In this paper we study participants' pattern of responses in a 2AFC tone discrimination task in relatively short experiments consisting of tens of trials. We report a substantial contraction bias that persists even when it hampers performance due to a-typical statistics. We show that participants' pattern of behavior is consistent with an “implicit memory” model, in which the representation of previous stimuli is a single scalar that continuously updates with examples. Thus, this model can be viewed as a simple implementation of the Bayesian model that provides a better account of participants' perceptual decision making.</p>

        <p>We measured the performance of our participants in the random 2AFC paradigm (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), in which subjects compared the frequencies of two sequentially presented tones drawn from a broad frequency range. Averaged across the population of participants, the JND was 13.6%±0.7% (SEM), which is higher than typically reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Wier1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Dai1">[13]</xref>). The relatively high value of the JND, which is likely to result from the lack of experience of the participants and the fact that no reference was used, is comparable with previous studies using the random frequency paradigm, with short stimuli and untrained participants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Ahissar1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Nahum1">[15]</xref>.</p>

            <p>On each trial two 50 ms tones, separated by an interval of 950 ms, were played and the participant was asked to respond which of the 2 tones was higher by pressing a button. Immediately after the button press, visual feedback in the form of a smiling face for correct answers, and a sad face for incorrect answers was presented for 300 ms. The inter-trial-interval was 700 ms.; The two frequencies were drawn from a wide distribution and their ratio was determined by a staircase paradigm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>

        <p>As predicted by the contraction bias, the JND did not capture the full pattern of participants' responses. This is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. The coordinates of each dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> correspond to the frequencies of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> tones in a trial, referred to as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Blue and red dots denote trials, in which the participant's response was correct and incorrect, respectively. The closer the dots are to the diagonal, the smaller is the difference in the frequencies of the two tones. Therefore naively, one would expect that the probability of a trial to be incorrect (red dot) would be highest near the diagonal. Moreover, if the probability of a correct response as a function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is symmetrical around 0, as implicitly assumed when measuring the JND, then the pattern of red and blue dots is expected to be symmetrical around the diagonal. In contrast, we found that the pattern of incorrect responses is highly non-symmetrical. Participants tended to err more when both frequencies were high and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and when both frequencies were low and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To quantify this asymmetry, we considered separately two regions: the Bias+ region corresponds to trials in two sections of this plane (yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>): in the first section are trials in which the frequencies of both stimuli are <italic>above</italic> the median (1000 Hz) and the frequency of the 1<sup>st</sup> tone is <italic>lower</italic> than that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone. In the second section are trials in which the frequencies of both stimuli are <italic>below</italic> the median frequency and the frequency of the 1<sup>st</sup> tone is <italic>higher</italic> than that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone. Similarly, The Bias− region (gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) corresponded to trials in which the frequencies of both stimuli are <italic>above</italic> the median (1000 Hz) and the frequency of the 1<sup>st</sup> tone is <italic>higher</italic> than that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone and trials in which the frequencies of both stimuli are <italic>below</italic> the median frequency and the frequency of the 1<sup>st</sup> tone is <italic>lower</italic> than that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone. Participants' rate of success differed greatly between the Bias+ and Bias− regions. Participants were typically successful when either the two tones were low (&lt;1000 Hz) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone was lower (lower left yellow region, 88.2%±0.5% correct responses, mean ± SEM) or when the two tones were high (&gt;1000 Hz) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone was higher (upper yellow region, 88.4%±0.6% correct responses). On the other hand, performance was relatively poor either when the two tones were low and the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was lower (lower left gray region, 63.2%±0.8% correct responses) or when the two tones were high and the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was higher (upper gray region, 61.8%±0.8% correct responses). These effects were highly significant in each of the two quadrants (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, Monte Carlo Permutation test). The differential level of proficiency in the yellow and gray regions indicates a substantial contraction bias, in line with that bias described in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Preuschhof1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Ashourian1">[7]</xref>: when the frequency of the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was relatively low, participants tended to overestimate it (leading to successful performance when the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was higher). The opposite was true when the frequency of the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was relatively high (leading to successful performance when the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was lower). The differential level of proficiency in the yellow and gray regions is evident not only in the response pattern of the population of participants but also in the response pattern in individual blocks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002731.s001">Fig. S1A–C</xref>). Moreover, it was evident for all levels of proficiency in the task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002731.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>).</p>

The vertical and horizontal lines correspond to the lines in which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively.

These lines partition the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> space into different regions, denoted using a different background color. The numbers in each region denote the fraction of correct responses in the region ± SEM. Note that the pattern of correct responses is not symmetrical with respect to the diagonal, as expected from a participant whose probability of success in the trial depends solely on the ratio of the two frequencies. <bold>B</bold>.

Bins in which the number of trials was smaller than 50 were not analyzed and are colored green. Note in particular the 2 squares marked by arrows. Although they are of equal ‘objective’ difficulty (they are located at the same distance from the diagonal), performance differed substantially: in the square denoted by the upper arrow performance was at chance level (50.8% correct responses) whereas in the square denoted by the lower arrow it was 92.3%.</p>

        <p>To further illustrate the contraction bias, we constructed a two-dimensional histogram of participants' performance by binning the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> space of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> and computing the fraction of correct responses in each bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, grayscale). The non-symmetrical distribution of the shades of gray of the squares around the diagonal reflects the contraction bias. Note in particular the two squares denoted by arrows. Despite the fact that they were of equal ‘objective’ difficulty (the absolute difference in frequencies was the same), the performance in the bottom right square region was almost perfect (92.2% correct responses; <italic>n</italic> = 324), whereas it was almost at chance level in the top left square region (50.8% correct responses; <italic>n</italic> = 323; <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−33</sup>, Fisher's exact test). It should be noted that the bias in participants' response cannot be accounted for by a general preference in favor of one of the alternative answers, because the bias is opposite in the low and high frequencies.</p>
        <p>The non-symmetrical performance around the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) is not captured by a single performance measure, the JND. This has motivated us to consider a measure of performance that captures some of this asymmetry. To that goal, we computed two separate JNDs for each participant (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>): one for the trials in the regions in which the contraction bias augments behavior (Bias+, yellow) and the other for the regions in which the contraction bias impairs behavior (Bias−, gray). These JNDs differed by more than 6 fold (the medians of JNDs across the population were 4.1%, and 27.0% for the Bias+ and Bias− regions, respectively; <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>, Monte Carlo Permutation test). In fact, as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002731.s002">Fig. S2</xref> in the Supporting Information section, a participant's proficiency on a trial depended more on the contraction bias (i.e. Bias+ versus Bias− regions) than on the participant's overall proficiency (overall low versus high JND). These results demonstrate the substantial contribution of this bias to behavior.</p>

        <title>Recency effect and the prior distribution</title>
        <p>In a previous study we have shown that the contraction bias in a visual discrimination task is consistent with a model of an ideal detector that utilizes Bayes' rule to incorporate the prior distribution with the sensed stimuli in order to optimize performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Ashourian1">[7]</xref>. In agreement with that study, such a Bayesian model, with 2 free parameters that correspond to the noise in the internal representation of each of the two stimuli, can qualitatively account for the observed contraction in the two-tone discrimination task (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002731.s003">Fig. S3</xref> in the Supporting Information section).</p>
        <p>However, it should be noted that the Bayesian model relies on the assumption that the prior distribution of stimuli is known to the observer, which seems unreasonable in our experiment, which consisted of merely tens of trials. Therefore, it is not clear how the history of trials experienced by the participants in the experiment contributes to the bias. To address this question, we considered the contribution of individual trials to the bias. Because the statistics of stimuli in our experiment are stationary, all past trials are equally informative about the prior distribution. Therefore, normative considerations that incorporate an assumption of stationarity imply that the effect of past trials on participants' choices will be independent of the number of trials elapsed between these trials and the choice. By contrast, previous studies have reported that participants' responses are influenced to a greater degree by recent stimuli, which is known as the recency effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Holland1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Stewart1">[21]</xref>. In addition, the activity of neurons in the primary auditory cortex has been shown to contain information about both current and previous stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Ulanovsky1">[22]</xref>. To test for recency in our dataset, we fitted a linear non-linear model that relates the response in each trial to a linear combination of present and past stimuli according to the following equation:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002731.e013"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the probability that the model would report that the frequency of the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was higher than that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone in trial <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the normal cumulative distribution function such that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are parameters, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the frequencies of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> tone, respectively, in trial <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the geometric mean of the frequencies of all stimuli in the experiment until trial <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>To gain insights into the behavior of the model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002731.e013">Eq.

In contrast, if the participant assumes that the statistics of the experiment is non-stationary then we expect the most recent trials to have a stronger effect on behavior, resulting in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> whose magnitude decreases as the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases.</p>

This result reflects the simple fact that the tones presented in a trial influence the decision in that trial more than tones presented in previous trials. The recency effect is manifested in the non-zero coefficients of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, the contribution of past trials to choice diminishes within several trials. This result is consistent with other findings of rapid perceptual learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Agus1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Chalk1">[24]</xref> (but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Chopin1">[25]</xref>) and demonstrates that at least some aspects of the prior distribution are estimated using a small number of the most recent trials.

Otherwise it responds that “<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>”. In this model we assume that the noise is restricted to the representation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The reason for ignoring noise in the representation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is that noise in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is mathematically equivalent to a larger magnitude noise in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when considering decision in a given trial.</p>
        <p>It is easy to show that in this model, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an exponentially weighted sum of the current and past stimuli and their respective encoding noises:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002731.e102"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e102" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>Note that in this model past values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> do not contribute to behavior.

It should also be noted that in this model, the contribution of past stimuli to decision (which plays the role of the prior distribution in the Bayesian model) is encoded using the same variable as the encoding of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, the model does not require any form of separate representation of the long term memory of past trials.</p>
        <p>The implicit-memory model is characterized by two parameters that denote the level of noise, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the extent to which the history of the experiment affects perception, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g004">Fig. 4</xref> depicts the results of a simulation of a population of implicit memory models, each with the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> best fitting a single block in our dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

A quantitative analysis reveals that the goodness-of-fit of the Implicit memory model is comparable to that of the Bayesian model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002731.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). However, in contrast to be Bayesian model that assumes a constant prior, the contribution of very recent trials to performance (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002731.e013">Eq.

        <title>The rigidity of the contraction bias</title>
        <p>The contraction bias in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2</xref> can be justified using optimality considerations, in which prior knowledge is incorporated with the observations in order to maximize performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002731.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Would contraction bias persist in an experiment in which it impairs performance due to the dependencies between the frequency distribution of the two tones?</p>
        <p>In order to address this question, we conducted a second experiment (Experiment 2 in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), in which we manipulated the correlations between the frequencies of the two tones such that in some blocks the contraction bias is beneficial to performance whereas in others it is detrimental. Contraction bias is beneficial in the Bias+ region (yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Figs. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g004">4A</xref>) and is detrimental in the Bias− region (gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Figs. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g004">4A</xref>). Therefore, in this experiment we manipulated the fraction of trials in the Bias+ and Bias− regions in different blocks. In one condition, the two tones were chosen such that the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone was typically higher than the 1<sup>st</sup> when the two frequencies were relatively high, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> tone was typically lower than the 1<sup>st</sup> when the two frequencies were relatively low. We refer to this condition as the ‘Bias+ condition’, because there were many more trials in the Bias+ region than in the Bias− region (11,233 vs. 1172). In the other condition, the two tones were chosen such that the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was typically higher than the 2<sup>nd</sup> when the frequencies of the two tones were relatively high and the 1<sup>st</sup> tone was typically lower than the 2<sup>nd</sup> when the frequencies of the two tones were relatively low. This ‘Bias− condition‘ was comprised of substantially more trials in the Bias− region than in the Bias+ region (8111 vs. 952). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g005">Figs. 5A and 5B</xref> depict the distribution of trials and correct and incorrect responses in the Bias+ and Bias− conditions, respectively. Similar to the pattern of responses in the first experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), participants were more likely to be correct in the Bias+ regions, compared to the Bias− regions. This was true both for the Bias+ condition (82.0%±0.4% correct responses vs. 44.5%±1.6% correct responses, p&lt;10<sup>−126</sup> Fisher exact test) and the Bias− condition (88.0%±1.2% correct responses vs. 72.6%±0.6% correct responses, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−21</sup> Fisher exact test).

        <p>In the framework of the Bayesian model, the difference in proficiency between the two conditions is surprising because given the joint distribution, the detection problem in the two conditions is symmetric. However, our results indicate that our participants did not utilize these probabilities when making a decision about the relative frequencies in this task.</p>
        <p>To test the ability of the implicit-memory model to account for the results of the second experiment, we fitted the parameters of the model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to the experimental data of the Bias+ condition. We then simulated each of the model participants in both the Bias+ and Bias− conditions. The resulting JNDs (mean ± SEM 3.7%±0.5% and 13.3%±0.9% for the Bias+ and Bias− conditions, respectively, purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) are not statistically different from to the experimentally measured JNDs (4.3%±0.6% and 14.1%±1.6%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.78 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.85, respectively, Wilcoxon rank sum test), suggesting that the participants did not utilize the differential statistics of the two tones in the two conditions. For example, they did not decrease the weights of recent trials even when their performance was consequently hampered. In fact, adapting to the Bias− condition simply by setting the weight of the history-dependence parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to 0 (effectively eliminating the contribution of past stimuli to decision in the model) would have improved their performance. To demonstrate this, we simulated the model participants in the Bias− condition while assuming that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The resultant JND was only 9.1%±0.7%, lower than the JND of the model participants when assuming the history-dependence parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> measured in the Bias+ condition.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this work we showed that the contraction bias is a dominant determinant of participants' behavior in a 2AFC tone frequency discrimination task. Some aspects of this bias are consistent with the behavior of an ideal detector that utilizes the prior distribution to maximize performance. However, a substantial recency effect combined with a failure of the participants to utilize the joint distribution of the stimuli implies that this Bayesian-like computation is approximated using a much simpler algorithm, in which the prior distribution is not fully represented.</p>
      <p>What information does the cognitive system store about the prior distribution? The full Bayesian model represents one extreme approach, in which it is assumed that the participant has full information about the joint distribution of the two stimuli. The standard way in which signal detection theory is applied to psychophysics represents the other extreme, in which the participant does not have (or does not utilize) any prior information about the identity of the stimuli (but only about the probability of each response being correct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Green1">[1]</xref>). The contraction bias in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2</xref> demonstrates that participants have some information about the marginal probabilities. However, the strong recency effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) indicates that this marginal probability is constantly updated using a small number of most recent observations, even in stationary environments. In a normative framework, the recency effect, observed previously in various tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Neiman1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Summerfield1">[27]</xref>, implies that participants believe that the environment is highly volatile and as a result only the very recent history is informative about future stimuli.</p>
      <p>The results of experiment 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) indicate that participants are either unable to compute the joint distribution or unable to utilize it, at least within a single experimental block of 80 trials. The implicit memory model can be viewed as a minimal modification of the standard approach of applying signal detection theory to perception in the direction of the full Bayesian model. Here, participants represent the prior distribution of the stimuli with a single scalar, which is an estimate of the mean of the marginal of the prior distribution. Nevertheless this implicit model captures many aspects of the behavioral results. Further studies are needed to determine whether, and to what extent other moments of the prior distributions are learned and utilized in the 2AFC discrimination task, especially under longer exposure to distribution statistics.</p>
      <p>Several studies have shown that the magnitude of the contribution of the prior distribution to perception on a given trial depends on the level of internal noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Krding2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Trommershuser1">[28]</xref>. In particular in the framework of the 2AFC task, increasing the delay between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Berliner2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Hanks1">[30]</xref> or introducing a distracting task between them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Ashourian1">[7]</xref> enhances the contraction bias. These results are consistent with the Bayesian approach. How can these results be accounted for in the framework of the implicit memory model? One possibility is to assume that the relative contribution of the prior in the simplified online rule of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002731.e081">Eq. (2)</xref> is affected by perceptual noise. However, it should be noted that at least in one case, the level of noise was determined <italic>after</italic> the encoding of the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Ashourian1">[7]</xref>. The dependence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the level of noise can be accounted for in the framework of the implicit memory model if we assume that the computation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which incorporates the prior knowledge with the response to the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus, is carried out simultaneously by several neurons, or populations of neurons, which are characterized by different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Ulanovsky1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Jun1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Bernacchia1">[32]</xref>. At the time of the decision, the magnitude of the noise determines which populations of neurons will be the most informative with respect to the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus. If the level of noise is high, the populations of neurons that are more affected by past trials (for whom the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is large) will dominate perception, resulting in a substantial contraction bias. Otherwise the populations that are less affected by past trials will dominate perception, resulting in a small contraction bias.</p>
      <p>Almost 40 years ago, Tversky and Kahneman characterized irrational decision making and reasoning and concluded that “people rely on a limited number of heuristic principles which reduce the complex tasks … to simpler judgmental operations. In general, these heuristics are quite useful, but sometimes they lead to severe and systematic errors” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Tversky1">[33]</xref>.

        <p>150 participants (mean age 24±3.1 years) engaged in a 2AFC high/low pure tone frequency discrimination task, after signing consent forms. 18 participants were excluded due to poor performance on a hearing test or because they did not complete the full schedule. Each participant performed 2 blocks of 80 trials. Each trial consisted of two 50 ms pure tones, with 10 ms linear rise time, and 10 ms linear fall time, separated by 950 ms. Immediately after the 2<sup>nd</sup> stimulus was played, the text ‘Which tone was higher?’ appeared on screen, and the participant responded by clicking one of two on-screen buttons using a computer mouse, with no time constraint. Visual feedback of a smiling face or a sad face was presented for 300 ms after correct and incorrect responses, respectively. After a pause of 700 ms the next trial began (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). All stimuli were presented binaurally through Sennheiser HD-265 linear headphones using a TDT System III signal generator (Tucker Davis Technologies) controlled by in-house software in a sound attenuated room in the laboratory. Tone intensity was 65 dB SPL. Both the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> frequencies in each trial were drawn from a wide distribution according to the following procedure: a frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was drawn from a uniform distribution between 800 Hz and 1200 Hz.

The step size decreased every four reversals, from 4.5% to 2% to 1% to 0.5% to 0.1%. One of the two frequencies was randomly selected as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the other frequency was selected as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This schedule is expected to converge to a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for which the participant answers correctly in 79.4% of the trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002731-Levitt1">[34]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002731-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, dots). Blocks that did not converge to at least 65% correct responses in the last 40 trials were excluded from the analysis (12 of 264 blocks). The JND was calculated as the average difference between the stimuli frequencies in the last 6 reversals. As a result of the adaptive staircase schedule, the ratios between the frequencies of the two stimuli tended to decrease in the first trials of the block. On average, after 15 trials this ratio stabilized and therefore the first 15 trials of each block were excluded from the analysis.</p>

        <p>To test for differences in the JNDs between different regions, we used a Monte Carlo permutation test in which the identities of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002731.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in a trial were randomly shuffled.
