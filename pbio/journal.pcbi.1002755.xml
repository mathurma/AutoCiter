      <abstract>
        <p>Ribosomal profiling is a promising approach with increasing popularity for studying translation. This approach enables monitoring the ribosomal density along genes at a resolution of single nucleotides.</p>
        <p>In this study, we focused on ribosomal density profiles of mouse embryonic stem cells. Our analysis suggests, for the first time, that even in mammals such as <italic>M. musculus</italic> the elongation speed is significantly and directly affected by determinants of the coding sequence such as: 1) the adaptation of codons to the tRNA pool; 2) the local mRNA folding of the coding sequence; 3) the local charge of amino acids encoded in the codon sequence. In addition, our analyses suggest that in general, the translation velocity of ribosomes is slower at the beginning of the coding sequence and tends to increase downstream.</p>
        <p>Finally, a comparison of these data to the expected biophysical behavior of translation suggests that it suffers from some unknown biases. Specifically, the ribosomal flux measured on the experimental data increases along the coding sequence; however, according to any biophysical model of ribosomal movement lacking internal initiation sites, the flux is expected to remain constant or decrease. Thus, developing experimental and/or statistical methods for understanding, detecting and dealing with such biases is of high importance.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Gene translation is the process by which ribosomes translate mRNA molecules to proteins, a central process in all living organisms. Thus, understanding the biophysics of gene translation and the way its efficiency is encoded in the different features of the coding sequence has ramifications to every biomedical discipline. Recently, a new large-scale experimental approach named ‘ribosomal profiling’, has been developed for monitoring the ribosomal density at a resolution of single nucleotides. In this study, we analyzed ribosomal profiling data of mouse embryonic stem cells. These data enabled us to directly show that translation velocity is affected by the adaptation of codons to the tRNA pool, local mRNA folding of coding sequence, and local charge of the amino acids encoded in the coding sequence. In addition, our analyses suggest that ribosomal speed tends to be slower at the beginning of the coding sequence. Finally, we report possible biases in the ‘ribosomal profiling’ procedure that should be considered in future studies utilizing this method.</p>

One of the open questions in the field is related to the way translation efficiency is encoded in the transcript.</p>
      <p>The most promising approach for studying gene translation is the ribosomal profiling method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia1">[11]</xref>. This approach was introduced only a few years ago but has already been successfully employed for answering various fundamental biological questions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Reid1">[19]</xref>. Specifically, ribosomal profiling has been used for: 1) understanding the mechanism of gene expression down-regulation by microRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Guo1">[13]</xref>, 2) understanding the dynamics of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>, 3) showing that the anti-Shine–Dalgarno sequence drives translational pausing and codon choice in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Li1">[14]</xref>, 4) studying the yeast meiotic program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Brar1">[15]</xref>, 5) showing that miR-430 reduces translation before causing mRNA decay in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Bazzini1">[17]</xref>, and 6) to reveal the co-translational chaperone action of trigger factor in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Oh1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the current study we analyzed ribosomal profiles of mouse embryonic stem cells measured in a previous experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>. The experiment output included ribosomal density measurements along hundreds of genes at a few time points, after preventing translation initiation. These data enabled us to infer the translation elongation speed in different genes, allowing us for the first time to study several biophysical aspects of translation elongation in mouse embryonic stem cells.</p>

        <title>Measuring translation elongation velocities</title>
        <p>To study the kinetics of translation elongation in <italic>M. musculus</italic>, ribosome footprint profiles of isoforms expressed in embryonic stem cell were reconstructed based on a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>. Briefly, translation was halted by applying cyclohexamide. Fragments covered by ribosomes were mapped to the transcript and a baseline ribosomal read counts profile for each expressed isoform was created (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Let us denote these created profiles by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the index of the analyzed isoform. In addition, to estimate the elongation speed of ribosomes, in three <italic>additional</italic> experiments harringtonine was used to stop translation initiation, while allowing ribosomes that already started translating the mRNA to continue their movement on it. Cyclohexamide was again applied 90/120/150 seconds after applying harringtonine to stop translation. In this work, the time difference between applying harringtonine and cyclohexamide for creating depleted profiles is named the ‘<italic>run-off</italic>’ time.</p>
        <p>Let us denote the ribosomal read counts obtained in each of these three experiments by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> accordantly. The estimated <bold>S</bold>tarting <bold>L</bold>ocation of the depleted ribosomal profile (<italic>SL</italic>) was defined as the point where the ribosomal read counts profile of gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at time point <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> profile) reached half of the original ribosomal read counts profile <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Using these <italic>SL</italic> points, local translation elongation velocities were estimated for each analyzed isoform. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002755-g001">Figure 1</xref> outlines a schematic description of the method used to estimate the <italic>SL</italic> points, demonstrated on the uc007gge.1 isoform (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>

        <p>In the original work 4,994 isoforms with good read counts were found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>. The authors noticed that the effect of harringtonine was best observed for genes longer than 750 codons, as for shorter genes the ribosomes managed to exit the mRNA for the used run-off times. Thus, only genes that were long enough (at least 750 codons) were used to infer the position of the <italic>SL</italic> points. In the current work, the same isoforms satisfying these conditions were analyzed, resulting in 785 processed isoforms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s027">Table S10</xref>). Let us define the three estimated <italic>SL</italic> points by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponding to time points 90/120/150 respectively. Let us mark with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the segments defined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> accordantly, and the ribosomal average translation velocity in these segments by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The average translation velocity of a segment was estimated by dividing the segments' length by 30 seconds. For each gene and time point, various quality checks were performed to reliably estimate the position of the <italic>SL</italic> points (see more technical details in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). Eventually, only isoforms with <italic>SL</italic> points satisfying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were selected, resulting in 692 valid isoforms out of the 785 processed isoforms (88%).</p>

To compare the attained results to simulated genes with uniform translation elongation rate, we simulated 692 synthetic genes with 1) lengths distribution identical to the lengths distribution of the analyzed genes, and 2) with constant codons translation efficiency (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The ribosomal profile of these genes was simulated with a biophysical model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), resulting in a much smaller difference between the calculated velocities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (median = 0.01; KS-test: p-value &lt;1.81*10<sup>−271</sup>), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002755-g002">Figure 2C</xref>. The ratio between the velocities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was also much more moderate when calculated on these simulated ribosomal profiles (0.99+/−0.03, KS-test p-value &lt;1.56*10<sup>−295</sup>), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002755-g002">Figure 2D</xref>.

        <title>Estimated translation elongation velocity is significantly associated with features of the coding sequence</title>
        <p>In order to explain the high variability among segments length, those were analyzed with respect to different features of the coding sequence, such as the adaptation to the tRNA pool (<italic>e.g.</italic> the tAI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-dosReis1">[20]</xref> and the CAI measure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Sharp1">[21]</xref>), local mRNA folding energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller1">[22]</xref> and local charge of the translated amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Lu1">[23]</xref>. Specifically, codons recognized by more abundant tRNA molecules increase the tAI measure, therefore we expect longer segments to positively correlate with this measure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller2">[24]</xref>. The CAI index, which measures the frequency of codons in a segment relatively to their appearance in highly expressed genes, is also expected to positively correlate with the segment length.</p>
        <p>In addition, it was suggested that strong local mRNA folding tends to slow down ribosomal translation elongation as it increases the time it takes the helicases to unfold the mRNA molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller2">[24]</xref>. Therefore, segments more strongly folded (<italic>i.e.</italic> with lower folding energy (FE)) are expected to be shorter. Finally, the polypeptide must traverse two negatively charged regions to exit the ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Lu1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Trylska1">[25]</xref>, thus charged amino acids (specifically positively charged amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Lu1">[23]</xref>) that are encoded in the codons preceding (upstream) the currently translated codon should have electrostatic interactions with the ribosome exit tunnel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Lu1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Trylska1">[25]</xref>. Therefore, segments more positively charged are expected to be shorter. More details about the calculation of these measures appear in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section.</p>
        <p>To estimate the distinct contribution of each of the coding sequence features to the elongation speed, we calculated the correlation between the length of the segments and each of these features, when controlling for the other two features, and after binning the data (details in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). Spearman correlation between the segments length and the genes' tAI/CAI when controlling for charge and folding energy of the segments resulted in a correlation coefficient of r = 0.29/0.21 (P&lt;0.00615/0.049) accordantly. Spearman correlation between the segments' length and their mRNA folding energy when controlling for charge and gene tAI was r = 0.42 (P&lt;4.72*10<sup>−5</sup>). The correlation between the segments' length and their charge when controlling for folding energy and the genes' tAI was r = −0.21 (P&lt;0.046) (additional analyses appear in the supplementary). Thus, the results reported in the current subsection support the conjecture that the translation elongation speed is independently affected by each of the following features of the ORF: the adaptation of the ORF codons to the tRNA pools, local mRNA folding and local amino acids charge.</p>
        <p>As mentioned in the previous section, the speed of translation elongation tends to increase along the coding sequence. Aiming at explaining this phenomenon, features measured on the first and second segment were also compared using a paired Wilcolxon test, resulting in significant values for folding energy (Wilcolxon test: P&lt;1.04*10<sup>−3</sup>) but not for tAI/CAI and charge. This suggests that in mouse, a possible explanation of the increase in translation speed along the coding sequence is the decrease in the strength of the mRNA folding along the coding sequence. Finally, a weak but significant correlation between the average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> translation speed and the average transcripts length was observed in mouse (Spearman correlation: r = −0.05, p = 0.022), supporting the conjecture that shorter genes are more efficiently translated.</p>

        <title>Ribosomal flux inferred based on ribosomal profiling increases along the coding sequence, contradicting biophysical models of translation elongation</title>
        <p>According to the accepted biophysical model of translation, during the elongation step ribosomes move along the coding sequence, translating each codon with a speed related to the features of the coding sequence in its vicinity and according to cellular factors such as concentrations of elongation factors and tRNA molecules. In addition, a ribosome may be delayed if a ribosome is located downstream in front of it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Alberts1">[26]</xref>.

From a biophysical perspective, slower codons are covered by ribosomes for a larger amount of time (relatively to other codons in the mRNA), creating a higher number of reads (for an illustration see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002755-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we reanalyzed the ribosomal profiling data of mouse embryonic stem cells that was generated in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>. Our analysis demonstrates that even for relatively long analyzed genes, that are not expected to be under strong selection for translation efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Eisenberg1">[27]</xref>, in unusual tissue/conditions such as embryonic stem cells, translation elongation speed is affected by features such as the adaptation of codons to the tRNA pool, local mRNA folding, and charge.</p>
      <p>In addition, our analysis directly shows for the first time that the translation elongation speed tends to increase along the coding sequence. The reasons for this phenomenon may be related to the fact that at the beginning of the coding sequence features such as adaptation to the tRNA pool and mRNA folding strength tend to slow down ribosomal movement (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller2">[24]</xref>). This may also be related to the fact that there is a selection for lower codon bias at the beginning to reduce the costs of both missense and nonsense translational errors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Stoletzki1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Huang1">[29]</xref>. The statistical analysis performed in this study support the conjecture that the slower speed at the beginning of the coding sequence is due to stronger mRNA folding in this region. This phenomenon, however, may also be related to yet unknown properties of this process or to biases of the ribosomal profiling methods.</p>
      <p>Finally and importantly, at least in the reported study, our analysis demonstrates the existence of some unexplained deviations between the output of the ribosomal profiling approach and any of the accepted models of translation elongation, which assume that the rate of initiation from sites inside the ORF is negligible. This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that current models of translation elongation are inaccurate and, for example, initiation does tend to occur from sites inside coding sequences. However, the most plausible explanation is that ribosomal profiling approach, as in the case of the more traditional approaches for studying mRNA levels (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Scherer1">[30]</xref>), includes experimental biases that should be further explored. Another bias of the ribosomal profiling approach which is related to the increased ribosomal density at the beginning of the ORF has been suggested recently in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We also suggest a few explanations for these observed biases, while taking into consideration that there might be additional sources of bias in the ribosomal profiling protocol that are not mentioned here. For example, an insufficient number of mRNA molecules could increase the estimation errors and bias all the presented measures. Specifically, the ribosomal profiling approach produces for each gene the ribosomal positions along the mRNA molecules that have been transcripted from it and that are present in the cell at the time of the experiment. As the read counts per location of a single mRNA are stochastic, averaging them over many mRNA molecules of a gene should theoretically produce a profile that is similar to the stationary density profile of the gene. Thus, the number of mRNA copies affects the averaged profile and eventually the quality of the estimated measures mentioned in this study. In practice, genes with a relatively low number of mRNA molecules can result in highly biased profiles. Indeed, when we modified our computational simulation of the experiment to simulate a low number of mRNA molecules per gene (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), the correlation between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s012">Figures S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s013">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s014">S14</xref>) while the <italic>DSRC</italic> measure increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s009">Figures S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s011">S11</xref>), contrary to the expected trend.</p>
      <p>Another source of bias may be related to the fact that the current ribosomal density protocol involves filtering some of the reads, distorting the resultant ribosomal density profiles. Specifically, by the protocol of the experiment, only short mRNA fragments that are covered by exactly one ribosome (<italic>i.e</italic>. monosomes) are purified for further analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia3">[31]</xref>, while mRNA segments covered by polysomes are discarded. Thus, it is also possible that the reported biases are, at least partially, due to the fact that fragments that origin from ribosomes located very close to each other on the mRNA are filtered and not analyzed, creating deviated ribosomal profiles. Indeed, cases of fragmented mRNA covered with more than one ribosome as a result of very close ribosomes were reported in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Wolin1">[32]</xref>. In addition, when only monosomal footprints were considered in the simulation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), we obtained a decrease in the correlation between the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ratios and a major increase in the <italic>DSRC</italic> measure (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s009">Figures S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s011">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s012">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s013">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s014">S14</xref>).</p>
      <p>The deviations from the accepted biophysical model could also be explained by the non-uniform effect of the harringtonine/cyclohexamide substances on the different mRNA molecules, causing uneven run-off times, and distorting the location of the <italic>SL</italic> points. The simulation of this possible experimental bias (see details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) also resulted in an increased <italic>DSCR</italic> and a decrease in the correlation between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s015">Figures S15</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s016">S16</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s017">S17</xref>).</p>
      <p>Finally, complex relations between the sequence features, their effect on ribosomal density and on the output of the ribosomal profiling approach may also contribute to the deviation from the biophysical model. For example, it was suggested that elongation speed and ribosomal density are affected by the strength of the local folding of the mRNA (stronger folding→slower elongation speed→high ribosomal density) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller1">[22]</xref>. However, it is also possible that stronger mRNA folding decreases the efficiency of footprint production in the ribosomal profiling protocol (<italic>e.g.</italic> the efficiency of RNase activity decreases for mRNA fragments with strong folding; <italic>e.g.</italic> see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-LeDerout1">[33]</xref>), contributing to a distorted ribosomal density profiles.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, currently, the ribosomal profiling approach is the major method for studying gene translation, therefore understanding these biases and accurately correcting them should significantly affect studies in various biomedical disciplines. As was demonstrated in this study, one possible direction for detecting such biases is by comparing the ribosomal profiling outcome to the computational biophysical models using statistical analysis. We believe that such approach will be used in the future for employing filters and normalization procedures that are inversed to the noise/bias obtained in the experimental procedure and for adjusting the experimental procedure itself.</p>

        <p>Sequencing data were downloaded from the GEO database (accession number GSE30839) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>. We analyzed all data related to the study of the kinetics of translation elongation. The specific processed files are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s018">Table S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>Sequenced reads comprise short RNA fragments of different lengths; therefore, a generated linker sequence (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTGTAGGCACCATCAATTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGAA</named-content>) was attached to enable the recovery of the original fragment. More details of this method appear in the original work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>. In this study, linkers were first detected and removed from the published fragments and only then aligned to transcripts. The start location of the linker was estimated to be between the 20–36 <italic>nt</italic> of the RNA fragment. Next, the distance between the estimated linker and the published linker was calculated (in terms of number of different nucleotides); a valid linker was accepted if this distance differed by up to two nucleotides. If no valid linker was found, the fragment was rejected. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s019">Table S2</xref> summarizes the number of fragments published by Ingolia <italic>et al.</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s018">Table S1</xref>, column 2) and the percentage of processed fragments after removing the attached linker (column 3).</p>
        <p>Aligning the fragments directly to the genome resulted in a high number of ambiguous matches. Therefore, fragments were aligned to known transcripts (exons) and spliced junctions. The <italic>M. musculus</italic> transcripts were derived from the UCSC Genes data set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Hsu1">[34]</xref> and the alignment was performed using the Bowtie software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Langmead1">[35]</xref>, allowing up to two mismatches.</p>
        <p>As mentioned by Ingolia <italic>et al.</italic>, fragments of different lengths tend to have slighter different A site locations, therefore the beginning of the A site for fragments of 29–30/31–33/34–35 nt was defined to begin +15/+16/+17 <italic>nt</italic> relatively to the 5′ end of the fragment. Additional details about this topic appear in the original work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s019">Table S2</xref>, part of the processed fragments matched to more than one location. To overcome multiple mapping of a single fragment, we performed the following procedure: first, only fragments aligning to a single location were mapped. In the second iteration, for all fragments aligning to more than one location, the mean read counts in the region of the possible locations was calculated (10 <italic>nt</italic> before and after the location of the A site for each possible location). These mean read counts defined the probability of an ambiguous fragment to be aligned to only one of the locations.</p>
        <p>For each isoform, nucleotide read counts profiles were reconstructed by assembling read counts of relevant exons and spliced junctions. Codon reads were calculated by averaging the obtained reads of each three non-overlapping consecutive nucleotides.</p>

        <title>Estimating the position of the ribosomes at each time point by the new method</title>
        <p>Further study of the nature of ribosomal profiles revealed that the original <italic>SL</italic> estimation method suffers from some difficulties: the results presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s003">Figure S3</xref>-A show that read counts in regions not affected by harringtonine (beyond the 750<sup>th</sup> codon, excluding the last 20 codons) have a high variability, therefore their average read count value cannot be used for normalizing the ribosomal profiles. In addition, in the original method the <italic>SL</italic> point was defined as the location where the run-off profile exceeded the threshold value 0.5. This criterion assumes again that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> profiles are relatively homogenous, and small spikes caused by noises can be filtered by first smoothing them. However, the results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s003">Figure S3</xref>-B show that different profiles have a high read counts variability, also suggesting that ribosomal read counts could be position dependent, making the comparison of the run-off profile to a static threshold of 0.5 problematic.</p>
        <p>To overcome these issues, in the current work we suggested scaling each run-off profile to the baseline profile by a dynamic factor that derives from the read counts beyond the 750<sup>th</sup> codon of both profiles (excluding the last 20 codons). This factor is set to minimize the distance between these regions. In the current study, we also tested the effect of the smoothing window size (10/15/20/25/30 codons) on the number of genes with physical <italic>SL</italic> points, as presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s022">Table S5</xref>. The <italic>SL</italic> location of each isoform was defined as the position beyond the first 40 codons, where the ribosomal density profile <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> exceeded the value of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> profile multiplied by the recovery factor. This created a dynamic threshold for the run-off profiles to be compared to. The influence of the recovery factor on the number of genes with physical <italic>SL</italic> points was also evaluated, as presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s023">Table S6</xref>. In addition, to improve robustness of the method to local bursts of noise, an <italic>SL</italic> point was defined to be valid if 50% of the next 20 points could also exceed the dynamic threshold. The optimal smoothing window size and recovery factor were selected to maximize the number of genes whose <italic>SL</italic> points were physically estimated (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), resulting in a window size of 30 codons and a recovery factor of 0.5 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s020">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s021">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s022">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s023">S6</xref>).</p>
        <p>To compare between the methods' ability to correctly estimate <italic>SL</italic> points in a noisy environment, both the original <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Ingolia2">[12]</xref> and the newly suggested methods were also evaluated on synthetic data created using the TASEP model (<italic>e.g.</italic> see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller1">[22]</xref>). <italic>SL</italic> points were estimated for different run-off times and different levels of additive noise (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, evaluating the error rate of the <italic>SL</italic> points). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s004">Figures S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002755.s006">S6</xref> show the mean and standard deviation estimation error as function of noise level and size of the smoothing window for both estimation methods.

        <p>For comparison, in this work, the various tested measures were calculated based on <italic>SL</italic> points estimated using both methods.

        <p>To enable analysis of various features in a simulated environment, ribosomal densities of the analyzed isoforms in this work were calculated using the TASEP biophysical translation model, previously used in different studies (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Tuller1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002755-Shaw1">[37]</xref>). The mRNA was modeled using a lattice of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sites, representing the number of codons of the isoform. Each ribosome was defined to cover 11 codons and the A site was located at the sixth codon. During translation, any codon could be covered at a time by a single ribosome at most. In each step of the simulation, a single ribosome was allowed to attach itself to the lattice or advance to the next codon if the first/next six codons were not occupied. The time between initiation attempts was set to be exponentially distributed with a constant rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

In general, longer genes or genes with low initiation rates (relative to the gene's codon translation efficiencies) require a higher number of simulation steps to achieve this condition.</p>
        <p>To calculate ribosomal density profiles, we simulated another 10<sup>7</sup> steps. In each step, the simulation updated the time each site was translated by a ribosome. The final vector of times representing the total time a site was translated by a ribosome was then normalized by the total time of the simulation. In addition, the final scattering location of the ribosomes on the mRNA was saved.</p>

        <title>Simulating ribosomal densities for different run-off times</title>
        <p>Simulated ribosomal profiles were created by using three different initiation rate regimes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002755.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: low, high and proportional to the genes' mean ribosomal read counts. The low initiation rate was set to be 10% of lowest codon translation rate (based on the tAI measure), while the high initiation rate was set to be twice the value of the highest codon translation rate (based on the tAI measure).</p>
        <p>Proportional initiation rates were set for each isoform according to its measured mean ribosomal read counts (excluding the first 60 and last 40 codons). This initiation rate type assumed that in general, genes with higher mRNA and ribosomal densities levels (thus higher ribosomal read counts) are more highly expressed, therefore their initiation rate should be higher. Thus, for this regime initiation rate of the isoform with the lowest mean read counts was set as half of the slowest codon translation rate, while the initiation rate of the isoform with the highest mean ribosomal read counts value was set to twice the value of the highest codon translation rate. Initiation rates for the rest of the genes were set with equal distance between these two extremes, according to the genes' mean ribosomal read counts.</p>
        <p>To simulate ribosomal profiles for different run-off times, the TASEP model was run 10<sup>6</sup> simulations steps to achieve a steady state ribosomal spread on the mRNA.

        <p>To simulate numerous mRNA copies per gene, for each run-off time and analyzed gene, 500 ribosomal density profiles were calculated and those were averaged with equal weight to obtain a representative ribosomal profile for each gene and run-off time.
