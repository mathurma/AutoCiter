Here, we identified eight sets of redundant pathways that included redundancy for the assimilation of acetate, and for the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. These equivalent pathways and two other sub-optimal pathways were studied using 5 single-gene deletion mutants in those pathways for the evaluation of the predictive capacity of the model. The growth phenotypes of these mutants were studied under 12 different conditions of electron donor and acceptor availability. The comparison of the model predictions with the resulting experimental phenotypes indicated that pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase is the only activity able to convert pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. However, the results and the modeling showed that the two acetate activation pathways present are not only active, but needed due to the additional role of the acetyl-CoA transferase in the TCA cycle, probably reflecting the adaptation of these bacteria to acetate utilization. In other cases, the data reconciliation suggested additional capacity constraints that were confirmed with biochemical assays. The results demonstrate the need to experimentally verify the activity of key enzymes when developing in silico models of microbial physiology based on sequence-based reconstruction of metabolic networks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Geobacter sulfurreducens</named-content> is a member of the <italic>Geobacteraceae</italic> family of micro-organisms that breathe metals and have a unique mode of metabolism.

In addition to these reactions that are all stoichiometrically equivalent and are optimal alternatives, we also considered two cases of sub-optimal alternatives in the central metabolism for the evaluation of the predictive capacity of the model.

One of these was the oxidative decarboxylation of malate by the malic enzyme, and the subsequent carboxylation of pyruvate, which could potentially substitute for the activity of the malate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), but at the cost of an extra ATP. The other sub-optimal alternatives considered were the synthesis of PEP from pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), via the PEP dikinase (Ppdk, EC 2.7.9.1), the PEP synthase (Ppsa, EC 2.7.9.2), or the PEP carboxykinase (Ppck, EC 4.1.1.32)/pyruvate carboxylase (Pc, EC 6.4.1.1) pathway. Of the three pathways, the Ppdk pathway is energetically more favorable than either the Ppck or the Ppsa pathway, both of which are stoichiometrically equivalent.

The reason for this phenotype is not known and contrasted with predictions of the previously published model based on the presence of the transporter and enzymes needed for pyruvate oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b021">21</xref>]. Thus, it was necessary to incorporate an additional constraint on the pyruvate transport flux in order to ensure that pyruvate could contribute to growth as a carbon source but could not serve as the sole electron donor in silico. The pyruvate uptake constraint was chosen, as this constraint is active only during growth with pyruvate, and hence does not impact growth predictions in any other environment. The rate of pyruvate uptake was constrained to 0.15 mmol pyruvate/grams of dry weight per hour (gdwh), which is the rate required to meet the non-growth associated ATP maintenance demand (0.45 mmol ATP/gdwh) during growth with fumarate as the electron acceptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b021">21</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0040036-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0040036.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Growth Curves for Wild Type Strain</title><p>(A) WT, (B) POR1, pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase; (C) PPCK1, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; (D) MDH1, malate dehydrogenase; (E) PTA1, phosphotransacetylase; (F) ATO1, acetyl-CoA transferase 1; (G) ATO2, acetyl-CoA transferase 2; (H) ATO3, acetyl-CoA transferase 1 and 2 mutant strains grown in medium containing fumarate as the electron acceptor, and acetate (•), acetate and hydrogen (), pyruvate<bold> (</bold>□<bold>),</bold> pyruvate and hydrogen (▴), acetate and pyruvate (<bold>○</bold>), or acetate, pyruvate, and hydrogen (<bold>▵</bold>) as electron donors.

Furthermore, in both cases a gene coding for a phenylacetate CoA ligase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of phenylalanine or in the aromatic catabolism of phenylacetic acid, is present immediately downstream, suggesting a putative role for the product of these genes in the reduction of a 2-oxoacid of the aromatic type.

They also show that the predicted redundant pathways, pyruvate formate lyase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and another suboptimal alternative pathway through aldehyde dehydrogenase for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040036-st003">Table S3</xref>), are not functional, at least under the growth conditions evaluated.

Hence, we evaluated the role of these pathways in gluconeogenesis through the analysis of a deletion mutant in phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase (Ppck). The one gene in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content> genome with clear homology to the Ppck enzymes from other organisms is GSU3385 (53% identical to BAD30010 from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Corynebacterium glutamicum</named-content>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b030">30</xref>].

When the wild-type was assayed, activity was 10-fold higher with GDP than with ADP, suggesting that the enzyme belongs to the class of monomeric GTP dependent Ppck enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b031">31</xref>].</p><p>Strain PPCK1 grew at least as well as wild type with fumarate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) as the electron acceptor, but did not grow on Fe(III) citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Growth on fumarate is consistent with model simulations which suggest that pyruvate phosphate dikinase (Ppdk) is the primary source for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) generation. The Ppdk reaction also produces diphosphate, which is hydrolyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) to translocate a proton across the cell membrane, resulting in an energetic advantage. The lack of growth on Fe(III) citrate was not predicted by the model. A possible reason for this is that Ppck activity could contribute to lower oxaloacetate levels, which is important because the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase is thermodynamically unfavorable (standard free energy change is + 29.7 kJ/mol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b032">32</xref>]). A high oxaloacetate to malate ratio is not likely to occur when fumarate is the electron acceptor because malate pools are probably maintained at higher concentrations due to excess fumarate in the cell. Indeed growth on fumarate often results in secretion of malate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b033">33</xref>]. Therefore, PPCK1 lethality when Fe(III) citrate is the electron acceptor is not because the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) requirements of the cells are not met by redundant pathways, but probably because of a disruption in oxaloacetate homeostasis. However, since metabolite concentrations are not represented in the Flux Balance Analysis metabolic model, oxaloacetate homeostasis constraint cannot be incorporated in the model.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Redundancy in the Malate Oxidation</title><p>The inactivation of the Mdh reaction (EC 1.1.1.37, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) was included in this analysis to further investigate the role of redundant pathways in the anaplerotic reactions connecting the TCA cycle to the glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway. Deleting the one gene in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content> genome with homology to malate dehydrogenase (GSU1466) eliminated malate dehydrogenase activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0040036-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Simulations predicted that this extra ATP cost would prevent growth with Fe(III) citrate as the electron acceptor because of the already low energy yields with Fe(III).</p><p>For growth on fumarate, the model predicted that, in order to compensate for the lack of Mdh, the flux through the pyruvate carboxylase would have to increase over 50 fold relative to the wild type flux distribution. The measured activity of the pyruvate carboxylase was low in the wild type, ca. 5 μmol/mg of protein/min. When pyruvate carboxylase flux is constrained at levels for the wild type cells, the model correctly predicts that MDH1 should not be able to grow with acetate as the carbon source, even with fumarate as the electron donor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0040036-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Acetate Activation Alternative Pathways and the Conversion of Succinyl-CoA to Succinate</title><p>In order to evaluate the potential redundancy in pathways for converting acetate to acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), the gene coding for the phosphotransacetylase (GSU2706) was deleted.

This contrasted with the predictions of the model which indicated that acetyl-CoA transferase should be the primary provider of acetyl-CoA and that growth was possible on acetate and fumarate. Even the addition of pyruvate as a carbon source to meet the gluconeogenic carbon requirements did not rescue the mutant growth on acetate. PTA1 did grow when pyruvate and hydrogen were the carbon source and electron donor, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g004">Figures 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g005">5</xref>E). However, when acetate was supplied as the carbon source to cultures growing with pyruvate and hydrogen, growth on Fe(III) citrate was completely inhibited and growth on fumarate was partially inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g004">Figures 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g005">5</xref>E).</p><p>In order to further evaluate this phenotype of PTA1, the predicted alternative pathway for succinyl-CoA synthesis catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase was investigated.

When the model was adjusted to remove the succinyl-CoA synthetase reaction it was found that for every acetyl-CoA molecule produced by acetyl-CoA transferase activity, one must be utilized in the citrate synthase reaction of the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g006">Figure 6</xref>), effectively coupling the acetyl-CoA transferase flux with that of the TCA cycle. Thus, in order for acetate to be utilized for biomass production an alternative pathway for acetyl-CoA production is required. The acetate kinase/phosphotransacetylase pathway is apparently the only route for producing this acetyl-CoA. Growth is possible with hydrogen as the electron donor and pyruvate as the carbon source because pyruvate can be used for gluconeogenesis and hydrogen provides reducing equivalents.</p><fig id="pcbi-0040036-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0040036.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Central Metabolism in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content> Showing the Alternative Metabolic Pathways Studied (Dotted/Dashed Lines)</title><p>The metabolic pathway in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content> after the refinement of the network based on the comparison of the in silico predictions with the physiological data from the mutant strains is shown.

Acetyl phosphate has been proposed to be a metabolic signal participating in the regulation of gene expression in other bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b036">36</xref>]. Therefore, it may be that acetate is affecting growth through a regulatory effect triggered by acetyl phosphate accumulation.

The model predicted that deleting the acetyl-CoA transferase activity would not permit growth on acetate, but that an acetyl-CoA transferase activity-deficient mutant should be able to grow with hydrogen as the electron donor. In the presence of hydrogen, the TCA cycle activity is not required for the generation of redox equivalents and consequently the acetyl-CoA transferase is predicted to be nonessential.</p><p>Two genes potentially encoding acetyl-CoA transferase enzymes were found in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content> genome.

They did have a lower growth rate in the pyruvate-H<sub>2</sub> medium than the wild type, an observation which could not be explained based on the Flux Balance Analysis model. ATO3, which completely lacked acetyl-CoA transferase activity, could only grow with hydrogen as the electron donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g004">Figures 4</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g005">5</xref>H). This follows the prediction of the model that growth on acetate is not possible because of the loss of the key step in succinate conversion in the TCA cycle. The ability of the mutant to grow with hydrogen as the electron donor and acetate as the carbon source indicates that the acetate kinase pathway for acetate activation is sufficient for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>In Silico Model Refinement</title><p>The results demonstrate the continued need to experimentally verify the activity of key enzymes when developing in silico models of microbial physiology based on sequence-based reconstruction of metabolic networks. The initial version of the in silico model (Mahadevan et al., 2006) predicted the growth phenotype in 47 of the 72 growth conditions evaluated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0040036-t003">Table 3</xref>). One of the most significant errors in the modeling was the prediction that pyruvate could serve as the sole electron donor to support growth. This prediction assumed that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content> had the necessary pyruvate transporters to support the required flux of pyruvate into the cell and the associated metabolic pathways to catabolize the assimilated pyruvate. The finding that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content> did not grow solely on pyruvate required that the pyruvate uptake be constrained to allow the use of pyruvate only as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). With this constraint the model accurately predicted the growth of the wild type for all conditions evaluated. However, there were 16 instances in which the model predicted the growth of mutants, because of predicted redundant pathways, when the mutants did not grow. These discrepancies between predictions and growth studies were helpful in identifying predicted pathways that are not actually functional or can not be considered truly redundant in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content>, at least under the growth conditions evaluated. These results have led to the following additional constraints in the model: the elimination of pyruvate formate lyase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and succinyl-CoA synthetase reactions. Further constraints that limit the flux through pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate transport and aldehyde dehydrogenase were also incorporated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040036-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The model with the updated constraints was able to correctly predict 64 out of the 72 cases (89%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0040036-t003">Table 3</xref>). While these results are significant, it is important to emphasize that the model is essentially a reflection of our knowledge of metabolism and the improvement in the predictive capabilities of the model is the direct outcome of the characterization of the role of redundant pathways. Even with these additional constraints, the model could not predict the phenotypes in 5 conditions involving the PPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) mutant (all during Fe(III) citrate reduction) and in 3 conditions involving the PTA (phosphotransacetylase) mutant, possibly due to accumulation of acetyl-phosphate, a regulatory feature, which can not yet be incorporated into the model due to lack of sufficient information.</p><p>In addition, an alternative approach for simulating the phenotype of knock-out mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b040">40</xref>], in which minimization of the difference in flux distribution (MOMA) rather than growth maximization was the objective, was evaluated. However, applying MOMA with the additional constraints resulted in 14 incorrect predictions, of which 6 were false negatives. The remaining 8 were the same false positives predicted with the Flux Balance Analysis approach with the objective of growth maximization. The false negatives resulted from the fact that MOMA does not always identify non-zero growth solutions even if they are feasible, whereas such false negative predictions are less common in the Flux Balance Analysis approach.</p><p>In summary, the results demonstrate that the iterative comparison of the in silico and the in vivo phenotypes has led to additional information on the role and activity of the central metabolic pathways in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content>.

Growth under different environments was simulated by modifying the constraints on the exchange fluxes of the corresponding growth medium constituents: electron donors such as hydrogen, pyruvate, and acetate, and electron acceptors such as Fe(III) citrate and fumarate. The presence of hydrogen in the environment was modeled by allowing a hydrogen influx of 10 mmol/gdwh. In the case of pyruvate, the in silico prediction that pyruvate could be utilized as the sole carbon and electron source if the pyruvate transporters are present, was inconsistent with physiological data, which indicated that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. sulfurreducens</named-content> can grow on pyruvate only if an electron donor, such as hydrogen is also present (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). In order to ensure that pyruvate could contribute to growth as a carbon source but could not serve as the sole electron donor in silico, the rate of pyruvate uptake was constrained to 0.15 mmol pyruvate/gdwh, the rate required to meet the non growth associated ATP maintenance demand (0.45 mmol ATP/gdwh) during growth with fumarate as the electron acceptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b021">21</xref>]. The growth with acetate and fumarate was modeled by allowing the corresponding acetate and fumarate uptake rates to have flux values up to 5 mmol/gdwh and 25 mmol/gdwh respectively. Fe(III) citrate reduction in the presence of acetate was simulated by allowing acetate and Fe(III) uptake rates to have values up to 10 mmol/gdwh and 150 mmol/gdwh. These rates were chosen so that they were similar to experimentally observed values reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b041">41</xref>]. Optimal growth rates with these constraints were calculated to be 0.055 hr<sup>−1</sup> and 0.043 hr<sup>−1</sup> for fumarate and Fe(III) citrate reduction, respectively, and were found to be consistent with experimental observations.

Briefly, this algorithm involves the maximization and minimization of every flux in the network subject to the stoichiometric constraints and an additional constraint that forces an optimal growth rate. The solution of this series of optimization problems results in the maximum and the minimum value of flux allowed for every reaction in the network, given the constraint that the growth rate is optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040036-b027">27</xref>].

Metabolic modeling based on linear programming known as Flux Balance Analysis is effective in predicting large-scale growth phenotypes in different organisms. Flux Variability Analysis is an algorithm to identify those reactions that participate in alternate metabolic pathways. In this algorithm, in addition to the stoichiometric and capacity constraints, a growth rate constraint that forces the growth rate to be optimal is incorporated. Then, the flux through every reaction in the model is maximized and minimized in the formulation. If a reaction has an alternate pathway, then the flux through this reaction can be zero and yet optimal growth can be maintained as the flux gets rerouted through the alternate pathway. The range of flux is calculated as the difference between the maximum and the minimum possible value. Therefore, any reaction that has a non-zero range in the FVA problem has an alternate pathway. These reactions are compiled and augmented with the reactions in the reverse direction and used as the input to the Extreme Pathway Analysis algorithm. The redundant pathways are then identified from the list of predicted pathways. Further details are available in a previously published manuscript (Mahadevan and Schilling, 2003).
