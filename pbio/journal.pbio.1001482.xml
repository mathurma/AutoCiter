However, little is known about how metabolic signals affect the balance between enzymatic and regulatory roles of these dual functional proteins. We previously described the RNA binding activity of a 63 kDa chloroplast protein from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, which has been implicated in expression of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA, encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II. Here, we identify this factor as dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (DLA2), a subunit of the chloroplast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (cpPDC), which is known to provide acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. Analyses of RNAi lines revealed that DLA2 is involved in the synthesis of both D1 and acetyl-CoA. Gel filtration analyses demonstrated an RNP complex containing DLA2 and the chloroplast <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA specifically in cells metabolizing acetate. An intrinsic RNA binding activity of DLA2 was confirmed by in vitro RNA binding assays. Results of fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation experiments support a role of DLA2 in acetate-dependent localization of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to a translation zone within the chloroplast. Reciprocally, the activity of the cpPDC was specifically affected by binding of <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA. Beyond that, in silico analysis and in vitro RNA binding studies using recombinant proteins support the possibility that RNA binding is an ancient feature of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferases. Our results suggest a regulatory function of DLA2 in response to growth on reduced carbon energy sources. This raises the intriguing possibility that this regulation functions to coordinate the synthesis of lipids and proteins for the biogenesis of photosynthetic membranes.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Metabolic control of gene expression coordinates the levels of specific gene products to meet cellular demand for their activities. This control can be exerted by metabolites acting as regulatory signals on a class of metabolic enzymes with dual functions as regulators of gene expression. However, little is known about how metabolic signals affect the balance between enzymatic and regulatory roles of these proteins. Here, we report an example of a protein with dual functions in gene expression and carbon metabolism. The chloroplast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is well-known to produce activated di-carbon precursors for fatty acid, which is required for lipid synthesis. Our results show that a subunit of this enzyme forms ribonucleoprotein particles and influences chloroplast mRNA translation. Conversely, RNA binding affects pyruvate dehydrogenase (metabolic) activity. These findings offer insight into how intracellular metabolic signaling and gene expression are reciprocally regulated during membrane biogenesis. In addition, our results suggest that these dual roles of the protein might exist in evolutionary distant organisms ranging from cyanobacteria to humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Accumulating evidence suggests that metabolism and gene expression are tightly linked. For instance, changes in metabolite levels affect protein modification, for example by acetylation or N-glycosylation, which in turn influences signal transduction and gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-McKnight1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Xing1">[3]</xref>. In line with this, several metabolic enzymes functioning in diverse pathways were found to possess unexpected RNA-binding properties by which they are proposed to regulate gene expression and other cellular processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Bhardwaj1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ciela1">[5]</xref>). Often these proteins represent key enzymes of metabolic pathways, which make them particularly suitable to coordinate distinct biochemical pathways in response to changes in metabolism.</p>
      <p>In eukaryotic organisms, photosynthesis is performed in endosymbiotically acquired organelles, the chloroplasts. Within chloroplasts, the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis take place in thylakoid membranes, which represent a highly organized system of lipid membranes and embedded multisubunit protein complexes. These complexes include photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), the cytochrome <italic>b<sub>6</sub>f</italic> complex, and the chloroplastic ATP synthase.</p>
      <p>The biogenesis of thylakoid membranes requires the synthesis of both lipids and proteins. Major lipids include two glycolipids, monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG), the synthesis of which necessitates acetyl-CoA for fatty acid production within the chloroplast (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Benning1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Rawsthorne1">[7]</xref>). This acetyl-CoA is mainly generated from pyruvate by the chloroplast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (cpPDC), which—like its mitochondrial counterpart (mtPDC)—is a megadalton complex consisting of multiple copies of three subunits; a pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (DLA, E2), and a dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Lin1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-TovarMndez1">[11]</xref>. The decarboxylation of pyruvate by cpPDC is a central reaction in chloroplast carbon metabolism and is regulated by light, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and feedback inhibition by acetyl-CoA and NADH (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Mooney1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-TovarMndez1">[11]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The biogenesis of thylakoid membranes also necessitates the synthesis of polypeptides and their assembly into multisubunit complexes. Since their origin as a cyanobacterial endosymbiont, chloroplasts have retained downsized genomes and gene expression systems. However, most chloroplast proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytosol, and then imported into the chloroplast. Therefore, the synthesis of thylakoid membrane protein complexes requires an intracellular coordination, which is mainly mediated via nucleus-encoded factors acting at all levels of chloroplast gene expression (for a recent overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Barkan1">[12]</xref>). Particularly chloroplast translation initiation has been considered to play a key role in determining the levels of photosynthesis-related proteins (for recent overviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Barkan1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Woodson1">[14]</xref>). Moreover, targeting of mRNAs to specific subcellular sites for localized translation contributes a further level of regulation of chloroplast gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Marrison1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Uniacke1">[16]</xref>. These targeting mechanisms are thought to involve membrane-associated RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that tether respective mRNAs to specific membrane regions within the chloroplast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Uniacke1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ossenbhl1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The unicellular green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is an established model organism for the analysis of biogenesis and gene expression in chloroplasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Harris1">[18]</xref>. Moreover, it has the potential to be an ideal model system to study metabolic regulation of gene expression because it can adjust its metabolism to different energy sources. Unlike plants and animals, which derive energy exclusively from light and reduced carbon, respectively, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> can use both sources. It can exclusively use light energy in photoautotrophic growth, acetate in heterotrophic growth, or a combination of both in mixotrophic growth. The <italic>C. reinhardtii psbA</italic> mRNA is probably one of the most studied models of translational regulation in chloroplasts. The de novo assembly of PSII requires the synthesis of all subunits of this multimeric complex, including the <italic>psbA</italic> gene product, the D1 subunit, and its assembly partner D2. This thylakoid membrane protein synthesis is localized to a specialized membrane region called the T (translation)-zone surrounding the pyrenoid, a spherical body and the primary site of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in the chloroplasts of most algae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Michael1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Uniacke2">[20]</xref>. However, under higher intensity light, D1 is damaged. Under these conditions, the so-called damage-repair cycle replaces degraded D1 proteins by newly synthesized ones (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Kato1">[21]</xref>). Interestingly, repair synthesis of the PSII reaction center protein D1 is not localized to the T-zone but distributed over stroma-exposed thylakoid membranes indicating a strict spatial separation from the PSII de novo synthesis machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Uniacke2">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using in vitro RNA-binding assays, we previously identified an RBP of 63 kDa, RBP63, in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, which is associated with stromal thylakoids and preferentially binds to an A-rich element within the 5′ UTR of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ossenbhl1">[17]</xref>. This A-rich element is important for <italic>psbA</italic> translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Bruick1">[22]</xref>. Based on these findings, RBP63 was suggested to fulfill a role in membrane targeting and translation of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ossenbhl1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we report the identification and further characterization of RBP63, which surprisingly turned out to be the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase subunit, DLA2, of the cpPDC. Therefore, DLA2 might represent another example of a metabolic enzyme with an alternate function as an RBP involved in gene expression. Our data support a role of DLA2 in the localized translation of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA and confirm its known enzymatic role in acetyl Co-A synthesis. Moreover, the binding of this subunit to RNA might not be restricted to <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> but appears to be a more general feature of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferases, including the mitochondrial forms. Taken together, these results lead us to a new concept for the coordination of chloroplast translation and carbon metabolism that involves a cross-talk between protein and lipid synthesis in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.</p>

        <title>RBP63 Is DLA2, the Predicted E2 Subunit of cpPDC</title>
        <p>RBP63 was purified from detergent-solubilized thylakoid membranes of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> by two sequential affinity chromatography steps, using first heparin and then poly(A). RBP63 was monitored in the fractions on the basis of its <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA binding activity with a UV-cross-linking assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We observed the highest RNA binding activity in the fraction eluted with 0.5 M KCl from poly(A)-Sepharose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, pA E500). SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie Blue staining revealed that this fraction contained predominately the 63 kDa protein as well as minor amounts of proteins with different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, pA E500). For the identification of the gene encoding RBP63, the excised 63 kDa protein species was then subjected to proteolytic digestion and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, four different peptides mapped to DLA (DLA2), the E2 subunit of the cpPDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>Blast searches of the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> nuclear genome using the DLA2 amino acid sequence identified two homologues: DLA1 and DLA3. However, the mass spectrometrically identified peptides unambiguously assigned the purified protein to DLA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, in silico analysis of the N-terminal region of DLA2 by TargetP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Emanuelsson1">[23]</xref> revealed properties of a 30 aa N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide, while DLA1 and DLA3 were predicted to localize to mitochondria, and thus are likely to represent putative E2 subunits of the mitochondrial PDC. Mitochondrial localization of DLA1 and DLA3 is further supported by their identification during mass spectrometrical determination of the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> mitochondrial proteome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Atteia1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Mathy1">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To establish the gene structure of <italic>DLA2</italic>, we sequenced the EST clone MXL069g06 (BP097085) from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The clone included the full-length DLA2 cDNA, whose sequence corresponds to the gene model au5.g10333_t1 (chromosome 3:1419737–1423311) annotated in JGI v4 (Joint Genome Institute; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Chlre4/Chlre4.home.html" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Chlre4/Chlre4.home.html</ext-link>). The 2,174 nt <italic>DLA2</italic> transcript contains six exons, comprising 1,485 nt, flanked by untranslated regions of 38 and 651 nt at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. In silico analysis of the genome sequence and DNA hybridizations confirm that <italic>DLA2</italic> is a single copy gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The predicted protein has 494 amino acids with a molecular mass of 49.8 kDa. The discrepancy between the predicted molecular weight of DLA2 (49.8 kDa) and the apparent MW determined from SDS-PAGE (63 kDa, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s007">Figure S7</xref>) represents a size anomaly observed for all PDC E2 subunits analyzed to date and has been explained by frequently occurring turn-inducing and charged amino acid residues within the interdomain linker regions of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Guest1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Reed1">[29]</xref>.

        <p>In agreement with α-proteobacterial and cyanobacterial origins of mitochondrial and chloroplast E2 subunits, respectively, DLA2 shows an overall amino acid sequence identity of more than 50% to the E2 subunit from the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

The lipoamide attachment site and the catalytic domain show a relatively high conservation between the different organisms, whereas the E3 binding region is more variable. <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> DLA2 contains a single predicted lipoamide attachment site, similar to the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

        <title>DLA2 Is a Chloroplast Localized Protein</title>
        <p>To verify the predicted chloroplast localization and exclude an additional targeting of DLA2 to mitochondria, we first carried out subcellular fractionation detecting DLA2 with an antiserum raised against the recombinant protein. The antibody detected a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 63 kDa in whole cell extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Subsequently, the comparisons of the level of DLA2 in subcellular fractions revealed it to be localized to chloroplasts, with approximately similar levels in thylakoid membranes versus the soluble stromal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). As is often seen for <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, the chloroplast and thylakoid fractions were contaminated with mitochondria as judged by following the mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g003">Figure 3A</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Belknap1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Geraghty1">[32]</xref>). However, the most significant result of this analysis was that no DLA2-specific signal was detected in the mitochondrial fraction, confirming that DLA2 does not form part of the mitochondrial PDC. In addition, this result reveals that a cross-reactivity of the antibody to the putative mitochondrial isoforms, DLA1 and DLA3, is improbable.</p>

        <title>DLA2 Is in a High Molecular Weight (HMW) Complex with the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA</title>
        <p>Because DLA2 (RBP63) was previously characterized as a <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA binding protein, we tested whether DLA2 forms part of a HMW ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Detergent-solubilized thylakoid membranes were prepared from wild-type cells cultured under photoautotrophic (light, no acetate), mixotrophic (light, with acetate), or heterotrophic (no light, with acetate) conditions and then subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Schwarz1">[33]</xref>). By following the elution pattern of DLA2, we verified that it forms part of a HMW complex in a size range between 700 kDa and more than 2,800 kDa under each of the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Peak fractions of eluted DLA2 slightly varied between samples from light versus dark grown cells. Under photoautotrophic and mixotrophic growth conditions, the DLA2 complex was more than 2,800 kDa, as indicated by a peak of elution in fraction 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4A,C</xref>). In cells grown heterotrophically, the peak fractions were moderately shifted toward smaller molecular sizes (i.e., fraction 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggests a light-dependent formation of these different DLA2 HMW complexes. To investigate whether the observed HMW complexes contain RNA, solubilized thylakoid membranes were treated with RNase prior to SEC analysis. Intriguingly, the detected complexes revealed a growth condition-dependent RNase sensitivity: only under mixotrophic conditions did the complex shift toward lower molecular weight fractions upon RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, peak of elution in fraction 4). In contrast, no such size shifts were observed for material from cells grown under photoautotrophic or heterotrophic growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This strongly suggests that DLA2 forms a HMW–RNP complex in an acetate and light-dependent manner.</p>

        <p>As localization studies revealed an almost equal distribution of DLA2 in the stroma and the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), we also investigated the size and RNase sensitivity of stromal DLA2 complexes of the wild-type grown under different conditions by SEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast to what was seen for the membrane-bound DLA2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4A–C</xref>), we did not observe significant RNase sensitivity of stromal DLA2 complexes under any condition.</p>
        <p>To obtain an indication of which of the gel filtration fractions contained active PDH complexes and additionally investigate if it is the active PDH complex itself that binds RNA or an alternative RNP complex, we performed cpPDC enzyme tests on the SEC fractions by measuring the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> spectrophotometrically. These assays were performed on stroma or thylakoid SEC fractions from mixotrophically grown wild-type cells. The results revealed cpPDC activity mainly in the highest molecular weight fraction as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Approximately 10% of the activity measured in fraction 1 was detected in fraction 2 in a size range of ∼1.2–1.7 MDa, whereas no significant cpPDC activity was detectable in fractions containing smaller complexes. Moreover, no changes in the elution profile of cpPDC activity were observed upon RNase treatment even though significant amounts of DLA2 proteins were detected in lower molecular weight fractions 4 and 5. Therefore, it is probably not the active cpPDC that binds RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s003">Figure S3A</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether the RNA bound by the DLA2 complex is the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA, solubilized thylakoid membranes from the chloroplast <italic>psbA</italic> deletion mutant <italic>FuD7</italic> (grown under mixotrophic conditions) were subjected to SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Bennoun1">[34]</xref>). With this mutant, the DLA2 complex was mainly detected in fraction 4, resembling the elution pattern of RNase-treated DLA2 complexes from mixotrophically grown wild-type cells. Reduced amounts of HMW complexes were detected in fractions 1+2 as compared to the WT, indicating that the lack of <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA in a mutant background reduces the DLA2 complex size. Therefore, this result supports the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA as being the RNA component of the DLA2 RNP complex.</p>
        <p>We cannot exclude DLA2 binding to RNAs other than the <italic>psbA</italic> message. However, another mixotrophically grown PSII mutant (<italic>nac2–26</italic>) tested in this analysis, which lacks the <italic>psbD</italic> mRNA, was not affected in DLA2 complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4D</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Boudreau1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Vaistij1">[36]</xref>). In conclusion, the data revealed a <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA-dependent DLA2 RNP complex under mixotrophic growth conditions.</p>
        <p>To further verify a specific interaction of DLA2 and the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA in vivo, RNA co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs) using solubilized thylakoids from mixotrophically grown wild-type cells were performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The immunoprecipitate obtained with the αDLA2 antiserum contained the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA, but not the mRNAs of <italic>rbcL</italic> or <italic>atpB</italic>, chloroplast genes encoding the large subunit of Rubisco and the beta subunit of ATP synthase, respectively. This confirms the formation of a specific <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA/DLA2 complex in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). In agreement with the results of SEC analysis, no <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA was co-immunoprecipitated from cells grown under heterotrophic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s004">S4B</xref>). It should be noted that this IP was relatively inefficient because the DLA2 antiserum only weakly recognizes the native protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).</p>
        <p>As a next step, we further substantiated the RNA binding capacity of DLA2 by testing the hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein (His-DLA2) for in vitro RNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In UV cross-linking experiments with various <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNAs, His-DLA2 showed a clear intrinsic RNA binding activity for all probes tested (e.g., the 5′ UTRs of <italic>psbA</italic>, <italic>psbD</italic>—encoding the PSII reaction center protein D2—and <italic>rbcL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We next tested the specificity of RNA binding by applying RNA competition assays. Therefore, the UV cross-linking assays were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of homologous or heterologous unlabeled RNA probes as competitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast to what was previously reported for the native DLA2 protein, His-DLA2 exhibited no specificity for the <italic>psbA</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ossenbhl1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This is probably due to a lack of other components of the DLA2–RNP complex that facilitate recognition of the <italic>psbA</italic> 5′ UTR by DLA2 in vivo. Such a behavior would resemble other chloroplast RBPs, like RBP40 from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, which—as an isolated protein—unspecifically recognizes any RNA. Only as part of a complex with its cognate binding partner Nac2 does RBP40 have binding specificity to the <italic>psbD</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Schwarz2">[37]</xref>.</p>

        <title>DLA2 Is Involved in <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA Localization</title>
        <p>As another means of testing whether DLA2 plays a role in <italic>psbA</italic> translation, we asked whether it is associated with a “chloroplast translation membrane” (CTM). This membrane subfraction was identified as a privileged location of translation in the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> chloroplast. CTMs are characterized by their higher density as compared to thylakoids and their association with the translation machinery including the translational regulator RBP40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Schottkowski1">[45]</xref>. Accordingly, membranes from wild-type cells from mixotrophic conditions were separated on the basis of density by floatation from a 2.5 M sucrose cushion into a 0.5–2.2 M sucrose gradient during isopycnic ultracentrifugation. Most thylakoid membranes were detected in the intermediate-density fractions 3 and 4, as revealed by their high chlorophyll concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, left panel). Progressively less thylakoid membrane was present in fractions with increasing density (fractions 5–8). The CTM marker RBP40 was detected in fractions 3–8, as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Schottkowski1">[45]</xref>. Immunodetection of DLA2 revealed that its concentrations were highest in lanes 3–6 and progressively decreased in the denser fractions 7–8. The presence of DLA2 in fractions 3 and 4 was inconclusive because this is consistent with DLA2 association with thylakoid membranes, CTM, or both membrane types. However, DLA2's sustained high levels in lanes 5 and 6 (i.e., in fractions in which thylakoid membrane levels progressively decrease) indicate that DLA2 is associated with a nonthylakoid membrane such as the CTM in these fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, left panel). That the RBP40 distribution extends to the bottom of the gradient (lanes 7 and 8) indicates that the DLA2 is not associated with the densest CTMs to detectable extent.</p>

        <p>To determine whether the DLA2 that cofractionates with CTM (lanes 5 and 6) in membranes from mixotrophically cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, left panel) could be relevant to its role in <italic>psbA</italic> translation, we carried out the same analysis on membranes from cells cultured photoautotrophically, which lack the DLA2 RNP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In this experiment, DLA2 more closely co-fractionated with the thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, right panel, fractions 3–5). The density distribution of CTM was not dramatically altered relative to mixotrophically cultured cells, based on the distribution of RBP40. Together, these results substantiate the proposed acetate-dependent role of DLA2 in <italic>psbA</italic> translation.</p>
        <p>It was proposed previously that DLA2 binds the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to localize it for translation and cotranslational membrane insertion of D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ossenbhl1">[17]</xref>. To test this possibility, we asked whether DLA2 is required to localize the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to a specific, spatially defined, “translation zone” (T-zone) in the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> chloroplast, which is believed to be a privileged subcompartment for protein synthesis and to contain the CTM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Uniacke1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Uniacke2">[20]</xref>. The T-zone was originally defined by results of confocal microscopy, which revealed in the outer perimeter of the pyrenoid by the colocalization of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA, chloroplast ribosome subunits, and the PSII translation factor RBP40 (RB38) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Uniacke2">[20]</xref>. The pyrenoid serves as a cytological landmark for the T-zone because it is large (1–2 µm in diameter) and located in the same position in every chloroplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). To determine whether DLA2 localizes the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to the T-zone, we first asked whether this localization is altered in the most severe RNAi line: <italic>iDLA2</italic>-1. When we visualized the suborganellar distribution the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the recipient strain used for RNAi, WT-NE, we found that the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA was localized to the T-zone in 78% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). In the representative WT-NE cell, the green <italic>psbA</italic> FISH signal is concentrated in distinct regions adjacent to the pyrenoid, which is seen in the accompanying phase contrast image. These cells were from the mixotrophic growth conditions in which DLA2/<italic>psbA</italic> mRNA complex formation was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, when <italic>iDLA2</italic>-1 cells were examined, only 30% showed this <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA localization pattern, a greater than 2-fold reduction relative to WT-NE. In the representative <italic>iDLA2-1</italic> cell, the <italic>psbA</italic> FISH signal is more dispersed and not concentrated in distinct regions adjacent to the pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Together, these results reveal that DLA2 is involved in <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA localization to the T-zone and that the sustained <italic>psbA</italic> localization in 30% of these cells probably reflects the residual DLA2 in this RNAi line (i.e., 5% of the wild-type level, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), the activity of a partially redundant DLA2-independent localization mechanism, or both.</p>
        <p>As another means of determining whether DLA2 localizes the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA, we asked whether they colocalize in the T-zone. When the WT-NE cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for DLA2, 65% showed the DLA2 IF signal near the pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). However, these analyses were hampered by the dispersed IF signal, reflecting the difficulty of specifically detecting the RNA-binding form of DLA2 amidst the “background” IF signal from DLA2 of cpPDC, which is most probably nonlocalized based on its detection as soluble and membrane-bound forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s003">S3</xref>). To reveal a pool of DLA2 involved in <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA localization, amidst the nonlocalized signal, we used the program Colocalization Finder (ImageJ) to display signals of maximal intensity from both DLA2 and the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Uniacke2">[20]</xref>. Our prediction was that the strongest signals from each should be colocalized for translation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, clusters of maximal colocalized signals from DLA2 and the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA were seen in the T-zone in 60% of the cells analyzed (and are labeled white in the right-hand most image). Moreover, this pattern requires DLA2 because parallel analyses of the most severe knock-down line, <italic>iDLA2</italic>-1, revealed that only 8% of these cells showed the colocalization with DLA2 in the T-zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Therefore, these in situ results and the biochemical evidence that DLA2 is associated with the CTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) support our hypothesis that DLA2 is required for the localization of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to the T-zone and, thereby, targets newly synthesized D1 protein to this PSII biogenesis center.</p>

        <title>Regulation of cpPDC Activity</title>
        <p>In order to explore possible signals for the transition of the enzymatic form of DLA2 to its RNA-binding form for <italic>psbA</italic> translation, we asked whether cpPDC activity is altered by interaction of DLA2 with the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA. This idea is supported by bioinformatical analysis of the DLA2 amino acid sequence. By using the RNABindR software to predict possible RNA-binding residues within the amino acid sequence of DLA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Terribilini1">[46]</xref>, we detected a putative RNA-binding region that overlaps the E3 subunit attachment site (aa 191–216, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). Hence, a competitive binding of either E3 or <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to this DLA2 site might be involved in regulation. Since binding of E3 is required for cpPDC function, the lack of <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA should then lead to increased cpPDC activity. We therefore decided to analyze cpPDC activity in the absence of <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA.</p>
        <p>Data from higher plants have revealed an activation of the complex by light, due to an increase of stromal pH and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-TovarMndez1">[11]</xref>). A similar light-dependent activation of cpPDC could be confirmed for <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> wild-type as indicated by an increase of activity of ca. 30% of light versus dark grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). This light activation depends on electron transport from PSII to PSI, as indicated by clearly reduced cpPDC activity upon treatment of cells with DCMU, a chemical that specifically blocks the electron flow from PSII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). Next, we tested cpPDC activity in the PSII mutants <italic>FuD7</italic> and <italic>nac2–26</italic> specifically lacking either the <italic>psbA</italic> or the <italic>psbD</italic> mRNA, respectively. Consistent with a requirement for photosynthetic electron flow, both mutants exhibited reduced cpPDC activities as compared to the wild-type. However, in the <italic>FuD7</italic> mutant, this reduction (66% of wild-type level) was less pronounced than in <italic>nac2-26</italic> (47% of wild-type level; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). This might suggest that the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA, which is still present in <italic>nac2–26</italic> but lacking in <italic>FuD7</italic>, has an additional inhibitory effect on cpPDC activity.</p>

        <p>To further test this, we measured the cpPDC activity in extracts of light grown wild-type and <italic>FuD7</italic> cells after incubation with in vitro transcribed RNAs derived from the 5′ UTRs of the <italic>psbA</italic> or <italic>rbcL</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g010">Figure 10B</xref>).

To gain first insights, we predicted the possible RNA binding sites within the amino acid sequences of E2 subunits from phylogenetically distant organisms (i.e., human, yeast, and a cyanobacterium) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Similar to <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> DLA2, all analyzed proteins revealed a putative RNA binding domain within the proposed E3 attachment site. Consequently, we tested recombinant E2 versions from these organisms for their ability to bind RNA in vitro. Therefore, E2 subunits were heterologously expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins and purified on Ni-NTA Sepharose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g011">Figure 11A</xref>). Even though the recombinant proteins were markedly enriched after purification, especially the preparation of the E2 subunit from human (Hs-E2) revealed contaminations with proteins in a size range of 30–45 kDa. These most likely represent Hs-E2 degradation products because they are specifically recognized by an anti-hexahistidine antibody (unpublished data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g011">Figure 11A</xref>). As controls for the subsequent RNA binding assay, we also included PratA, which is an unrelated his-tagged protein not described to possess any RNA binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Stengel1">[48]</xref>.

      <p>Our finding that RBP63 is DLA2 reveals another example of a metabolic enzyme with a dual function as an RBP. Some of these proteins, including enzymes involved in carbon and fatty acid metabolism, were shown to directly interact with nucleic acids and have been proposed to influence transcription or translation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Bhardwaj1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ciela1">[5]</xref>). However, the physiological significance of RNA binding by metabolic proteins is mostly unclear and might be a remnant of the “RNA-world” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Kyrpides1">[51]</xref>. In this context, our results are important because they reveal a physiological function of an alternate RNA-binding form of a metabolic enzyme: that is, DLA2 as an RBP in <italic>psbA</italic> translation. Our results also suggest a model in which DLA2 adjusts <italic>psbA</italic> expression in response to available sources of energy.</p>

        <title>DLA2 Is an Active Subunit of cpPDC and Forms Part of an RNP Complex with the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA</title>
        <p>After mass spectrometrical identification of DLA2, we confirmed its in silico predicted chloroplast localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Results of enzyme activity assays of <italic>DLA2</italic> knock-down lines demonstrated DLA2 to be a functional subunit of the cpPDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g009">9</xref>). SEC analyses revealed a <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA-specific DLA2 complex of ca. 700 kDa only in cells cultured mixotrophically (i.e., in the presence of exogenous acetate and light) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, a large &gt;2.8 MDa, RNase-insensitive, DLA2 complex is likely to represent the functional cpPDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s003">S3</xref>). This complex accumulated predominantly in cells cultured in photoautotrophic conditions and only to a lower level in mixotrophically or heterotrophically grown cells. Which of these complexes is formed, therefore, seems to be dependent on whether light or acetate is available as an energy source. Under photoautotrophic conditions, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> chloroplasts depend on the production of acetyl-CoA via cpPDC. Therefore, it is likely that most of DLA2 is in complexes of &gt;2.8 MDa. In contrast, under mixotrophic conditions acetate can be converted into acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and/or by the acetate kinase (ACK)/phosphate acetyltransferase (PAT) system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Spalding1">[10]</xref>. Accumulating acetyl-CoA then signals substrate availability for fatty acid synthesis, which might cause a product-inhibition of the cpPDC and/or acetylation of its subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Wellen1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Xing1">[3]</xref>. This, we propose, leads to its partial disassembly, thereby stimulating the light-dependent binding of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to DLA2 and, consequently, the formation of the smaller DLA2 RNP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g012">Figure 12</xref>).

Accumulating acetyl-CoA levels signal efficient substrate availability for fatty acid synthesis, which causes a product inhibition of the cpPDC and, putatively, its partial disassembly.

        <p>The alternate function of DLA2 reported here may be conserved in higher plants. Several hints suggest that cpPDC subunits are present in complexes other than fully assembled cpPDC in higher plants. The analysis of HMW complexes from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> chloroplasts by SEC revealed the chloroplast E2 subunit (LTA2, At3g25860) as a component of two chloroplast complexes, one of &gt;5 MDa and another one of 1–2 MDa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Olinares1">[52]</xref>. The former most likely represents a fully assembled cpPDC, whereas the latter did not cofractionate with the E1 and E3 subunits. Instead, most E2 coeluted with ribosomal proteins and RNA binding proteins. Likewise, the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> chloroplast E2 subunit has been reported to co-immunoprecipitate with CSP41b, a protein involved in chloroplast RNA metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Beligni1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Qi1">[55]</xref>. Further indications for E2 subunits possessing an additional function besides being a cpPDC subunit are derived from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> T-DNA insertion lines. Assuming that all three cpPDC enzyme components are necessary for its functionality, it is surprising that T-DNA insertions in <italic>E2</italic> genes lead to embryo lethality in the homozygous state, whereas the E3 subunit is dispensable, thereby indicating an essential function of E2 distinct from its role in the cpPDC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Chen1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Meinke1">[58]</xref>. Similarly, an extensive PCR-based search for a DLA2 insertion mutant in an indexed library of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> failed, suggesting that DLA2 also is essential in green algae (Bohne, Grossman, and Nickelsen, unpublished results).</p>

        <title>DLA2 Is Involved in the Localization of D1 Synthesis</title>
        <p>Consistent with a functional role of the DLA2–RNP complex, the <italic>DLA2</italic>–RNAi lines exhibited growth retardation and reduced D1 synthesis rates under mixotrophic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g007">7</xref>). Based on results reported here and previously, we propose a role of DLA2 in localizing the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to the T-zone for its translation and the synthesis of D1 in de novo PSII biogenesis. First, the existence of mRNA localization factors in the T-zone was suggested by a previous demonstration that the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA localizes there in the absence of the nascent D1 polypeptide and, hence, any localization information in the polypeptide sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Uniacke1">[16]</xref>. Second, we show here that DLA2 is associated with membranes that are distinct from thylakoid membranes in density and within the density range of CTM, a biogenic membrane that is probably localized in the T-zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, left image, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Schottkowski1">[45]</xref>). DLA2 is also associated with stromal thylakoid membranes, another proposed location of <italic>psbA</italic> translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ossenbhl1">[17]</xref>. Third, DLA2 functions in the localization of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA in the T-zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Together, these results support a model in which the RNA-binding form of DLA2 tethers the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to CTM in the T-Zone for translation and cotranslational membrane insertion of D1 for its incorporation into assembling PSII complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g012">Figure 12</xref>).</p>
        <p>While the phenotypes of the <italic>DLA2</italic>–RNAi lines suggest a role in <italic>psbA</italic> translation under mixotrophic conditions, the effects of DLA2 silencing under photoautotrophic conditions appear more pleiotropic. Although PSII levels increase as compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g007">Figure 7</xref>), growth rates remained unaltered despite the requirements for efficient photosynthesis under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This might be due to counteracting growth limitations caused by reduced cpPDC activity in the absence of acetate. Moreover, this raises the question: What is the molecular basis of the observed differences in the rates of PSII subunit synthesis in the <italic>DLA2</italic>–RNAi lines versus the wild-type in photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions (i.e., in the absence of DLA2–RNP complex formation)? Evaluation of the protein pulse-labeling data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g007">Figure 7B</xref> revealed that D2 synthesis also increased and decreased concomitantly with D1 synthesis in <italic>DLA2</italic>–RNAi lines under photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth, again suggesting more pleiotropic effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s008">Figure S8</xref>). In contrast under mixotrophic conditions when DLA2–RNP complex formation occurs, only D1 synthesis but not D2 synthesis was affected, confirming a <italic>psbA</italic>-specific function of DLA2 in the presence of light and acetate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s008">Figure S8</xref>). The translational regulation of <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA is complex and has been shown to involve many factors in addition to DLA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Mulo1">[59]</xref>. Nevertheless, based on the presented data, DLA2 appears to be specifically required for adjusting chloroplast gene expression when high levels of reduced carbon energy sources are available to the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g012">Figure 12</xref>).</p>

        <title>Regulation of cpPDC Activity Via <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA</title>
        <p>Little is known about the regulation of cpPDC activity in green algae. DLA2 is constitutively expressed in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> under different light conditions, and thus, it is likely that its enzymatic activity is regulated at the posttranslational level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s007">Figure S7</xref>). One mechanism to regulate cpPDC activity has been attributed to product inhibition by NADH and acetyl-CoA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-TovarMndez1">[11]</xref>. Additionally, cpPDC activity is stimulated in the light by an increase of stromal pH as well as Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration due to enhanced photosynthetic electron flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g010">Figure 10A</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-TovarMndez1">[11]</xref>). However, the prediction of a putative RNA binding site overlapping the E3 attachment site within the DLA2 primary amino acid sequence raised the possibility of competitive binding of either E3 or the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA to this region and, therefore, a further level of cpPDC activity regulation. This idea is supported by the observation that cpPDC activity in the <italic>psbA</italic> deletion mutant <italic>FuD7</italic> is higher than in the PSII mutant <italic>nac2–26</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g010">Figure 10</xref>). This is likely due to the lacking inhibitory effect of the <italic>psbA</italic> mRNA in <italic>FuD7</italic>, which can be recovered by the addition of exogenous <italic>psbA</italic> 5′ UTR RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g010">Figure 10A,B</xref>). This inhibitory effect of <italic>psbA</italic> RNA on cpPDC activity in <italic>FuD7</italic> might suggest a continuous assembly and disassembly of the PDH complex, as it is difficult to imagine how otherwise <italic>psbA</italic> should be able to access the DLA2 subunit, which was reported to be located in the inner core of the enzymatic complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Zhou1">[60]</xref>. Disassembled DLA2 could bind RNA and might then be inhibited from re-association with other PDC subunits. Alternatively, the structure of the cpPDC might be different from those known from mitochondrial or bacterial PDCs. This is supported by sedimentation analyses that show that cpPDC forms less defined complexes as compared to mitochondrial or bacterial PDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Camp1">[61]</xref>. It was speculated that this is due to dissociation of one or more of the component enzymes or association with other enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Camp1">[61]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the data indicate a reciprocal light and acetate-dependent regulation of D1 and cpPDC activity, which might guarantee a coordination of protein and lipid synthesis in the course of thylakoid membrane biogenesis. A linkage between carbon and protein metabolism is additionally supported by earlier studies that revealed that chloroplast protein synthesis, including that of D1, can be induced in cells in the dark phase of a diurnal regime after addition of acetate to the medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Michaels1">[62]</xref>.</p>

        <title>RNA-Binding Activity Might Be an Ancient Feature of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferases</title>
        <p>Our data demonstrate that recombinant E2 proteins from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, human, yeast, and a cyanobacterium all have an intrinsic unspecific RNA binding ability in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g011">11</xref>). This might point to a very ancient feature of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferases as RBPs, which is likely to have occurred even before the separation of mitochondrial and chloroplastic homologues. It should be noted, however, that the binding of the human E2 subunit to the provided plant-specific mRNA was very weak as compared to the other tested E2 subunits, and the significance of its RNA binding capacity requires further investigations.</p>
        <p>Further indications that RNA binding by E2 subunits is conserved are provided by the human mitochondrial E2 subunit of the mtPDC (Hs-E2). Only recently Hs-E2 has been found to interact with the transcription factor STAT5 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5), which was demonstrated to bind mitochondrial DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Chueh1">[63]</xref>. Furthermore, Hs-E2 and STAT5 are translocated to the nucleus under certain conditions, where Hs-E2 is thought to function as a co-activator in STAT5-dependent nuclear gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Chueh2">[64]</xref>. This raises the possibility that regulation of gene expression by E2 subunits occurs in diverse phylogenetic contexts.</p>
        <p>How the RNA binding ability might have been acquired is uncertain, but one might speculate that this occurred before the complex composition of PDC evolved. The ancient E2 enzyme might have had the capacity to bind NAD<sup>+</sup>, a role that is now performed by the E3 subunit of PDC to reoxidize E2-bound dihydrolipoamide produced during catalysis. This is indicated by prediction of a typical NAD<sup>+</sup>/FAD<sup>+</sup> binding site known as the Rossmann fold within the E3 binding region of many E2 subunits including <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> DLA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001482.s010">Figure S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Rao1">[65]</xref>). Interestingly, the Rossmann fold, which is typically described as a functional NAD<sup>+</sup> binding domain, is highly conserved among dehydrogenases and has been reported to be involved in binding of RNA molecules by metabolic enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ciela1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Weiner1">[66]</xref>. One well-studied example is the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is described to specifically bind to AU-rich elements within the 3′ UTRs of several mRNAs via its Rossmann fold domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Nagy1">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Nagy2">[68]</xref>. A wide variety of physiological functions has been attributed to this enzyme–RNA interaction including regulation of mRNA stability, degradation, and/or translation; tRNA and mRNA transport; and as an RNA chaperone (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Bhardwaj1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Ciela1">[5]</xref>). As reported in this study for DLA2, Nagy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001482-Nagy1">[67]</xref> observed a decreased enzymatic activity of GAPDH upon RNA binding in vitro, which also might indicate a reciprocal regulation between metabolic enzyme activity and RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001482-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). In conclusion, the available data suggest a complex and coordinated interplay between metabolic pathways and gene expression in the chloroplast.</p>
