<abstract>
<p>In fungi, mating between partners depends on the molecular recognition of two peptidyl mating pheromones by their respective receptors. The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Sp) has two mating types, Plus (P) and Minus (M). The mating pheromones P-factor and M-factor, secreted by P and M cells, are recognized by the receptors mating type auxiliary minus 2 (Mam2) and mating type auxiliary plus 3 (Map3), respectively. Our recent study demonstrated that a few mutations in both M-factor and Map3 can trigger reproductive isolation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>. Here, we explored the mechanism underlying reproductive isolation through genetic changes of pheromones/receptors in nature. We investigated the diversity of genes encoding the pheromones and their receptor in 150 wild <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> strains. Whereas the amino acid sequences of M-factor and Map3 were completely conserved, those of P-factor and Mam2 were very diverse. In addition, the P-factor gene contained varying numbers of tandem repeats of P-factor (4–8 repeats). By exploring the recognition specificity of pheromones between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> and its close relative <italic>Schizosaccharomyces octosporus</italic> (So), we found that So-M-factor did not have an effect on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> P cells, but So-P-factor had a partial effect on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> M cells. Thus, recognition of M-factor seems to be stringent, whereas that of P-factor is relatively relaxed. We speculate that asymmetric diversification of the two pheromones might be facilitated by the distinctly different specificities of the two receptors. Our findings suggest that M-factor communication plays an important role in defining the species, whereas P-factor communication is able to undergo a certain degree of flexible adaptation–perhaps as a first step toward prezygotic isolation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The emergence of a new species might occur when two groups can no longer mate. Although such reproductive isolation is considered a key evolutionary process, the mechanisms by which it actually occurs have been confined to conjecture. The two sexes (Plus [P] and Minus [M]) of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> each secrete a pheromone (P-factor and M-factor), which binds to a corresponding receptor (mating type auxiliary minus 2 [Mam2] and mating type auxiliary plus 3 [Map3]) on cells of the opposite sex. The interaction between a pheromone and its receptor is essential for successful mating. Here, we explored conservation of the mating pheromone communication system among 150 wild <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> strains of different geographical origins and the closely related species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>octosporus</italic>. We found that 1) the M-factor/Map3 interaction was completely conserved, whereas the P-factor/Mam2 interaction was very diverse in the strains investigated, and 2) most of the P-factor variants were functional across species. Thus, we have revealed an asymmetric pheromone/receptor system in fungal mating: namely, whereas M-factor communication operates extremely stringently, P-factor communication has the flexibility to create variations, perhaps facilitating prezygotic isolation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reproductive isolation, which restricts gene flow between sympatric populations, is one of the key mechanisms of speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref001">1</xref>]. Mating between individuals of closely related species is prevented by a prezygotic barrier, which is mainly caused by changes in signals that enable individuals to appropriately recognize the opposite sex: for example, pheromones in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref003">3</xref>] and amphibians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref005">5</xref>], body color in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref006">6</xref>], and song in birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref007">7</xref>]. Although such reproductive isolation has been frequently studied in higher organisms, far less is known in fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref008">8</xref>]. In ascomycetes including yeasts, mating between partners critically depends on the molecular recognition of peptidyl mating pheromones by receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref010">10</xref>]. Our recent study in the fission yeast <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> demonstrated that several mutations in a pheromone and its corresponding receptor created a new prezygotic barrier that can give rise to a new species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref011">11</xref>]. This experimental observation supports the idea that pheromone/receptor systems drive reproductive isolation through very subtle variations in nature. Thus, genetic alterations of pheromones and their receptors are likely to be important to promote speciation in yeasts. More generally, however, loss of pheromone activity may result in extinction of an organism’s lineage; therefore, changes in the mating pheromone systems might occur gradually and/or coincidently before speciation happens. This hypothesis is an attractive explanation for the speciation process in yeasts, but the mechanisms of genetic alterations of pheromone/receptor systems in nature remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> has two mating types, Plus (P) and Minus (M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref013">13</xref>]. Under nitrogen-limited conditions, two haploid cells of opposite mating types mate via reciprocal stimulation of their mating pheromone receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref014">14</xref>]. P cells secrete a mating pheromone called P-factor, a simple 23-amino acid peptide, which is recognized by its corresponding G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) mating type auxiliary minus 2 (Mam2) on M cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref016">16</xref>]. The mating type auxiliary plus 2<sup>+</sup> (<italic>map2</italic><sup>+</sup>) gene encodes a precursor polypeptide containing four tandem repeats of mature P-factor, which is a mixture of three different peptides in the laboratory strain. P-factor is secreted by the standard secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref016">16</xref>]. On the other hand, M cells secrete a mating pheromone called M-factor, which is recognized by its GPCR Map3 on P cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref017">17</xref>]. Mature M-factor, a farnesylated and methylated peptide of nine amino acids, is encoded by three redundant genes: <italic>mfm1</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>mfm2</italic><sup>+</sup>, and <italic>mfm3</italic><sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref019">19</xref>]. Each of these genes generates a precursor containing a single copy of the same M-factor sequence. M-factor is secreted specifically by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter Mam1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref020">20</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> M cells also produce a pheromone-degrading enzyme encoded by the sexually activated 2<sup>+</sup> (<italic>sxa2</italic><sup>+</sup>) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref023">23</xref>]. Sxa2 is a serine carboxypeptidase that specifically degrades extracellular P-factor. The C-terminal Leu residue of P-factor is removed by Sxa2, which is secreted by M cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref022">22</xref>], and the resulting P-factor lacking Leu is inactive and not recognized by Mam2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref024">24</xref>]. Yeast cells sense a gradient of pheromones secreted by the opposite cell and then extend a mating projection toward the pheromone source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref025">25</xref>]. Degradation of the pheromones by the peptidase is thought to make the gradient more stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref026">26</xref>]. In contrast, an enzyme that degrades M-factor has not yet been found. Instead, expression of the <italic>mfm</italic> genes encoding M-factor might be differentially controlled to facilitate fine tuning. These differences in the two mating pheromones, including chemical structure, secretion pathway, and degradation, are widely common in ascomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref009">9</xref>], but the biological significance remains unclear.</p>
<p>The standard laboratory strain of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, L968, has four copies of the P-factor–encoding sequence and three genes encoding M-factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref027">27</xref>]. Hence, evolution has a mechanism for creating new versions of pheromones, while at the same time, cells retain the ability to mate via the original versions; therefore, we hypothesized that the redundancy in the pheromones might allow unrestricted diversification. In this study, we examined how pheromones and their receptors coevolve in nature. First, we examined pheromone diversity by determining the nucleotide sequences of the pheromone and receptor genes in 150 wild <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref029">29</xref>], finding that the amino acid sequence of M-factor and Map3 was completely conserved, whereas that of P-factor and Mam2 was very diverse. In some strains, for example, the copy number of P-factor increased to 5–8 repeats. Second, we analyzed the specificity of pheromones–receptor recognition between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> and the related species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>octosporus</italic>. Whereas So-M-factor was not functional in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, all So-P-factors tested were partially functional in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, enabling these cells to mate successfully using So-P-factors. Thus, recognition of M-factor is highly stringent, whereas that of P-factor is relatively relaxed. Our findings suggest that M-factor communication plays an important role in partner discrimination, whereas P-factor communication allows flexible adaptation to create variations. We speculate that such an asymmetric pheromone/receptor system may have evolved to create a prezygotic barrier in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>.</p>

<p>To investigate the diversity of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> mating pheromones and their corresponding receptors in nature, we analyzed 150 wild strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s008">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s009">S2</xref> Tables) whose origins differ from the standard laboratory strain, L968, first described by U.

<p>Notably, three <italic>mfm</italic> genes of all 151 strains (i.e., 453 genes in total) produced an identical mature M-factor peptide, YTPKVPYMC<sup>Far</sup>-OCH<sub>3</sub> (102 genes have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref033">33</xref>]). Many mutations were found in the prosequences and introns, but only one mutation was found in the mature M-factor–encoding region; this was a synonymous change that did not cause an amino acid substitution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s011">S4 Table</xref>). Moreover, the amino acid sequences of Map3 in the 150 strains were also identical to that in the L968 strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t001">Table 1</xref>). In other words, the amino acid sequences of the M-factor/Map3 pair seem to be completely conserved in nature. In contrast, the sequences of the <italic>map2</italic> genes were very diverse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s010">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s011">S4</xref> Tables). Whereas the <italic>map2</italic> gene in L968 carries four P-factor–encoding tandem repeats (P1-P2-P3-P2), extensive variations in the number of repeats were observed in the 150 strains, ranging from four to eight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In addition, the <italic>map2</italic> genes of the wild strains were predicted to produce six different mature P-factor peptides (P1–P6; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Interestingly, there were five different amino acid sequences of Mam2 across the 150 strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the amino acid sequences of the P-factor/Mam2 pair seem to be very diverse in nature.

<title>Wild <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> strains simultaneously produce multiple P-factor peptides</title>
<p>Having observed increased numbers of P-factor–encoding repeats in the <italic>map2</italic> gene in about half of the 150 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), we tested whether repeat number directly affects mating frequency. The native 4-repeat Map2 open reading frame (ORF) from the L968 strain was replaced with an ORF carrying different numbers of the P2 repeat, which was first characterized as P-factor of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref016">16</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>). We found that a decrease in P2 repeat number (&lt;4 repeats) resulted in an extremely low frequency of zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). For example, the strain with the 3-repeat ORF produced less than one-tenth of the zygotes (%) of the strain with the 4-repeat ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). However, few significant differences in mating efficiency were observed among the strains carrying an ORF with more than 4 repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To compare the activity of the different P-factor peptides (P1–P6), we introduced a modified <italic>map2</italic> gene carrying four tandem repeats of each P-factor into the P-factorless strain (FY23418; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s008">S1 Table</xref>), in which the native <italic>map2</italic><sup>+</sup> gene had been deleted (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>). The resulting strains each produced one of the six P-factors. The mating efficiency of these strains was assessed by the frequency of zygotes. The strain producing four P2 peptides from the <italic>map2</italic> gene showed a high frequency of zygotes (66.9% ± 4.4%); remarkably, however, the zygote frequency of the remaining strains producing the other P-factor peptides (P1, P3–P6) was extremely low or zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Furthermore, in a strain in which the native <italic>map2</italic><sup>+</sup> gene carrying a sequence of repeats (P1-P2-P3-P2) was introduced, the frequency of zygotes was fairly high (76.6% ± 5.1%), despite the production of only two copies of the P2 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). To determine whether the order of nucleotide sequences encoding mature P-factor affects zygote frequency, we also introduced a <italic>map2</italic> gene carrying a permuted sequence of repeats (P2-P3-P2-P1) into the FY23418 strain. Similar to the strain with the native sequence, this strain also mated at high frequency (74.2% ± 1.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2D</xref>); therefore, the effect of peptide-coding position appears small.</p>
<p>Next, we considered that if mature P-factor production is modulated by a length-dependent biosynthetic pathway, the low mating efficiency observed in strains carrying an ORF with fewer than 4 repeats might be attributed to translation level. To examine this possibility, we constructed a <italic>map2</italic> gene carrying the four tandem P-factor–encoding repeats P5-P2-P5-P2 and introduced it into the FY23418 strain. Surprisingly, however, this strain was almost as sterile as the strain with the 2-repeat ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Thus, the apparently inactive P1 and P3 peptides might have important roles during the mating process. The amino acid sequences of the P1 and P3 peptides slightly differ from that of the P2 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In fact, some peptides with slight mutations of P1–P3 had markedly decreased mating efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). These results indicate that the substitution of only a few amino acids of P-factor have a large influence on copulation.</p>
<p>To investigate further the causes of the low frequencies of the P-factor peptides (P1, P3–P6), we constructed strains carrying two <italic>map2</italic> genes encoding four tandem repeats of each P-factor (i.e., eight copies in total) and examined the zygote frequency of these strains in the same way. Remarkably, the strains producing eight copies of peptide showed a much higher frequency of zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) relative to those carrying one gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). We considered that this is probably due to a dose-dependent effect. Overall, these results indicated that the P2 peptide is likely to be most compatible with the native Mam2 receptor; curiously, however, no wild strains that we investigated generated a precursor containing only copies of the P2 peptide sequence.</p>

<title>Production of multiple P-factors might be advantageous for mate choice</title>
<p>As described above, the <italic>map2</italic> gene was found to contain at least four tandem repeats encoding multiple P-factor peptides in all 150 wild strains. To assess the effect of producing multiple P-factors, we performed a quantitative competitive mating assay. In this experiment, P cells producing a multiple P-factor (P1-P2-P3-P2) and P cells producing a single P-factor (P2-P2-P2-P2) were inoculated with wild-type M cells onto malt extract agar (MEA) plates at a cell number ratio of 1:1:2. The three strains were differentially marked by different drug-resistant markers (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>). After incubation for 24 hours, the cell suspension was spread onto yeast extract agar (YEA) plates containing combinations of the appropriate drugs. Doubly resistant hybrid descendants of mating between P cells and M cells were counted to determine the recombinant frequency.</p>
<p>The assay indicated that M cells showed a slight preference to mate with P cells producing a multiple-type P-factor as compared with a single-type P-factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This tendency was not influenced by the type of drug-resistant marker used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These results suggest that the production of multiple P-factors might be advantageous for mate choice by M cells.</p>

The same number of two P cells and twice the number of cells of the M cells were mixed and grown on MEA.

<title>Most P-factor peptides are recognized by Mam2</title>
<p>In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, P-factor is largely degraded outside the cell by the carboxyl peptidase Sxa2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref022">22</xref>]. Next, therefore, we examined whether each P-factor peptide is truly recognized by Mam2 in the absence of Sxa2. An M-type strain lacking Sxa2 (TS402; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s008">S1 Table</xref>) was treated with synthetic P-factors at different concentrations (0–1,000 nM) in nitrogen-free liquid medium (EMM2−N). Yeast cells elongate a mating projection (“shmoo”) when they sense sufficient pheromones; therefore, the ability of Mam2 to recognize the different P-factors was determined by measuring the ratio between the length (L) and width (W) of an individual cell (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>). Here, we defined cells with an L/W ratio of 2.0 or more as shmooing cells.</p>
<p>The addition of P2 peptide clearly induced cell elongation at 10 nM after 1 day of incubation. According to our definition, one-third of cells treated with P2 peptide (10 nM) became shmooing cells in response to P-factor after 1 day (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Notably, cells treated with 10 nM P1, P3, P4, and P6 also elongated, indicating that these peptides were recognized by Mam2. As compared with P2 peptide, however, the proportion of shmooing cells after treatment with these peptides was significantly low (15%–23% at 10 nM; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In contrast, the P5 peptide, produced only by the 24CBS5682 strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s009">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s010">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s011">S4</xref> Tables), was not recognized by Mam2 even when the cells were treated with a concentration of 1,000 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). To measure the activity of the P5 peptide accurately, we used a P-factor–sensitive strain (TS578; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>) and treated the cells with 1,000 nM synthetic P5 peptide. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, no cells underwent shmoo elongation. This result indicates that the P5 peptide is not recognized by native Mam2, as far as we have examined. In conclusion, the shmoo formation assay indicated that most P-factor peptides are sufficiently recognized by Mam2 in vitro.</p>

<title>P2 peptide is degraded more rapidly by Sxa2</title>
<p>Sxa2 removes the C-terminal Leu residue of P-factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref022">22</xref>]. Based on the above results, we considered that differences in the processing of each P-factor peptide by Sxa2 might affect pheromone-based mate choice. To examine this possibility, the <italic>sxa2</italic><sup>+</sup> ORF was cloned into the pTS111 plasmid downstream of the no message in thiamine 1<sup>+</sup> (<italic>nmt1</italic><sup>+</sup>) promoter, which is strongly expressed in absence of thiamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref034">34</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>). The resulting plasmid (pTS284) was then introduced into the TS402 strain lacking Sxa2. The resulting cells were grown in EMM2 medium without thiamine to induce the <italic>nmt1</italic><sup>+</sup> promoter, and the culture supernatant was assayed to confirm carboxypeptidase activity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>). Next, each P-factor peptide (200 μM) was mixed with an aliquot of the cell-free culture supernatant including abundant active Sxa2 (total protein 100 ng) for up to 60 minutes, and the amount of leucine released from each P-factor was determined as a measure of Sxa2 activity.</p>
<p>All six P-factor peptides (P1–P6) were sufficiently degraded after 60 minutes in the presence of Sxa2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t002">Table 2</xref>). Unexpectedly, degradation of P2 peptide was found to be more efficient than that of other P-factor peptides. In 10 minutes, approximately 70% of P2 peptide (133.0 ± 21.7 μM) was degraded, as compared with, for example, approximately 50% of P1 (97.7 ± 5.8 μM; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t002">Table 2</xref>). These results suggest that native Sxa2 might not efficiently degrade P-factor peptides containing a few residues that differ from P2 peptide. Thus, the P2 peptide is likely to be the best substrate for Sxa2 protease. In fact, <italic>sxa2</italic> deletion mutants are virtually sterile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref023">23</xref>]. Hence, degradation of P-factor seems to be important for the correct orchestration of mating. We speculate that the diversification of P-factor probably affects the selection of mates by M cells.</p>

<p>Three of the nine amino acids of So-M-factor were found to differ from those of Sp-M-factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). To assess whether So-M-factor is recognized at all by the M-factor receptor of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> (Sp-Map3), we carried out a shmooing assay (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s005">S5B Fig</xref>) in which we measured the L/W ratio of cells treated with synthetic So-M-factors at various concentrations in EMM2−N. The M-factor-sensitive strain (TS405; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s008">S1 Table</xref>) significantly induced cell elongation after one day of incubation with 100 nM Sp-M-factor but showed no elongation when treated with So-M-factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Under these conditions, approximately 40% of cells treated with Sp-M-factor peptide underwent shmoo formation, whereas no cells treated with So-M-factor peptide underwent shmooing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). When the concentration of So-M-factor was raised to 1,000 nM, the cells underwent shmoo elongation a little (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). These results imply that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> is reproductively isolated from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>octosporus</italic>, owing to the lack of compatibility of M-factor.</p>
<p>On average, eight of the 23 amino acids of P-factor differed between the two species. To test whether the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>octosporus</italic> P-factor peptides (hereafter named P1’–P4’; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s005">S5C Fig</xref>) are recognized by the P-factor receptor of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> (Sp-Mam2), we treated TS402 with each of the four synthetic So-P-factor peptides. Remarkably, cells formed visible shmoos in all cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). The most effective peptide was P2’; that is, one-fifth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cells treated with P2’ peptide (10 nM) elongated a shmoo in response to P-factor after one day, and the proportion of shmooing cells increased to about 80% at a peptide concentration of 100 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). In contrast, recognition of the P4’ peptide by Sp-Mam2 was relatively low.

<title>A pheromone-degrading enzyme might facilitate pheromone diversity</title>
<p>The above findings showed that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cells can respond to So-P-factors produced by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>octosporus</italic>. We therefore examined whether the P-factor–degrading enzyme of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> (Sp-Sxa2) can degrade So-P-factors. Each of the synthetic So-P-factor peptides was mixed at 200 μM with culture supernatant containing active Sp-Sxa2, and the amount of leucine released from each P-factor was measured at fixed time points, as described above for Sp-P-factors. All four So-P-factor peptides (P1’–P4’) were considerably degraded in the presence of Sp-Sxa2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t002">Table 2</xref>). The P2’ peptide was degraded most efficiently, with 83.7 ± 4.0 μM degraded after 60 minutes of incubation; as compared with Sp-P-factor peptides, however, Sp-Sxa2 inefficiently removed the Leu residue from So-P-factor peptides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t002">Table 2</xref>). In conclusion, Sp-Sxa2 acts most effectively on Sp-P-factors but has the capacity to degrade P-factor peptides from related species such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>octosporus</italic>, probably limiting the interspecies mating response.</p>
<p>Lastly, we examined the diversity of Sxa2 in nature. In the 150 wild <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> strains, there were four different amino acid sequences of Sxa2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s011">S4 Table</xref>). In exploring the asymmetric diversification of the two mating pheromones, it is notable that M-factor is not degraded by a specific enzyme. We speculate that overlapping regions of P-factor (probably the C terminus) are recognized by both its receptor Mam2 and its degradation enzyme Sxa2, thereby facilitating coevolution of their substrate specificities together with divergence of P-factor. Taken together, diversification of the two pheromones might be accelerated asymmetrically by the distinctly different specificities of the two receptors, in addition to the existence of Sxa2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mutational alterations of the pheromone/receptor system can affect the recognition between mating partners, resulting in prezygotic isolation. In this study, we explored the diversification of the pheromones and cognate receptors of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> in nature. We found that the amino acid sequences of M-factor and its receptor Map3 are completely conserved, whereas those of P-factor and its receptor Mam2 are very diversified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t001">Table 1</xref>). Such asymmetric diversification of the two mating pheromones was also seen in the related species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>octosporus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Moreover, we noticed that So-M-factor was not functional on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cells, whereas all of the So-P-factors tested were partially functional; in other words, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cells were capable of mating with cells producing only So-P-factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Therefore, it is more likely that the recognition specificities of the two pheromone receptors vary in strictness for their respective pheromones. Map3 and Mam2 are both class IV GPCRs but differ clearly in their amino acid sequences. Recently, Rogers and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref010">10</xref>] reported that a-type pheromones (lipid peptide) either promote efficient mating completely or do not promote it at all, while α-type pheromones (simple peptide) show a more graded distribution of mating efficiency in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Thus, the different specificities of the two GPCRs might lead to asymmetric competence and diversification of pheromones.</p>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> has three genes encoding Sp-M-factor, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>octosporus</italic> has six putative genes encoding So-M-factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Such redundancy might enable the cells to alter one copy of M-factor to adapt to genetic changes in Map3, while keeping the others unchanged. In fact, the N-terminal half of M-factor has been shown to be dispensable for recognition by Map3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref033">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, the redundant genes encoding M-factor peptides generate the same sequence of amino acids in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Wild-type <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> has four copies of P-factor, so in principle both pheromones should be free to evolve. We speculate that the amount and/or activity of M-factor might affect mating frequency. Previously, Nielsen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref019">19</xref>] reported that any one of the three genes of M-factor is sufficient for mating. However, this might not reflect the actual situation in nature. For example, efficient copulation might depend largely on the number of M-factor genes under more severe nutrient-limited conditions, resulting in restricted variation. Because M-factor is encoded by different genes, rather than by repeats, intergenic conversion can occur with considerable frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref036">36</xref>]. Concerted evolution of the <italic>mfm</italic> genes might allow conservation of the sequence of mature M-factor and the rapid spread of favorable mutations. We could not confirm whether there is an increase or decrease in <italic>mfm</italic> genes in the 150 wild <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> strains, but the reason why the M-factor sequence is fixed will be investigated in a future study.</p>
<p>In the wild <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> strains, the number of P-factor–encoding repeats in the <italic>map2</italic> gene varied from four to eight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Variations in repeat number in the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> genus have previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref038">38</xref>]. For example, decreasing numbers of repeats in Mfα1, a structural gene for α-factor pheromone, results in a stepwise decrease in α-factor production in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref039">39</xref>]. Our experimental data also revealed that removing a single repeat of the 4-repeat sequence in <italic>map2</italic> has a marked effect on mating frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Perhaps, decreasing numbers of repeats in the <italic>map2</italic> gene might lead to a lower production of P-factor in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>. In addition, a previous study suggested that the secretion pathway has a minimum size requirement for transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref040">40</xref>]. Hence, the product of the <italic>map2</italic> gene might need to have sufficient length for processing by the biosynthetic pathway. Although a higher repeat number in the <italic>map2</italic> gene might result in increased P-factor production, further increases in repeat number do not necessarily lead to greater pheromone production because Rogers and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref038">38</xref>] also showed that an 8-repeat strain is less favorable than a 6-repeat strain for mating choice in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, probably due to reduced pheromone production caused by a decrease in the rate of translation. When the various <italic>map2</italic> genes (4–8 repeats) obtained from the 150 wild strains were integrated into the FY23418 strain, almost all of the resulting strains showed high mating frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). The only exception was the <italic>map2</italic> gene (6 repeats) obtained from the 22CBS10468 strain (<italic>map2_D8</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s010">S3 Table</xref>), in which a spacer sequence located between the fourth and the fifth repeat was changed from KK<underline>R</underline> to KK<underline>C</underline> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s011">S4 Table</xref>). The kexin-related endopeptidase kexin-related protease 1 (Krp1) cleaves the KKR motif (three basic amino acids) in the Golgi during the biosynthetic pathway to generate mature P-factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref041">41</xref>]; therefore, such a mutation might affect the production of P-factor. Yeast cells choose a favorable partner producing the highest levels of pheromone, whereas a cell that cannot produce pheromones is not chosen as a mating partner by the opposite mating cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref043">43</xref>]. Such fluctuations in the repeat number of P-factor are likely to have an influence on various factors related to mating events.</p>
<p>All of the wild <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> strains produced at least three different P-factors, as far as we investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Curiously, however, our experimental data clearly showed that the P2 peptide was much more efficiently recognized by Mam2 as compared with the others in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Why don’t <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cells produce only P2 peptides? Interestingly, we found that cells producing multiple different P-factors seemed to be slightly preferred as a mate by the opposite cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This might be explained by the differences in the extent of degradation by Sxa2. In fact, <italic>sxa2</italic> deletion mutants are virtually sterile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref023">23</xref>]. Recent studies by Martin’s group have clearly shown that the local pheromone gradient rather than the absolute pheromone concentration is important for efficient mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref044">44</xref>]. In this study, we revealed that all constructed strains lacking the <italic>sxa2</italic><sup>+</sup> gene showed fairly low zygote frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s002">S2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s006">S6</xref> Figs), and although the P2 peptide is recognized more efficiently by native Mam2, it is also degraded more rapidly by Sxa2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t002">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, we consider that the production of different peptides might affect the whole orchestration of mating by slightly changing the substrate specificity of Sxa2, resulting in the diversification of P-factor.</p>
<p>One of the possible reasons for the extremely low mating frequency of cells expressing each of the P1, P3, P4, and P6 (4 repeats) peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) is that these peptides are not expressed as effectively as P2. However, we could not examine this possibility here. All functions of sexual differentiation (i.e., expression of pheromone and receptor genes) are stimulated only by nitrogen starvation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>; hence, it is extremely difficult to transfer the majority of conventional methods used with <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> (e.g., Halo assay) to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>. Nielsen’s group developed an alternative technique based on the observation that pheromone stimulation is necessary to undergo meiosis and sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref045">45</xref>]. In our case, however, there are significant differences in bioactivity among the peptides; thus, it is hard to estimate the amount of each P-factor secreted. Therefore, a method that quantifies pheromone secretions independent of the bioactivity of peptides will be needed in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>. Nevertheless, we believe that the P1, P3, P4, and P6 peptides are certainly expressed because the strains carrying two <italic>map2</italic> genes showed a much higher frequency of zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) relative to those carrying one gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>We further noticed that there is a positive relationship between the recognition of P-factor by Mam2 and its efficient degradation by Sxa2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s003">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000101.t002">Table 2</xref>). This is because both Mam2 and Sxa2 are likely to depend on the same regions of P-factor activity. A recent study also suggests that coevolution of sterile 2 (Ste2) (a receptor for α-pheromone) and barrier 1 (Bar1) (a peptidase of α-pheromone) can occur, together with evolution of α-pheromone in <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, because Ste2 and Bar1 recognize the overlapping regions of α-pheromone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref046">46</xref>]. In this study, although we did not obtain conclusive evidence that novel compatible combinations of the P-factor/Mam2 and P-factor/Sxa2 pairs can occur (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>), such coevolution might proceed little by little, even though reproductive isolation would not be prevented during this time.</p>
<p>This study has revealed an asymmetric diversification of the pheromone/receptor system in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>: namely, recognition by M-factor is extremely stringent, whereas that by P-factor is relatively relaxed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000101.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In ascomycetes, one pheromone is a farnesylated peptide with hydrophobicity (i.e., M-factor), while the other is an unmodified peptide with hydrophilicity (i.e., P-factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref009">9</xref>]. This chemical asymmetry might be more beneficial for yeasts living in a liquid environment because a hydrophilic peptide is probably more diffusible and therefore might reach far-away cells, enabling rapid identification of mating partners. In fact, our findings lead us to propose two hypotheses. One is that the sexual behavior of individual species in nature is controlled by sexual interactions across species. The interaction between a pheromone and its receptor is essential for successful mating and appropriate mate choice. In the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> clade, outbreeding is thought to be relatively rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref048">48</xref>]; therefore, this hypothesis might be reasonable for yeasts in which the haploid is thought to be the stable point of their life cycle. The other hypothesis is that the farnesyl group of pheromones is the key determinant for mating partner discrimination. Whereas M cells have a high basal production of M-factor, P-factor production is fully dependent on M-factor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref049">49</xref>]. Perhaps, this difference is related to the conservation of M-factor. Overall, it seems that the asymmetric system in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> might allow flexible adaptation of the simple peptide to mutational changes in the pheromone/receptor pair while maintaining stringent recognition for mating partners by the lipid peptide, perhaps as a first step toward prezygotic isolation.</p>

<title>An asymmetric system of pheromone recognition in fission yeast.</title>
<p>The specificity of recognition of M-factor (lipid peptide) is extremely stringent, whereas that of the P-factor (simple peptide) is relatively relaxed, allowing cross-reactions to occur between two yeast species. Therefore, the diversity of the two mating pheromones might facilitate asymmetrically in nature. This possession of distinctly different specificities for the mating pheromones might guarantee not only stringent recognition of mating partners but also flexible adaptation to various mutational changes in a combination of a pheromone/receptor.

<title>Construction of strains with variable numbers of P2 peptide in the Map2 ORF</title>
<p>The <italic>map2</italic><sup>+</sup> gene (approximately 2.6 kb) containing its promoter and terminator regions was amplified from L968 genomic DNA using the primer set oTS81/82. The DNA fragment was fused by using a Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs) to a linearized vector derived from the integration vector pBS-ade6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000101.ref033">33</xref>], which was prepared by inverse PCR with the primer set oTS79/80. The resultant plasmid pTS13 (all plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000101.s013">S6 Table</xref>) was used as a starting template. To create a P2 unit, the correct two oligos (oTS73 and oTS93; reverse complements of each other) were mixed in Annealing Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM NaCl), incubated at 70 °C for 10 minutes by a GeneAmp PCR System 9700, and then slowly cooled to 25 °C (approximately 1 hour). The DNA fragment that was amplified from the resulting double-strand DNA fragment (the P2 unit) using the primer set oTS74/75 was fused to a linearized vector derived from pTS13, which was prepared by inverse PCR with the primer set oTS71/72 to replace the <italic>map2</italic><sup>+</sup> gene.

Three mixed DNA fragments were fused to a linearized vector derived from pTS10, which was prepared by inverse PCR with the primer set oTS72/179. The resultant plasmids had various random repeats in the Map2 ORF. The number of repeats in each plasmid was checked by PCR using oTS85/86, and plasmids with the desired number of repeats (2–4 repeats) were sequenced to confirm their sequences.

<p>The <italic>sxa2</italic><sup>+</sup> gene (approximately 3.5 kb) containing its promoter and terminator regions was amplified from L968 genomic DNA using the primer set oTS624/625. The DNA fragment was fused to a linearized vector derived from the integration vector pFA6a-natMX6, which was prepared by inverse PCR with the primer set oTS35/36 to construct the plasmid pTS246. The <italic>sxa2</italic> gene (approximately 1.5 kb) was amplified from the genomic DNAs of three wild strains (01CBS10391, 04CBS2775, and 101FY29038) using the primer set oTS664/665. Each of the DNA fragments was fused to a linearized vector derived from pTS246, which was prepared by inverse PCR with the primer set oTS627/628 to replace the <italic>sxa2</italic><sup>+</sup> gene. All obtained plasmids were integrated into the TS356 strain after restriction with <italic>Bam</italic>HI near the center of the terminator region.</p>
