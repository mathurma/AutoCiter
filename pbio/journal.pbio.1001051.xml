        <p>The neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), produced by neurons and glia, affects multiple processes in the brain, including neuronal survival and neurogenesis during development and in aging. We provide evidence that DHEA interacts with pro-survival TrkA and pro-death p75<sup>NTR</sup> membrane receptors of neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), acting as a neurotrophic factor: (1) the anti-apoptotic effects of DHEA were reversed by siRNA against TrkA or by a specific TrkA inhibitor; (2) [<sup>3</sup>H]-DHEA binding assays showed that it bound to membranes isolated from HEK293 cells transfected with the cDNAs of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors (K<sub>D</sub>: 7.4±1.75 nM and 5.6±0.55 nM, respectively); (3) immobilized DHEA pulled down recombinant and naturally expressed TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors; (4) DHEA induced TrkA phosphorylation and NGF receptor-mediated signaling; Shc, Akt, and ERK1/2 kinases down-stream to TrkA receptors and TRAF6, RIP2, and RhoGDI interactors of p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors; and (5) DHEA rescued from apoptosis TrkA receptor positive sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia in NGF null embryos and compensated NGF in rescuing from apoptosis NGF receptor positive sympathetic neurons of embryonic superior cervical ganglia.

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate ester are the most abundant steroid hormones in humans, and DHEA was described as the first neurosteroid produced in the brain. DHEA is known to participate in multiple events in the brain, including neuronal survival and neurogenesis. However, to date no specific cellular receptor has been described for this important neurosteroid. In this study, we provide evidence that DHEA exerts its neurotrophic effects by directly interacting with the TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> membrane receptors of nerve growth factor (NGF), and efficiently activates their downstream signaling pathways. This activation prevents the apoptotic loss of NGF receptor positive sensory and sympathetic neurons. The interaction of DHEA with NGF receptors may also offer a mechanistic explanation for the multiple actions of DHEA in other peripheral biological systems expressing NGF receptors, such as the immune, reproductive, and cardiovascular systems.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a steroid, produced in adrenals, in neurons and in glia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Baulieu1">[1]</xref>. The physiological role of brain DHEA appears to be local, i.e. paracrine, while that produced from adrenals, which represents the almost exclusive source of circulating DHEA, is systemic. The precipitous decline of both brain and circulating DHEA with advancing age has been associated with aging-related neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Baulieu1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Compagnone1">[2]</xref>. It is experimentally supported that DHEA protects neurons against noxious conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Charalampopoulos1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Lapchak1">[6]</xref>. DHEA exerts its multiple pro-survival effects either directly modulating at micromolar concentrations γ-aminobutiric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), or sigma1 receptors, or following its conversion to estrogens and androgens. We have recently shown that nanomolar concentrations of DHEA protect sympathoadrenal PC12 cells from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Belanger1">[7]</xref>. PC12 cells do not express functional GABA<sub>A</sub> or NMDA receptors and cannot metabolize DHEA to estrogens and androgens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Charalampopoulos2">[8]</xref>. The anti-apoptotic effect of DHEA in PC12 cells is mediated by high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> at nanomolar levels) specific membrane binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Charalampopoulos3">[9]</xref>. Activation of DHEA membrane binding sites results in an acute, transient, and sequential phosphorylation of the pro-survival MEK/ERK kinases, which, in turn, activate transcription factors CREB and NFκB, which afford the transcriptional control of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. In parallel, activation of DHEA membrane binding sites induces the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt kinases, leading to phosphorylation/deactivation of the pro-apoptotic Bad protein and protection of PC12 cells from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Charalampopoulos4">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In fact, the anti-apoptotic pathways in sympathoadrenal cells initiated by DHEA at the membrane level strikingly resemble those sensitive to neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF promotes survival and rescues from apoptosis neural crest–derived sympathetic neurons (including their related sympathoadrenal cells) and sensory neurons involved in noniception. NGF binds with high affinity (K<sub>D</sub>: 0.01 nM) to transmembrane tyrosine kinase TrkA receptor and with lower affinity (K<sub>D</sub>: 1.0 nM) to p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor, a membrane protein belonging to the TNF receptor superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Reichardt1">[11]</xref>. In the presence of TrkA receptors, p75<sup>NTR</sup> participates in the formation of high affinity binding sites and enhances NGF responsiveness, leading to cell survival signals. In the absence of TrkA, p75<sup>NTR</sup> generates cell death signals. Indeed, docking of TrkA by NGF initiates receptor dimerization and phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues 490 and 785 on the receptor. Phosphotyrosine-490 interacts with Shc and other adaptor proteins resulting in activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling kinase pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Reichardt1">[11]</xref>. These signals lead to the activation of prosurvival transcription factors CREB and NFκB, the subsequent production of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and prevention of apoptotic cell death of sympathetic neurons and sympathoadrenal cells, including PC12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Riccio1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Intrigued by the similarities in the prosurvival membrane signaling of DHEA and NGF, we set out to examine in the present study whether the anti-apoptotic effects of DHEA are mediated by NGF receptors. To address this issue we employed a multifaceted approach, designing an array of specific experiments: we used RNA interference (RNAi) to define the involvement of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors in the anti-apoptotic action of DHEA; we assessed membrane binding of DHEA in HEK293 cells transfected with the TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> plasmid cDNAs, using binding assays, confocal laser microscopy, and flow cytometry; to investigate the potential direct physical interaction of DHEA with NGF receptors, we tested the ability of immobilized DHEA to pull-down recombinant or naturally expressed TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors; finally, we examined the ability of DHEA to rescue from apoptosis NGF receptor sensitive dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons of NGF null mice and NGF deprived rat superior cervical ganglia sympathetic neurons in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Crowley1">[13]</xref>. We provide evidence that DHEA directly binds to NGF receptors to protect neuronal cells against apoptosis, acting as a neurotrophic factor.</p>

        <title>RNA Interference against TrkA Receptors Reverses the Anti-Apoptotic Effect of DHEA</title>
        <p>To test the involvement of NGF receptors in the anti-apoptotic effect of DHEA in serum deprived PC12 cells we have used a combination of three different sequences of siRNAs for TrkA and two different shRNAs for p75<sup>NTR</sup> transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Vilar1">[14]</xref>. The effectiveness of si/shRNAs was shown by the remarkable decrease of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> protein levels in PC12 cells, observed by immunoblotting analysis, using GAPDH as reference standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Scrambled siRNAs were ineffective in decreasing TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> protein levels and did not significantly alter the effect of DHEA (unpublished data). FACS analysis of apoptotic cells (stained with Annexin V) has shown that DHEA and membrane impermeable DHEA-BSA conjugate at 100 nM diminished the number of apoptotic cells in serum deprived PC12 cell cultures from 53.5%±17.6% increase of apoptosis in serum free condition (control) to 6%±1.4% and 13%±5.2%, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 versus control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Decreased TrkA expression in serum deprived PC12 cells with siRNAs resulted in the almost complete reversal of the anti-apoptotic effects of NGF and DHEA or DHEA-BSA membrane-impermeable conjugate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Co-transfection of serum deprived PC12 cells with the si/shRNAs for TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors did not modify the effect of the TrkA deletion alone. Furthermore, transfection of serum deprived PC12 cells with shRNAs against p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor alone did not significantly alter the anti-apoptotic effects of NGF and DHEA, suggesting that their anti-apoptotic effects are primarily afforded by TrkA receptors.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Transfection of serum deprived PC12 cells with the siRNAs against the TrkA transcript fully annulled the ability of DHEA to maintain elevated levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Again, transfection with the shRNA against p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor alone did not significantly affect Bcl-2 induction by DHEA, further supporting the hypothesis that TrkA is the main mediator of the anti-apoptotic effect of DHEA in this system.</p>
        <p>It appears that the ratio of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors determines the effect of DHEA or NGF on cell apoptosis and survival. Indeed, both NGF and DHEA induced apoptosis of nnr5 cells, a clone of PC12 cell line, known to express only pro-death p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming the pro-apoptotic function of this receptor. Blockade of p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression by shRNA almost completely reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of both agents. The anti-apoptotic effect of NGF and DHEA was remarkably restored after transfection of nnr5 cells with the TrkA cDNA, the efficacy of reversal being proportionally dependent on the amount of transfected TrkA cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>DHEA was also controlling the response of NGF receptor-positive cells, by regulating TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor levels, mimicking NGF. Serum deprived PC12 cells were exposed to 100 nM of DHEA or 100 ng/ml of NGF for 12, 24, and 48 h; TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> protein levels were measured in cell lysates with immunoblotting, using specific antibodies against TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteins, and were normalized against GAPDH. Both NGF and DHEA significantly increased pro-survival TrkA receptor levels in the time frame studied, i.e. from 12 to 48 h (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001051.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

        <p>We have also tested the anti-apoptotic effects of DHEA in neural crest deriving superior cervical ganglia (SCG), a classical NGF/TrkA sensitive mammalian neuronal tissue, containing primarily one class of neurons, principal sympathetic neurons. Indeed, NGF and TrkA receptors are absolutely required for SCG sympathetic neuron survival during late embryogenesis and early postnatal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Crowley1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Smeyne1">[15]</xref>.

Dispersed rat sympathetic SCG neurons at P1 were isolated and cultured for at least 7 d in the presence of 100 ng/ml NGF before the experiments are performed, in order to obtain an enriched, quasi-homogenous (95%) neuronal cell culture. Enriched SCGs were then incubated in the presence of 100 ng/ml NGF or in the same medium as above but lacking NGF and containing a polyclonal rabbit anti-NGF-neutralizing antiserum in the absence or the presence of 100 nM DHEA. Withdrawal of NGF strongly increased the number of apoptotic sympathetic neurons stained with Annexin V, while DHEA effectively compensated for NGF by decreasing the levels of apoptotic neurons. This effect was blocked by a specific TrkA inhibitor, thus suggesting the involvement of TrkA receptors as the main mediator of the anti-apoptotic action of DHEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>HEK293 cells (not expressing TrkA or p75<sup>NTR</sup>) were transfected with an empty vector (control) or a specific TrkA or p75<sup>NTR</sup> vector; transfection efficiency was assessed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g003">Figure 3A and C,F</xref> inserts), confocal laser microscopy, and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g003">Figure 3B,D</xref>).

To rule out the possibility that the loss of specific binding might be due to the transfection process, we tested binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]-DHEA to membranes isolated from PC12 cells transfected with siRNA against GAPDH. Saturation binding and Scatchard analysis have shown that [<sup>3</sup>H]-DHEA bound to membranes from PC12-siRNA GAPDH cells with a K<sub>D</sub> = 1.068±0.43 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
        <p>The selectivity of DHEA binding to HEK293<sup>TrkA</sup> and HEK293<sup>p75NTR</sup> cell membranes was examined by performing heterologous [<sup>3</sup>H]-DHEA displacement experiments using a number of non-labeled steroids or NGF. Binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]-DHEA to membranes isolated from both HEK293<sup>TrkA</sup> and HEK293<sup>p75NTR</sup> cells was effectively displaced by NGF (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.8±0.2 and 1.19±0.45 nM, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001051.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

In contrast, displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H]-DHEA binding to membranes from both HEK293<sup>TrkA</sup> and HEK293<sup>p75NTR</sup> cells was shown by sulfated ester of DHEA, DHEAS (IC<sub>50</sub>: 6.1±1.1 and 8.1±1.2 nM, respectively, <italic>n</italic> = 3), and testosterone (Testo) (IC<sub>50</sub>: 5.3±2.1 and 7.4±3.2 nM, respectively).

        <p>Our binding assays with radiolabeled DHEA suggest that DHEA physically interacts with NGF receptors. To test this hypothesis we covalently linked DHEA-7-<italic>O</italic>-(carboxymethyl) oxime (DHEA-7-CMO) to polyethylene glycol amino resin (NovaPEG amino resin) and tested the ability of immobilized DHEA to pull down TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteins.

We also tested the effects of DHEA and NGF in PC12 cells, endogenously expressing TrkA receptors.

NGF levels in culture media of control and DHEA-treated HEK293 and PC12 cells were undetectable, indicating that DHEA-induced TrkA phosphorylation was independent of NGF production.

        <p>The effectiveness of DHEA to promote the interaction of p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors with its effector proteins TRAF6, RIP2, and RhoGDI was also assessed.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>DHEA exerts multiple actions in the central and peripheral nervous system; however, no specific receptor has been reported to date for this neurosteroid. Most of its actions in the nervous tissue were shown to be mediated via modulation, at micromolar concentrations, of membrane neurotransmitter receptors, such as NMDA, GABA<sub>A</sub>, and sigma1 receptors. DHEA may also influence brain function by direct binding, also at micromolar concentrations, to dendritic brain microtubule-associated protein MAP2C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Laurine1">[22]</xref>. In the present study we provide evidence that DHEA binds to NGF receptors. This is the first report showing a direct binding of a steroid to neurotrophin receptors. Saturation experiments and Scatchard analysis of [<sup>3</sup>H]-DHEA binding to membranes isolated from HEK293 cells transfected with the cDNAs of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors showed that DHEA binds to both membranes (7.4±1.75 nM and 5.6±0.55 nM for TrkA or p75<sup>NTR</sup>, respectively). Non-radioactive NGF effectively displaced [<sup>3</sup>H]-DHEA binding to both membrane preparations, with IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.8±0.2 and 1.19±0.45 nM, respectively. Furthermore, pull-down experiments using DHEA covalently immobilized on NovaPEG amino resin suggest that DHEA binds directly to TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteins. Indeed, polymer-supported DHEA-7-CMO effectively pulled down recombinant TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteins and precipitated both proteins from extracts prepared from cells expressing both receptors (HEK293<sup>TrkA</sup>, HEK293<sup>p75NTR</sup>, and PC12 cells and freshly isolated rat brain). Interestingly, DHEA was unable to effectively displace binding of [<sup>125</sup>I]-NGF on membranes isolated from HEK293<sup>TrkA</sup> and HEK293<sup>p75NTR</sup> transfectants. It is possible that dissociation of binding of peptidic NGF from its receptors lasts longer due to the multiple sites of interaction within the binding cleft of this large peptidic molecule compared to smaller in volume steroid. Another explanation might be that NGF and DHEA bind to different domains of NGF receptors, the NGF domain being non-recognizable by DHEA. It is of note that antidepressant amitryptiline cannot chase NGF from TrkA receptors because it binds to a different domain on TrkA protein compared to NGF. Indeed, other small molecules, like antidepressant amitriptyline and gamboge's natural extract gambogic amide, bind in the extracellular and the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domains of TrkA receptor, although with much lower affinity compared to DHEA (K<sub>d</sub> 3 µM and 75 nM, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Jang1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Jang2">[24]</xref>. The domains of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteins involved in DHEA binding were not defined in the present study. Mutagenesis assays combined with NMR spectroscopy are planned to map the domains of both receptors related to DHEA binding.</p>
      <p>Our findings suggest that binding of DHEA to NGF receptors is functional, mediating its anti-apoptotic effects. Indeed, blocking of TrkA expression by RNAi almost completely reversed the ability of DHEA to protect PC12 cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and to maintain elevated levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Additionally, in dispersed primary sympathetic neurons in culture, DHEA effectively compensated NGF deprivation by decreasing the levels of apoptotic neurons, an effect which was reversed by a specific TrkA inhibitor, further supporting the involvement of TrkA receptors in the anti-apoptotic action of DHEA. Finally, DHEA effectively rescued from apoptosis TrkA-positive dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons of NGF null mouse embryos.</p>
      <p>It appears that the decision between survival and death among DHEA-responsive cells is determined by the ratio of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors. In fact, DHEA and NGF induced apoptosis of nnr5 cells, a clone of PC12 cells expressing only pro-death p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors. The pro-death effects of both agents were completely blocked by p75<sup>NTR</sup> shRNA and were remarkably restored after transfection of nnr5 cells with the TrkA cDNA. It is of note that during brain development the ratio of TrkA to p75<sup>NTR</sup> varies tempospatially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Barrett1">[25]</xref>. Thus, the ability of DHEA to act in a positive or negative manner on neuronal cell survival may depend upon the levels of the two receptors during different stages of neuronal development.</p>
      <p>Binding of DHEA on both TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors was effectively competed by sulfated DHEA, DHEAS (IC<sub>50</sub>: 6.1±1.1 and 8.1±1.2 nM, respectively), suggesting that DHEAS may also bind to NGF receptors. Testosterone displaced DHEA binding to TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> (IC<sub>50</sub>: 5.3±2.1 and 7.4±3.2 nM, respectively), while synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone displaced DHEA binding only to pro-survival TrkA receptors (IC<sub>50</sub>: 9.5±4.6 nM). In a previous study we had shown that both steroids effectively displaced DHEA from its specific membrane binding sites of sympathoadrenal cells, acting as DHEA antagonists by blocking its anti-apoptotic effect and the induction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Charalampopoulos3">[9]</xref>. Our findings suggest that testosterone and glucocorticoids may act as neurotoxic factors by antagonizing endogenous DHEA and NGF for their binding to NGF receptors, explaining previously published data. Indeed, testosterone was shown to increase NMDA and GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated neurotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Yang1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Nuez1">[27]</xref>. Our findings suggest that testosterone may act as a neurotoxic factor by also antagonizing the neuroprotective effects of endogenous DHEA. Furthermore, glucocorticoids show a bimodal effect on hippocampal neurons causing acutely an increase in performance of spatial memory tasks, while chronic exposure has been associated with decreased cognitive performance and neuronal atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Lupien1">[28]</xref>. Acute administration of glucocorticoids results in a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated phosphorylation and activation of hippocampal TrkB receptors, exerting trophic effects on dentate gyrus hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Jeanneteau1">[29]</xref>, via an increase in the sensitivity of hippocampal cells to neurotrophin BDNF, the endogenous TrkB ligand known to promote memory and learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Lee1">[30]</xref>. However, overexposure to glucocorticoids during prolonged periods of stress is detrimental to central nervous system neurons, especially in aged animals, affecting mainly the hippocampus. It is possible that part of neurotoxic effects of glucocorticoids may be due to their antagonistic effect on the neuroprotective effect of endogenous DHEA and NGF, via TrkA receptor antagonism. The decline of brain DHEA and NGF levels during aging and in Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Lupien1">[28]</xref> might exacerbate this phenomenon, rendering neurons more vulnerable to glucocorticoid toxicity. Indeed, glucocorticoid neurotoxicity becomes more pronounced in aged subjects since cortisol levels in the cerebrospinal fluid increase in the course of normal aging, as well as in relatively early stages of Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Lupien1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A number of neurodegenerative conditions are associated with lower production or action of both DHEA and NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-WeillEngerer1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Capsoni1">[32]</xref>. Animal studies suggest that NGF may reverse, or slow down the progression of Alzheimer's related cholinergic basal forebrain atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Capsoni1">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, the neurotrophic effects of NGF in experimental animal models of neurodegenerative conditions, like MPTP (Parkinson's disease), experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (multiple sclerosis), or ischemic retina degeneration mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Villoslada1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Sivilia1">[35]</xref> support its potential as a promising neuroprotective agent. However, the use of NGF in the treatment of these conditions is limited, because of its poor brain blood barrier permeability. It is of interest that DHEA also exerts neuroprotective properties in some of these animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Belanger1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Du1">[36]</xref>. These findings suggest that synthetic DHEA analogs, deprived of endocrine effects, may represent a new class of brain blood barrier permeable NGF receptor agonists with neuroprotective properties. We have recently reported the synthesis of 17-spiro-analogs of DHEA, with strong anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective properties, deprived of endocrine effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Calogeropoulou1">[37]</xref>, which are now being tested for their ability to bind and activate NGF receptors.</p>
      <p>We have previously defined the pro-survival signaling pathways that are initiated by DHEA at the membrane level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Charalampopoulos1">[3]</xref>. These pathways include MEK1/2/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pro-survival kinases. We now provide experimental evidence that DHEA activates these kinases via TrkA receptors. Down-regulation of TrkA receptors using siRNAs resulted in an almost complete reversal of the ability of DHEA to increase the phosphorylation of kinases Shc, Akt, and ERK1/2. In addition to TrkA receptors, binding of DHEA to the low affinity NGF receptor was also functional, affording the activation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors. Unlike TrkA receptors, p75<sup>NTR</sup> lacks any enzymatic activity. Signal transduction by p75<sup>NTR</sup> proceeds via ligand-dependent recruitment and release of cytoplasmic effectors to and from the receptor. Indeed, DHEA like NGF facilitated the recruitment of two major cytoplasmic interactors of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, TRAF6 and RIP2 proteins. Additionally, DHEA-mediated activation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> led to the dissociation of bound RhoGDI, a protein belonging to small GTPases and interacting with RhoA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Yamashita1">[21]</xref>.

          <p>DHEA binds with high affinity to TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors, initiating the following sequence of events: 1) DHEA induces TrkA-mediated Tyr490-phosphorylation of Shc, ERK1/2, and Akt kinases, controlling the expression and function of apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins; and 2) DHEA promotes the interaction of p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors with effector proteins TRAF6, RIP2, and RhoGDI affecting neuronal cell apoptosis. Our findings suggest that the decision between survival and death among DHEA-responsive cells is determined by the balance of its interactions with TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors.</p>

      <p>Previous findings suggest that DHEA protects PC12 cells against apoptosis via pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitive, G protein-associated specific plasma membrane-binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Charalampopoulos3">[9]</xref>. Indeed, PTX was shown to partially reverse the anti-apoptotic effects of DHEA and its membrane impermeable DHEA-BSA conjugate, as well as their effects on prosurvival kinases PI3K/Akt, the activation of transcription factor NFkappaB, and the phosphorylation and inactivation of apoptotic protein Bad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Charalampopoulos4">[10]</xref>. Interestingly, the prosurvival effects of NGF in sympathetic neurons and PC12 cells are also partially reversed by PTX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Wu1">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, the NGF-dependent activation of Akt is partially attenuated by PTX, indicating the participation of G(i/o) proteins. In the same study, NGF-induced phosphorylation of Bad and transcriptional activity of NFkappaB were also shown to be sensitive to PTX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Wu1">[38]</xref>. It appears that other NGF-driven pathways are sensitive to PTX too. For instance, in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons the NGF-induced phosphorylation of tuberin (a critical translation regulator holding a central role in NGF-promoted neuronal survival) is partially blocked by PTX, suggesting the participation of G(i/o) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Wu2">[39]</xref>. Finally, NGF-dependent activation of the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/p44 MAPK) pathway in PC12 cells was effectively blocked by PTX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Rakhit1">[40]</xref>. However in HEK293 cells transfected with TrkA receptors, PTX was unable to affect the induction of TrkA phosphorylation by NGF or DHEA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001051.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These findings considered together suggest that TrkA receptors may use down-stream G protein-coupled receptor pathways, after binding and activation by NGF or DHEA, to control neuronal cell survival.</p>
      <p>It is worth noticing that the interaction of DHEA with the NGF system was first suggested 15 years ago by Compagnone et al., showing co-localized staining of CYP17, the rate limiting enzyme of DHEA biosynthesis, and NGF receptors in mouse embryonic DRGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Compagnone2">[41]</xref>. About one-fifth of CYP17-immunopositive DRG neurons in the mouse were found to be also TrkA-immunopositive. Among the TrkA-expressing cells, about one-third also express CYP17, while p75<sup>NTR</sup>-expressing neurons represent only 13% of the cells in the DRG. Thus, about one-fifth of CYP17-immunopositive neurons may be able to respond to both DHEA and NGF stimulation, an observation compatible with our data, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001051-g006">Figure 6C</xref>. A recent report further supports the interaction of DHEA with NGF receptors. Indeed, DHEA was shown to act as a keratinocyte-deriving neurotrophic signal, mimicking NGF in promoting axonal outgrowth of NGF non-producing but TrkA positive sensory neurons, an effect blocked by TrkA inhibitor K252a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Ulmann1">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>CYP17 is expressed in invertebrate cephalochordata Amphioxus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Mizuta1">[43]</xref>. Amphioxus is also expressing TrkA receptor homologous AmphiTrk, which effectively transduces signals mediated by NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-BenitoGutierrez1">[44]</xref>. Phylogenetic analysis of neurotrophins revealed that they emerged with the appearance of vertebrates (530–550 million years ago), when complexity of neural tissue increased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Hallbook1">[45]</xref>. Invertebrate cephalochordata like Amphioxus are positioned on the phylogenetic boundary with vertebrates (600 million years ago). It is thus tempting to hypothesize that DHEA contributed as one of the “prehistoric” neurotrophic factors in an ancestral, simpler structurally invertebrate nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001051-Miller1">[46]</xref>; then, when a strict tempospatial regulation of evolving nervous system of vertebrates was needed, peptidic neurotrophins emerged to afford rigorous and cell specific neurodevelopmental processes.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that DHEA and NGF cross-talk via their binding to NGF receptors to afford brain shaping and maintenance during development. During aging, the decline of both factors may leave the brain unprotected against neurotoxic challenges. This may also be the case in neurodegenerative conditions associated with lower production or action of both factors. DHEA analogs may represent lead molecules for designing non-endocrine, neuroprotective, and neurogenic micromolecular NGF receptor agonists.</p>

        <p>HEK293 cells were cultured in 12-well plates, and 24 h later they were transfected with the cDNAs for TrkA and/or p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors, or the vector alone. Staining was performed 48 h later. Transfectants (5×10<sup>5</sup> cells) were pelleted and incubated with 20 µl of the primary antibodies against TrkA or p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors for 30 min over ice. Afterwards, transfectants were washed three times with PBS and 20 µl of the secondary antibodies, and anti-rabbit-R-phycoerythrin conjugated and anti-mouse-fluorescein conjugated were added, as described above. For DHEA-BSA-FITC binding on cells, 20 µl (100 nM) were added on the pelleted cells for 10 min at RT, and then they were washed with serum free culture medium and incubated for another 15 min in serum free culture medium containing 4% BSA. Transfectants were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 500 µl of PBS, and were analyzed in a Beckton-Dickinson FACSArray apparatus and the CELLQuest software (Beckton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).</p>
