<abstract abstract-type="toc">
<p>The GPCR-activated PI3Kγ is also a key enzyme downstream of the IgE high affinity receptor FcεRI. PKCβ-dependent phosphorylation of PI3Kγ on Ser582 is the ‘missing link’ that functions as a molecular switch to divert PI3Kγ from GPCR inputs.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>All class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) associate tightly with regulatory subunits through interactions that have been thought to be constitutive. PI3Kγ is key to the regulation of immune cell responses activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Remarkably we find that PKCβ phosphorylates Ser582 in the helical domain of the PI3Kγ catalytic subunit p110γ in response to clustering of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) and/or store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup>- influx in mast cells. Phosphorylation of p110γ correlates with the release of the p84 PI3Kγ adapter subunit from the p84-p110γ complex. Ser582 phospho-mimicking mutants show increased p110γ activity and a reduced binding to the p84 adapter subunit. As functional p84-p110γ is key to GPCR-mediated p110γ signaling, this suggests that PKCβ-mediated p110γ phosphorylation disconnects PI3Kγ from its canonical inputs from trimeric G proteins, and enables p110γ to operate downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PKCβ. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry shows that the p84 adaptor subunit interacts with the p110γ helical domain, and reveals an unexpected mechanism of PI3Kγ regulation. Our data show that the interaction of p110γ with its adapter subunit is vulnerable to phosphorylation, and outline a novel level of PI3K control.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are involved in most essential cellular processes. Class I PI3Ks are heterodimers: class IA PI3Ks are made up of one of a group of regulatory p85-like subunits and one p110α, p110β, or p110δ catalytic p110 subunit, and are activated via binding of their p85 subunit to phosphorylated tyrosine receptors or their substrates. The only, class IB PI3K member, PI3Kγ, operates downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recent work suggested that PI3Kγ also operates downstream of IgE-antigen complexes in mast cell activation, but no mechanism was provided. We show that clustering of the high-affinity IgE receptor FcεRI triggers a massive calcium ion influx, which leads to PKCβ activation. In turn, PKCβ phosphorylates Ser582 of the PI3Kγ catalytic p110γ subunit's helical domain. Downstream of GPCRs, p110γ requires a p84 adapter to be functional. Phospho-mimicking mutations at Ser582 disrupt the p84-p110γ interaction, and cellular Ser582 phosphorylation correlates with the loss of p84 from p110γ. Thus our data suggest that PKCβ phosphorylates and activates p110γ downstream of calcium ion influx, while simultaneously disconnecting the phosphorylated p110γ from GPCR signaling. Exploration of the p84-p110γ interaction surface by hydrogen- deuterium exchange mass spectrometry confirmed that the p110γ helical domain forms the main p84-p110γ contact surface. Taken together, the results suggest an unprecedented mechanism of PI3Kγ regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) produce the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub>] and consist of a p110 catalytic and a regulatory subunit. The class IA catalytic subunits, p110α, β, and δ, are constitutively bound to p85-related regulatory proteins that link them to the activation by protein tyrosine kinase receptors. The only class IB PI3K member, p110γ, is activated downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and interacts with p101 or p84 (also known as p87<sup>PIKAP</sup>) adaptor subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Stephens1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Voigt1">[3]</xref>. A tight complex of the p110γ catalytic subunit (PK3CG) with p101 was first discovered in neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Stephens1">[1]</xref>. The p101 subunit (PI3R5) sensitizes PI3Kγ for activation by Gβγ subunits of trimeric G proteins, and is essential for chemotaxis of neutrophils towards GPCR-ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Stephens1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Brock1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Suire2">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mast cells do not express p101; however, they do express the homologous adaptor protein p84 ([PI3R6]) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Bohnacker1">[6]</xref>, which shares 30% sequence identity with p101. Both p101 and p84 potentiate the activation of p110γ by Gβγ, but the p110γ-p101 complex is significantly more sensitive towards Gβγ, and displays an enhanced translocation to the plasma membrane as compared with p110γ-p84 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Kurig1">[7]</xref>. Although p84 is absolutely required to relay GPCR signals to protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) phosphorylation and degranulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Bohnacker1">[6]</xref>, its role is not completely understood: contrary to p110γ-p101, p110γ-p84 requires additionally the presence of the small G protein Ras, and might operate in distinct membrane micro-domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Bohnacker1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Kurig1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, genetic ablation of p110γ blocks high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI)-dependent mast cell degranulation in vitro and in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Collmann1">[8]</xref>. In part this is due to the fact that initial IgE/antigen-mediated mast cell stimulation triggers the release of adenosine and other GPCR ligands to feed an autocrine/paracrine activation of PI3Kγ, which then functions as an amplifier of mast cell degranulation. Interestingly, a substantial part of the observed PI3Kγ-dependent histamine-containing granule release (ca. 40%) was found to be resistant to <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> toxin (<italic>P</italic>Tx) pretreatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Laffargue1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Endo1">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, although adenosine activates PI3Kγ via the A3 adenosine receptor (A<sub>3</sub>AR; [ADORA3]), A<sub>3</sub>AR null mice are still sensitive to passive systemic anaphylaxis, and degranulation in A<sub>3</sub>AR<sup>−/−</sup> bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) upon antigen stimulation remains functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Tilley1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Gao1">[12]</xref>. This and the strong degranulation phenotype of PI3Kγ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs suggest that GPCR signaling does not generate the full input to PI3Kγ-dependent degranulation, but a GPCR-independent activation mechanism for PI3Kγ has yet to be defined.</p>
<p>Here we identify a mechanism that activates PI3Kγ independently of GPCRs: we demonstrate that (i) IgE/antigen complexes and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx activate PI3Kγ, (ii) PI3Kγ is operationally linked to the FcεRI specifically by PKCβ (PRKCB), (iii) and that the phosphorylation of Ser582 located in the helical domain of p110γ by PKCβ leads to the dissociation of the p84 adapter to decouple phosphorylated p110γ from GPCR inputs. Further we characterize the p110γ-p84 interface, and delineate an activation process that seems to be conserved among class I PI3Ks.</p>

<title>Thapsigargin-Induced Mast Cell Activation Needs PI3Kγ</title>
<p>A committed step in mast cell activation is the influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Ma1">[13]</xref>. Thapsigargin, which inhibits the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake ATPase (SERCA), causes depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, triggering SOCE. The latter achieves full-scale degranulation of BMMCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Huber1">[14]</xref>. Surprisingly, BMMCs devoid of the p110γ catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ lost their responsiveness to thapsigargin and matched degranulation responses attained by wortmannin-pretreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate if thapsigargin-triggered, p110γ-dependent degranulation involved release of adenosine, BMMCs were preincubated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) to convert adenosine to inosine, which has a very low affinity for adenosine receptors. ADA attenuated degranulation induced by IgE/antigen but did not affect thapsigargin-stimulated degranulation in wild type cells and did not further attenuate residual degranulation in p110γ null BMMCs. Likewise, presence of ADA did not reduce the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in response to thapsigargin via the p110γ-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) but did reduce phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in response to adenosine—illustrating that the added ADA removes adenosine quantitatively. <italic>P</italic>Tx treatment of BMMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) blocked adenosine—but not thapsigargin-stimulated PKB/Akt phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Thapsigargin-induced mast cell degranulation requires PI3Kγ, but not GPCR signaling.</title>
<p>(A) Granule release of wild type and p110γ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs was determined detecting β-hexosaminidase (β-Hex) release into extracellular media. BMMC stimulation with IgE/antigen was initiated with the antigen (Ag, DNP-HSA at 10 ng/ml; 100 ng/ml IgE overnight). Alternatively, BMMCs were stimulated by the addition of thapsigargin (1 µM). Where indicated, BMMCs were preincubated for 15 min with 100 nM wortmannin. Released β-Hex was quantified 20 min after stimulation, and is expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) (<italic>n</italic> = 3; <italic>p</italic>-values in all figures are * or &amp;: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, **: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005; ***: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0005; * depict here comparison with respective wild type control; &amp; refer to comparison of untreated versus treated samples). (B) Granule release was assessed as above, but ADA (10 units/ml) was added to BMMC suspensions 1 min before stimulation where depicted. (C) Wild type or p110γ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs were stimulated with adenosine (Ade; 1 µM) or thapsigargin (1 µM) for 2 min, and phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Thr308 (pPKB), total PKB and p110γ was analyzed by Western blotting. BMMCs were incubated in starving medium (2% FCS, without IL-3) for 3 h before stimulation, and pretreated with ADA where indicated. (D) Heterotrimeric Gα<sub>i</sub> proteins were inactivated by preincubation of wild type and p110γ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs with 100 ng/ml <italic>P</italic>Tx for 4 h, before thapsigargin (Tg) or adenosine was added as in (C).</p>

<p>To exclude that autocrine/paracrine signaling to p110γ occurred through <italic>P</italic>Tx-insensitive Gαq subunits to phospholipase β (PLCβ [PLCB2, PLCB3]), and a subsequent Ras activation by the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP4 as described earlier in neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Suire3">[15]</xref>, we used platelet activating factor (PAF) to trigger cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. PAF was reported earlier to trigger a <italic>P</italic>Tx-insensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from mast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Laffargue1">[9]</xref>, and induced here a robust CREB phosphorylation comparable to adenosine and IgE/antigen. In contrast, PAF failed to trigger phosphorylation of PKB/Akt by itself, and did not enhance signaling of IgE/antigen to PKB/Akt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results clearly illustrate that thapsigargin stimulates BMMCs via a PI3Kγ-dependent activation pathway, which operates separately from adenosine-induced activation of Gαi/o trimeric G proteins.</p>

<title>Thapsigargin-triggered PI3Kγ activation requires influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</title>
<p>(A) Where indicated, IL-3 starved BMMCs were incubated with EDTA (5 mM) for 5 min, before cells were stimulated with thapsigargin (1 µM) or ionomycin (1 µM). Cells were lysed 5 min after stimulation, and phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser473 was analyzed. (B) BMMCs as in (A) were pretreated for 10 min with the cell-permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator BAPTA/AM (10 µM) and stimulated either with IL-3 (10 ng/ml), adenosine (1 µM), or thapsigargin (1 µM). (C, D) BMMCs were loaded with the ratiometric low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe Fura-4F/AM for 10 min in physiologic HEPES buffer at 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s013">Text S1</xref>). After the loading, washed cells were resuspended in the presence of increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>) to modulate maximal stimulation-induced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). Cells were then stimulated with 0.5 µM thapsigargin, and maximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase and phosphorylation of PKB/Akt were measured. pPKB S473 levels are displayed as a function of the individually determined [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Data points come from two independently performed experiments. (E) Representative anti-phospho-PKB/Akt immunoblot as used to determine pPKB/Akt levels in (D).

<p>Interestingly, the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> required to trigger PI3Kγ-dependent phosphorylation of PKB/Akt exceeded peak concentrations that are reached by GPCR stimulation: GPCR agonists release Ca<sup>2+</sup> only from internal stores (maximum [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>&lt;300 nM), while thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g002">Figure 2C–2F</xref>) and IgE/antigen trigger SOCE and elevate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to µM concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Laffargue1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Huber1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Baba1">[17]</xref>. Moreover, the correlation of maximally achieved [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> after thapsigargin revealed a steep, switch-like activation of PKB/Akt. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores triggered by Gαi-coupled GPCRs (such as the A<sub>3</sub>AR stimulated by <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine-5′-<italic>N</italic>-methylcarbox-amide [IB-MECA]) is sensitive to <italic>P</italic>Tx, thapsigargin-induced SOCE is not.

<p>Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (Ro318425, Gö6983, Gö6976) targeting classical and atypical PKCs, and the inhibitor PKC412, which mainly inhibits classical PKCs, all substantially blocked PKB/Akt phosphorylation in response to thapsigargin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s002">S2A</xref>). Rottlerin, with a limited selectivity for PKCδ, had no effect on PKB/Akt activation. GPCR-dependent PI3Kγ activation by adenosine was resistant to all tested PKC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). The inhibitor profile suggested that a classical PKC activates PI3Kγ. While PKB/Akt activation by PMA and thapsigargin was blocked in PKCβ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), signaling in PKCα<sup>−/−</sup> and PKCγ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs remained intact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Deletion of PKCβ eliminated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Thr308 and Ser473 completely, whereas a residual signal on Ser473 was observed after PI3K-inhibition by wortmannin. This may be explained by the observation that PKCβ2 can function as a Ser473 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Kawakami1">[18]</xref>. Adenosine, IL-3, and stem cell factor (SCF)-induced PKB/Akt activation was not affected by elimination of PKCβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), demonstrating that PKCβ does not relay adenosine signals to PI3Kγ, and is not required in cytokine and growth factor receptor-dependent activation of class IA PI3Ks in mast cells.</p>

<title>PKCβ relays thapsigargin-induced PI3Kγ activation.</title>
<p>(A) Effect of PKC inhibitors on thapsigargin-induced PKB phosphorylation on Ser473 (S473). IL-3 starved BMMCs were preincubated with the indicated compounds for 20 min before stimulation (pan-PKC: Ro318425, Gö6983; classical PKC: PKC412 (CPG41251); classical and atypical PKC: Gö6976; Rotterlin: broad band inhibitor; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s013">Text S1</xref>; &amp; refers to comparison with untreated control; <italic>p</italic>-values see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g001">Figure 1</xref>). (B) PKB/Akt activation in response to 100 nM PMA or 1 µM thapsigargin was analyzed in wild type and PKCβ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs. Cells were IL-3 deprived as in (A), and were pretreated with wortmannin (Wm, 100 nM) for 15 min before stimulation where indicated. Cells were lysed 2 min after stimulation, and analyzed for phosphorylation of PKB/Akt (T308 and S473) and MAPK (T183/Y185). (C) Wild type and PKCβ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs were stimulated with 1 µM adenosine, 10 ng/ml IL3, or 10 ng/ml SCF, and processed as in (B). (D–F) PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> (PI<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub>) levels were determined in untreated (Ctrl) and classical PKC-inhibitor (PKC412)-treated wild type BMMCs and PKCβ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs after stimulation with 0.5 µM thapsigargin, 200 ng/ml PMA, or 5 µM adenosine (30 s). BMMCs were metabolically labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P]-orthophosphate, lipids were extracted, deacylated, and applied to high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).

(G) Granule release and PKB activation (S473) in response to thapsigargin (1 µM) or IgE/antigen (100 ng/ml IgE overnight, 10 ng/ml DNP) was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of the classical PKC inhibitor PKC412. Cells starved as in (A) were stimulated with IgE/antigen (IgE/Ag) or thapsigargin (Tg), and PKB phosphorylation and β-hexosaminidase release assays were performed in parallel (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 3).

This, combined with the similarity of p110γ and PKCβ null phenotypes in IgE/antigen-induced degranulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g003">Figure 3H</xref>), suggests a direct link of PKCβ and PI3Kγ downstream of FcεRI.</p>

<title>PKCβ Binds and Phosphorylates PI3Kγ</title>
<p>Co-expression of p110γ with tagged full length or truncated PKCβ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) revealed that only the catalytic domain fragment and a pseudo-substrate deletion mutant of PKCβ2 formed complexes with p110γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that the presence of the pseudo-substrate in PKCβ results in a closed conformation that is unable to interact with p110γ.

<title>PKCβ interacts with and phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation of the PKCβ-p110γ interaction: full-length (fl) PKCβ is in a closed conformation due to the interaction of the pseudo-substrate domain with the catalytic pocket of PKCβ, while the truncated catalytic domain (cat; amino acids 302–673) and pseudo-substrate deletion mutant (Δps; deletion of aa 19–31) give access to p110γ. (B) HEK293 cells were co-transfected with p110γ and HA-tagged PKCβ2 constructs. Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-p110γ or anti-HA antibodies, before HA-PKCβ2 and p110γ was detected by immunoblotting. Ig: immunoglobulin heavy chain signals of mouse anti-p110γ and anti-HA antibodies. (C) Recombinant GST-p110γ wild type (wt) or a catalytically inactive p110γ mutant (KR, Lys833Arg mutant) were incubated with recombinant PKCβ2 and [γ<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP in kinase buffer for 30 min, before proteins were denatured and separated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphatidylserine (PS) lipid vesicles containing 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) were present during the reaction where marked. Protein-bound <sup>32</sup>P was determined by radioisotope imaging, and recombinant proteins were stained with Coomassie blue (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], <italic>n</italic> = 3; * point to comparison with respective sample without PKC). (D) In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of PI3Kγ on S582, analyzed by LC-MRM. S582 non-phospho- and phospho-peptides were detected in the MRM mode, quantifying the transition 501.1 to 709.3 for the non-modified peptide (blue) and 541.3 to 492.1 for the phospho-peptide (red). Data were normalized to the transition of the non-modified peptide, which was set to 1. Upper part: recombinant catalytically inactive human GST-PI3Kγ (2 µg) was incubated alone, together with PKCβ2 or with PKCβ2 and PKC-inhibitor (Ro318425, 2 µM) as in (C). After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, PI3Kγ was excised from the gel and prepared for LC-MRM. Lower part: wild type BMMCs (300 M cells/stimulation) were starved for 4 h in IL-3 free medium/2% FCS, and were left unstimulated or were treated for 2 min with 50 nM PMA or for 4 min with 10 ng/ml antigen (cells preloaded with 100 ng/ml IgE overnight). Endogenous PI3Kγ was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with LC-MRM.</p>

<p>Although the extended peptide around Ser582 scores as a PKC substrate site, the core Arg-X-X-Ser582 sequence is a putative recognition site for several protein kinases (scores are PKC&gt;protein kinase A&gt;calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases [CAMK]). As mast cell activation is accompanied by a massive influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we assessed if CAMK could phosphorylate p110γ directly. In the presence of <sup>32</sup>P-γ-ATP, recombinant CAMKII (CAMK2) incorporated equal amounts of phosphate into free and p84-bound p110γ. In the same experiment, PKCβ preferentially phosphorylated free p110γ, illustrating a preference of PKCβ for p110γ surfaces obscured in the p84-p110γ complex. CAMK also substantially phosphorylated p84, which was borderline in in vitro assays with PKC (12 versus 3 mol %) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Probing the phosphorylation of Ser582 in vitro demonstrated that access to this site is blocked when p84 is bound to p110γ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>In cellular assays stimulating BMMCs with thapsigargin, CAMK activation could be monitored using anti-phospho-CAMKII antibodies. While PKC inhibitors left CAMKII phosphorylation &gt;50% intact, Ser582 and PKB/Akt phosphorylation were both reduced to background levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s006">Figure S6</xref>), even in a context favoring Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered responses. The above, and the fact that PKCβ<sup>−/−</sup> BMMCs showed a major reduction in phospho-Ser582 after PMA or IgE/antigen stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>), illustrate that phosphorylation of p110γ is mainly mediated by PKCβ, and that other PKC isoforms (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent kinases attribute to less than 18% of the observed overall signal.</p>

<p>As mutations in the helical domain of p110α attenuate contacts with the p85 regulatory subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Miled1">[21]</xref>, we examined binding of p110γ mutants to the PI3Kγ adaptor subunit p84: the substitution of Ser582 with Glu and Asp, abrogated p110γ-p84 interactions in HEK293 cells and BMMCs, while the Ser582Ala replacement favored p110γ-p84 complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g006">Figure 6D–6F</xref>). In line with this, PMA-induced phosphorylation of Ser582 in BMMCs was suppressed by the overexpression of p84 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g006">Figure 6G</xref>), which fits the very limited access of PKCβII to in vitro phosphorylate Ser582 in the p110γ-p84 complex (reduced to 20% of phosphorylation of free p110γ) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Most importantly, the correlation of phosphorylation of Ser582 on p110γ and the release of p84 could also be established in wild type BMMCs: when stimulated with PMA, the amount of p84 that could be co-precipitated with p110γ was reduced significantly, and was linked to Ser582 phosphorylation of p110γ. In the inverse co-immunoprecipitation, anti-p84-associated p110γ was reduced, and phosphorylation was below detection levels in the remaining p84-associated p110γ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s007">Figure S7</xref>). The collected results are in agreement with a mechanism in which PKCβII-mediated phosphorylation of Ser582 and the interaction of p84 and p110γ are exclusive events, and in which PKCβ action displaces p84 from p110γ.</p>

<title>The Helical Domain of p110γ Binds and Is Stabilized by p84</title>
<p>In order to understand how p84 could mask Ser582 phosphorylation, and to map the p110γ-p84 contact interface, hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was used. HDX-MS elucidated contacts of class IA p110δ with its p85 regulatory subunit, and the mechanism of action of cancer-linked mutations in p110α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Burke1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Burke2">[26]</xref>. HDX-MS relies on amide hydrogen exchange with solvent at a rate dependent on their involvement in secondary structure and solvent accessibility. Following proteolysis, location and extent of deuterium uptake are analyzed by peptide mass determination.

Due to difficulties in producing free p84, the contacts on p84 with p110γ could not be mapped. Interestingly, in the absence of the p84 subunit, the majority of peptides in the helical domain exhibited broad isotopic profiles (HDX of peptide 623–630, which is representative of peptides in the helical domain, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g007">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001587.s011">S11</xref>).

<p>(A) Changes in deuteration levels between free and p84-bound PI3Kγ are mapped onto the crystal structure of PI3Kγ (PDB ID: 2CHX). Regions that are covered by peptides of PI3Kγ (labeled A–R) that showed greater than 0.5 or 1.0 Da changes in deuteration are colored light or dark blue, respectively. The greatest difference in exchange observed at any time was used for the mapping. S582 is labeled red. The ATP competitive inhibitor PIK-90 in the crystal structure is shown in green as a reference point for the kinase domain. The linker regions between the RBD and the C2 domain and the C2 and the helical domain are shown as dotted lines (right part). (B) The percent deuterium exchange differences between free and p84-bound PI3Kγ were summed up over all seven time points for every identified peptide (<italic>y</italic>-axis), which were graphed according to their central residue number (<italic>x</italic>-axis). (C) A selected peptide (623–630) from the helical domain is shown at four time points of H/D on-exchange +/− the p84 subunit. In the absence of the p84 adaptor the majority of peptides in the helical domain showed broadening of the isotopic profiles indicative of EX1 kinetics (see 30, or 300 s in free p110γ).

(D) p84 was coexpressed with GST-tagged or untagged PI3Kγ constructs in HEK293 cells. N-terminal deletions of 37 or 130 amino acids are denoted Δ37 or Δ130, respectively. HA-p84 (left) or PI3Kγ (right) was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-HA or anti-PI3Kγ antibodies and protein G beads. PI3Kγ-p84 interactions were analyzed by Western blotting, quantified with Odyssey Imager software and expressed as fold of untagged, full-length p110γ-p84 association (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], left: <italic>n</italic> = 4, 6, 6, 6; right: <italic>n</italic> = 2, 4, 4, 4).</p>

<p>The N-terminus of p110γ was shown to stabilize the p110γ-p101 heterodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Krugmann1">[28]</xref>. Expression of p110γ mutants lacking the first 130 amino acids (Δ130–p110γ) seemed to support this view, as association with p84 was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). However, when truncated p110γ was N-terminally tagged with GST (GST-Δ130-p110γ), binding of p84 was restored. Although we detected a small decrease in the <sup>2</sup>H-incorporation in two N-terminal p110γ peptides (59–70 and 107–113) in the presence of p84, this interaction seems to be dispensable. The N-terminus of p110γ instead has a role in stabilizing the intact catalytic subunit. The helical domain is the main location of interaction with p84; however, it appears that this interaction is vulnerable and easily broken, as a single phosphorylation at Ser582 is able to disrupt the contact.</p>

<p>The activation of PI3Kγ has been tightly linked to GPCRs-triggered dissociation of trimeric Gαi proteins, and has been shown to require the interaction of Gβγ subunits with p110γ and the PI3Kγ adaptor subunits p101 and p84 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Stephens1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Suire1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Brock1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Stoyanov1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Maier1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Shymanets1">[30]</xref>.

<p>Non-GPCR-mediated activation of PI3Kγ has not been reported so far, but it has been shown that phorbol esters and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophores can modulate phosphoinositide levels in a variety of cells, including platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Yamamoto1">[37]</xref>, adipocites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Nave1">[38]</xref>, fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Petritsch1">[39]</xref>, and hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Stephens2">[40]</xref>. The proposed mechanisms have been diverse and involved protein tyrosine kinases and GPCR signaling. A recent finding that protein kinase D (PKD) can phosphorylate two distinct sites on the p85 regulatory subunit to control class IA PI3K activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Lee1">[41]</xref> is an indication that PI3K control is more complex than anticipated.</p>
<p>PI3Kγ has been shown to be a key element in enhancing IgE/antigen output by the release of adenosine. This process involves signaling downstream of Gαi-coupled A<sub>3</sub>AR, and is sensitive to <italic>P</italic>Tx and ADA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Laffargue1">[9]</xref>. The resistance of thapsigargin-induced degranulation to ADA shown here, and the fact that <italic>P</italic>Tx did not diminish the PI3Kγ-dependent, thapsigargin-induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, points to a novel mechanism of PI3Kγ activation, which is clearly distinct from GPCR action. This Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated PI3Kγ activation requires SOCE and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> &gt;600 nM. In contrast, GPCRs yield phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in mast cells even in the absence of a change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Furthermore, increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> triggered via GPCRs remain at levels incapable of engaging a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of PI3Kγ.</p>
<p>Thapsigargin bypasses the signaling chain from IgE/antigen-clustered FcεRI to the activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub>) production, and triggers SOCE by the depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. That thapsigargin requires functional PI3K activity to induce mast cell degranulation was first demonstrated using the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Huber1">[14]</xref>, but no link between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise and PI3Kγ activity was established previously. The fact that inhibitors for classical PKCs only prevented the thapsigargin- and PMA-induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, while the GPCR-mediated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt remained intact, points to a link between classical PKCs and PI3Kγ. Experiments on BMMCs lacking PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCγ, showed that only the PKCβ null cells lost the ability to activate PKB/Akt in response to thapsigargin or PMA stimulation. As the PMA- and thapsigargin-induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser473 showed a partial resistance to wortmannin, and as it has been reported that PKCβ can directly phosphorylate Ser473 in the hydrophobic motif of PKB/Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Kawakami1">[18]</xref>, the effect of genetic and pharmacological targeting of PKCβ was also validated measuring PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> production directly. The lack of PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> production in thapsigargin or PMA-stimulated BMMCs treated with the PKC inhibitor PKC412, and in cells devoid of PKCβ, is in agreement with a requirement of PKCβ upstream of PI3Kγ. That signaling from PKC to PI3K plays a role in mast cell degranulation is further supported by the close correlation of PKC inhibitor sensitivity of phosphorylated PKB/Akt and degranulation responses. Moreover, the loss of PKCβ or PI3Kγ results in a similar reduction of degranulation over a wide range of IgE/antigen concentrations. The results obtained here are in agreement with previous findings that mast cells and mice devoid of p85α/p55α/p50α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-LuKuo1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Fukao1">[43]</xref> and p85β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Krishnan1">[44]</xref> remain fully responsive to IgE/antigen complexes. A previous report showed a biphasic activation of PI3K with PI3Kγ having an early role and PI3Kδ a later role downstream of FcεRI in murine mast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Ali1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Ali2">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>A mechanistic link between PKCβ and the catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ was initially difficult to establish, as the direct PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> response to PMA-stimulation was transient (main peak half life &lt;1 min), and the two full-length enzymes interacted only weakly. The observation that truncated, activated forms of PKCβ formed stable complexes with p110γ, suggested that PKCβ must attain an open conformation to interact with p110γ, and that PKCβ binds to p110γ via its catalytic domain. This contact resulted in phosphorylation of Ser582 on p110γ, which could be detected both in vitro and in PMA or IgE/antigen-stimulated BMMCs by mass spectrometry. The PKCβ-mediated phosphorylation of p110γ was confirmed using site-specific anti-phospho-Ser582 antibodies. Stimuli like PMA, thapsigargin, and IgE/antigen complexes all required PKC to signal to PKB/Akt, which correlated with the phosphorylation of Ser582 on p110γ. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Ser582 on p110γ was sensitive to removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, buffering of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and the genetic deletion of PKCβ. Adenosine stimulates PI3Kγ via GPCRs and <italic>P</italic>Tx-sensitive trimeric G proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Laffargue1">[9]</xref> in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent process, and did not yield a detectable phosphorylation of Ser582.</p>
<p>The increased turnover of PtdIns and PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, and the increased rate of auto-phosphorylation displayed by p110γ with a phosphate-mimicking mutation (Ser582Glu), suggests that a structural change in the helical domain of p110γ is sufficient to increase the catalytic activity independent of the presence of the p84 subunit. Previous work examining the activation of the class IA p110α, p110β, and p110δ catalytic subunits has shown that part of the activation mechanism occurs through a conformational change from a closed cytosolic form to an open form on membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Burke1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Burke2">[26]</xref>. The helical domain of p110γ is exquisitely well placed to propagate conformational changes due to the fact that it is in contact with every other domain in p110γ. In the crystal structure of N-terminally truncated (Δ144) p110γ, the side chain of Ser582 points inward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Walker1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Pacold1">[48]</xref>, and has to rotate to accommodate a phosphate. Our HDX-MS results showed a dynamic “breathing” motion in the helical domain in the free p110γ catalytic subunit that may allow for temporary exposure of Ser582, enabling modification by PKC. HDX results showed that the p84 subunit slowed or prevented this dynamic motion, and this correlated with a decreased efficiency of phosphorylation by PKC in cells in the presence of p84.</p>
<p>Although Ser582 is not in a direct contact with the kinase domain, it is structurally linked to it: the heat repeat HA1/HB1 housing Ser582, and the connecting intra-helical loop (residues 560 to 570), along with helix A3 (624–631) are in contact with helices kα9 and kα10 in the C-lobe of the kinase domain (known as the regulatory arch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Zhang1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Vadas1">[50]</xref>) and could transduce a conformational change to the catalytic center of p110γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). The phosphorylated Ser582 and phosphorylation-mimicking mutants may activate lipid kinase activity by causing a conformational shift at this interface. It has been shown recently that this region of the p110γ kinase domain is critical in regulating lipid kinase activity, as phosphorylation of Thr1024 in the kα9 by protein kinase A (PKA) negatively regulates p110γ activity in vitro and in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Perino1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast to the p110α-p85 heterodimer, stabilized by the N-terminal adaptor-binding domain (ABD)/inter SH2 domain interaction, the association of the p110γ subunit with its adaptor subunit is quite vulnerable, and the Ser582Glu mutant, but not Ser582Ala, abrogated the formation of a p110γ-p84 complex. HDX-MS revealed that the helical domain of p110γ was stabilized by p84. Ser582 is located in the center of the p110γ-p84 contact surface, which explains how a change in charge (Ser582Glu) breaks the interaction with p84, either by direct contact or by destabilization of the helical domain. Overexpression of p84 shields p110γ from a PMA-induced phosphorylation, and suggests that binding of p84 to p110γ, and Ser582 phosphorylation by PKCβ are mutually exclusive. This implies that the two activation modes of PI3Kγ—by GPCRs or PKCβ—are completely separated. At low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, PI3Kγ is exclusively activated by Gβγ subunits. It has been demonstrated that a PI3Kγ adapter protein is absolutely needed for functional GPCR inputs to p110γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001587-Bohnacker1">[6]</xref>. If the interaction of p84 with p110γ is blocked by the phosphorylation of Ser582, p110γ is decoupled from its GPCR input (for a schematic view of the process see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001587-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The PKCβ-mediated activation and phosphorylation of p110γ constitutes therefore an unprecedented PI3K molecular switch, which enables the operation of p110γ downstream of FcεRI signaling, and will elucidate cell type-specific activation processes in allergy and chronic inflammation.</p>

<title>Phosphorylation of Ser582—loss of GPCR coupling of p110γ.</title>
<p>In a resting mast cell, the PI3Kγ complex is responsive to GPCR-mediated dissociation of trimeric G proteins. An adapter protein (here p84) is required for a productive relay of the GPCR signal to PI3Kγ. When FcεRI receptors are clustered via IgE/antigen complexes, a signaling cascade is initiated, which triggers the depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and the opening of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The resulting increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and PLCγ-derived diacylglycerol activate PKCβ, which binds to p110γ and subsequently phosphorylates Ser582 (→pp110γ). Phosphorylated p110γ cannot interact with p84, and is therefore unresponsive to GPCR inputs. GPCR input to PI3Kγ coincides with migration and adhesion, while Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKCβ activation of p110γ occurs when mast cells degranulate. The phosphorylation of PKB/Akt occurs downstream of PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub>, which originates from G protein-activated p84-p110γ complex or PKCβ-activated pp110γ. The phosphorylated residues Thr308 and Ser473 of PKB/Akt are used to monitor PI3K activation.

Free or complexed p110γ (with p84 protein) was incubated with 10 µM ATP and 5 µCi of [<sup>32</sup>P]-γ-ATP, and equal specific activity of recombinant PKCβII and CamKII (Life Technologies assays: 30 pmol phosphate incorporation/min.) for 30 min at 30°C. Subsequently, proteins were denatured and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining (lower panel). <sup>32</sup>P-incorporation was visualized by autoradiography and quantified on a phospho-imager (Typhoon 9400, middle panel). Band intensities were quantified with ImageQuant TL Software (Amersham Biosciences, top panel; <italic>n</italic> = 4, * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Insert: quantification of p84 phosphorylation from the reactions shown in (A), (open bars, <italic>n</italic> = 4, * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Phospho-PKCβII levels were subtracted from phospho-p84 signals (due to identical apparent Mr on SDS-PAGE).

Proteins were denatured, separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunological detection of p110γ and p84 protein, as well as site-specific phosphorylation of residue Ser582 (pp110γ S582) in p110γ. PKCβII and CamKII input was adjusted to equal protein kinase activity (30 pmol of transferred phosphate/min). For quantification, Ser582 phosphorylation levels were normalized (<italic>n</italic> = 4, *: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, ***: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0005).</p>
