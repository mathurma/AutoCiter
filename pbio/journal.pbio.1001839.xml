<p>Two independent studies, one of them using a computational approach, identified CHRONO, a gene shown to modulate the activity of circadian transcription factors and alter circadian behavior in mice.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Circadian rhythms are controlled by a system of negative and positive genetic feedback loops composed of clock genes. Although many genes have been implicated in these feedback loops, it is unclear whether our current list of clock genes is exhaustive. We have recently identified <italic>Chrono</italic> as a robustly cycling transcript through genome-wide profiling of BMAL1 binding on the E-box. Here, we explore the role of <italic>Chrono</italic> in cellular timekeeping. Remarkably, endogenous CHRONO occupancy around E-boxes shows a circadian oscillation antiphasic to BMAL1. Overexpression of <italic>Chrono</italic> leads to suppression of BMAL1–CLOCK activity in a histone deacetylase (HDAC) –dependent manner. <italic>In vivo</italic> loss-of-function studies of <italic>Chrono</italic> including <italic>Avp</italic> neuron-specific knockout (KO) mice display a longer circadian period of locomotor activity. <italic>Chrono</italic> KO also alters the expression of core clock genes and impairs the response of the circadian clock to stress. CHRONO forms a complex with the glucocorticoid receptor and mediates glucocorticoid response. Our comprehensive study spotlights a previously unrecognized clock component of an unsuspected negative circadian feedback loop that is independent of another negative regulator, <italic>Cry2</italic>, and that integrates behavioral stress and epigenetic control for efficient metabolic integration of the clock.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The circadian clock has a fundamental role in regulating biological temporal rhythms in organisms, and it is tightly controlled by a molecular circuit consisting of positive and negative regulatory feedback loops. Although many of the clock genes comprising this circuit have been identified, there are still some critical components missing. Here, we characterize a circadian gene renamed Chrono (Gm129) and show that it functions as a transcriptional repressor of the negative feedback loop in the mammalian clock. Chrono binds to the regulatory region of clock genes and its occupancy oscillates in a circadian manner. Chrono knockout and Avp-neuron-specific knockout mice display longer circadian periods and altered expression of core clock genes. We show that Chrono-mediated repression involves the suppression of BMAL1–CLOCK activity via an epigenetic mechanism and that it regulates metabolic pathways triggered by behavioral stress. Our study suggests that Chrono functions as a clock repressor and reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying its function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circadian rhythms with a period of approximately 24 h endow organisms with the ability to adapt to changes of solar light following earth's rotation. The mammalian circadian clock system consists of inputs from light and feeding, a core pacemaker located in a paired nuclei, called suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and outputs including, but not limited to, cycles of locomotor activity, sleep–awake, and hormonal secretion. Disturbance of the biological clock causes not only sleep rhythm disruptions but also various pathological conditions such as cancer, metabolic, and psychiatric disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Hastings1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Asher1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>The clock gene, <italic>period</italic>, was first identified in fly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Bargiello1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Zehring1">[8]</xref> and later in various organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Zhang1">[9]</xref>. The molecular mechanism of circadian transcription was then found to be based on interconnected transcription–translation feedback loops (TTFL), conserved from prokaryotes to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Zheng1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-UkaiTadenuma1">[12]</xref>. In mammals, the complex of positive elements BMAL–CLOCK (NPAS2) activates PER and CRY that repress their own transcription to form a negative feedback loop. An accessory feedback loop involves ROR and REV–ERBα, which regulate BMAL1 transcription positively and negatively, respectively, whereas BMAL1 activates REV–ERBα expression. More members of the circadian clock components have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Brown2">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Robles1">[16]</xref>. Because of the complexity of circadian timekeeping, mathematical modeling has emerged as an important tool to understand data and make novel predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Forger1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Leloup1">[19]</xref>. In particular, a recently published mathematical model reproduces much of the known data on circadian timekeeping (e.g., mutant phenotypes) and correctly predicts the pharmacological manipulation of circadian rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Kim1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Kim2">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although it is widely believed that the major components of the mammalian circadian clock have been identified, the search for additional clock components continues. In our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Hatanaka1">[22]</xref> and in others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Koike1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Rey1">[24]</xref>, the systematic screening by using ChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation)–Chip and ChIP-seq revealed several uncharacterized genome-wide BMAL1 targets. Among strong BMAL1 binding sites, only one novel gene, <italic>Gm129</italic>, was found besides known clock and clock-controlled genes such as <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>, <italic>Dbp</italic>, and <italic>Tef. Gm129</italic> expression shows a robust circadian rhythm antiphasic to <italic>Bmal1</italic>. In light of its circadian expression, <italic>Gm129</italic>, now renamed <italic>Chrono</italic> (ChIP-derived Repressor of Network Oscillator), appeared to be a core clock gene.</p>
<p>Here, we study the functional role of <italic>Chrono</italic> in the circadian clock. CHRONO binds to the promoters of clock genes and functions as a negative regulatory component of the circadian clock. <italic>In vivo</italic> loss-of-function of <italic>Chrono</italic> including an <italic>Avp</italic> neuron-specific knockout (KO) mouse model displays a longer circadian period of locomotor activity. We demonstrate that <italic>Chrono</italic> is a core-clock component similar to <italic>Cry2</italic>, although its repression mechanism operates through an independent pathway. <italic>In silico</italic> study using a modified Kim–Forger model predicts that the recently identified residual rhythmicity in the <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic> double KO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Ono1">[25]</xref>, is dependent on <italic>Chrono</italic>. Remarkably, <italic>Chrono</italic> is involved in glucocorticoid receptor (GR)–mediated metabolic physiology. We conclude that <italic>Chrono</italic> is part of the negative feedback loop of the mammalian circadian clock and a potential link between the clock and stress metabolism.</p>

<title>ChIP-Seq Identifies a Novel Clock Gene Regulated by BMAL1</title>
<p>Our previous ChIP-based genome-wide analyses using a core clock transcription factor BMAL1 identified hundreds of target molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Hatanaka1">[22]</xref>. Among these targets, <italic>Gm129</italic>, now called <italic>Chrono</italic>, was one of the groups with the strongest binding including core clock proteins PER and CRY. Another ChIP-seq experiment using <italic>in vivo</italic> brain samples also identified <italic>Chrono</italic> as a BMAL1 target. <italic>Chrono</italic> exists only in mammals, is well conserved among mammals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and consists of 375 amino acids with no functional domains. To examine whether <italic>Chrono</italic> encodes a polypeptide, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation experiment. Bands of approximately 45 kDa (CHRONO) and 46 kDa (CHRONO–FLAG) were observed as an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Chrono</italic> Transcripts Display Robust Circadian Expression</title>
<p>Our previous study showed robust circadian oscillation of <italic>Chrono</italic> mRNA in the mouse SCN and liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Hatanaka1">[22]</xref>. We further examined its expression in five different mouse peripheral tissues (heart, lung, stomach, kidney, and testis) by quantitative RT-PCR. After entrainment of mice housed for 2 wk under a 12–12 h light–dark (LD) cycle, samples were collected every 4 h starting at circadian time (CT) 0 (<italic>n</italic> = 3 at each time point) in the third dark–dark (DD) cycle. The temporal expression of <italic>Chrono</italic> transcripts in all tested tissues except testis displayed robust circadian rhythms peaking at approximately CT 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which were antiphasic to <italic>Bmal1</italic>. This result supports that <italic>Chrono</italic> encodes a component of the circadian clock loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Yamamoto1">[26]</xref>. The ChIP-seq experiment using brain samples revealed that BMAL1 strongly binds to CpG islands on the <italic>Chrono</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Studying differently sized <italic>Chrono</italic> promoter constructs (−195, −138, −87, −52, and −16 bp from the transcriptional start site (TSS) of <italic>Chrono</italic>/PGL3B) showed that the closest E-box to the TSS is necessary to generate circadian oscillation of <italic>Chrono</italic> in NIH3T3 cells and that all of the three E-boxes contribute to robust circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g001">Figure 1D and E</xref>). These results suggest that BMAL1 strongly binds to the E-boxes on the <italic>Chrono</italic> promoter and regulates circadian expression of <italic>Chrono</italic>, making <italic>Chrono</italic> a novel clock gene.</p>
<p>We next asked whether CHRONO is also expressed rhythmically at the protein level. We prepared liver samples at CT 2, 8, 14, and 20. We raised a specific antibody against the CHRONO protein. CHRONO showed circadian rhythm antiphasic to BMAL1 as in the mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s002">Figure S2A and C</xref>). This oscillation was observed in both the mouse CHRONO antibody we generated and the human C1orf51 antibody (ab106120, Abcam) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>CHRONO Forms a Complex with Other Clock Components</title>
<p>Because CHRONO showed a similar rhythmic expression profile to other core clock proteins, we asked if CHRONO binds directly with clock proteins. Various clock proteins with tags were expressed in COS7 cells and the expression was assessed by immunoprecipitation (IP) and blotting with anti-tag antibodies. CHRONO bound to BMAL1, PER2, CRY2, and DEC2 but not to PER1, CRY1, and DEC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Among these interactions, we asked if CHRONO–BMAL1 binding occurs endogenously <italic>in vivo</italic>. We observed a band of BMAL1 in the CHRONO antibody IP from mouse liver lysate that was absent in the IP from <italic>Chrono</italic>-deficient mouse liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest that CHRONO endogenously binds to BMAL1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>Chrono</italic> Is Involved in HDAC-Dependent Transcriptional Repression</title>
<p>Next, we asked how <italic>Chrono</italic> is involved in circadian transcription. The luciferase activity of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter (∼−2,817+110 bp from TSS/PGL3B) in NIH3T3 cells was repressed by co-expression with <italic>Cry2</italic> and <italic>Dec2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g002">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s003">S3A</xref>). The basic transcription activity of <italic>Per2</italic> was increased by <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic> co-expression, and this activation was repressed by <italic>Chrono</italic> as well as <italic>Cry2</italic>. This repression was also seen in the <italic>Chrono</italic> promoter (−1,333 bp from TSS/PGL3B) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of <italic>Chrono</italic> reduced the transcriptional amplitude of expression on the <italic>Dbp</italic> promoter, just as <italic>Cry2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s003">Figure S3C and D</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Chrono</italic> functions as a negative element of circadian transcription, similar to <italic>Cry2</italic>.</p>
<p>Histone modification by histone deacetylase (HDAC) is one of the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Bellet1">[27]</xref>. HDAC is often recruited during the transcriptional repression process. We hypothesized that CHRONO is in a repressor complex that includes CRY2. To investigate the potential role of HDAC in <italic>Chrono</italic>-mediated transcriptional repression, we treated cells with trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC inhibitor, in the reporter assay. <italic>Chrono</italic>, as well as <italic>Cry2</italic>, repressed the enhanced luciferase activity of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter. However, in the presence of TSA, <italic>Chrono</italic> did not repress activity but rather enhanced activity, whereas <italic>Cry2</italic> did not change its repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). To confirm the involvement of HDAC in <italic>Chrono</italic>-mediated transcriptional repression, we investigated the interaction of CHRONO with HDAC1. We expressed and showed co-IP of CHRONO–HA and HDAC1–FLAG in COS7 cells, indicating that CHRONO is bound with HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g002">Figure 2F and G</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Chrono</italic> KO Mice Have a Lengthened Circadian Period</title>
<p>To evaluate the physiological and circadian clock function of <italic>Chrono in vivo</italic>, we generated <italic>Chrono</italic> KO mice by using a gene trap method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g004">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s004">S4</xref>). After entrainment in the 12–12 h LD condition, the locomotor activity rhythm under DD was recorded. In DD the average circadian period length of wild-type (WT) mice was 23.81±0.08 h (mean ± standard deviation, <italic>n</italic> = 13), whereas that of <italic>Chrono</italic>-deficient mice was significantly longer (23.96±0.11 h, <italic>n</italic> = 12) (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; Student's <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g004">Figure 4B–D</xref>).

We used a recently developed mathematical model of mammalian circadian clock (Kim–Forger model) because this model successfully reproduced and predicted the circadian period change in response to mutations of clock genes (e.g., <italic>Per1/2</italic>, <italic>Cry1/2</italic>, <italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic>, and etc.) and pharmacological inhibition of kinase (e.g., CK1δ/ε) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Kim1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Kim2">[21]</xref>.

Although CHRONO acts similarly to CRY2, we also incorporate key differences, including their very different mRNA time profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s005">Figure S5</xref>) and the fact that CHRONO does not bind PER1. When the transcription of <italic>Chrono</italic> is inhibited in the model, the model predicts that <italic>Chrono</italic> KO lengthens the period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, right), which indicates that the biochemical mechanisms we have identified for <italic>Chrono</italic>-mediated repression of BMAL1–CLOCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) are expected to cause the <italic>Chrono</italic> KO phenotypes.

<title><italic>Chrono</italic> Acts as a Transcriptional Repression Independent of <italic>Cry2</italic></title>
<p>Because <italic>Chrono</italic> is a putative repressor in the circadian clock mechanism, we next asked whether the expression of clock genes is altered after the deletion of <italic>Chrono</italic> in mice. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from <italic>Chrono</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), <italic>Per2</italic> expression was increased at 48 h and 52 h after dexamethasone stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s007">Figure S7B</xref>), compared with WT MEFs. In the liver derived from <italic>Chrono</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s007">Figure S7C</xref>), <italic>Per3</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Dbp</italic>, and <italic>Rev</italic>–<italic>erb</italic>s were increased at CT12 (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, Student's <italic>t</italic> test), consistent with the idea that <italic>Chrono</italic> is involved with negative feedback regulation of the core clock component via E-box. The similar trend was observed in the <italic>Chrono</italic>-deficient SCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s007">Figure S7D</xref>). Moreover, Acetyl-Histone H3 occupancy on <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Dbp</italic> promoters was enhanced in <italic>Chrono</italic> KO MEFs compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s007">Figure S7E and F</xref>; **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). This result suggests that <italic>Chrono</italic> changed the epigenetic modification of cells with the expression status.</p>
<p><italic>Chrono</italic>'s role in circadian timekeeping seems to mimic that of <italic>Cry2</italic> both <italic>in vivo</italic> and in cells. Because CHRONO interacts with CRY2 and DEC2, we hypothesized that CHRONO represses BMAL1–CLOCK activity only when partnered with CRY2 or DEC2 to form a complex. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed a luciferase reporter assay using <italic>Cry2</italic> KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) or <italic>Cry2</italic> knockdown (Cry2sh) NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s008">S8</xref>) and <italic>Dec2</italic> KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). The BMAL1–CLOCK complex induced <italic>Per2</italic> transcription in all cells and <italic>Chrono</italic> repressed the BMAL1–CLOCK activity in all cells, including those without <italic>Cry2</italic> and <italic>Dec2</italic>, indicating that CHRONO acts as a transcriptional repressor via an independent pathway from CRY2 and DEC2. Moreover, we established a stable NIH3T3 cell line with <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter luciferase and <italic>Cry2</italic> knockdown. The rhythm of fibroblasts with overexpression of Flag as a control showed a robust circadian oscillation with a lengthened period (27.29±0.06 h; mean ± S.E.M.; <italic>n</italic> = 4) due to <italic>Cry2</italic> knockdown. As expected, constitutive overexpression of <italic>Cry2</italic> driven by the CMV promoter partially restored the period to a shorter value (26.91±0.07 h; <italic>n</italic> = 4; *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, Welch's <italic>t</italic> test) in the <italic>Cry2</italic>-sh/NIH3T3 cells. Consistent with the idea that <italic>Chrono</italic> mimics the <italic>Cry2</italic> phenotype, overexpression of <italic>Chrono</italic> similarly shortened the period (26.66±0.15 h; <italic>n</italic> = 5; *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, Welch's <italic>t</italic> test) of oscillation in the <italic>Cry2</italic>-sh/NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5C and D</xref>). These relative modulations in periods are predicted in parallel by the extended Kim–Forger model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), under the simulated experimental conditions of <italic>Cry2</italic> knockdown to 30% of its original value and/or constitutive overexpression of either <italic>Cry2</italic> or <italic>Chrono</italic>. These results indicate that the circadian phenotypes of <italic>Chrono</italic> are similar to <italic>Cry2</italic>, although the repression mechanisms operate via different pathways.</p>

<p>Given the phenotypic similarities between <italic>Chrono</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic>, we postulated that <italic>Chrono</italic> could overtake the role of <italic>Cry2</italic> under KO conditions. To test this idea, we generated <italic>Chrono</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic> double KO mice by mating <italic>Chrono</italic> KO with <italic>Cry1</italic> KO mice. The <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic> double KO mouse shows a circadian arrhythmicity in DD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-vanderHorst1">[28]</xref>, and we expected a <italic>Chrono</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic> double KO would exhibit similar arrhythmicity. However, the circadian locomotor activity persisted under DD. In DD condition, <italic>Cry1</italic> KO mice showed a shorter period than WT, similar to <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Chrono</italic> double KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). There was no significant difference of period between <italic>Cry1</italic> KO and <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Chrono</italic> double KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). These results are predicted by our mathematical model, which shows short period rhythms under the double <italic>Chrono</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic> KO (22.95 h) and <italic>Cry1</italic> single KO (22.89 h), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5G</xref>, right). The model also predicted that the <italic>Chrono</italic> KO does not compromise the amplitude of <italic>Per2</italic> mRNA rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Interestingly, the model predicts initially oscillating but damping <italic>Per2</italic> rhythms in <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic> double KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5H</xref>, blue). However, the triple, <italic>Chrono</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic> KO completely removed any residual oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5H</xref>, red). These results led us to conclude that, although CHRONO acts as a repressor of the BMAL1–CLOCK complex just as CRY2, the mechanism of action of CHRONO is independent of CRY2 and that CHRONO may be required for rhythmicity in certain mutant backgrounds.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we characterized a gene called <italic>Chrono</italic> that serves as a component in the negative arm of the core mammalian circadian clock. Indeed, based on our genomic analysis of circadian promoters, CHRONO appears to be one of the last remaining components of the clock. The most interesting feature of CHRONO is its regulation by epigenetic control and behavioral stress. These findings place CHRONO in a central position to couple stress metabolism to clock regulation.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that CHRONO operates as a repressor of the core circadian feedback loop through the recruitment of HDAC. The repressive effects of CHRONO were also seen in <italic>Cry2</italic> KO MEFs and <italic>Dec2</italic> KO MEFs, which shows that CHRONO repression does not require cooperative interactions with CRY2 or DEC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Langmesser1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Fujimoto1">[34]</xref>. It has been reported that the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes is regulated in a circadian manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Nakahata1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Etchegaray1">[39]</xref> and some complexes are observed in transcriptional repression as in PER and SIN3–HDAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Duong1">[14]</xref>. HDAC1 rhythmically bound to the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s003">Figure S3F</xref>), and this result was consistent with a recent report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Duong2">[40]</xref>. Acetyl-Histone H3 occupancy around E-boxes was enhanced in <italic>Chrono</italic> KO MEFs compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s007">Figure S7E and F</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Chrono</italic> also has the potential to form complexes with other histone-modifying enzymes. However, HAT (histone acetyltransferase) activity by CLOCK was not affected by CHRONO <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001839.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Further mechanistic study is required. CHRONO endogenously binds to the E-boxes of circadian genes with circadian rhythmicity, suggesting that <italic>Chrono</italic> is a core circadian repressor that operates as an auto-regulated component of the clock.</p>
<p>The <italic>Chrono</italic> KO mouse showed a lengthened circadian period similar to the <italic>Cry2</italic> KO mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-vanderHorst1">[28]</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>Chrono</italic> restored the period of <italic>Bmal1-luc</italic> oscillations in <italic>Cry2</italic> knockdown cells in a manner comparable to <italic>Cry2</italic> overexpression. On the other hand, the <italic>Chrono</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic> double KO mouse did not show arrhythmic behavior as seen in the <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic> double KO mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-vanderHorst1">[28]</xref>. Together, these results suggest that <italic>Chrono</italic> plays a similar but independent role from <italic>Cry2</italic>. A conditional <italic>Chrono</italic> KO mouse driven by the <italic>Avp</italic> promoter (<italic>Avp</italic>Cre <italic>Chrono</italic><sup>flx/flx</sup>) also showed a lengthened circadian period. This points to <italic>Chrono</italic>'s central role in the core clock and that its expression in <italic>Avp</italic> neurons is critical for the determination of behavioral circadian period. It also demonstrates that the <italic>Avp</italic>Cre system (GENSAT line number QZ20_CRE) can potentially prove useful in dissecting the output pathway of the SCN that may perform coding by internally distributed periods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Myung1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>The role of <italic>Chrono</italic> was also tested <italic>in silico</italic> by modeling mechanisms of <italic>Chrono</italic>-mediated repression of BMAL1–CLOCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) within the most comprehensive and realistic mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Kim1">[20]</xref>. The extended model successfully predicted that the reduced (or enhanced) <italic>Chrono</italic> expression results in a lengthened (or shortened) period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g004">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">5E</xref>), matching the phenotypes of <italic>Chrono</italic> KO or overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g004">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">5D</xref>). This indicates that the proposed biochemical mechanisms of <italic>Chrono</italic>-mediated repression of BMAL1–CLOCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) are consistent with the overall phenotypes observed when <italic>Chrono</italic> levels are changed.</p>
<p><italic>Chrono</italic> is likely to be a physiological response-dependent regulator. In response to dexamethasone application, <italic>Sgk1</italic> was up-regulated in <italic>Chrono</italic> KO MEFs when compared with WT MEFs. <italic>In vivo</italic> serum corticosterone levels were also increased in the <italic>Chrono</italic> KO mouse when compared with the WT mouse under restraint stress and CHRONO itself interacted with the GR. Along with the observation that <italic>Chrono</italic> mRNA expression was induced by the stress response in MEFs and hypothalamus, we conclude that <italic>Chrono</italic> is a potential repressor activated by behavioral stress and can couple the clock with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Our previous results showed acute physical stress also elevated <italic>Per1</italic> mRNA through a glucocorticoid-responsive element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Yamamoto2">[42]</xref>. Further experimental work is needed to reveal the detailed molecular interactions between the circadian clock and the HPA axis.</p>
<p>Our discovery of the role of <italic>Chrono</italic> opens up many possibilities for future work. Our mathematical modeling raises the interesting possibility that the <italic>Per2</italic> oscillations from <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic> double KO neonatal SCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001839-Ono1">[25]</xref> is mediated by <italic>Chrono</italic>. In further studies, it would be interesting to see if the <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>, <italic>Chrono</italic> triple KO eliminates the ability to oscillate in neonatal SCNs as predicted by our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001839-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Further work should also examine the role of <italic>Chrono</italic> in linking the HPA to the circadian clock. Taken together, we conclude that <italic>Chrono</italic> is a novel circadian clock gene that acts as a repressor in the circadian system and modulates physiology.</p>
