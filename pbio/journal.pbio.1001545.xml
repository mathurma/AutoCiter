         <p>After nuclear export, mRNAs encoding secretory proteins interact with RanBP2/Nup358 on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore, a step that is required for the efficient translation of these mRNAs.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
         <p>In higher eukaryotes, most mRNAs that encode secreted or membrane-bound proteins contain elements that promote an alternative mRNA nuclear export (ALREX) pathway. Here we report that ALREX-promoting elements also potentiate translation in the presence of upstream nuclear factors. These RNA elements interact directly with, and likely co-evolved with, the zinc finger repeats of RanBP2/Nup358, which is present on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. Finally we show that RanBP2/Nup358 is not only required for the stimulation of translation by ALREX-promoting elements, but is also required for the efficient global synthesis of proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and likely the mitochondria. Thus upon the completion of export, mRNAs containing ALREX-elements likely interact with RanBP2/Nup358, and this step is required for the efficient translation of these mRNAs in the cytoplasm. ALREX-elements thus act as nucleotide platforms to coordinate various steps of post-transcriptional regulation for the majority of mRNAs that encode secreted proteins.</p>

         <title>Author Summary</title>
         <p>About one-fifth of the protein-coding genes in the human genome code for secreted and/or membrane-bound proteins. In the nucleus these genes are transcribed into messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which are then exported to the cytoplasm. These mRNAs are then transported to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum where they are translated into proteins destined for the secretory pathway. Most of these mRNAs contain signal sequence coding regions (SSCRs), which code for short hydrophobic polypeptides that target the newly synthesized proteins for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Previously, we found that many SSCRs also act as RNA elements that promote the efficient nuclear export of mRNAs. Here we present evidence that upon the completion of nuclear export, SSCR-containing mRNAs interact with RanBP2/Nup358, a large protein found on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. This interaction is mediated by direct binding between the SSCR and zinc finger repeats found within RanBP2/Nup358, and is ultimately required for the efficient translation of SSCR-containing mRNAs into secretory and/or membrane-bound proteins. Our work demonstrates that SSCRs act as nucleotide platforms that recruit various factors to the mRNA throughout its life to regulate distinct events, such as nuclear export and translation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In eukaryotic cells, mRNA synthesis and processing occur in the nucleus while the translation of mRNA into protein is restricted to the cytoplasm. Although these various mRNA metabolic steps take place in distinct compartments, these events are biochemically coupled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Moore1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo1">[2]</xref>. For example, the 5′ cap binding complex and the spliceosome collaborate to deposit the transcription export (TREX) complex on the 5′ end of a newly synthesized transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cheng1">[3]</xref>. TREX then recruits the TAP/p15 heterodimer, which ultimately allows the mRNA to be exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Strsser1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Stutz1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that the vast majority of transcripts contain introns and should therefore use the splicing-dependent export mechanism, we previously demonstrated that most mRNAs that encode secreted proteins contain RNA elements that promote an alternative mRNA nuclear export (ALREX) pathway that is independent of both splicing and a 5′ cap structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>. In addition, these ALREX-promoting sequences are found within the signal sequence coding region (SSCR) at the 5′ end of the ORF. SSCRs from vertebrates (and to a lesser extent in invertebrates) tend to contain long stretches of nucleotide sequence that lack adenine. This depletion in adenines is due to the enrichment in both amino acids that are encoded by adenine-poor codons and synonymous codons lacking adenine. Indeed, ALREX activity can be inhibited when nucleotides within the SSCR are silently substituted for adenines, so that the encoded amino acid remains unaltered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, we demonstrated that SSCR-containing genes tend to lack introns in their 5′ UTR (i.e., upstream of the SSCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cenik1">[7]</xref>. When SSCRs were present in genes that contained 5′ UTR introns, these SSCRs were not as depleted of adenines, and did not promote the export of a reporter mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cenik1">[7]</xref>. These results suggested that the 5′ most element in a transcript, be it an intron or SSCR, dictates whether the mRNA is exported by either the splicing or ALREX pathway. This model is supported by the observation that ALREX-promoting elements only potentiate export when present near the 5′ end of a reporter transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Tarnawsky1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the incorporation of silent adenine mutations into the ALREX-promoting SSCR not only inhibited nuclear export, but also induced the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) into which the mutated mRNAs partially accumulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>. Typically, these cellular structures form in response to an accumulation of cytoplasmic transcripts that fail to initiate proper translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Mazroui1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Mokas1">[10]</xref>. This observation suggested that the ALREX-promoting element might influence not only export, but also other downstream events, such as how the mRNA is localized in the cytoplasm and how efficiently the translation-initiation complex is assembled onto the transcript.</p>
      <p>Here we provide evidence that ALREX-promoting elements potentiate translation. Furthermore, our data indicate that these RNA elements associate with the zinc finger repeats (ZFRs) of RanBP2, a large protein found on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex. We then demonstrate that the depletion of RanPB2 not only prevents the normal potentiation of translation by ALREX-promoting sequences, but also inhibits the global synthesis of secreted and likely mitochondrial proteins.</p>

         <title>ALREX-Promoting SSCRs Enhance Protein Production</title>
         <p>Previously, we investigated the function of ALREX-promoting SSCRs in mediating mRNA localization of the <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> mRNA (<italic>ftz</italic>), a reporter transcript that has been used to study mRNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Reed1">[11]</xref> and nuclear export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Luo1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Gueroussov1">[13]</xref>. We also found that ALREX-promoting SSCRs promote the translation of the <italic>ftz</italic> reporter mRNA into protein (AFP, unpublished observations). However, these initial observations were uninformative as they could not determine whether ALREX-promoting SSCRs contain an RNA element that potentiates protein production in a manner independent of codon effects. Indeed, there is a correlation between (1) the frequency with which a codon is present in the genome (i.e., “codon usage”), (2) the amount of cognate tRNA that is present in the cytoplasm, and (3) the number of copies of that tRNA gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Ikemura1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Novoa1">[16]</xref>.</p>
         <p>To disrupt features that promote ALREX, such as adenine depletion, while simultaneously controlling for codon usage effects, we altered constructs that had ALREX-promoting SSCRs by mutating leucine codons so that they now encoded isoleucine. While leucine codons are relatively adenine-poor, all of the isoleucine codons contain at least one adenine. Moreover, isoleucine and leucine have almost the same hydrophobicity and the substitution of one for the other is unlikely to alter the strength of the encoded signal sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Kendall1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Hessa1">[19]</xref>. We chose to alter two constructs, <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> and <italic>insulin</italic> (<italic>INS</italic>)-<italic>ftz</italic>, which contain ALREX-promoting SSCRs derived from the mouse major histocompatibility <italic>H2kb</italic> gene and the human <italic>insulin</italic> gene, so that each had two leucine-to-isoleucine mutations (creating the <italic>2Ile-MHC-ftz</italic> and <italic>2Ile-INS-ftz</italic> constructs; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s007">Table S1</xref>). In each construct, the substituted codons had similar usage frequencies as the original ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Nakamura1">[20]</xref>. We then transfected cells with plasmids containing these various <italic>ftz</italic> constructs and monitored ftz protein production 18–24 h later. Note that the <italic>ftz</italic> reporter contains sequences that code for HA and FLAG epitopes, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>, and can be used to detect the protein by immunoblot. To control for transfection efficiency and gel loading, we co-transfected the cells with plasmids containing the <italic>Histone 1B (H1B)-GFP</italic> gene, and immunoblotted for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and α-tubulin.</p>

         <p>We found that cells expressing <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA produced about twice as much ftz protein when compared to those expressing <italic>2Ile-MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We obtained the same result when we compared <italic>INS-ftz</italic> to <italic>2Ile-INS-ftz</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Strikingly, the total steady state levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>) and cytoplasmic/nuclear distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1G and 1H</xref>) of the two mutant mRNAs were almost identical to their wild-type counterparts. In contrast, no protein could be detected when the ftz construct lacked an SSCR (<italic>c-ftz</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and very little protein was expressed from the <italic>parathyroid hormone</italic> (<italic>PTH</italic>)-<italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>prion protein</italic> (<italic>PRP</italic>)-<italic>ftz</italic> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001545-t001">Table 1</xref>), which contain SSCRs derived from the <italic>parathyroid hormone</italic> and <italic>prion protein</italic> genes. Both of these genes have an intron in their 5′ UTR, and as we previously documented, their SSCRs are adenine-rich (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s007">Table S1</xref>), and lack ALREX activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001545-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cenik1">[7]</xref>.

         <p>The difference in protein levels between cells expressing reporter genes with normal and mutant ALREX-promoting SSCRs could potentially have been caused by alterations in the translocation, processing or steady state level of the resulting proteins. However, all of the detectable translational products, for both <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> and <italic>2Ile-MHC-ftz</italic>, were glycosylated indicating that both were efficiently translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). This is not surprising as signal sequences containing either leucine or isoleucine serve equally well to promote translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Kendall1">[17]</xref>. Moreover, since the various protein products differ only in their signal sequence, which is cleaved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s001">S1C</xref>), the various SSCR-containing <italic>ftz</italic> constructs all produce the exact same final processed polypeptide. In agreement with this, these two protein products had similar half-lives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s001">Figure S1D</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s001">S1F</xref>). Thus the final difference in protein levels was not due to changes in translocation, processing, or protein stability.</p>
         <p>In support of the idea that the mutations inhibit translation, SG formation was up-regulated in cells expressing the mutant forms of ftz as compared to those expressing their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1I–1L</xref>). When controlling for transfection efficiency, mRNA distribution and mRNA levels, 54% (±6%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.00001) less protein was produced from <italic>2Ile-MHC-ftz</italic> than from <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA. Similar results were obtained for <italic>INS-ftz</italic> and <italic>2Ile-INS-ftz</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001545-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
         <p>In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that ALREX-promoting SSCRs act as an RNA element that enhances protein production from a reporter mRNA. In addition, our data indicate that the incorporation of a few silent adenine mutations has a much more dramatic impact on translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>) than on mRNA export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1G and 1H</xref>). This finding is consistent with our previous observations that many silent adenines had to be incorporated into ALREX-promoting SSCRs before we could observe effects on mRNA export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cenik1">[7]</xref>.</p>

         <title>ALREX-Promoting SSCRs Stimulate the Production of a Natural Protein</title>
         <p>Next we monitored the production of calreticulin (CALR), a protein chaperone that resides in the lumen of the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Williams1">[23]</xref>. The <italic>CALR</italic> gene lacks a 5′ UTR intron and has an SSCR that is highly depleted of adenines. Within the first 55 nucleotides of the human <italic>CALR</italic> ORF, there is a tract of 43 nucleotides that lacks adenine, which is above average for the typical human SSCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>.</p>
         <p>To detect the expression of this protein, we inserted a sequence that codes for HA epitope into the 3′ end of the ORF. We also created a mutant form of the <italic>CALR-HA</italic> gene where four leucine codons were substituted for isoleucine codons that had similar usage frequencies (<italic>4Ile-CALR-HA</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1M</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s007">Table S1</xref>). In agreement with our <italic>ftz</italic> reporter construct results, cells transfected with plasmids containing the <italic>CALR-HA</italic> cDNA gene produced more protein than those transfected with <italic>4Ile-CALR-HA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1N</xref>). Since the two protein products differ only in their signal sequences, which are cleaved during processing, we could again rule out that the difference in levels was due to changes in protein stability. Furthermore, we could also rule out that the change in protein production was due to differences in the level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1O</xref>) or cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1P</xref>) of <italic>CALR-HA</italic> mRNA.</p>
         <p>From these experiments we conclude that ALREX-promoting SSCRs can potentiate the translation of a natural mRNA. When controlling for transfection efficiency, mRNA distribution and mRNA levels, 57% (±13%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005) less protein was produced from <italic>4Ile-CALR-HA</italic> than from <italic>CALR-HA</italic> mRNA. Confirming our results with the <italic>ftz</italic> reporter construct, we again observed that the disruption of the ALREX-element had a more pronounced effect on translation than on mRNA export.</p>

         <title>ALREX-Promoting Elements Require a Nuclear Factor in order to Stimulate ftz Protein Synthesis</title>
         <p>When the translation of <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> and <italic>2-Ile-MHC-ftz</italic> was monitored using an in vitro reticulocyte extract, both mRNAs produced the same amount of protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). From this result we concluded that there is no inherent difference in the translatability of these two mRNAs and that reticulocyte lysate, which is derived from enucleated cells, may lack factors that are required for the efficient translation of transcripts harboring ALREX-elements. Indeed, ALREX-elements are likely to associate with nuclear factors that promote mRNA export and then accompany the transcript to the cytoplasm where they may help to potentiate translation. To test this idea, we microinjected in vitro synthesized and polyadenylated <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA into either the cytoplasm or nucleus of cells, and after various time points, we visualized <italic>ftz</italic> mRNA by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Cytoplasmic or nuclear microinjection was confirmed by co-injecting fluorescently labeled 70 kDa dextran, which is too large to passively cross the nuclear pores. When injected into the cytoplasm, but not the nucleus, <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA accumulated in aggregates that were positive for Tia1, a general marker for SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g002">Figure 2A–2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Kedersha1">[24]</xref>. In general, SGs are thought to form under a variety of conditions, including the accumulation of mRNA with defective or incompletely assembled translation initiation complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Kedersha2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Anderson1">[26]</xref>. Since these SGs were also enriched in eIF3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), a translation initiation factor, it is likely that the mRNAs that were injected into the cytoplasm assembled incomplete translation-initiation complexes, rather than simply aggregating non-specifically. Interestingly, mRNA that was injected into the cytoplasm appeared to be stable, as the FISH signal remained strong for up to 9 h post-injection (unpublished data).</p>

(D–E, H) NIH-3T3 cells were microinjected with FITC-labeled 70 kDa dextran and in vitro synthesized, capped, and polyadenylated <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA, which was either untreated (D–E) or pre-incubated with HeLa nuclear extract (H). The cells were incubated for 3 h then fixed and stained by immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope. Each row represents a single field of cells that were microinjected into the cytoplasm (D,H) or nucleus (E) as determined by the distribution of 70 kDa dextran. Note that when <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA is introduced directly into the cytoplasm it is translated only if it was pre-incubated with nuclear extract. Scale bar = 20 µM. (F–G) NIH-3T3 cells were microinjected with <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA and FITC-labeled 70 kD dextran, alone or with HeLa nuclear extract (“+NE”), in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Cells were fixed, then immunostained for either FLAG (F–G) or HA (F) epitopes. (F) The total integrated intensity of FLAG and HA immunofluorescence was quantified for cells, 3 h post-injection.

         <p>We next investigated whether the injected <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNAs were translated. Since too few cells are microinjected in a single experiment to allow for biochemical analysis, we instead monitored the expression of protein by immunofluorescence against the HA and FLAG epitopes, which are encoded within the <italic>ftz</italic> ORF. When <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA was microinjected into the cytoplasm, few of those cells produced detectable levels of ftz protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, most cells whose nuclei were injected with the same mRNA expressed protein after about 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). As expected, all expressed protein co-localized with the ER marker Trapα (unpublished data), as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>. When we quantified the total intensity of the FLAG and HA immunostain signals 3 h post-injection, there was a 10- to 15-fold increase in protein production when the mRNA was microinjected in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, when we monitored this expression over time, cells whose cytoplasm was injected with <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNAs eventually expressed protein, but only after a 2–3 h delay when compared to those that received <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNAs in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). We speculated that the delay in expression was due to the fact that over time these mRNAs were slowly accumulating a factor that cycled between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Remarkably, when <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA was pre-incubated with HeLa nuclear extract and then injected into the cytoplasm, efficient protein production was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g002">Figure 2F–2H</xref>). When <italic>c-ftz</italic> mRNA was injected either into the nucleus or cytoplasm, with or without nuclear extract, no translational product was ever detected (unpublished data). These observations suggest that ALREX-promoting elements potentiate translation by recruiting one or more nuclear factors to the translational start site.</p>

         <title>Identification of Nuclear Proteins That Associate with ALREX-Promoting Elements</title>
         <p>Since HeLa nuclear extract appeared to potentiate translation, and would also be enriched in putative nuclear export factors, we wanted to determine whether any proteins in these extracts directly associate with ALREX-promoting elements. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we observed the formation of a complex between nuclear extract factors and [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled RNA fragments from the <italic>Ins</italic> and <italic>MHC</italic> SSCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). Complex formation was detected when we tested a mutant form of the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR containing seven silent adenine substitutions (<italic>7A-Ins</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s007">Table S1</xref> for the sequence of this mutant). In contrast, very little complex was formed with an RNA fragment derived from the beginning of the <italic>β-globin</italic> (<italic>βG</italic>) ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>), which does not promote export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Valencia1">[27]</xref>. To test for specificity, we formed complexes between HeLa nuclear extracts and the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, but in the presence of cold competitor RNA. Unlabeled <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR was a more effective competitor than either the <italic>7A-Ins</italic> mutant or the <italic>βG</italic> RNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). From these experiments we concluded that one or more factors in HeLa nuclear extracts specifically associate with ALREX-promoting elements. Our data indicate that the addition of adenines decreases, but does not abolish, the ability of HeLa factors to interact with ALREX-promoting elements. This result is consistent with the observation that adenine substitutions only partially inhibit ALREX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g001">Figure 1 G and 1H</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cenik1">[7]</xref>.</p>

Several <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR-interacting factors were detected by silver stain. Importantly, these proteins were less abundant when the purification was performed with the <italic>7A-Ins</italic> mutant RNA, and almost completely absent with <italic>βG</italic> RNA. Note that these proteins also associated specifically with the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR under less stringent conditions, but were partially obscured by non-specific RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Since the nonspecific proteins bound equally well to beads with either the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR, the <italic>7A-Ins</italic> mutant, and <italic>βG</italic> RNAs, but not to the beads alone, we are somewhat confident that equal amounts of RNA were used in all pulldowns. Bands were excised and identified using mass spectrometry as being RanBP2/Nup358 (henceforth termed RanBP2), Importinβ, RanGAP1, Ran, and Ubc9. When proteins from RNAse A and SDS eluates were precipitated with trichloroacetate and analyzed by mass spectroscopy, we could also detect TAP, RCC1, and Importinα in the <italic>Ins</italic> purified fraction, but not the other fractions. Since these proteins could not be readily visualized on a silver-stained gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), we believe that their binding to the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR is either very weak or indirect. We also detected a large number of SUMO peptides in the trichloroacetate-precipitated fraction. Interestingly, RanBP2 is a known E3 SUMO ligase, which transfers SUMO from Ubc9 (an E2 SUMO ligase) to substrates such as RanGAP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Pichler1">[28]</xref>. Moreover RanBP2, which is present on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore, forms a stable complex with Ubc9 and sumoylated RanGAP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Mahajan1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Saitoh1">[30]</xref>. RanBP2 also interacts with most of the other identified proteins, including Ran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Yokoyama1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Wu1">[32]</xref>, TAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Forler1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Lvesque1">[34]</xref>, and Importinβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-BenEfraim1">[35]</xref>.</p>
         <p>To validate our findings, we assessed the association of HeLa extract proteins to the RNA-coated beads by immunoblot. To ensure that the binding was specific, we washed the beads extensively with high salt buffer. Indeed, RanBP2, RanGAP1, and Ran bound exclusively to <italic>Ins</italic>, but not <italic>7A-Ins</italic>, <italic>βG</italic> RNAs, or to the beads alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). When the fractions were probed with mAb414, an antibody that recognizes several nucleoporins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Davis1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Davis2">[37]</xref>, only RanBP2 was detected in the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, Nup62 and Nup153 failed to associate with the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, lane 1) despite the fact that they are present in this extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, lane 5).</p>
         <p>From these results we conclude that the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR interacts with RanBP2 and several RanBP2-associated proteins.</p>

         <title>The Zinc Finger Repeats of RanBP2 Interact Directly with the Ins SSCR</title>
         <p>Since all of the proteins that associated with the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR are known to bind to RanBP2, it is highly probable that the RNA is making contact to one subunit of a large complex. We expressed and purified five His-tagged, and one GST-tagged, fragments of RanBP2.

We found that the zinc finger domain (ZFD) fragment, which contains all eight of the RanBP2 ZFRs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), was able to form a complex with [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled <italic>Ins</italic> RNA by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). In contrast, none of the other fragments were able to form a complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). In addition we did not detect binding between [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR and either purified bacterially expressed RanGAP1 or Importinβ alone, or in the presence of GTP-bound Ran (unpublished data). The ZFD also formed a complex with the <italic>MHC</italic> SSCR, but not the <italic>βG</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).

         <p>Interestingly, the eight ZFRs from RanBP2 are highly related to repeats found in Nup153 and ZRanB2. Indeed, the ZRanB2 zinc fingers bind directly to single-stranded RNA in a sequence-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Loughlin1">[38]</xref>. Although the zinc fingers from RanBP2 and Nup153 had not been previously reported to interact with RNA, they were shown to directly associate with both GDP- and GTP-bound Ran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Higa1">[39]</xref>. Interestingly, structural and biochemical analysis indicates that the RanBP2 and Nup153 zinc fingers interact with Ran using the same analogous surface that the ZRanB2 repeats employs to bind RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Loughlin1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Higa1">[39]</xref>. This raised the possibility that the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR and Ran may compete for binding to the RanBP2 ZFRs. In agreement with this idea, GST-tagged Ran, loaded with either GTP or GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g004">Figure 4H</xref>), effectively prevented the ZFD protein fragment from associating with the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g004">Figure 4I</xref>, lanes 2 and 3).

From these results we conclude that the binding of the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR and Ran to ZFD is mutually exclusive. Our results are consistent with the idea that the ZFD uses a similar surface to bind to both molecules, although we cannot exclude the possibility that Ran-binding may induce a conformational change in the ZFD that ultimately alters a different RNA binding-site.</p>

         <title>The Number of RanBP2 Zinc Fingers Correlates with the Average Length of SSCR-Specific Adenine-Less Tracts across Metazoans</title>
         <p>Adenine depletion is a hallmark of ALREX-promoting elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cenik1">[7]</xref>. We previously capitalized on this fact to estimate the size of ALREX-promoting elements in various organisms by measuring the longest tract of adenine-less sequence within the first 69 nucleotides of ORFs that encode signal sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>. Indeed, the average length of adenine-less sequence per SSCR varied greatly between species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Palazzo2">[6]</xref>. We speculated that this variation between organisms might correlate with the number of zinc fingers present in their respective copy of RanBP2. To test this idea, we expanded our analysis to 36 different metazoans where we calculated the average length of the longest tract of adenine-less sequence within the first 99 nucleotides of the ORFs that encode signal sequences, and compared this to the number of zinc fingers encoded by that organism's <italic>RanBP2</italic> gene. As a control we computed the average length of the longest tract of adenine-less sequence in a stretch of 99 nucleotides selected randomly within each ORF. In addition we also analyzed genes that code for signal sequences from <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, two organisms that do not contain any known RanBP2 orthologs. Overall, we observed a general correlation between the number of RanBP2 ZFRs and the length of adenine-less tracts in SSCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s008">Table S2</xref>). Critically, SSCRs from <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> did not contain long adenine-less tracts when compared to control sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). Since RanBP2 has yet to have been documented outside of metazoans, our data suggest that the selective pressure necessary to effectively deplete adenines from SSCRs arose only after the appearance of RanBP2 at the base of the metazoan tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Even more interesting is the case of <italic>Pediculus humanus</italic> (commonly referred to as the human head louse), which did not display any significant increase in length of adenine-less tracts in their SSCRs and whose RanBP2 gene lacked ZFRs. In contrast, six other invertebrates (including aphids) had both a significant increase in the length of the adenine-less tracts in their SSCRs and versions of RanBP2 that contained ZFRs. Thus, it is likely that the lineage from which <italic>P. humanus</italic> arose, lost both features relatively recently (i.e., after this lineage had diverged from aphids, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

The average length of the longest adenine-less track within the first 99 nucleotides or a random stretch of 99 nucleotides was analyzed. (A) For each organism, the average adenine-less track lengths (<italic>y</italic>-axis) were plotted against the number of ZFRs (<italic>x</italic>-axis) in the RanBP2 gene.

A trend line and the corresponding coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) was also included. Note that for one metazoan species, <italic>P. humanus</italic> (human head lice), there is neither adenine depletion nor ZFRs within RanBP2.

         <p>This analysis indicated that these two features (i.e., zinc fingers within RanBP2 and SSCR-specific adenine depletion) not only correlated, but are either both present or absent in all organisms analyzed thus far. We thus concluded that adenine-less tracts and the zinc fingers of RanBP2 display an evolutionary relationship towards each other. This finding strongly indicates that a major role of the RanBP2 ZFRs is to recognize adenine-less tracts in ALREX-promoting SSCRs.</p>

         <title>RanBP2 Is Required for the Potentiation of Translation by ALREX-Promoting SSCRs</title>
         <p>We next examined whether RanBP2 was required for the efficient translation of mRNAs containing ALREX-promoting SSCRs. To accomplish this we transiently transfected reporter constructs into U2OS cells treated with lentiviral-delivered shRNAs directed against RanBP2. We found that cells depleted of RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) did not efficiently produce MHC-ftz protein when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figures 6B and 6C</xref>). In contrast, the expression of PTH-ftz and H1B-GFP protein was relatively unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figures 6B and 6C</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed a drop in the production of 2Ile-MHC-ftz. This result is not surprising when considering that the RanBP2 zinc-finger repeats bind to ALREX-promoting sequences that had adenine mutations, albeit at a lower level than wild-type sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g004">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>). The decrease in MHC-ftz and 2Ile-MHC-ftz protein synthesis could not be attributable to changes in the total level <italic>ftz</italic> mRNAs, which remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figures 6D and 6E</xref>), or to changes in the distribution of <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>

Error bars represent the standard deviation between the three experiments. (H) UAP56 and URH49 were simultaneously depleted in U2OS cells by lentiviral mediated delivery of shRNAs. Four days post-infection, cell lysates collected, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunostained for these two proteins and for α-tubulin.

(I) Three days post-infection, cells were transfected with plasmids containing GFP-RanBP2, or GFP-RanBP2Δ6ZFR or without plasmid (“Mock”). After allowing expression for 48 h, cell lysates were collected and detected by immunoblot using antibodies against GFP, RanBP2, and α-tubulin. Note that the GFP-RanBP2 constructs do not contain the endogenous UTRs and are resistant to depletion by shRNA3. (J–K) Three days post-infection, cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing MHC-ftz and either GFP-RanBP2, GFP-RanBP2Δ6ZFR, or H1B-GFP and allowed to express for 48 h. Cells were immunostained using anti-GFP and anti-HA primary antibodies, and the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.

         <p>This last finding was quite surprising given the fact that RanBP2 was shown to be required for the efficient nuclear export of bulk mRNA in insect and mouse cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Forler1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Hamada1">[40]</xref>. In contrast, it had also been reported that RanBP2 depletion had no effect on the distribution of poly(A) mRNA in the human HeLa cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Hutten1">[41]</xref>. In line with this last experiment we found that the cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio of poly(A) mRNA was unaffected by the depletion of RanBP2 in human U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). On the other hand, depletion of the two RNA helicases, UAP56 and URH49, by shRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6H</xref>) caused a pronounced block in mRNA nuclear export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6G</xref>) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Kapadia1">[42]</xref>. Thus it is likely that RanBP2 plays at most a minor role in mRNA nuclear export in human cells. This might be due to the presence of RanBP2 paralogs, which appear to be primate specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Ciccarelli1">[43]</xref>. Curiously, these paralogs lack the ZFRs and are thus unlikely to participate in ALREX-mediated events.</p>
         <p>We next evaluated the production of protein from a more “natural” transcript. As expected, the depletion of RanBP2 also inhibited the production of CALR-HA, but not 4Ile-CALR-HA protein without a significant change in mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s003">S3C</xref>). To confirm these results, we depleted RanBP2 with a second shRNA construct (“RanBP2 shRNA2”; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). In these cells we again observed a consistent reduction in the production of MHC-ftz and CALR-HA protein without a significant change in mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s003">Figure S3E</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s003">S3H</xref>). In contrast, the levels of PTH-ftz and H1B-GFP proteins were relatively unaffected. Finally we found that the depletion of RanBP2 using either of the two shRNAs inhibited the synthesis of INS-ftz protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s003">Figure S3I and S3J</xref>).</p>
         <p>To ensure that our results were not due to some pleiotropic effect, we depleted RanBP2 with a third lentiviral-delivered shRNA (i.e., shRNA3) that is complementary to a region in the 3′ UTR. Three days after infection we rescued the knockdown cells by transfecting a plasmid that contains a GFP-RanBP2 construct that lacks the endogenous UTRs and thus was resistant to depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6I</xref>). In parallel we transfected control plasmids containing either a version of GFP-RanBP2 that lacks the last six zinc fingers (RanBP2Δ6ZFR) or H1B-GFP. With these various GFP vectors we co-transfected a plasmid containing <italic>MHC-ftz</italic>. Since, only a subset of the MHC-ftz expressing cells also co-expressed the GFP-RanBP2 constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s004">Figure S4</xref>), we monitored individual cells for ftz protein levels by immunofluorescence against the HA epitope. Since GFP-RanBP2 expression was very low we also immunostained cells with an antibody against GFP. In cells transfected with <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> alone, RanBP2 depletion by shRNA3 resulted in a decrease in protein expression by approximately 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6J</xref>, “mock”). Co-expression of GFP-RanBP2 rescued the level of ftz protein, whereas co-expression of GFP-RanBP2Δ6ZFR, had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6J</xref>). Note that even in the shRNA3-treated cells, those that express GFP-RanBP2, express much more ftz protein than neighboring cells that express ftz alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6K</xref>, compare the level of ftz protein in the cells expressing GFP-RanBP2, which are denoted by arrows, to the cell expressing ftz alone, which is indicated by an arrowhead). In contrast, expression of GFP-RanBP2Δ6ZFR had no effect on ftz protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g006">Figure 6K</xref>).</p>
         <p>We next examined the association of <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> with polysomes using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Consistent with our analysis of translational product, <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA was associated with fewer ribosomes in RanBP2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g007">Figure 7A–7C</xref>). In contrast, the distributions of <italic>H1B-GFP</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g007">Figure 7A, 7B, and 7D</xref>) and ribosomal rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g007">Figures 7A,7B</xref>, and S5) in the gradients were relatively unaffected. Since active translation is required for the efficient localization of <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cui1">[44]</xref>, we next examined the distribution of this mRNA on this organelle. In order to accomplish this we extracted cells with digitonin, a detergent that selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane and thus removes cytoplasmic mRNAs that are not anchored to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cui1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Lerner1">[45]</xref>. By analyzing the level of <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA in unextracted and extracted cells by FISH, we calculated that the amount of ER-bound <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA was reduced in cells depleted of RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Finally we assessed the association of <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA with SGs by co-staining this transcript with Tia1. RanBP2-depleted cells transfected with plasmids encoding <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA had an increase in SG formation when compared to transfected control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). As seen previously, the vast majority of these SGs were enriched in <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA. To determine how fast these SGs formed, we microinjected plasmids into these cells and monitored the distribution of newly made mRNA levels. 20 min post injection we halted the further production of mRNA by adding α-amanatin and we then monitored the distribution of newly synthesized mRNA by FISH. Indeed, SGs appeared in RanBP2-depleted cells that expressed <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNA after only 2 h post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). Moreover the newly expressed mRNAs accumulated in these SGs. These observations are consistent with the idea that in RanBP2-depleted cells, there is a buildup of <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> mRNAs with defective translation-initiation complexes that very quickly aggregate into SGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Mazroui1">[9]</xref>.</p>

         <p>From these results we conclude that RanBP2 is required for the potentiation of translation by ALREX-promoting SSCRs.

         <title>RanBP2 Is Required for the Efficient Global Production of ER-Targeted Proteins</title>
         <p>Previously we estimated that about 70% of all human genes that encode proteins targeted to either the ER or mitochondria, contain ALREX-promoting elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cenik1">[7]</xref>. We thus decided to test the rate of protein synthesis in these various subcellular compartments. Newly synthesized proteins were labeled by feeding [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine/cysteine to either control, or RanBP2-depleted cells. After 15 min, the cells were lysed, and the nuclear, ER/mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation and analyzed for [<sup>35</sup>S] incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) and protein composition by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). In agreement with our previous bioinformatic analysis, the amount of newly synthesized protein in the ER/mitochondrial fraction decreased by half in cells depleted of RanBP2. We also detected a slight decrease in the amount of newly synthesized proteins in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), and this is likely due to the fact that a small but substantial fraction of non-secretory mRNAs contain features associated with ALREX (CC and FPR, unpublished observations). We also immunoprecipitated proteins from these cell lysates and determined that the amount of newly synthesized BiP, a lumenal ER chaperone that contains an adenine-depleted SSCR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s007">Table S1</xref>), significantly dropped in RanBP2 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g008">Figure 8C and 8D</xref>). In contrast the levels of α-tubulin remained unchanged. In agreement with our findings that RanBP2 is required for the translation of secretory mRNAs, we observed a small but statistically significant decrease in ER-associated mRNA after RanBP2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). As expected, the depletion of RanBP2 also generally promoted the general formation of SGs as detected by Tia1 staining; however, this was not seen in every experiment and the number of granules per cell was highly variable (unpublished data). In contrast, SGs were never detected in control cells.</p>

         <p>In summary we conclude that RanBP2 is required for the efficient translation of mRNAs that encode secreted and membrane-bound proteins. Our data also suggest that cells depleted of RanBP2 accumulate mRNAs with defective translation initiation complexes, although the overall level of these defective complexes is likely very low and near the critical amount necessary to form SGs. In support of this, we did not detect a significant increase in ribosomal rRNA associated with the monosomal fraction after RanBP2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we provide the first evidence that ALREX-promoting SSCRs act as a platform to coordinate both nuclear export and translation by recruiting factors to the 5′ end of the transcript. Our data suggest that once export is completed, this platform directly binds to the ZFRs of RanBP2, a large nucleoporin present on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. This interaction is required for downstream events, which likely includes the assembly of a competent translation initiation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Our data indicate that these events are critical for the proper translation of many mRNAs that encode secretory, and likely mitochondrial proteins. Our results may explain previous studies that reported that the presence of a signal sequence enhances protein synthesis (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Wicksteed1">[46]</xref>), and that the translation rate for ER-bound transcripts was much greater than those found in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Stephens1">[47]</xref>.</p>

            <title>A general model of ALREX-regulated processes.</title>
            <p>(1) mRNAs containing ALREX-promoting SSCRs are packaged into mRNPs and exported by an unknown mechanism. (2) The exported mRNAs transiently interact with RanBP2 at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. This interaction likely causes some alteration within the mRNP. (3) Ultimately, this interaction promotes the translation of these mRNAs into secretory proteins at the surface of the ER.</p>

      <p>It is still unclear how ALREX-promoting elements enhance mRNA export through the pore before these mRNAs encounter RanBP2. Our data suggest that it is unlikely that the nuclear transport complex TAP/p15 binds directly to the element, as purified TAP/p15 heterodimers do not associate with either the <italic>Ins</italic> or <italic>MHC</italic> SSCRs in vitro (unpublished data). It is possible that other proteins that contain RanBP2-like zinc fingers can bind to the ALREX-promoting elements, as these are known to interact with adenine-poor motifs. For example, each of the two RanBP2-like zinc fingers of ZRanB2 interacts with a GGU triplet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Nguyen1">[48]</xref>, and the RanBP2-like zinc finger of TLS recognizes GGUG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Nguyen1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Lerga1">[49]</xref>. One obvious candidate ALREX-element binding protein is Nup153, whose zinc fingers share the highest degree of similarity to those of RanBP2. However, in our experiments we did not detect any association of this protein with the <italic>Ins</italic> SSCR in HeLa nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). In line with these results, the number of Nup153 ZFRs does not appear to correlate with adenine depletion across genomes (unpublished data). In particular, the <italic>P. humanus</italic> Nup153 ortholog has five zinc fingers, without any SSCR-specific adenine depletion. Identification of other proteins that associate with ALREX-promoting elements will be critical for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the ALREX pathway.</p>
      <p>Since RanBP2 is thought mainly to reside on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore, it is likely that this protein only interacts with mRNAs after they have been exported. This interaction may be required to remodel the messenger ribonucleoparticle (mRNP) complex after it has emerged from the nuclear pore. The idea is supported by recent observations of single mRNA molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Grnwald1">[50]</xref>. These studies demonstrated that after their nuclear export, a subset displayed extended dwell times in a region that was 100–150 nm away from the nuclear pore, a region that is occupied mainly by RanBP2 and presumably its paralogs. In addition to its ZFD, RanBP2 may have additional RNA-interacting domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Kassube1">[51]</xref>, and thus also impact the translation of supplementary subclasses of mRNA. Furthermore, other factors that have been implicated in both nuclear export and translation, such as Dbp5 and Gle1, are also thought to be present on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Bolger1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Gross1">[53]</xref>. Thus it is likely that many critical mRNP remodeling events may occur in this region.</p>
      <p>Since it is likely that the first translating ribosome would disrupt the association between the SSCR and RanBP2, it is likely that this protein must enhance the translatability of the mRNA before the pioneer round of translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Maquat1">[54]</xref>. This is reminiscent of the exon junction complex (EJC), which is known to stimulate the translatability of any associated mRNA and whose binding to the transcript is also displaced by translating ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Nott1">[55]</xref>. The EJC accomplishes this in part by promoting the phosphorylation of translation factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Ma1">[56]</xref>. Recently, the EJC has been shown to associate with certain motifs that are found in the first exon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Singh1">[57]</xref>, which resemble sequences that are enriched in ALREX-promoting SSCRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cenik1">[7]</xref>. Experiments are currently underway to determine the exact contribution of the EJC to the translation of mRNAs containing ALREX-promoting SSCRs.</p>
      <p>Although RanBP2 is not known to be associated with any kinases, it does have the ability to sumoylate proteins. Indeed a large proportion of known sumoylated proteins have RNA-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Nie1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Meier1">[60]</xref>. Interestingly, it has been reported that the sumoylation of the cytoplasmic cap-binding protein, eIF4E, potentiates translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Xu1">[61]</xref>. Indeed, RanBP2 and eIF4E appear to cross regulate one another and thus impacting overall gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-CuljkovicKraljacic1">[62]</xref>. We have tried to recapitulate the potentiation of translation using in vitro translation systems, such as reticulocyte lysate; however, we could not detect any change between <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> and <italic>2Ile-MHC-ftz</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). This is not surprising as these lysates lack RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001545.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Unfortunately, adding HeLa nuclear extracts to reticulocyte lysates inhibits translation of all tested mRNAs (unpublished data). Experiments are now underway that aim to dissect the exact mechanism by which RanBP2 potentiates translation by performing a detailed domain analysis of this protein using an in vivo assay.</p>
      <p>Finally it is possible that RanBP2 may play some role in delivering mRNAs to their ultimate destinations. Interestingly, in photoreceptor cells of the retina, it has been reported that RanBP2 can accompany vesicles that pinch off from the nuclear envelope to be delivered to the cell periphery, which contains both ER and mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Mavlyutov1">[63]</xref>. In other studies, RanBP2 has also been reported to interact with kinesins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Cai1">[64]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Murawala1">[65]</xref> and dynein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001545-Murawala1">[65]</xref>. Further investigations will need to be performed to determine if RanBP2 plays a direct role in delivering secretory mRNAs to the ER.</p>

The lysates were first treated with Endo H, which removes ER-specific N-linked glycosylation, or PNGase, which removes all N-linked glycosylation. The lysates were then denatured and separated by SDS-PAGE, and probed with antibodies against the HA epitope (A–B), and against α-tubulin as a loading control (A). An image of colored molecular weight standards is included in (A). Note that after either Endo H or PNGase treatment, the mobility of all of the MHC-ftz and 2Ile-MHC-ftz proteins increased. This is to be expected as the mature ftz polypeptide has two consensus glycosylation sites. In contrast FS-MHC-ftz protein was unaffected by PNGase treatment. From these data we concluded that MHC-ftz, but not FS-MHC-ftz, is present in the ER lumen where it is glycosylated. Also note that the mobility of deglycosylated MHC-ftz is greater than that of FS-MHC-ftz despite the fact that the two protein products should have similar molecular weights, suggesting that the former is processed by signal peptidase. (C) In vitro transcribed and capped mRNAs were translated in vitro using reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine/cysteine. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and newly synthesized proteins were detected by autoradiography. An image of colored molecular weight markers (MWMs) was included as a reference. Note that reticulocyte lysate does not contain ER-derived microsomes, thus the resulting ftz protein products are expected to be unprocessed and unmodified. Also note that the molecular weight of these in vitro synthesized proteins (&gt;17 kD) was greater than the final deglycosylated in vivo translated forms (see PNGase and Endo H treated samples in (A), which are &lt;17 kD). This observation indicates that in cells, MHC-ftz and 2Ile-MHC-ftz are proteolytically processed, likely by signal peptidase. (D–F) To calculate the half-life of the two protein products, U2OS cells that were transfected with plasmids that contained either the <italic>MHC-ftz</italic> or <italic>2Ile-MHC-ftz</italic> genes (18–24 h post-transfection) were treated with cyclohexamide (CHX) for indicated time points. Cell lysates were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE, then probed with antibodies against the HA epitope and α-tubulin. (D) The amount of ftz protein (<italic>y</italic>-axis) at each time point (<italic>x</italic>-axis) was analyzed by densitometry and then normalized to the initial protein level and plotted. Each data point represents the average and standard deviation of three independent experiments. (F) Each bar represents the average and standard error of the half-lives derived from three independent experiments.</p>

<caption><p><bold>Identification of ALREX-element associating proteins from HeLa nuclear extract.</bold> Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, bound with various biotinylated RNAs (each 76 nucleotides long) or without any RNA (“No RNA”), were used to isolate ALREX-element associating proteins from NE under low salt conditions (i.e., 200 mM NaCl instead of the 600 mM used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001545-g003">Figure 3E–3G</xref>). Beads were treated with RNase A and then proteins were denatured in SDS at 90°C for 5 min. Eluted proteins were separated on a 4%–20% gradient gel and silver stained. ALREX-interacting proteins (RanBP2, Importinβ, RanGAP1, and Ran) are indicated. Note that under these conditions, many non-specific proteins are present in the RNA-coated beads at similar levels, but not in the uncoated beads. These observations indicate that the RNA-coated beads contained similar amounts of bound oligonucleotides. The position of molecular weight markers in kDa are indicated on the right.</p>
