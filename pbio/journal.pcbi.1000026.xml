Recent findings demonstrate that Pum also plays an important role in the nervous system, both at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and in long-term memory formation. In neurons, Pum appears to play a role in homeostatic control of excitability via down regulation of <italic>para</italic>, a voltage gated sodium channel, and may more generally modulate local protein synthesis in neurons via translational repression of <italic>eIF-4E</italic>. Aside from these, the biologically relevant targets of Pum in the nervous system remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that Pum might play a role in regulating the local translation underlying synapse-specific modifications during memory formation. To identify relevant translational targets, we used an informatics approach to predict Pum targets among mRNAs whose products have synaptic localization. We then used both in vitro binding and two in vivo assays to functionally confirm the fidelity of this informatics screening method. We find that Pum strongly and specifically binds to RNA sequences in the 3′UTR of four of the predicted target genes, demonstrating the validity of our method. We then demonstrate that one of these predicted target sequences, in the 3′UTR of <italic>discs large (dlg1)</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PSD95 ortholog, can functionally substitute for a canonical NRE (Nanos response element) in vivo in a heterologous functional assay. Finally, we show that the endogenous <italic>dlg1</italic> mRNA can be regulated by Pumilio in a neuronal context, the adult mushroom bodies (MB), which is an anatomical site of memory storage.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pumilio (Pum) protein was originally identified as a translational control factor for embryo patterning. Subsequent studies have identified Pum's role in multiple biological processes, including the maintenance of germline stem cell, the proliferation and migration of primordial germ cells, olfactory leaning and memory, and synaptic plasticity. Pum is highly conserved across phyla, i.e., from worm to human; however, the mRNA targets of Pum within each tissue and organism are largely unknown. On the other hand, the prediction of RNA binding sites remains a hard question in the computational field. We were interested in finding Pum targets in the nervous system using fruit flies as a model organism. To accomplish this, we used the few Pum binding sequences that had previously been shown in vivo as “training sequences” to construct bioinformatic models of the Pum binding site. We then predicted a few Pum mRNA targets among the genes known to function in neuronal synapses. We then used a combination of “golden standards” to verify these predictions: a biochemical assay called gel shifts, and in vivo functional assays both in embryo and neurons. With these approaches, we successfully confirmed one of the targets as Dlg, which is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of human PSD95. Therefore, we present a complete story from computational study to real biological functions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was supported by funds to JD, TT, and MQZ from Dart Neuroscience.

Its function in the posterior body patterning of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos is relatively well studied. Wharton and Struhl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Wharton1">[1]</xref> first identified two copies of sequence elements located in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of maternal <italic>hunchback</italic> (<italic>hb</italic>) mRNA, named Nanos Response Elements (NREs), which are essential for normal abdominal segmentation. It was later shown that Pum binds these elements, recruits Nanos (Nos) and Brain Tumor (Brat), and represses the translation of maternal <italic>hb</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Murata1">[2]</xref>. Pum was also reported to temporally regulate the translation of <italic>Drosophila bicoid</italic> (<italic>bcd</italic>) mRNA, which plays a key role in anterior development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Gamberi1">[3]</xref>. In addition, Pum, acting together with Nos, is required for germline development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, and <italic>Cyclin B</italic> (<italic>CycB</italic>) mRNA appears to be a target of translational repression by this complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-AsaokaTaguchi1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Kadyrova1">[5]</xref>. As a characteristic of the PUF family proteins, the minimal RNA-binding domain of Pum comprises eight imperfect repeats, is evolutionarily conserved across species from yeast to human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Zamore1">[6]</xref> and, therefore, is termed the PUF domain or Pumilio Homology Domain (Pum-HD). This RNA-binding domain appears to be sufficient for the function of Pum in vivo during <italic>Drosophila</italic> abdominal segmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Wharton2">[7]</xref>.</p><p>More recently, Pum has been found to play a role in the nervous system at the neuromuscular junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Menon1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Schweers1">[11]</xref>, in voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> current homeostasis in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Mee1">[9]</xref> and in long-term memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Dubnau1">[12]</xref>. Dubnau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Dubnau1">[12]</xref> employed the complementary “genomics” approaches of (i) a large-scale behavioral screen for mutants defective in one-day memory, and (ii) DNA microarray screening to identify genes in normal flies that are transcriptionally regulated during long-term memory formation. <italic>pum</italic> was found with both approaches: it is transcriptionally upregulated during memory formation after spaced training (which results in long-term memory) relative to massed training (which results only in shorter forms of memory), and two independent transposon insertions into <italic>pum</italic> yielded mutants with defective one-day memory after spaced training. In addition to <italic>pum</italic>, six other components of a pathway putatively involved in local translational control were identified: <italic>staufen</italic>, <italic>orb</italic> (CPEB), <italic>moesin</italic> and <italic>eIF-2G</italic> were transcriptionally regulated during memory formation, whereas transposon-mediated lesions were found in or near <italic>oskar</italic> (<italic>norka</italic> mutant) and <italic>eIF-5C</italic> (<italic>krasavietz</italic> mutant).</p><p>Local mRNA translation within dendrites of neurons has been proposed to be a mechanism for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Steward1">[13]</xref>). We hypothesized that Pum might play a role in local translation involved in synapse-specific modifications during memory formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Dubnau1">[12]</xref>. Consistent with this notion, Ye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Ye1">[10]</xref> showed that Pum and Nos act together and play a critical role in the morphogenesis of high-order dendritic branches in <italic>Drosophila</italic> peripheral neurons, and that Nos colocalizes with RNA granules in dendrites. The role of Pum-dependent regulation in neurons also may be conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Vessey1">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Despite these genetic observations of Pum/Nos function in neurons, only a few neuronal targets of Pum have been demonstrated in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Menon1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Mee1">[9]</xref>. A large number of Pum-associated mRNAs have been recently identified from oocytes and early embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Gerber1">[15]</xref>. These include a number of neuronally expressed genes whose in vivo relationship with Pum remains to be shown. As a complementary approach to screen for potentially relevant neuronal (and in particular synaptic) targets of Pum, we have used a combination of informatics and experimental approaches. Our first step to identify new Pum targets was to characterize and model the Pum binding sites. We then used our models to predict the presence of NREs in the 3′UTRs of mRNAs coding for synaptic proteins. We validated several of these by in vitro binding assays. We then used an established in vivo functional assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Wharton1">[1]</xref> to demonstrate Pum-dependent repression via the predicted NRE in the 3′UTR of <italic>dlg1</italic>.

This suggests that NRE_M10 is more accurate than NRE_M8, supporting the assumption behind NRE_M10, i.e., only Box B is important for Pum binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Expression Profiling of Putative Pum Targets During Memory Formation</title><p>While the validity of our model is also supported by our in vitro binding experiments, we decided to use an in vivo assay to validate our target prediction method for a few of the putative targets. Because we were interested in targets with potential relevance to behavioral plasticity, we decided first to quantify transcript levels for each candidate in response to behavioral training that induces long-term memory.</p><p>Expression profiling after experience-dependent memory formation indicated that the regulatory pathway for local translation (including Pum) is transcriptionally induced by spaced training <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Dubnau1">[12]</xref>. Thus we reasoned that mRNA levels of some of Pum targets might also be regulated. Using quantitative (real time) PCR (QPCR), we measured expression levels after spaced versus massed training for each of the putative Pum targets that showed robust binding in vitro. Two of them, <italic>Ace</italic> and <italic>dlg1</italic>, were significantly induced 6 hours after spaced training (fold change = 1.58, <italic>N</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0036 for <italic>Ace</italic>; fold change = 1.56, <italic>N</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0068 for <italic>dlg1</italic>). While we do not understand why transcriptional responses for Pum's targets are in the same direction as that of Pum, this may reflect global transcriptional increases versus local translational repression (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). These two candidate target genes were chosen for in vivo assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>In Vivo Confirmation of Predicted NRE Elements</title><p>To validate our target prediction method in vivo, we chose to use a Pum response assay described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Wharton1">[1]</xref>. This assay relies upon the requirement that maternally supplied <italic>hb</italic> mRNA be repressed by Pum/Nos in posterior regions of the early embryo. We started with a canonical genomic <italic>hb</italic> rescuing transgene in which the endogenous NRE motifs were deleted. In the absence of functional NRE elements, this construct causes a dominant sterility in transgenic females due to ectopic <italic>hb</italic> translation in the posterior half of the embryos produced. Such embryos are unable to form abdominal segments. Insertion of a functional NRE motif into this canonical construct restores Pum-mediated repression in the posterior, allowing production of viable progeny. Using this strategy, we tested the functional capacity of the predicted NRE motifs from <italic>Ace</italic> and <italic>dlg1</italic>. We chose these two putative targets because they showed relatively strong in vitro binding and also because both transcripts are induced by spaced training.</p><p>We generated a series of <italic>hb</italic>-transgene constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000026.s010">Table S4</xref>) in which the two endogenous <italic>hb</italic> NREs had either been deleted entirely (<bold>hbΔ</bold>), replaced with a single <italic>hb</italic> NRE, NRE2 (<bold>hb2</bold>), had both <italic>hb</italic> NRE elements re-inserted (<bold>hb1,2</bold>), replaced with putative NRE elements from <italic>Ace</italic> or <italic>dlg1</italic> genes (<bold>Ace</bold> or <bold>dlg1</bold>), or replaced with an anti-sense version of the predicted <italic>dlg1</italic> NRE (<bold>dlg1-anti</bold>).

It is worth noting that the rescue observed with the single <italic>dlg1</italic> NRE is superior to that observed with a single copy of the <italic>hb</italic> NRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). Consistent with a previous observation by Wharton and Struhl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Wharton1">[1]</xref>, a single <italic>hb</italic> NRE (<bold>hb2</bold>) yields partial rescue. In contrast, control transgenic lines in which no functional NRE was provided, or in which the <italic>dlg1</italic> NRE was inserted in opposite orientation (<bold>dlg1-anti</bold>) generate progeny nearly devoid of abdominal segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g005">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g006">6B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000026.s010">Table S4</xref>).

Optical sections of the MB lobes (A–F) or MB peduncle (G–L) are shown. In wild type (A–C, G–I), Dlg expression (red) is detected both in MB lobes and AL (A) as well as in the MB peduncle (G). In contrast, Dlg expression is dramatically reduced in the MB lobes (D) and peduncle (J) of Pum over-expressing MBs. AL glomeruli, also stained by Dlg antibody, serve as an internal control. We also noticed that when Pumilio is over-expressed in MB, there is MB developmental defect in MB lobe structure (visualized by GFP and shown in [E]). Despite this, GFP levels appear normal in the peduncle (K). Asterisk indicates peduncles where Dlg expression can be detected in wild type MB but is dramatically reduced in Pum over-expressing MB. As an additional confirmation, we used a series of Gal4 drivers that express preferentially in subsets of MB neurons (data not shown). Among all these Gal4 drivers, OK107 produced the strongest downregulation of Dlg as stated above. 238Y and c739 produced the second strongest effects: Dlg expression level is significantly reduced in the peduncle of the UAS-Pum; 238Y brains and is dramatically reduced in the α/β lobes of the UAS-Pum; c739 brains.

We next sought to test whether the endogenous <italic>dlg1</italic> mRNA can be regulated by Pumilio in a relevant neuronal context. Because of our interest in olfactory memory, we chose to test for Pum-mediated regulation of Dlg in the adult mushroom body (MB), which is an anatomical site of memory storage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Heisenberg1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Margulies1">[25]</xref>. We first used a monoclonal antibody against Dlg to examine the distribution of Dlg protein in brains of wild-type animals. Consistent with Ruiz-Canada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-RuizCanada1">[26]</xref>, we found that Dlg is widely distributed in the adult brain, with elevated levels in antenna lobes (AL) and mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We then tested whether transgenic over-expression of Pum in MB was sufficient to reduce the endogenous Dlg expression. To do this, we used a MB Gal4 enhancer trap line OK107 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Connolly1">[27]</xref> to drive the expression of both UAS-mCD8::GFP and UAS-Pumilio transgenes in the same brain. The GFP expression permitted independent visualization of the MB neuronal architecture and also served as an internal control for the distribution of Dlg.</p><p>Our imaging studies support two conclusions. First, we found that transgenic expression of Pum in MB Kenyon cells results in a dramatic reduction of Dlg expression levels. Importantly Dlg expression in AL appears unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, the GFP expression in MB neurons appears at normal levels. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that endogenous Dlg expression can be repressed by Pum in the CNS. Second, we also noticed that transgenic over-expression of Pum causes a severe defect in the elaboration of the axonal projections of MB neurons. This is evident in the expression of UAS-mCD8::GFP, which permits visualization of the entire MB neuronal architecture. In wild type animals, MB Kenyon cell axons dive ventrally and anteriorly along the peduncle. They then bifurcate into distinct vertical (α and α′) and horizontal (β, β′ and γ) lobes, which contain the axon terminals. In contrast, the MBs of Pum over-expressing animals do not form normal lobe structures. Instead, the axons appear to prematurely terminate just medial to the peduncle.</p><p>The above observation suggests the interesting possibility that Pum normally plays a key developmental role in elaboration of MB structure. While we cannot rule out neo-morphic effects of Pum over-expression, these findings nevertheless are consistent with the previous observations of Pum's role in dendrite morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Ye1">[10]</xref>. At the same time, however, we were concerned that the decreased accumulation of Dlg protein that we observed with Pum over-expression could be an indirect consequence of the MB structural defects. We used several strategies to rule this out. First, we made careful observation of Dlg expression levels in the peduncle in both wild type control and Pum over-expressing brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Unlike the lobes, which are largely absent from these animals, the peduncle is intact. GFP expression in the peduncle was used as a reference. Second, we used a monoclonal antibody against FasII, which like Dlg, is expressed at elevated levels in MB Kenyon cell neurons (although mostly α/β). This permitted a second independent means to image the MB of the same animals and also provided expression of a second endogenous protein as a control. Both of these experiments support the conclusion that Dlg expression per se is reduced in Pum over-expressing animals because both GFP and FasII protein levels are un-altered in the residual lobes and in the peduncle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Finally, we used several additional MB expressing Gal4 drivers to confirm the key observation that ectopic Pum can down regulate Dlg (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g006">Figure 6</xref> legend; data not shown). The magnitude of the effects on Dlg expression varied depending on expression levels, timing and number/type of MB neurons labeled. Nevertheless, we observed decreased Dlg immuno-labeling both with MB Gal4 line C739 and 238Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g006">Figure 6</xref> legend and data not shown).</p><fig id="pcbi-1000026-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000026.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>FasII Levels Appear Unaffected by Pum Over-Expression.</title><p>MB expressing Gal4 line (OK107) was used to drive expression of both UAS-mCD8::GFP (green) and UAS-Pum transgenes.

In most cases, biologically relevant motifs are hard to define, in part due to the unknown impact of secondary structure. This is confounded by the fact that in vivo assays to validate predictions are often not trivial. One approach to identify targets is to use genome-wide detection of mRNAs that directly associate with an RNA-binding protein. This approach was used with success <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Gerber1">[15]</xref> to identify putative Pum-associated mRNAs from ovaries and early embryos. In this study, we have taken a different approach to identify neuronal targets that might underlie Pum's role in memory. We took advantage of: (1) the availability of well characterized structural and functional information about Pum-HD:RNA interactions; (2) several conserved NRE elements that had been described for the <italic>hb</italic> and <italic>bcd</italic> genes; (3) the availability of a robust in vivo functional assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Wharton1">[1]</xref>, and (4) in vivo imaging of one target gene's expression to validate our predictions. We have identified a group of putative neuronal targets of Pum, including <italic>dlg1</italic> and <italic>Ace</italic>, both of which are also induced during memory consolidation. In the case of <italic>dlg1</italic>, the identified NRE appears capable of functioning both in a heterologous in vivo context of the early embryo and an endogenous one in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000026-g006">6</xref>).</p><p>Our results also suggest that the binding specificity of Pum is conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, as previously noted in Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Wang1">[17]</xref>, which is consistent with the observations that human Pum2 binds to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NRE sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Moore1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Fox1">[29]</xref>. First, NRE_M10, which is based on assumptions derived from the human Pum-RNA crystal structure, performed best among the three motif models constructed with known Pum targets in flies. Second, a motif derived from mouse PUM2 SELEX data, MmSelex_M8 (“Conservation of Pum binding specificity between fly and mouse” in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000026.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000026.s003">Figure S2</xref>), fit well with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pum binding data from EMSA. Furthermore, this conservation of Pum binding specificity may be extended to non-mammalian vertebrates, as <italic>Xenopus</italic> Pum has been shown to bind <italic>Drosophila hb</italic> NRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Bernstein1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Nakahata1">[30]</xref>. In fact, the RNA-binding domain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pum is very similar to that in human, mouse and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (amino acid identity ≥78%).</p><p>The fact that prediction scores of NRE_M10 and MmSelex_M8 are well correlated with in vitro binding data demonstrates the validity of these two models for Pum binding site prediction. The predicted hits by these two models in the synaptic gene set are significantly higher than random (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000026.s004">Figure S3</xref>), further demonstrating their validity and also suggesting that a number of synaptic genes are likely regulated by Pum. In the case of <italic>dlg1</italic>, our in vivo evidence indicates that the predicted NRE can function, not only in context of the <italic>hb</italic> 3′UTR, but also in CNS while Pum is over-expressed.</p><p>Comparing our synaptic gene set with the pulled-down targets from Gerber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Gerber1">[15]</xref>, 27 (18%) genes are in the adult specific target list. Only one gene overlaps with the embryo specific targets, presumably because the embryo specific target list is much smaller. Our predicted Pum targets using NRE_M10 and mmSelex_M8 are significantly enriched with experimentally pulled-down targets (36% and 30%, respectively, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000026.s006">Figure S5</xref> for more details). Although our NRE models, NRE_M10 and mmSelex_M8 were constructed from a very limited number of training sequences, the motif patterns match closely with the consensus Pum binding site published in Gerber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Gerber2">[31]</xref>, especially in the 8-nt core motif. These all validate the effectiveness of our method. Of course, further improvement can be made with more high confidence training sequences.</p><p>Studies in diverse organisms strongly indicate that sequences around BoxB play a major role in binding to Puf proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Gerber1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Wang1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Bernstein1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Gerber2">[31]</xref> although BoxA may affect the binding affinity to some extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Cheong1">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, the binding specificities appear to vary among Puf family members even though their RNA-binding domains are highly conserved. For example, Puf3, Puf4 and Puf5 in yeast appear to recognize similar motifs but in different lengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Gerber2">[31]</xref>. A recent finding by Opperman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Opperman1">[33]</xref> shed a light on this. It is indicated that small structural difference in the RNA-binding domain may require extra spacer nucleotides in the binding site. This BoxB related motif, hallmarked with UGUA tetranucleotide, may represent the most prevalent binding sites for Pum or even Puf family proteins. However, other types of binding sites may also exist as we will discuss below.</p><p>Notably, Pum binds to a 142-nt RNA harboring <italic>CycB</italic> TCE with a lower affinity than <italic>hb</italic> NRE under our experimental conditions. <italic>CycB</italic> TCE was initially proposed due to its resemblance to <italic>bcd</italic> and <italic>hb</italic> NRE, and was required for translational repression control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Dalby1">[22]</xref>. This cis-acting element was able to bind GST-Pum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Kadyrova1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Sonoda2">[34]</xref>, but not the purified Pum RBD or native embryonic extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Kadyrova1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Sonoda2">[34]</xref>. Indeed, <italic>CycB</italic> TCE has a lower score according to our matrix. A new element downstream of TCE has recently been proposed and been shown to bind to Pum in gel mobility shift experiments and, when substituted for the native <italic>hb</italic> NRE in a chimeric <italic>hb</italic> mRNA, was able to mediate <italic>CycB</italic>-like regulation on <italic>hb</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Kadyrova1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Sonoda2">[34]</xref>. Intriguingly, our matrix also predicts a Pum-binding site with high score (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ATTGTGCAAA</named-content>, nts 561–570 of 3′UTR of <italic>CycB</italic> mRNA) in the RNA fragment used in these experiments. Our predicted site is close to the NRE element proposed by Kadyrova and colleagues, but not the same. Further work needs to be done to address this discrepancy. It is also worth mentioning that there are several significant differences between regulation of <italic>CycB</italic> mRNA and <italic>hb</italic>/<italic>bcd</italic> mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Kadyrova1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Sonoda2">[34]</xref>. In contrast with <italic>bcd</italic> and <italic>hb</italic>, for example, regulation of <italic>CycB</italic> is Brat-independent. Kadyrova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Kadyrova1">[5]</xref> have demonstrated that in the case of <italic>CycB</italic>, Pum binding seems important only to recruit Nanos, because artificially tethering Nanos to the 3′UTR bypasses the requirement for Pum binding. This is in contrast to Pum's regulation of <italic>hb</italic>. Thus it seems that there are significant differences between the Pum-binding sites in <italic>CycB</italic> mRNA and those in <italic>hb</italic> and <italic>bcd</italic> mRNAs, as proposed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Menon1">[8]</xref>. Related to that, in the minimal 51 nt eIF-4E 3′UTR sequence bound by Pum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Menon1">[8]</xref>, only one binding site is predicted by NRE_M8 with a score just above the cutoff value 7.5, suggesting the Pum binding to eIF-4E 3′UTR may be also different from <italic>hb</italic> and <italic>bcd</italic>. Discovery of additional Pum targets from a variety of cell types and biological contexts may uncover the relationship between NRE sequence and regulatory mechanism.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize and predict Pum-binding sites with a PWM approach, which is typically more sensitive and more precise than consensus methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Stormo2">[21]</xref>. Our in vitro binding assay of Pum on a subset of the predicted targets provides a measure of validation of our motif models. Like Pum, two of these targets, <italic>Ace</italic> and <italic>dlg1</italic>, also appear to be transcriptionally induced after spaced training relative to massed training, suggesting that these are relevant targets for memory formation. We do not know why both a translational repressor and its putative targets are transcriptionally induced. It may be that transcripts are increased on a cell-wide level, while translation is spatially regulated within neurons. In the case of <italic>dlg1</italic>, our in vivo evidence supports the conclusion that the predicted NRE can mediate Pum-dependent repression both when it is in the context of the <italic>hb</italic> 3′UTR and in the endogenous <italic>dlg1</italic> transcript in the CNS. Thus, our findings directly predict that <italic>dlg1</italic> is a synaptic target of Pum.</p><p>Dlg is the sole <italic>Drosophila</italic> member of a family of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) that in mammals have been shown to play a key role in assembling the post-synaptic density in glutamatergic synapses.

We do not yet know whether other classic factors (Nanos and Brat) that cooperate with Pum in early embryos are also required in the translational control of Dlg in neurons. Further investigation also will be required to separate the roles of Pum in neuronal development and memory formation.

RNA quality was tested using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 Nano Chips. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with 5.0 µg RNA per reaction with an oligo dT primer and Taqman reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) in 100 µl total volume. PCR quantification was performed by using 4 µl of the above RT product per reaction on a real-time PCR machine (7900 HT, Applied Biosystems) using Taqman probe and Taqman reagents (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocols.

Expression levels were normalized to Drosophila TBP transcript levels. TBP was confirmed as an unchanged control by comparing in excess of 100 RNA extractions each after spaced and massed training (data not shown). All reactions were done in parallel by using at least eight independent RNA isolations for each group, with each RNA isolate being assayed once. Normalized threshold values (Ct) were subjected to parametric t-tests, with significance levels set at alpha = 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>In Vivo Assay for NRE Function</title><p>The in vivo function of the predicted NRE-like elements was tested as described by Wharton and Struhl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000026-Wharton1">[1]</xref>.
