      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>At least 10% of mammalian genes are transcribed from only one allele that, in most instances, is chosen at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b001">1</xref>]. The mechanisms for achieving differential regulation of homologous alleles in a stochastic manner are poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b002">2</xref>]. X-chromosome inactivation in mammals is an example of random monoallelic expression; the majority of genes on one X chromosome in XX females are silenced to equalize expression of X-linked genes with XY males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b003">3</xref>]. Understanding the process by which the two X chromosomes are assigned active and inactive fates in a stochastic manner will provide insight into how randomness can be achieved in other biological contexts.
			</p>
      <p>X-inactivation is a well-defined system for studying the mechanisms that generate the randomness of monoallelic expression. In the earliest stages of female embryogenesis, X-linked genes exhibit biallelic expression in female cells. Upon receipt of a developmental cue, one X chromosome is silenced in half of the cells of the embryo and the other X chromosome is silenced in the remaining half. Once the identities of the active and inactive X chromosomes (Xa and Xi) are established, they are stably propagated throughout all subsequent cell divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b004">4</xref>]. Female mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells provide a model system to study the mechanisms that control the initial, stochastic determination of the Xa and Xi in vitro. As in the pluripotent cells of the early embryo, genes are expressed from both X chromosomes in female ES cells. X-inactivation can be induced in vitro, recapitulating the random silencing process that occurs in vivo during differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b005">5</xref>]. In addition, genetic elements have been identified that affect the randomness of X-inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b006">6</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b007">7</xref>], making female ES cells a useful tool for the study of the mechanisms that control random monoallelic expression.
			</p>
      <p>The 
				<italic>X-inactivation center (Xic)</italic> is a master 
				<italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element on the X chromosome that controls X-inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b004">4</xref>]. The 
				<italic>Xic</italic> contains a number of elements, including 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and 
				<italic>Tsix,</italic> a sense/antisense pair of noncoding RNAs that are transcribed from both X chromosomes prior to X-inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b010">10</xref>]. When embryonic cells differentiate and X-inactivation is initiated, 
				<italic>Xist</italic> RNA spreads in 
				<italic>cis</italic> from the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> to coat and silence one X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b009">9</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b010">10</xref>]. 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> play a role in the stochastic determination of which X chromosome will become the Xi and which will become the Xa. In cells heterozygous for either an 
				<italic>Xist</italic> or a 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> mutation
				<italic>,</italic> X-inactivation is nonrandom: an 
				<italic>Xist</italic> mutant chromosome always becomes the Xa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b011">11</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b012">12</xref>] and a 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> mutant chromosome always becomes the Xi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b015">15</xref>]. Heterozygous mutations of 
				<italic>Xist</italic> or 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> also exhibit effects in 
				<italic>trans:</italic> not only are the fates of the mutant X chromosomes fixed but also the fates of the wild-type X chromosomes are determined. Thus, information about the fate of one X chromosome must be transmitted to the other X chromosome, ensuring that decisions about their fates are coordinated and that there is random and exclusive silencing of one X chromosome in female cells. The manner in which the opposing activities of 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> regulate the fates of both X chromosomes in female cells remains mysterious.
			</p>
      <p>In this paper, we present evidence that in individual pluripotent embryonic cells that are poised for X-inactivation, the X chromosomes exist in two mutually exclusive states. In heterozygous 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> mutant cells, these states predict the fates of the X chromosomes, indicating that one X chromosome adopts a future Xa state and the other X chromosome adopts a future Xi state. In wild-type cells, X chromosomes switch between these states such that, among the progeny of a single cell, a given X chromosome exhibits each state with equal frequency. Thus, the concerted switching of homologous X chromosomes between mutually exclusive future Xa and future Xi states may provide the basis for the apparent randomness of X-inactivation.

        <title>X-Chromosomal Loci Show a High Frequency of Singlet/Doublet Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Signals in ES Cells</title>
        <p>While using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize the 
					<italic>Xic</italic> in female ES cells fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA), we observed that a high frequency of cells displayed a single pinpoint FISH signal at one allele and a double pinpoint at the other. To determine whether this feature was unique to the 
					<italic>Xic,</italic> we analyzed a number of other X-chromosomal loci. Cells were scored as showing a singlet signal for each allele (SS), a doublet signal for each allele (DD), or a pattern in which one allele appeared as a singlet and the other as a doublet (SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). For all X-chromosomal loci examined, the SD signal class was the most abundant, comprising 40% to 50% of the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and S1A). This proportion is significantly greater than the fraction of SD signals observed for two autosomal loci, which exhibited the SD pattern in fewer than 20% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and S1A). Thus, the high proportion of cells displaying SD signals is a unique feature of X-linked sequences.

            <title>X-Chromosomal Loci Display SD FISH Signals Independent of Asynchronous DNA Replication</title>
            <p>(A) FISH for 
							<italic>Xic</italic> genomic sequences (red) demonstrates the three classes of signals in PFA-fixed female ES cells. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue).
						</p>
            <p>(B) ES cells display an elevated proportion of SD signals at X-chromosomal loci. Average data from two to four experiments (
							<italic>n</italic> &gt; 150), scored by two independent scorers, are presented. Error bars indicate one standard deviation. See 
							<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>A for complete scoring of SS, SD, and DD signals in these cells.
						</p>
            <p>(C) The 
							<italic>Xic</italic> and 
							<italic>Pgk1</italic> show a single peak of replication in female ES cells. DNA was isolated from cells that were arrested in G1, released into S phase, and pulsed with BrdU at hourly intervals. Progression through S phase was monitored by FACS (
							<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). An equal amount of BrdU-labeled human DNA was added to each time point. BrdU-labeled DNA was immunopurified, and sequences present in each fraction were assessed by PCR. Standard shows amplification of a human sequence, as a control for variability in immunoprecipitations. IgG represents PCR analysis from labeled DNA purified with mouse IgG instead of anti-BrdU antiserum. –BrdU indicates analysis of an anti-BrdU immunoprecipitation from unlabeled DNA. Pre-IP depicts PCR analysis of the input DNA.
						</p>
            <p>(D) Live female ES cells, pulse-labeled with BrdU, were sorted into six fractions by Hoechst staining for DNA content (upper panel). FISH for the 
							<italic>Xic</italic> (middle panel), and 
							<italic>Pgk1</italic> (lower panel) in these fractions shows constant, high proportions of SD signals (red triangles) throughout S-phase. Proportions of SS (black circles) and DD (gray squares) are also shown. The high proportion of BrdU-positive cells in all fractions (bold black line) shows that a substantial proportion of cells in all six fractions are in S phase. Over 80% of cycling ES cells are in S phase and fewer than 10% are in G1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b040">40</xref>], inevitably leading to the inclusion of early S phase cells in fraction 1. Data are representative of two or three independent experiments.
						</p>
            <p>(E) In ES cells, singlet and doublet FISH signals for X-chromosomal loci exhibit equivalent fluorescence intensity. Plots show the ratios of S/D (solid symbols) or D/D (open symbols) FISH signal intensities in individual MEF or ES cell nuclei displaying an SD or DD pattern for 
							<italic>Pgk1</italic> or the 
							<italic>Xic</italic> as indicated. The intensity of both pinpoints in each doublet was summed to calculate the total intensity of doublet signals. When calculating the D/D intensity ratios, the two doublets in a cell were randomly assigned to the numerator or denominator. Mean ratio values and 95% confidence intervals for the means are indicated.

            <p>(F) Comparison of the proportions of cells displaying SS (white), SD (black), and DD (gray) signals for an autosomal locus 
							<italic>(Fn1)</italic> and three X-chromosomal loci 
							<italic>(Mecp2, Xic, and Pgk1)</italic> in S-phase ES cells upon PFA or MeOH fixation.

        </fig>
        <p>A high frequency of SD FISH signals can be indicative of asynchronous replication of the two alleles, as singlet and doublet signals can reflect unreplicated and replicated loci respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b016">16</xref>]. However, a singlet FISH signal can also occur at a replicated locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b017">17</xref>]. To determine whether the high proportion of cells exhibiting SD signals was due to asynchronous replication, we directly measured the replication timing of X-linked sequences. ES cells were blocked in G1 and released into S phase. At hourly intervals, cells were pulsed with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label replicating DNA. BrdU-containing DNA was immunopurified from each time point and assayed by PCR for X-linked sequences. The 
					<italic>Xic</italic> and 
					<italic>Pgk1</italic> each showed a single peak of BrdU incorporation early in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Therefore, neither X-linked locus was subject to highly asynchronous DNA replication. We next performed FISH for the 
					<italic>Xic</italic> and 
					<italic>Pgk1</italic> in female ES cells sorted by DNA content. The proportion of cells exhibiting SD signals increased at the beginning of S phase, remained fairly constant throughout S phase, and decreased at the end of S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>D)
					<italic>.</italic> Taken together, these data demonstrate that even though both alleles of each of these X-chromosomal loci replicated early, SD signals persisted throughout S phase. Furthermore, they suggest that the singlets in cells exhibiting SD FISH signals are replicated alleles.
				</p>
        <p>If a singlet signal in a cell showing an SD signal pattern represents a replicated allele, then it should contain the same amount of DNA as the two pinpoints comprising the doublet signal. To test this hypothesis, we determined the relative fluorescence intensity of singlet and doublet signals for the 
					<italic>Xic</italic> and 
					<italic>Pgk1</italic>. We validated this assay on X-linked sequences in female fibroblasts, in which singlet FISH signals correspond to unreplicated loci and doublet FISH signals correspond to replicated alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b018">18</xref>]. In female mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibiting DD signals for 
					<italic>Pgk1,</italic> the distribution of D/D intensity ratios centered around 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>E), demonstrating that two replicated alleles display equal signal intensities. We next compared the intensity of the singlet to the sum of the two pinpoints in the doublet (S/D) in female MEFs exhibiting SD signals for 
					<italic>Pgk1</italic>. The S/D intensity ratios centered around 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>E), indicating that relative fluorescence intensity can be used to measure a two-fold difference in DNA content. Quantification of FISH signals can therefore be used to assay differences in DNA content at individual loci in single cells. In ES cells, the ranges of S/D intensity ratios for both the 
					<italic>Xic</italic> and 
					<italic>Pgk1</italic> were very similar to the ranges of D/D ratios: in both cases, the distributions centered approximately around 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). These results indicated that the singlet and doublet FISH signals in ES cells exhibiting an SD pattern for the 
					<italic>Xic</italic> and 
					<italic>Pgk1</italic> contained the same amount of DNA. In combination, these analyses demonstrate that the unusually high proportion of ES cells displaying SD signals for X-chromosomal loci reflects something other than asynchronous DNA replication. We refer to the high frequency of PFA-fixed cells exhibiting SD signals that are Independent of Asynchronous DNA Replication as SIAR.
				</p>
        <p>In a recent study, it was suggested that nuclear organization was important for replicated sequences to appear as singlet FISH signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b017">17</xref>]. To determine whether SIAR required an intact nucleus, we compared the proportion of ES cells exhibiting SD signals upon PFA fixation to that seen upon methanol:acetic acid (MeOH) fixation. While PFA fixation preserves the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus by cross-linking nucleic acids and proteins, MeOH fixation destroys nuclear architecture by extracting the bulk of histones and other chromatin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b019">19</xref>]. The distribution of SS, SD, and DD signals for an autosomal gene, 
					<italic>Fn1,</italic> did not differ significantly between fixation methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). In contrast, these two fixation conditions resulted in different distributions of FISH signals for the X-chromosomal loci 
					<italic>Mecp2, Pgk1,</italic> and the 
					<italic>Xic</italic>. For these loci, the proportion of cells displaying SD signals decreased while the proportion of cells exhibiting DD signals increased in MeOH-fixed samples compared to PFA-fixed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). The changes in the relative proportions of cells exhibiting SD and DD signals indicate that when nuclear structure is disrupted, some replicated X-chromosomal loci that would appear as singlets in an intact nucleus resolve into doublets. In addition, these results suggest that native chromatin structure and/or nuclear organization is necessary for some replicated alleles of X-chromosomal loci to appear as singlets.

        <p>All X-chromosomal loci examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) exhibited SIAR in female ES cells. We tested whether the singlet FISH signals for multiple loci appeared on the same chromosome or were randomly distributed between the two X chromosomes. Closely linked loci were analyzed pairwise and, among the cells that exhibited SD signals for both probes, the proportion in which singlet signals occurred on the same chromosome (concordant signals) was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

This 65% concordance is significantly higher than the 50% concordance that would be expected for a random distribution of singlet signals between chromosomes (
					<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02), indicating that the behavior of loci on each X chromosome is coordinated. One X chromosome exhibits a higher frequency of singlet signals along its length, and the other X chromosome exhibits a higher frequency of doublet signals. These results suggest that, even though X-inactivation has not yet occurred and X-linked genes are biallelically expressed, the two X chromosomes in female ES cells already differ from each other.

        <title>X Chromosomes Alternate between Two States prior to Random X-Inactivation</title>
        <p>The coordination of SIAR in wild-type ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) indicated that the two X chromosomes existed in two distinct states similar to those observed in 
					<italic>Xist</italic> and 
					<italic>Tsix</italic> mutants. We hypothesized that in cells poised for random X-inactivation, these X chromosome states might also be indicative of X chromosome fates. Two predictions arise from this hypothesis. First, each X chromosome in wild-type ES cells should exist in the future Xi state in the same proportion of cells in which that chromosome will be inactivated. Second, because the fate of each X chromosome is not yet fixed in wild-type ES cells, the state of each X chromosome must not be fixed either.
				</p>
        <p>In an ES cell line that will undergo random X-inactivation, one X chromosome should exist in the future Xi state in half of the cells in the population and the other X chromosome should exist in the future Xi state in the remaining half. By FISH, an X-linked gene should appear as a singlet on one X chromosome in 50% of SD cells and on the other X chromosome in the remaining 50%. To test this prediction, we performed allele-specific FISH in X.2/X<sup>wt</sup> ES cells, which are poised to undergo random X-inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b021">21</xref>].

					<italic>Xic</italic> on the 129 allele should appear as a singlet in approximately 62% of SD cells (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Consistent with this prediction, the singlet appeared on the 129 allele in 60% of SD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Together, analysis of ES cell lines that undergo completely random, completely nonrandom, and skewed X-inactivation suggests that there is a relationship between the state of an X chromosome in ES cells and its fate as the Xa or Xi.
				</p>
        <p>The fates of the X chromosomes are not fixed in wild-type ES cells, as a population of ES cells derived from a single progenitor cell undergoes random X-inactivation upon differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b011">11</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b024">24</xref>]. If the states of the X chromosomes in ES cells reflect their fates upon X-inactivation, the states should not be fixed in ES cells that undergo random or skewed X-inactivation. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed four clonal derivatives of the X.2/X<sup>wt</sup> ES cell line, each of which is subject to random X-inactivation (unpublished data). In each clone, the X.2 chromosome exhibited a singlet signal for 
					<italic>Ccnb3</italic> in approximately half of cells displaying SD signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Thus, each clone recapitulated the pattern observed in the parental cell line. In the two clonally derived 129-tet/
					<italic>cas</italic> ES cell lines, the 
					<italic>Xic</italic> on the 129 chromosome also appeared as a singlet in some cells exhibiting SD signals and a doublet in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Thus, the marked chromosome in each cell line, which would have existed in either the future Xa or the future Xi state in the founding cell of each clone, assumed the future Xa state in some daughter cells and the future Xi state in others. Therefore, the states of the X chromosomes cannot be fixed; rather, the two X chromosomes must switch between states in cycling ES cells.

        <p>After one X chromosome is silenced, it remains the Xi throughout all subsequent cell divisions. We analyzed differentiated cells to determine whether SIAR persists after X-inactivation is established. In MEFs, the X-chromosomal loci

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we used FISH to demonstrate that the two X chromosomes in female mouse ES cells differ prior to X-inactivation. On one X chromosome, the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> tended to appear as a singlet signal when assayed by FISH and other X-linked genes more often appeared as doublets. The second X chromosome was more likely to show the opposite pattern. In ES cell lines that are destined for nonrandom X-inactivation, the future Xi exhibited a high frequency of singlet signals for the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> and of doublet signals for other X-chromosomal loci, while the future Xa showed the opposite pattern. Taken together, these data suggest that, prior to X-inactivation, the two X chromosomes in a female cell exist in distinct future Xi and future Xa states.
			</p>
      <p>We propose that an absolute difference between the X chromosomes underlies the future Xi and future Xa states. The state of the X chromosome in turn affects the probability that a locus will appear as a singlet or doublet FISH signal. In 
				<italic>Tsix</italic>-pA/+ and Δ
				<italic>Xist</italic>/+ ES cells, where a given X chromosome will become the Xi in 100% of cells, the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> appeared as a singlet on that chromosome in 70% of SD cells. A simple explanation for this observation is that FISH reflects dynamic behavior of loci, and the future Xi and future Xa differ in their dynamics. For example, the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> may fluctuate between appearing as a singlet or doublet on both the future Xi and the future Xa, appearing more frequently as a singlet on the future Xi and more frequently as a doublet on the future Xa (
				<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). In this model, the frequency with which a locus on the future Xi or Xa appears as a singlet or doublet in the population, and not its appearance in a single cell at any given point in time, reveals the underlying state of the chromosome.
			</p>
      <p>In cell lines destined for random and completely nonrandom X-inactivation, the frequency with which a given X chromosome adopts the future Xi state correlates with the frequency with which it will be inactivated. The same relationship was observed in cell lines that will display skewed X-inactivation due to the 
				<italic>Xce</italic> effect. Thus, the 
				<italic>Xce</italic> effect is manifested prior to X-inactivation. This result is consistent with the suggestion that 
				<italic>Xce</italic> effect influences the initial assignment of X chromosome fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b026">26</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Our observation that X chromosomes adopt distinct future Xi and future Xa states suggests that X chromosomes know their fates prior to silencing. These states exist even in cell lines that will undergo random X-inactivation, raising the question of how randomness is achieved. In clonal populations of ES cells that will undergo random X-inactivation, a marked X chromosome showed a singlet signal for an X-linked gene in 50% of cells, suggesting that X chromosomes can switch states.</p>
      <p>We propose a model in which switching of X chromosomes between mutually exclusive future Xi and future Xa states is the source of the apparent randomness of X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). In each cell, one X chromosome adopts the future Xi state and the other X chromosome adopts the future Xa state. When a cell receives the cue to initiate X-inactivation, the chromosome that exists in the future Xi state in that cell will be silenced. However, as long as that cell remains pluripotent, the states of the chromosomes are not fixed and can switch in a concerted fashion. Because of this switching, the two X chromosomes each assume the future Xi state in half of the cells in a population. This randomization of states provides the basis for silencing to occur in an apparently random manner when X-inactivation is triggered. In this model, the mechanisms that determine the randomness of X-inactivation function prior to the receipt of the differentiation signal that initiates X-inactivation. In contrast, the prevailing model for randomness of X-inactivation posits that the two X chromosomes are equivalent in pluripotent cells, and that designation of which chromosome will be silenced occurs stochastically upon receipt of the signal that triggers X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g006">Figure 6</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b004">4</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b027">27</xref>]. Instead, our data support a model similar to the class of models proposed by Williams and Wu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b028">28</xref>], who speculate that a switching-based mechanism, like that regulating mating-type switching in fission yeast, may underlie the randomness of X-inactivation.

          <title>Models for Achieving Randomness in X-Inactivation</title>
          <p>(A) The data in the present study suggest a model in which the X chromosomes in pluripotent cells (m indicates maternal X chromosome, p indicates paternal X chromosome) coordinately switch between future Xa (light blue with dark blue 
						<italic>Xic</italic>) and future Xi (dark blue with light blue 
						<italic>Xic</italic>) states in cycling cells. The fates of the X chromosomes as the Xa (green with red 
						<italic>Xic</italic>) or the Xi (red with green 
						<italic>Xic</italic>) are determined by their states at the time that the cell receives the cue to initiate X-inactivation.
					</p>
          <p>(B) The prevailing model holds that the two X chromosomes in pluripotent cells (black, 
						<italic>Xic</italic> indicated in white) are equivalent until the cue that initiates X-inactivation causes differential marking of the two X chromosomes (gray cross), thus designating the Xa and the Xi.

      <p>X-chromosomal loci exhibited SD signals in a significant fraction of MeOH-fixed and of PFA-fixed ES cells. In a recent study, Gribnau et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b011">11</xref>] also observed a high frequency of SD FISH signals for X-chromosomal loci in MeOH-fixed ES cells. Based on the large fraction of cells exhibiting SD signals, it was suggested that X-linked genes are subject to asynchronous replication in ES cells. We directly assayed replication timing of two X-chromosomal loci, 
				<italic>Pgk1</italic> and the 
				<italic>Xic,</italic> in ES cells. Each exhibited a single peak of replication. Cells showing SD FISH signals for the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> or 
				<italic>Pgk1</italic> occurred at a high frequency even after both alleles of these two X-chromosomal loci had replicated. In addition, a FISH signal intensity quantification assay revealed that in individual ES cells, the singlet and doublet signals for the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> or for 
				<italic>Pgk1</italic> contained comparable amounts of DNA. Together, these data indicate that the high frequency of SD FISH signals for X-chromosomal loci in ES cells is not due to highly asynchronous DNA replication (
				<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>).
			</p>
      <p>In PFA-fixed ES cells, the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> was unusual in that it tended to exhibit a singlet FISH signal while other genes on the same X chromosome more often showed doublet signals. In contrast, the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> and adjacent genes exhibited concordant FISH signals when ES cells were fixed with MeOH (
				<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg006">Figure S6</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b011">11</xref>]. Thus, the opposite behavior of the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> was observed only in PFA-fixed ES cells. In addition, when ES cells were fixed with PFA, the future Xi showed a higher frequency of singlet signals for the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> or of doublet signals for other X-linked genes. In contrast, when ES cells were fixed with MeOH, the future Xi and future Xa showed equal probabilities of exhibiting singlet signals for the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> or other X-linked genes (
				<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg006">Figure S6</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b011">11</xref>]. PFA fixation maintains nuclear structure while MeOH extracts histones and other chromatin proteins and perturbs nuclear organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b019">19</xref>]. Therefore, the differences between PFA- and MeOH-fixed samples suggest that some aspect of chromatin structure or nuclear organization is required for replicated alleles on the future Xi and future Xa to appear as singlets with different probabilities. One possible explanation is that there is differential cohesion between sister chromatids on the two X chromosomes. Whatever the physical basis of the singlet and doublet FISH signals, they demonstrate that the X chromosomes differ prior to X-inactivation in a manner that is predictive of Xi and Xa fates.
			</p>
      <p>The 
				<italic>Xic</italic> behaved oppositely to other loci on both the future Xi and the future Xa, mirroring the opposite expression patterns of 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and most X-linked genes after X-inactivation and suggesting a correlation between the appearance of a locus by FISH and its future expression status. Azuara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b017">17</xref>] reported a correlation between FISH signal appearance and current expression status. In that study, a replicated transgene tended to exhibit a doublet FISH signal when it was expressed and a singlet FISH signal when it was silenced. In our study, the replicated allele that more often appeared as a singlet signal in ES cells was the one that would be expressed after X-inactivation is triggered by differentiation. This result suggests that organization of sequences within the nucleus of a pluripotent embryonic cell may impact their expression after differentiation.
			</p>
      <p>In wild-type ES cells, X chromosomes appear to switch between states in a concerted manner: when one X chromosome assumes the future Xi state, the other adopts the future Xa state. In heterozygous 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> mutant ES cells, it appears that the X chromosomes no longer switch between states, suggesting that these noncoding RNAs are either required for switching to occur or affect the likelihood that a chromosome will adopt the future Xi or future Xa state each time a switch occurs. The probability that a chromosome will become the Xi (or the Xa) is determined by the opposing activities of 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> on that chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b029">29</xref>]. These observations suggest that 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> influence the fates of both X chromosomes by determining how effectively each chromosome competes to adopt the future Xi (or future Xa) state prior to X-inactivation. Both 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> RNAs have been implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b032">32</xref>]. Prior to X-inactivation, these noncoding RNAs can be detected exclusively at the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> on both transcriptionally active X chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b008">8</xref>]. Perhaps 
				<italic>Xist</italic> and 
				<italic>Tsix</italic> RNA mediate changes in chromatin structure at the 
				<italic>Xic</italic> prior to X-inactivation. Such changes may in turn modulate the state of the entire X chromosome and direct its fate.
			</p>
      <p>Our data show that prior to random X-inactivation, X chromosomal loci differ in a manner that is predictive of future expression status. In addition to X-linked genes, several thousand autosomal genes are also subject to random monoallelic expression. It has been suggested that random monoallelic loci on autosomes and the X chromosome may share regulatory features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b001">1</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b033">33</xref>]. It will be interesting to determine whether a common mechanism of concerted switching between two states underlies the randomness of monoallelic expression throughout the genome.

          <title>A Dynamic Model for SIAR</title>
          <p>(A) We hypothesize that after replication, both alleles of an X-chromosomal locus fluctuate between appearing as a singlet and a doublet FISH signal, and that one allele preferentially appears as a doublet (navy), while the homologous allele preferentially appears as a singlet (aqua). Schematics show the four possible FISH signal patterns for a single locus (SS, SD or DS, DD); the approximate percentages of cells displaying each pattern for the 
						<italic>Xic</italic> are indicated. SD/DS FISH signals are subdivided into the approximate percentages in which the singlet is displayed by the aqua allele vs. the navy allele, based on allele-specific FISH in Δ
						<italic>Xist</italic>/+ and 
						<italic>Tsix</italic>–pA/+ ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Several observations are consistent with this model. First, SS, SD, and DD populations coexisted at apparent equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, fractions 3–5) until chromosome condensation at G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, fraction 6), suggesting that loci may interconvert between appearing as singlet and doublet FISH signals. Second, most X-linked loci on one X chromosome exhibited approximately 65% concordance when analyzed pair-wise, showing singlet signals for both loci on one chromosome and doublet signals for both loci on the other chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This degree of concordance can be accounted for by the independent fluctuation of linked loci, which all exhibit the same probability of appearing as a singlet along a given chromosome. Third, most loci on the future Xa in Δ
						<italic>Xist</italic>/+ and 
						<italic>Tsix</italic>–pA/+ ES cells exhibited an elevated frequency of appearing as singlet signals. However, these loci did not appear as singlets in every cell, consistent with loci fluctuating between appearing as a singlet or a doublet and spending more time as a singlet on the future Xa.
					</p>
          <p>(B) Calculation of the probabilities with which alleles on each chromosome appear as singlets or doublets in the dynamic model described above. The frequencies with which the navy and aqua alleles appear as a singlet or doublet signal are described by the terms pS and pD, where pD = 1 − pS. The table lists pS and pD values estimated from our data. We assumed that the identities of the future Xa and future Xi are fixed in Δ
						<italic>Xist</italic>/+ and 
						<italic>Tsix</italic>–pA/+ ES cells, and that for the 
						<italic>Xic</italic> locus, the navy allele (low pS, mostly doublet) occurred on the future Xa and the aqua allele (high pS, mostly singlet) occurred on the future Xi. The overall frequency of SS (approximately 20%), SD (approximately 50%), DD (approximately 30%) FISH signals in the wild-type population were considered. For the navy allele, the pS was calculated by adding the fraction of SS signals (where both the navy and aqua alleles appeared as singlets) to the fraction of SD signals in which the navy allele appeared as the singlet (as determined from the Δ
						<italic>Xist</italic>/+ and 
						<italic>Tsix</italic>–pA/+ cell lines, in which it appeared as the singlet in approximately 30% of SD signals). A similar calculation was performed for the aqua allele.
					</p>
          <p>(C) Illustration of the calculation for the frequency with which an allele fixed in the aqua state (high pS) will appear as the singlet in a cell exhibiting an SD signal at a given locus. Calculations were based on the values listed in 
						<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>B. The calculation shows that strict differences in the underlying states of the X chromosomes could result in the observed approximately 69% bias in singlet allele identity seen in heterozygous 
						<italic>Xist</italic> and 
						<italic>Tsix</italic> mutant ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).
					</p>
          <p>(D) Prediction of FISH signal concordance frequencies for two linked loci that inhabit the same state (both navy on one chromosome, both aqua on the other) and that are fluctuating independently. Even though states are strictly coordinated on each homolog under the model, the predicted frequency of concordant SD SD FISH signals is 58%, comparable to the observed frequency of 62% to 65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).
					</p>
          <p>(E) Use of the model to predict the degree of skewing in singlet allele identity in 129-tet/
						<italic>cas</italic> ES cells. The proportion of the time that the 129 
						<italic>Xic</italic> allele is expected to appear as the singlet in SD cells is calculated based on the results of 
						<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>C. The model assumes that the 129 
						<italic>Xic</italic> allele is in the aqua state in 80% of cells, and in the navy state in the remaining 20% of cells. The model predicts 62% skewing toward the 129 allele appearing as the singlet signal, which is in close agreement to the 60% skewing observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).

          <p>(A) Table summarizing data pertaining to the replication timing of the 
						<italic>Xic</italic> in ES cells and fibroblasts
					</p>
          <p>Data from the present study are represented in columns 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), 2 (upper: 
						<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g005">Figure 5</xref>C; lower: 
						<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), 3 (lower: 
						<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), 5 (
						<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>B), and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Determination of 
						<italic>Xic</italic> replication timing in fibroblasts using S-phase fractionation followed by immunopurification of BrdU-labeled material and PCR analysis (column 3, upper) was reported by Hansen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b038">38</xref>]. Column 4 indicates that fibroblasts, but not ES cells, contain a uniformly late-replicating X chromosome when assayed by immunostaining of chromosome spreads from BrdU-pulsed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b020">20</xref>,
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b039">39</xref>]. Taken together, these data indicate that the elevated frequency of SD FISH signals observed in MeOH-fixed ES cell samples does not correlate with highly asynchronous DNA replication of the 
						<italic>Xic</italic>.

          <p>(B) 
						<italic>Xic</italic> FISH signal intensity quantification as in 
						<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g001">Figure 1</xref>E for MeOH-fixed MEFs and ES cells. S/D FISH signal intensity ratios in individual nuclei displaying SD signals are plotted. The signal intensity ratio distributions are consistent with the interpretations that (1) in MEFs exhibiting an SD pattern, most singlet and doublet signals represent unreplicated and replicated alleles, respectively, and that (2) in ES cells exhibiting an SD pattern, the majority of the singlet and doublet FISH signals reflect equal amounts of DNA at the two alleles.

          <title>Coordination and Absence of Correlation with Fate in MeOH-Fixed Cells</title>
          <p>(A) Coordination of FISH signals for X-chromosomal loci in MeOH-fixed ES cells. Frequencies of concordance and discordance for specified locus pairs were scored as in 
						<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g002">Figure 2</xref>B. 
						<italic>p</italic>-Values reflect the probability that the observed distributions are random. A high 
						<italic>p</italic>-value for 
						<italic>Mecp2</italic> and the 
						<italic>Xic</italic> reflects the small sample size. As previously reported, the 
						<italic>Xic</italic> exhibited a high proportion of concordant FISH signals with the linked 
						<italic>Mecp2</italic> gene in samples fixed with MeOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b011">11</xref>], whereas in PFA-fixed samples this locus pair exhibited predominantly discordant FISH signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).
					</p>
          <p>(B) Scoring of allele-specific FISH in MeOH-fixed 
						<italic>Tsix</italic>–pA/+ ES cells. Cells displaying an SD pattern for the 
						<italic>Xic</italic> were scored for identity of the allele displaying the singlet signal as in 
						<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g003">Figure 3</xref>B. 
						<italic>p</italic>-Values reflect the probability that the observed distributions are random. This analysis supports the conclusion that in MeOH-fixed ES cells, the 
						<italic>Xic</italic> on the future Xi does not display an increased likelihood of exhibiting a singlet signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040159-b011">11</xref>], in contrast to what was seen in PFA-fixed ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040159-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).
