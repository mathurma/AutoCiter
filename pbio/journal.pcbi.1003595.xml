<abstract>
<p>In the presence of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) the model bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is able to conserve energy by aerobic respiration. Two major terminal oxidases are involved in this process - Cyo has a relatively low affinity for O<sub>2</sub> but is able to pump protons and hence is energetically efficient; Cyd has a high affinity for O<sub>2</sub> but does not pump protons. When <italic>E. coli</italic> encounters environments with different O<sub>2</sub> availabilities, the expression of the genes encoding the alternative terminal oxidases, the <italic>cydAB</italic> and <italic>cyoABCDE</italic> operons, are regulated by two O<sub>2</sub>-responsive transcription factors, ArcA (an indirect O<sub>2</sub> sensor) and FNR (a direct O<sub>2</sub> sensor). It has been suggested that O<sub>2</sub>-consumption by the terminal oxidases located at the cytoplasmic membrane significantly affects the activities of ArcA and FNR in the bacterial nucleoid. In this study, an agent-based modeling approach has been taken to spatially simulate the uptake and consumption of O<sub>2</sub> by <italic>E. coli</italic> and the consequent modulation of ArcA and FNR activities based on experimental data obtained from highly controlled chemostat cultures. The molecules of O<sub>2</sub>, transcription factors and terminal oxidases are treated as individual agents and their behaviors and interactions are imitated in a simulated 3-D <italic>E. coli</italic> cell. The model implies that there are two barriers that dampen the response of FNR to O<sub>2</sub>, i.e. consumption of O<sub>2</sub> at the membrane by the terminal oxidases and reaction of O<sub>2</sub> with cytoplasmic FNR. Analysis of FNR variants suggested that the monomer-dimer transition is the key step in FNR-mediated repression of gene expression.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The model bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has a modular electron transport chain that allows it to successfully compete in environments with differing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) availabilities. It has two well-characterized terminal oxidases, Cyd and Cyo. Cyd has a very high affinity for O<sub>2</sub>, whereas Cyo has a lower affinity, but is energetically more efficient. Expression of the genes encoding Cyd and Cyo is controlled by two O<sub>2</sub>-responsive regulators, ArcBA and FNR. However, it is not clear how O<sub>2</sub> molecules enter the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell and how the locations of the terminal oxidases and the regulators influence the system. An agent-based model is presented that simulates the interactions of O<sub>2</sub> with the regulators and the oxidases in an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell. The model suggests that O<sub>2</sub> consumption by the oxidases at the cytoplasmic membrane and by FNR in the cytoplasm protects FNR bound to DNA in the nucleoid from inactivation and that dimerization of FNR in response to O<sub>2</sub> depletion is the key step in FNR-mediated repression. Thus, the focus of the agent-based model on spatial events provides information and new insight, allowing the effects of dysregulation of system components to be explored by facile addition or removal of agents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a widely used model organism to study bacterial adaptation to environmental change. As an enteric bacterium, <italic>E. coli</italic> has to cope with an O<sub>2</sub>-starved niche in the host and an O<sub>2</sub>-rich environment when excreted. In order to exploit the energetic benefits that are conferred by aerobic respiration, <italic>E. coli</italic> has two major terminal oxidases: cytochrome <italic>bd</italic>-I (Cyd) and cytochrome <italic>boâ€²</italic> (Cyo) that are encoded by the <italic>cydAB</italic> and <italic>cyoABCDE</italic> operons, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Gennis1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Trumpower1">[2]</xref>. Cyd has a high affinity for O<sub>2</sub> and is induced at low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (micro-aerobic conditions), whereas Cyo has a relatively low affinity for O<sub>2</sub> and is predominant at high O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (aerobic conditions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Rolfe1">[3]</xref>. These two terminal oxidases contribute differentially to energy conservation because Cyo is a proton pump, whereas Cyd is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Gennis1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Trumpower1">[2]</xref>; however, the very high affinity of Cyd for O<sub>2</sub> allows the bacterium to maintain aerobic respiration at nanomolar concentrations of O<sub>2</sub>, thereby maintaining aerobic respiratory activity rather than other, less favorable, metabolic modes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-DMello1">[4]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Stolper1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The transcription factors, ArcA and FNR, regulate <italic>cydAB</italic> and <italic>cyoABCDE</italic> expression in response to O<sub>2</sub> supply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Cotter1">[7]</xref>. FNR is an iron-sulfur protein that senses O<sub>2</sub> in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Crack1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Crack2">[9]</xref>. In the absence of O<sub>2</sub> the FNR iron-sulfur cluster is stable and the protein forms dimers that are competent for site-specific DNA-binding and regulation of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Crack3">[10]</xref>. The FNR iron-sulfur cluster reacts with O<sub>2</sub> in such a way that the DNA-binding dimeric form of FNR is converted into a non-DNA-binding monomeric species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Crack3">[10]</xref>. Under anaerobic conditions, FNR acts as a global regulator in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Constantinidou1">[11]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Kang1">[13]</xref>, including the <italic>cydAB</italic> and <italic>cyoABCDE</italic> operons, which are repressed by FNR when the O<sub>2</sub> supply is restricted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Cotter1">[7]</xref>. Under aerobic conditions, repression of <italic>cydAB</italic> and <italic>cyoABCDE</italic> is relieved and Cyd and Cyo proteins are synthesized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Rolfe1">[3]</xref>. In contrast, ArcA responds to O<sub>2</sub> availability indirectly via the membrane-bound sensor ArcB. In the absence of O<sub>2</sub> ArcB responds to changes in the redox state of the electron transport chain and the presence of fermentation products by autophosphorylating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Iuchi1">[14]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Georgellis1">[16]</xref>. Phosphorylated ArcB is then able to transfer phosphate to the cytoplasmic ArcA regulator (ArcAâˆ¼P), which then undergoes oligomerization to form a tetra-phosphorylated octomer that is capable of binding at multiple sites in the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Salmon2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Liu1">[18]</xref>, including those in the promoter regions of <italic>cydAB</italic> and <italic>cyoABCDE</italic> to enhance synthesis of Cyd and inhibit production of Cyo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Cotter1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Salmon2">[17]</xref>. Because the terminal oxidases (Cyd and Cyo) consume O<sub>2</sub> at the cell membrane, a feedback loop is formed that links the activities of the oxidases to the regulatory activities of ArcA and FNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These features of the system - combining direct and indirect O<sub>2</sub> sensing with ArcAâˆ¼P and FNR repression of <italic>cyoABCDE</italic>, and ArcAâˆ¼P activation and FNR repression of <italic>cydAB</italic> - result in maximal Cyd production when the O<sub>2</sub> supply is limited (micro-aerobic conditions) and maximal Cyo content when O<sub>2</sub> is abundant (aerobic conditions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Rolfe1">[3]</xref>.</p>

<title>Components of the agent-based model.</title>
<p>The diagram shows the interactions between and locations of the components of the model. Oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) cross the cytoplasmic membrane and enter the bacterial cell where they are reduced to water (H<sub>2</sub>O) by the action of the membrane-bound terminal oxidases (Cyo and Cyd). The transcription regulator, FNR is located in the cytoplasm and is inactivated by reaction with O<sub>2</sub>. The active form of FNR represses the expression of both the <italic>cydAB</italic> and <italic>cyoABCDE</italic> operons located in the nucleoid. The ArcBA two-component system responds to O<sub>2</sub> indirectly (dashed line). The availability of O<sub>2</sub> alters the redox state of the electron transport chain and the production of fermentation products. These changes are sensed by the membrane-bound sensor ArcB, which autophosphorylates when O<sub>2</sub> is restricted. ArcB transfers phosphate to the cytoplasmic regulator ArcA, which acts to repress expression of <italic>cyoABCDE</italic> and activate expression of <italic>cydAB</italic>.</p>

<p>Although the cellular locations of the relevant genes (<italic>cydAB</italic> and <italic>cyoABCDE</italic>), the regulators (ArcBA and FNR) and the oxidases (Cyd and Cyo) are likely to be fundamentally important in the regulation of this system, the potential significance of this spatial organization has not been investigated. Therefore, a detailed agent-based model was developed to simulate the interaction between O<sub>2</sub> molecules and the electron transport chain components, Cyd and Cyo, and the regulators, FNR and ArcBA, to shed new light on individual events within local spatial regions that could prove to be important in regulating this core component of the <italic>E. coli</italic> respiratory process.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<p>The starting point for this work was the suggestion that spatial effects play an important role in controlling the response of the <italic>E. coli</italic> transcription factor FNR to changes in O<sub>2</sub> availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Rolfe2">[15]</xref>. Early work showed that when dissolved O<sub>2</sub> was detectable in the culture medium the activity of FNR decreased, exhibiting âˆ¼50% activity in the range 2â€“5 ÂµM dissolved O<sub>2</sub> and that under these conditions the external concentration of O<sub>2</sub> was equivalent to that in the bacterial cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Becker1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Marshall1">[20]</xref>. However, when the cultures were supplied with low concentrations of O<sub>2</sub> in the input gas, dissolved O<sub>2</sub> in the culture medium could not be measured conventionally, because the O<sub>2</sub> is consumed by the respiratory activity of the bacteria. Therefore, a physiological measure of O<sub>2</sub> availability (the aerobiosis scale) was adopted to investigate the effects of low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations on bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Alexeeva1">[21]</xref>. On the aerobiosis scale, the minimum O<sub>2</sub> input that results in undetectable excretion of the fermentation product acetate under carbon-limiting conditions is defined as 100% aerobiosis (100% AU). As the amount of O<sub>2</sub> supplied to cultures decreases the specific rate of acetate production (<italic>q</italic><sub>acetate</sub>) increases to a maximum under anaerobic conditions (0% AU). Between these limits (0â€“100% AU) lies the micro-aerobic range, defined by the linear decrease in <italic>q</italic><sub>acetate</sub> as the O<sub>2</sub> transfer rate increases, i.e. there is an inverse correlation between <italic>q</italic><sub>acetate</sub> and aerobiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Alexeeva1">[21]</xref>. When the O<sub>2</sub> supply exceeds the minimum required to abolish acetate excretion the AU value extends beyond 100%, reaching 217% when the culture medium is O<sub>2</sub> saturated. This physiological measurement of O<sub>2</sub> availability is reliable for cultures grown at values as low as 4% AU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Alexeeva1">[21]</xref>. In previous experiments using this approach steady-state chemostat cultures were established at fixed points on the aerobiosis scale and samples were taken for measurement of the numbers of Cyd and Cyo molecules per bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Rolfe1">[3]</xref>. In addition, Western blotting showed that the concentration of FNR in the cell was constant at 3000 protomers per bacterium across the aerobiosis scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The agent-based model was constructed to simulate interactions between three groups of agents: O<sub>2</sub> molecules, terminal oxidases, (Cyd and Cyo) and regulators (FNR and ArcBA), which interact with O<sub>2</sub> directly or indirectly. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the initial state of the model is defined in the file 0.xml, which contains information on agent properties such as Id, type, status, position etc. â€“ the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t001">Table 1</xref> was used to provide numbers of Cyd, Cyo, ArcA and FNR molecules. There is no information available on the abundance of ArcB in the cell and thus it was assumed that there are 1000 ArcB molecules per cell based on the âˆ¼10âˆ¶1 ratio of response-regulator to sensor kinase of another <italic>E. coli</italic> two-component system, PhoBR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Gao1">[22]</xref>. At the beginning of the simulation, the 0.xml file is read to establish the 3-D <italic>E. coli</italic> cell. From the initial state, the agents start moving randomly within their 3-D activity space, and interact with each other according to a set of pre-defined interaction rules and interaction radii (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t003">3</xref>), leading to an emergent state.</p>

<p>The algorithm of supplying O<sub>2</sub> to the cell responds to given AU levels and automatically calculates the rate of O<sub>2</sub> molecules supplied to the cell.

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Modeling the regulatory response to O<sub>2</sub> availability</title>
<p>The dynamics of the system were investigated by running the simulation through two cycles of transitions from 0â€“217% AU. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g003">Figure 3a</xref> shows a top view of a 3-D <italic>E. coli</italic> cell at 0% AU (steady-state anaerobic conditions). Under these conditions, the FNR molecules are present as dimers, all ArcB molecules are phosphorylated and the ArcA is octameric. The DNA binding sites for ArcA (120 in the model) and FNR (350 in the model) in the nucleoid are fully occupied. The number of ArcA sites was chosen from the data reported by Liu and De Wulf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Liu1">[18]</xref>. The model must include a mechanism for ArcAâˆ¼P to leave regulated promoters. Upon introduction of O<sub>2</sub> into anaerobic steady-state chemostat cultures âˆ¼5 min was required to inactivate ArcA-mediated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Rolfe2">[15]</xref>. In the agent-based model presented here, each iteration represents 0.2 sec. Therefore, assuming that ArcAâˆ¼P leaving the 120 DNA sites is a first order process, then t<sub>Â½</sub> is âˆ¼45 sec, which is equivalent to âˆ¼0.3% ArcAâˆ¼P leaving the DNA per iteration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t003">Table 3</xref>). The number of FNR binding sites was based on ChIP-seq and ChIP-Chip measurements, which detected âˆ¼220 FNR sites and a genome sequence analysis that predicted âˆ¼450 FNR sites; thus a mid-range value of 350 was chosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Myers1">[23]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Robison1">[25]</xref>. Interaction with O<sub>2</sub> causes FNR to dissociate from the DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t003">Table 3</xref>). Under fully aerobic conditions (217% AU) the FNR dimers are disassembled to monomers, and the different forms of ArcA coexist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). The ArcA- and FNR- DNA binding sites in the nucleoid are mostly unoccupied due to the lower concentrations of FNR dimers and ArcA octamers. Examination of the system as it transits from 0% to 217% AU showed that the DNA-bound, transcriptionally active FNR was initially protected from inactivation by consumption of O<sub>2</sub> at the cell membrane by the terminal oxidases and by reaction of O<sub>2</sub> with the iron-sulfur clusters of FNR dimers in the bacterial cytoplasm - the progress of this simulation is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003595.s006">Video S1</xref>. This new insight into the buffering of the FNR response could serve a useful biological purpose by preventing pre-mature switching off of anaerobic genes when the bacteria are exposed to low concentration O<sub>2</sub> pulses in the environment.</p>

<p>In the various niches occupied by <italic>E. coli</italic>, the bacterium can experience the full range of O<sub>2</sub> concentrations from zero, in the anaerobic regions of a host alimentary tract, to full O<sub>2</sub> saturation (âˆ¼200 ÂµM, equivalent to âˆ¼120,000 O<sub>2</sub> molecules per cell), but fully aerobic metabolism is supported when the O<sub>2</sub> supply exceeds 1,000 O<sub>2</sub> molecules per cell. The profiles of five repetitive simulations for each agent in the model are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g004">Figure 4</xref>. From iteration 1 to 5000 and iteration 15000 to 20000, O<sub>2</sub> was supplied at a constant value of âˆ¼6,500 molecules per cell such that the total number of O<sub>2</sub> molecules entering the cell increased linearly; when the O<sub>2</sub> supply was stopped (5000 to 15000 and 20000 to 30000 iterations) no more O<sub>2</sub> entered the cell and thus the number of O<sub>2</sub> molecules that had entered the cell remained unchanged during these periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g004">Figure 4a</xref>). When O<sub>2</sub> became available to the cell (from iteration 1), the sensor ArcB was de-phosphorylated and started to de-phosphorylate ArcA. Consequently, the number of ArcA octamers bound at their cognate sites in the nucleoid decreased rapidly. The ArcA tetramers and dimers produced during de-phosphorylation of the ArcA octamer were transformed to inactive (de-phosphorylated) ArcA dimers, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g004">Figure 4dâ€“f</xref>). Under aerobic conditions (iteration 5000) all the ArcA was decomposed to inactive ArcA dimers. When the O<sub>2</sub> supply was stopped (from iteration 5001), the number of inactive ArcA dimers decreased rapidly as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g004">Figure 4f</xref>, being transformed into phosphorylated ArcA dimers, tetramers and octamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g004">Figure 4câ€“e</xref>). Due to the phosphorylated ArcA dimers and tetramers combining to form ArcA octamers, their numbers dropped after initially increasing. The rate at which the ArcA octomers accumulated (ArcA activation) after O<sub>2</sub> withdrawal was slower than the rate of ArcA inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g004">Figures 4b and c</xref>). In this implementation of the modeled transition cycle, the numbers of ArcA octamers in the cytoplasm and bound to DNA did not reach that observed in the initial state before the second cycle of O<sub>2</sub> supply began, indicating that a longer period is required to return to the fermentation state.</p>

<p>The numbers of FNR dimer bound to binding sites and free FNR dimer (cytoplasmic FNR dimer) decreased when O<sub>2</sub> was supplied to the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g004">Figures 4gâ€“h</xref>), but the rate was slower than that for ArcA inactivation, consistent with O<sub>2</sub> consumption at the membrane, which can be sensed by ArcB to initiate inactivation of ArcA, but lowers the signal for inactivation of FNR. When O<sub>2</sub> was removed from the system (from iteration 5001) FNR was activated over a similar timeframe to ArcA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g004">Figures 4b and g</xref>), which was again consistent with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Rolfe2">[15]</xref>. As with ArcA, free FNR dimers and FNR monomers did not fully return to their initial states after O<sub>2</sub> supply was withdrawn in the model, indicating that further iterations are required to reach steady-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g004">Figure 4hâ€“i</xref>). These results clearly indicate that the model is self-adaptive to the changes in O<sub>2</sub> availability, and the reproducible responses prove the reliability and robustness of the model. The ArcBA system simulated in this model is based on a preliminary biological assumption, and the agent-based model presented here should prove a reliable and flexible platform for exploring the key components of the system and testing new experimental findings.</p>

<title>Model validation</title>
<p>In order to validate the model with biological measurements of FNR DNA-binding activity estimated using an FNR-dependent <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter, the ArcBA system agents were removed from the model by setting their agent numbers to zero. The ArcBA system is an indirect O<sub>2</sub> sensor and does not consume O<sub>2</sub>, hence the FNR system was not affected by withdrawing ArcBA from the model, but this simplification increased simulation speed.</p>
<p>The O<sub>2</sub> step length and other model parameters were estimated using the experimental data obtained at 31% AU. Using the estimated O<sub>2</sub> step length at 31% AU and defining the step length of O<sub>2</sub> molecule, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003595.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as 0 at 0% AU, a linear model, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003595.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was constructed to predict the step lengths of O<sub>2</sub> at other AU levels, where <italic>k</italic>â€Š=â€Š2.1 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003595.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the O<sub>2</sub> concentration at different AU levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t004">Table 4</xref>). The O<sub>2</sub> step lengths predicted by this model were used to validate the model at 85%, 115% and 217% AU, and the accuracy of the linear model was shown by the good correlation between the model and experimental data.</p>

<p>A second validation approach using two FNR variants that are compromised in their ability to undergo monomer-dimer transitions was adopted. The FNR variant FNR I151A can acquire an iron-sufur cluster in the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, but subsequent dimerization is impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Moore1">[26]</xref>. The FNR D154A variant can also acquire an iron-sulfur cluster under anaerobic conditions, but does not form monomers in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Moore1">[26]</xref>. To mimic the behavior of these two FNR variants the interaction radius for FNR dimer formation was changed in the model. Thus, the interaction distance for wild-type FNR monomers, which was initially set at 6 nm (r<sub>3</sub>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t003">Table 3</xref>) was increased to 2000 nm for the FNR D154A variant, essentially fixing the protein as a dimer, or decreased to 2.5 nm for the FNR I151A variant, making this protein predominantly monomeric under anaerobic conditions. The results of simulations run under aerobic (217% aerobiosis) and anaerobic conditions (0% aerobiosis) suggested that under aerobic conditions wild-type FNR and FNR I151A should be unable to inhibit transcription from an FNR-repressed promoter (i.e. the output from the reporter system is 100%), whereas FNR D154A should retain âˆ¼50% activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t006">Table 6</xref>). Under anaerobic conditions, wild-type FNR was predicted to exhibit maximum repressive activity (i.e. 0% reporter output), whereas FNR I151A and FNR D154A mediated slightly enhanced repression compared to the simulated aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t006">Table 6</xref>). To test the accuracy of these predictions, the ability of wild-type FNR, FNR I151A and FNR D154A to repress transcription of a synthetic FNR-regulated promoter (<italic>FFgalÎ”4</italic>) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Williams1">[27]</xref>. The choice of a synthetic FNR-repressed promoter was made to remove complications that might arise due to iron-sulfur cluster incorporation influencing the protein-protein interactions between FNR and RNA polymerase; in the reporter system chosen FNR simply occludes the promoter of the reporter gene and as such DNA-binding by FNR controls promoter activity. The experimental data obtained matched the general response of the FNR variants in the simulation, but not very precisely for FNR D154A, with the experimental data indicating more severe repression by FNR D154A under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions than predicted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t006">Table 6</xref>). This suggested that the interaction radius (r<sub>2</sub>â€Š=â€Š5 nm; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t003">Table 3</xref>), which controls the binding of FNR to its DNA target required adjustment to enhance DNA-binding of the FNR D154A variant. Therefore, the simulations were rerun after adjusting r<sub>2</sub> to 7 nm for all the FNR proteins considered here. The results of the simulations for both FNR variants now matched the experimental data well (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t006">Table 6</xref>). However, it was essential to ensure that the adjustment to r<sub>2</sub> did not significantly influence the model output for wild-type FNR. Therefore, simulations of the behaviour of wild-type FNR at 31, 85, 115 and 217% aerobiosis were repeated using the adjusted r<sub>2</sub> value of 7 nm. The model output was very similar to those obtained when r<sub>2</sub> was at the initial value of 5 nm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t007">Table 7</xref>). These analyses imply that for FNR D154A, which is essentially fixed in a dimeric state, the rate of binding to the target DNA governs transcriptional repression, but for wild-type FNR the upstream monomer-dimer transition is the primary determinant controlling the output from the reporter.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>The FNR switch has been the subject of several attempts to integrate extensive experimental data into coherent models that account for changes in FNR activity and target gene regulation in response to O<sub>2</sub> availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Rolfe2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Partridge1">[28]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Tolla2">[31]</xref>. These models have provided estimates of active and inactive FNR in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells exposed to different O<sub>2</sub> concentrations and the dynamic behavior of the FNR switch. The ability of FNR to switch rapidly between active and inactive forms is essential for it to fulfill its physiological role as a global regulator and the models are able to capture this dynamic behavior. Thus, it is thought that the â€˜futileâ€™ cycling of FNR between inactive and active forms under aerobic conditions has evolved to facilitate rapid activation of FNR upon withdrawal of O<sub>2</sub> and hence the physiological imperative for rapid activation has determined the structure of the FNR regulatory cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Tolla1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Tolla2">[31]</xref>. However, it is less clear from these approaches how the system avoids undesirable switching between active and inactive states at low O<sub>2</sub> availabilities (micro-aerobic conditions, &gt;0%â€“&lt;100% AU). To achieve rapid FNR response times it has been suggested that minimizing the range of O<sub>2</sub> concentrations that constitute a micro-aerobic environment, from the viewpoint of FNR, is advantageous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003595-Tolla2">[31]</xref>. Unlike previous models of the FNR switch, the agent-based model described here recognizes the importance of geometry and location in biology. This new approach reveals that spatial effects play a role in controlling the inactivation of FNR in low O<sub>2</sub> environments. Consumption of O<sub>2</sub> by terminal oxidases at the cytoplasmic membrane and reaction of O<sub>2</sub> with the iron-sulfur clusters of FNR in the cytoplasm present two barriers to inactivation of FNR bound to DNA in the nucleoid, thereby minimizing exposure of FNR to micro-aerobic conditions by maintaining an essentially anaerobic cytoplasm for AU values up to âˆ¼85%. It is suggested that this buffering of FNR response makes the regulatory system more robust by preventing large amplitude fluctuations in FNR activity when the bacteria are exposed to micro-aerobic conditions or experience environments in which they encounter short pulses of low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Furthermore, investigation of FNR variants with altered oligomerization properties suggested that the monomer-dimer transition, mediated by iron-sulfur cluster acquisition, is the primary regulatory step in FNR-mediated repression of gene expression. It is expected that the current model will act as a foundation for future investigations, e.g. predicting the effects of adding or removing a class of agent to identify the significant regulatory components of the system.</p>

<title>Control of agent mobility</title>
<p>In the model the individual agents (Cyd, Cyo, ArcB, ArcA, FNR and O<sub>2</sub>) are able to move and interact within the confines of their respective locations in a 3-D-cylinder representing the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell. To control the velocity of agents, the maximal distances they can move in 3-D space during one iteration (step length) were pre-defined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t004">Table 4</xref>). Thus, a step length is pre-defined in program header file (.h) and for each movement, this is multiplied by a randomly generated value within [0,1] to obtain a random moving distance, which in turn is directed towards a 3-D direction (movement vector) that was also randomly generated within defined spatial regions. An example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003595-g006">Figure 6</xref> to illustrate the movements of an O<sub>2</sub> molecule when it enters the cell.</p>

<p>Within a pre-defined limit (step length) the agent moves a random distance per iteration. For O<sub>2</sub> this is also used to imitate the diffusion along the concentration gradient according to Fick's first law, in which the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient (spatial derivative). The adjustment of step length of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t004">Table 4</xref>) affects the spatial moving speed, which is simply represented as the greater the step length, the faster the movement. The angle range was defined for O<sub>2</sub> molecules that are outside the cell to enable them move towards cell. The O<sub>2</sub> molecules inside the cell and all other molecules move in any direction within their defined spatial regions.</p>

<title>Estimating interaction radii</title>
<p>Interactions between agents depend upon the biological rules governing their properties and being in close enough proximity to react. The interaction radius of an agent encapsulates the 3-D space within which reactions occur. As the interaction radii cannot be measured, they were first estimated on the basis of known biological properties. For the radii <italic>r<sub>1â€¦4</sub></italic>, <italic>r<sub>12</sub></italic> and <italic>r<sub>13</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t003">Table 3</xref>), arbitrary values were initially set at 31% AU, and the model was then trained to match the experimental result for the number of FNR dimers at 31% AU (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t005">Table 5</xref>). The modeled output of FNR dimer number at steady-state was compared with the experimental data, and the difference suggested re-adjustment of interaction radii. The adjusted radii were then tested against the FNR dimer numbers at 85%, 115% and 217% AU (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003595-t005">Table 5</xref>) during model validation, and the results indicate that the interaction radii values are capable of describing the behavior of the system. The interaction radii of Cyd and Cyo with O<sub>2</sub> reflect their relative affinities for O<sub>2</sub> (i.e. Cyd has a high O<sub>2</sub> affinity and thus reacts more readily, 7 nm interaction radius, than Cyo, which has a lower affinity for O<sub>2</sub>, 3 nm interaction radius). As, thus far, no accurate biological data is available for ArcBA system, the radii <italic>r<sub>5â€¦11</sub></italic> were arbitrarily defined and were refined by training the model to match current biological expectations.</p>
