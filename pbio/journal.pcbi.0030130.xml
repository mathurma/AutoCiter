This fate choice is influenced by ligand–receptor-mediated activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Significant work is being done to understand the signaling proteins and pathways that control self-renewal of ESCs, and an emerging picture is that these pathways influence self-renewal in a context-dependent and temporally modulated manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b004">4</xref>]. One such pathway is the Jak/Stat3 (Janus kinase / signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b005">5</xref>]. Activation of Stat3 by phosphorylation at Tyr-705 results in induction of genetic programs that are sufficient for maintenance of self-renewal in mouse ESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b008">8</xref>]. Understanding how Stat3 activation is controlled may be useful for controlling ESC self-renewal.</p><p>Stat3 is activated by a variety of ligands from the interlukin-6 (IL-6)–type family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b009">9</xref>]. In mouse ESCs, Stat3 activation results from binding of leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) to the LIF receptor and glycoprotein-130 (GP130), forming a heterodimeric receptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b011">11</xref>]. Jak-mediated Src homology-2 (SH2)–domain phosphorylation of receptors leads to Stat3 recruitment to the receptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b012">12</xref>], and its Tyr-705 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b025">25</xref>]. This pathway is under control of three main inhibitors, protein inhibitor of activated Stat3 (PIAS3), Src-2 homology containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase (SHP2), and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3). PIAS3 and SHP2 work to reduce Stat3 availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>] and receptor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>], respectively, and SOCS3, which is under transcription control of Stat3, inactivates activated receptors by binding to GP130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b027">27</xref>]. Activation of Stat3 is therefore influenced by a variety of intrinsic pathway components as well as receptor trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b029">29</xref>]. Understanding how this signaling is controlled presents a challenge which may be best addressed by mathematical modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b030">30</xref>].</p><p>Previous attempts to model the Jak/Stat pathway have either focused on steady state responses or on capturing the transient activation profile of the pathway to understand its kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b035">35</xref>]. Examining the transient activation profile provides a larger dynamic range of signal activation, and is therefore more amenable to experimental investigation. Although several models have made predictions about the role of different signaling processes in Stat activation, little work has been done to systematically understand how different signaling events contribute to pathway control, and to experimentally validate model predictions. Furthermore, a lack of computationally feasible algorithms for assessing the importance of pathway structure on signaling behavior has prevented an examination of the signaling consequences of all possible intrapathway interactions. To address this limitation, we developed an in silico model of the Jak/Stat3 pathway to computationally screen and classify parameter interactions for their effects on the transient activation profile of Stat3. In performing this global sensitivity analysis, we were able to predict and experimentally verify novel pathway dynamics such as a receptor-concentration–dependent switch in ligand sensitivity. Moreover, this approach allowed us to group pathway interactions into stimulatory- and inhibitory-signaling modules. By focusing our computational analysis on signaling kinetics, we were able to examine the consequence of pathway structure on the kinetics of ligand desensitization. These results led to predictive control of ESC self-renewal by modulating the frequency of ligand stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Simulation of the LIF-Induced Signaling Cascade</title><p>LIF-induced activation of Jak/Stat3 pathway was modeled using mass action kinetics for the network structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

At 500 pM LIF, LIFR and GP130 receptor complexes formed stabilized dimers in less than ten minutes. Cytoplasmic levels of Stat3 decreased by 4-fold during the first 15 min of LIF addition as Stat3 became phosphorylated and localized to the nucleus, consistent with its observed kinetics in other cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b041">41</xref>]. Even at 10 pM of exogenous LIF, the steady state levels of activated Stat3 were at 60% saturation, and significant changes in SOCS3 induction were observed. Simulations predicted a rapid activation and nuclear localization of Stat3 with a peak at 20–25 min, and a time to equilibrium of 2 h.

By examining the surfaces for local minima and maxima, which represent non-monotonic effects on Stat3 activation, we found that the only parameter that provided such a response was the production rate of GP130 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The model predicted a biphasic response; a small increase in receptor expression resulted in an increase in Stat3 activation; while significant receptor overexpression attenuated activation. In silico analysis suggested that transient formation of LIFR and GP130 nonsignaling receptor heterodimers, and sequestering of LIFR by GP130 in the overexpressing cells, is responsible for the observed results, which is consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b028">28</xref>]. Removal of this ligand-independent interaction from the model eliminated the biphasic response to GP130 expression. To validate this prediction, we developed several ESC lines which overexpress the GP130 receptor to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g004">4</xref>C). As predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g004">Figure 4</xref>D), Stat3 activation increased upon an incremental GP130 overexpression but decreased at higher levels of receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). To demonstrate that the overexpressed receptors were in fact functional, we examined Stat3 activation in response to IL-6 plus sIL-6R, which signals exclusively through GP130 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>]. Cells expressing higher levels of GP130 exhibited higher levels of Stat3 activation upon IL-6 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g004">Figure 4</xref>F), confirming that the overexpressed receptors were functional. As expected from the correlation between Stat3 activation and cell fate processes, modest receptor overexpression appeared to enhance self-renewal in the absence of exogenous LIF, while greater levels of receptor expression increased differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g004">4</xref>C). In addition to demonstrating the predictive power of this model, these results provide a range of parameter variations over which Stat3 activation is monotonic (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030130-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).

However, parameter interactions have an important role in signal control and must be considered in this context. To do this, a GSA on Stat3 activation was performed for all two-parameter interactions. This approach can be used to cluster different interactions according to their impact on pathway output. Since rows corresponding to parameters group closer together if they interact similarly with other parameters, this approach allowed us to cluster groups of similarly interacting parameters. This approach provides a visual representation that is easy to interpret. The results of this analysis, presented in a clustergram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), show that it is possible to distinguish parameters that contribute to pathway activation (hatched circle) or inhibition (yellow circle), as well as to identify interesting pathway interactions. For example, simultaneously changing the nuclear export rate of Stat3 (K16, all rate constants described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030130-st001">Table S1</xref>) and the rate of docking of Stat3 on activated receptors (K7) will influence Stat3 activation more significantly than either of these parameters in isolation or in combination with any other parameters. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that nuclear phosphatase activity, inhibition of SOCS3, and Stat3 nuclear export most significantly influence Stat3 activation. These results were unaffected by how much parameters were changed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030130-sg007">Figure S7</xref>), and could be averaged over different fold-changes in parameter values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030130-sg008">Figure S8</xref>).</p><p>To experimentally validate the GSA results, chemical inhibitors were used to specifically target different pathway activation steps (reducing their corresponding rates by 5-fold) and the resultant Stat3 activation profiles were compared with model predictions. For validation, we chose to target nuclear export of Stat3 (K17) and receptor phosphorylation (K5) because of the availability of specific chemical inhibitors and the ability to directly measure the reduction in each rate constant. A CRM-1–dependent nuclear export blocker, Leptomycin-B, was used to reduce phosphorylated-Stat3 nuclear export, and a Jak-specific inhibitor was used to reduce receptor complex phosphorylation. Dose responses of the inhibitors were produced to determine the exact concentrations required to reduce the corresponding rate constants by 5-fold (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030130-sg009">Figure S9</xref>). As predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) show that a 5-fold reduction in surface complex activation by addition of Jak inhibitor will reduce levels of activated Stat3, while a 5-fold reduction in nuclear export of phospho-Stat3 increases levels of activated Stat3. If both inhibitors are used simultaneously, the upstream effect (K5) will dominate the response. We also verified two other sensitivity analysis results involving SOCS3 transcription and receptor production (K22,K29) and SOCS3 translation and receptor production (K25,K29). Model-predicted trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g005">Figure 5</xref>E) were observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g005">Figure 5</xref>F). In this case, reduction of receptor production decreased the level of Stat3 activation, and reduction of SOCS3 production led to loss of signal attenuation. Knockdown of SOCS3 using siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b042">42</xref>] verified that it is responsible for signal attenuation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030130-sg009">Figure S9</xref>). Therefore, global sensitivity analysis was used to cluster cell-signaling steps based on intrapathway interactions and identified biologically relevant control nodes of Stat3 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>In Silico Investigation of Desensitization to Ligand Stimulation</title><p>Desensitization, which is the inability to respond to ligand restimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>], may significantly limit cytokine-driven in vitro stem cell propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b043">43</xref>]. Possible mechanisms of desensitization in the Jak/Stat3 pathway include receptor downregulation, SHP2- or SOCS3-mediated signal attenuation, and differential transport kinetics of STAT3, but the relative importance of each interaction is unknown. As a first step to investigate this response, model-predicted trends of desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) were experimentally verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), and showed that a minimum time of about 3 h is required after ligand stimulation for the cells to become fully responsive to the readdition of LIF. GSA of two successive Stat3 activation profiles was used to understand what pathway components control desensitization. This method distinguishes between desensitization and inhibition, since both successive activation profiles will be changed by inhibition, but only the reactivation profile is influenced by desensitization. The relative shift of the reactivation profile of Stat3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), and the sensitivity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">Figure 6</xref>D), both showed that the decreased production of SOCS3 and a reduction of Stat3 nuclear export (together or independently) could delay the Stat3 reactivation profile. The main determinants of desensitization control, in order of importance, were SOCS3, nuclear phosphatase, and nuclear export of Stat3. Our analysis also suggested that receptor turnover rates influence desensitization.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030130-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Desensitization of ESCs to LIF Stimulation Can Be Investigated Computationally and Used to Control Self-Renewal</title><p>(A) Model-predicted trends of desensitization of Stat3 activation to LIF stimulation.

Dose responses of Stat3 activation and Oct4 expression at different LIF concentrations identified 10 pM LIF as the minimum concentration that maintains undifferentiated (Oct4+) ESC cells and does not saturate Stat3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">6</xref>F). We reasoned that small modulations of Stat3 above and below this level would reveal sensitivities to desensitization, and thus this concentration of LIF was cycled at two different periods to investigate the impact of desensitization on self-renewal of ESCs. According to our predictions, a 6-h LIF-supplementation period would provide sufficient time (3 h) for Stat3 signaling to reach a minimum and for cells to lose their “memory” of previous LIF levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">Figure 6</xref>G). In contrast, a 1-h LIF-supplementation period would result in an increased minimum level of activated Stat3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">Figure 6</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">6</xref>G) due to desensitization-mediated effects. Consequently, the 1-h LIF cycle should maintain a higher percentage of Oct4+ cells. To experimentally test this prediction, periodic LIF supplementations were performed for a total of 72 h, and the impact of these manipulations on Oct4 expression in ESCs was determined. Results indicated that although total exposure to LIF was the same between these two conditions, the percentage of Oct4+ cells was higher in the 1-h periodic LIF stimulation condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">Figure 6</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g006">6</xref>I). Therefore, the desensitization period may provide windows of opportunity for ESCs to lose memory of previous ligand concentrations and differentiate. Desensitization of the Jak/Stat3 pathway provides an example of how pathways kinetics influences ESC fate choices.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Jak/Stat3 pathway, which is required for self-renewal of mouse ESCs, was modeled using a deterministic, lumped-parameter, differential-equation–based representation of mass action kinetics. Model-predicted trends of Stat3 activation and nuclear accumulation as well as Jak activation and SOCS3 expression were verified experimentally by quantitative imaging of adherent mouse ESCs. These results provided evidence for biological relevance of model predictions, and led to further investigation of pathway control.</p><p>Transient Stat3 activation was used to understand how different signaling events influence pathway kinetics, and grouping of model parameter interactions determined the important intracellular signaling control modules. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters in isolation predicted that significant GP130 overexpression should reduce Stat3 activation. Experimental results of GP130 overexpressing cell lines confirmed predictions, showing decreased Stat3 activation with increased expression of GP130 receptors. Intact biological function of overexpressed receptors was confirmed by IL-6 stimulation of the cells. Based on model results, sequestering of LIFR by GP130 to form a nonsignaling heterodimer, which has been shown to exist transiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b012">12</xref>], can account for this behavior. Higher differentiation was observed in the highest GP130 overexpressing cell lines in the absence of LIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). This response may be attributed either to reduced Stat3 activation from endogenously produced GP130 ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b044">44</xref>] or possibly to increased activation of ERK by SHP2 through the GP130 receptors contributing to the response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b045">45</xref>].</p><p>Global sensitivity analysis of the system was performed by considering two parameter interactions; this approach covered the entire solution space of these interactions and provided a computationally feasible method to perform this analysis compared with previous attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b031">31</xref>]. Clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) demonstrated how different parameters interact to yield similar effects. It is noteworthy that sets of inhibitory and stimulatory signaling interactions appeared distributed across the signaling network. Points of sensitivity may represent important nodes of crosstalk between pathways, and nonintuitive pathway behavior could arise from the alteration of seemingly innocuous parameters. These possibilities may in part account for the observation that conserved signaling pathways affect a variety of cell processes in a cell-type and context-dependent manner. A number of other signaling pathways have recently been implicated in ESC self-renewal; this analysis provides a first step toward understanding this signaling crosstalk.</p><p>GSA results were verified experimentally by specifically targeting signaling steps for which specific inhibitors were available. The impact of a reduction in the rates of nuclear export of Stat3- and Jak-mediated receptor activation in isolation and in combination were determined experimentally and corroborated model predictions. Interaction of two targets, which clustered together in the GSA, SOCS3 induction and receptor production, was verified, demonstrating that they synergize similarly. Although this sensitivity analysis focused on Stat3 activation due to its importance to self-renewal of mouse ESCs; the same analysis could be performed for any protein in the signal transduction pathway (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030130-sg010">Figure S10</xref>). Based on GSA, nuclear export of Stat3, nuclear phosphatase activity, and inhibition by SOCS3 were the most sensitive parameters for manipulating pathway output. Although other mechanisms of desensitization, in particular receptor desensitization or differential transport kinetics between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated receptors, are possible, our investigation points out a series of possible mechanisms through which desensitization can occur. More importantly, this approach allows for determination of importance of each mechanism to desensitization. Computational investigation of the dynamics of pathway desensitization to ligand stimulation was a particularly interesting application of GSA. In agreement with previous reports, SOCS3, but neither SHP2 nor PIAS3 kinetics, could account for pathway desensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>The phenomena of desensitization is an interesting feature of the Jak-Stat signaling pathway, which lends itself to a computational approach for identifying methods of circumventing this inhibitory behavior. To do this, we predicted the effects of two different ligand-dosing frequencies on Stat3 activation and examined their consequences on ESC fate. Although both sets of conditions were exposed to the same overall amount of LIF, the conditions with the LIF cycle period of 1 h retained a higher percentage of Oct4+ cells. Therefore, knowledge of dynamic pathway behavior such as desensitization can be used to identify nonintuitive targets or cell culture manipulations to control stem cell behavior.</p><p>In summary, directing stem cell fate requires knowledge of how intracellular signaling can be controlled. To do this, we used a combined computational and experimental approach to study the kinetics of the Jak/Stat3 pathway in mouse ESCs. Although such mass action kinetics models can be improved, for example by including more detailed reaction mechanisms and interpathway interactions, this approach utilized herein provided us with an appropriate representation of the network dynamics and has allowed identification of interesting behaviors and properties of this signaling pathway. Modeling predicted novel effects of signaling (which were experimentally verified), and global sensitivity analysis led us to understand how this pathway is controlled. Based on computational predictions of desensitization kinetics, the self-renewal response of ESCs was modulated by controlling the frequency of ligand stimulation. This approach is useful for optimizing stem cell cultures by providing a ligand delivery regimen based on knowledge of intracellular signaling pathway kinetics. Our approach can be used to find key targets for control of intrapathway kinetics in stem cells. What is now required is to develop direct links between the nuclear concentration of activated Stat3 and cell fate decisions in individual cells. Ultimately, this requires insight into how cells convert graded stimuli into a threshold-based cell fate decision. Adapting the model presented herein to single cell signaling and integrating it with approaches to describe gene regulatory networks will yield a deep understanding of stem cell self-renewal.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Model development and implementation.</title><p>The Matlab software package (The Mathworks, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mathworks.com" xlink:type="simple">http://mathworks.com</ext-link>) was used for model development and implementation. Signal propagation starts with binding of LIF to its LIFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b011">11</xref>]; this is followed by recruitment of the glycoprotein 130 (GP130) receptor to form a stabilized heterodimeric receptor complex on the cell surface. Transient homodimers of LIFR and GP130 are nonsignaling in this system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b012">12</xref>]. LIF-mediated heterodimeric receptor complex formation leads to activation of receptor-associated Jaks, which phosphorylate the complementary SH2 domain of both LIFR and GP130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b025">25</xref>]. The transcription factor Stat3 then docks on the phosphorylated SH2 domains of the receptor heterodimer and is phosphorylated at Tyr705 by Jak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b023">23</xref>]. In this model, we assumed pre-association of Jak with the receptors according to literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b022">22</xref>], and we have assumed reversible kinetics as shown by double arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030130-g001">Figure 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b020">20</xref>]. Stat3 is predominantly dimeric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b019">19</xref>] and cytoplasmic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b017">17</xref>] in its unphosphorylated form, and translocates to the nucleus upon phosphorylation by using the importin machinery, in particular importin α3–5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b024">24</xref>]. In addition to ligand-mediated nuclear import of Stat3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b016">16</xref>], there is a basal level of nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling of unphosphorylated Stat3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b017">17</xref>], and dephosphorylation of phosphorylated nuclear Stat3 leads to its CRM-1 dependent nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b014">14</xref>]. We modeled these events by reversible binding of Stat3 to activated receptor complexes (rate constants K7, K8), nonreversible phosphorylation and dissociation of Stat3 from the receptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b013">13</xref>] (K9), followed by reversible nuclear translocation of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Stat3. We used a set of lumped parameters for all nuclear transport events (K13–17) where import rates are similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b038">38</xref>]; however, the export rate of phosphorylated Stat3 is lower, in accordance with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b041">41</xref>]. We optimized this profile by tuning the export rate constant of phosphorylated Stat3 based on the rise time of its activation profile as determined experimentally. Three important inhibitors of the Jak/Stat3 pathway are also implemented. SOCS3 is under transcription control of Stat3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b027">27</xref>], binds to the activated receptor complex of LIF and GP130 by binding to the Tyr974 of the GP130 receptor in the complex, and renders it inactive by removing the ability of Jak to phosphorylate Stat3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>]. Transcription control of SOCS3 by Stat3 and transport rates for the mRNA were modeled by using lumped parameters. Translated SOCS3 protein binds reversibly to the activated herterodimeric receptor complex and renders it inactive, and it dephosphorylates the receptor complex while remaining bound. The second inhibitor of the pathway, PIAS3, has been shown to be present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, to bind directly to phosphorylated Stat3, is believed not to be under the transcription control of Stat3, and removes the DNA binding ability of phospho-Stat3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>]. We modeled PIAS3 activity by two reversible binding steps in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Finally, the effect of SHP2, which is the third main inhibitor of the pathway, was captured in the dephosphorylation of the Src-Homology-2 SH-2 domain phosphorylated receptor heterodimer complexes, using rate constant (K6). This is the suggested mode of action of SHP2 in this system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b026">26</xref>]. Trafficking of the receptors GP130 and LIFR is also implemented in the model, and all surface receptors can be internalized with the same rate constant (K28), there is a fixed rate of receptor production using rate constant K29, and internalized complexes do not signal and are degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b029">29</xref>].

All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and at least 30,000 cells were imaged per data point.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Flow cytometry and receptor expression assays.</title><p>Cells were fixed after LIF addition at appropriate time points (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030130-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) using Reagent 1 containing 5.5% formaldehyde (IM2389, Immunotech, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.beckmancoulter.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.beckmancoulter.com</ext-link>) in 2% FBS Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) (14175–095-Gibco) for 15 min. Permeablization (in the case of permeablized cells) was done in Reagent 2 containing 0.1% sodium azide (IM2389, Immunotech) for 5 min, followed by incubation with the appropriate primary antibody for another 15 min. Primary antibodies that were used are listed above, and the secondary antibodies that were used are PE anti-mouse IgG1 (550083; BD Bioscience) and Goat-anti-rabbit FITC (0833; Immunotech).</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Development of GP130 overexpressing cell lines.</title><p>GP130 cDNA was provided by Kishimoto et. al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b041">41</xref>].

The cloned product was sequenced. R1 ESCs were transfected by electroporation, and stable transfectants were selected using Puromycin resistance. Five cell lines (RG1–RG5) were expanded and cell-surface GP130 overexpression was confirmed by both flow cytometry and Cellomics imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>SOCS3 siRNA construction and transfection.</title><p>siRNA transfections were performed using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (18342–012; Invitrogen). siRNA for murine SOCS3 (sense, 5′-GGAGCAAAAGGGUCAGAGGtt-3′; antisense, 5′-CCUCUGACCCUUUUGCUCCtt-3′) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030130-b042">42</xref>] was custom-manufactured (16211; Ambion, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ambion.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ambion.com</ext-link>). Transfection was performed on adherent cells in KO media without antibiotics, in a volume of 200 ul/well containing 160 ul of plating media, 1–50 pMol of siRNA, and 0.3–0.8 ul of Lipfectamine reagent. After dose response, the optimum condition was found to be 11.4 pmol of siRNA in 200 μl of plating media containing 0.4 μl of Lipfectamine, which was made according to manufacturer instructions (18342–012; Invitrogen). Cells were plated in the transfection reagent 24 h before readout.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Diagrammatic Representation of the Signal Network Structure of the Jak/Stat3 Pathway and Mathematical Representation</title><p>(78 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg002" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Flow Cytometry Results of Receptor Expression</title><p>(227 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg003" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg003" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><title>Dependency of Model Output on Initial Numbers of Proteins and Receptors</title><p>(98 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg004" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg004" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><title>Stat3 Surface Response to Parameter Changes</title><p>(2.3 MB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg005" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg005" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><title>Stat3 Activation Surfaces for Two-Parameter Interactions</title><p>(877 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg006" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg006" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S6</label><caption><title>Calculating Changes in Activation Profile of Stat3</title><p>(42 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg007" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg007" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S7</label><caption><title>Sensitivity Analysis Results Are Independent of Fold Changes in Parameters</title><p>(58 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg008" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg008" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S8</label><caption><title>Sensitivity Analysis for All Possible Parameter Changes</title><p>(117 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg009" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg009" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S9</label><caption><title>Dose Responses of Inhibitors</title><p>(37 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-sg010" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.sg010" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S10</label><caption><title>Sensitivity Analysis for Each Protein in the Pathway</title><p>(129 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030130-st001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030130.st001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Rate Constants and Parameters Used in the Mathematical Model</title><p>(211 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge technical assistance from Kento Onishi.
