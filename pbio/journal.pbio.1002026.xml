<p>Phosphorylation of histone demethylase KDM3A in response to thermal stress enables its specific recruitment to target genes by Stat1.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Histone lysine (K) residues, which are modified by methyl- and acetyl-transferases, diversely regulate RNA synthesis. Unlike the ubiquitously activating effect of histone K acetylation, the effects of histone K methylation vary with the number of methyl groups added and with the position of these groups in the histone tails. Histone K demethylases (KDMs) counteract the activity of methyl-transferases and remove methyl group(s) from specific K residues in histones. KDM3A (also known as JHDM2A or JMJD1A) is an H3K9me2/1 demethylase. KDM3A performs diverse functions via the regulation of its associated genes, which are involved in spermatogenesis, metabolism, and cell differentiation. However, the mechanism by which the activity of KDM3A is regulated is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) specifically phosphorylates KDM3A at Ser264 (p-KDM3A), which is enriched in the regulatory regions of gene loci in the human genome. p-KDM3A directly interacts with and is recruited by the transcription factor Stat1 to activate p-KDM3A target genes under heat shock conditions. The demethylation of H3K9me2 at the Stat1 binding site specifically depends on the co-expression of p-KDM3A in the heat-shocked cells. In contrast to heat shock, IFN-γ treatment does not phosphorylate KDM3A via MSK1, thereby abrogating its downstream effects. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that a KDM can be modified via phosphorylation to determine its specific binding to target genes in response to thermal stress.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Histone methylation regulates gene expression and can have drastic consequences for health if the process is defective. Histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) counteract the activity of methyl-transferases and remove methyl group(s) from histones. KDM3A is a H3K9me2/1 demethylase that performs diverse functions via the regulation of its target genes, which are involved in spermatogenesis, metabolism, and cell differentiation. However, the mechanisms underlying KDM3A regulation of specific genes at specific times are largely unknown. Here we found that a physiological stress—elevated temperature—induces KDM3A phosphorylation in human cells via the MSK1 kinase. This phosphorylated form of KDM3A directly interacts with the transcription factor Stat1, which enables Stat1 to recruit KDM3A to Stat1-binding sequences at the promoters of specific target genes. KDM3A then acts to demethylate H3K9me2/1 at these targets, thereby causing specific gene expression in response to the thermal stress. We conclude that heat shock can affect the expression of many genes in human cells via a novel activation mechanism that is centered around the phosphorylation of KDM3A.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Histone modifications, such as methylation and acetylation, regulate RNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Allfrey1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Jenuwein1">[2]</xref>. Unlike the activating impact of acetylation, the methylation of lysine residues in histones can exert either an activating or a repressive effect on genes, depending on the number of methyl groups that are added and the position of the lysine residue in the histone tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Zhang1">[3]</xref>. For example, the di- or tri-methylation of lysine (K) 9 on histone (H) 3 (H3K9me2/3), H3K27me2/3, and H4K20me3 is repressive, whereas that of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enhances the transcription of their target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Martin1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Strahl1">[6]</xref>. A major breakthrough in this field was the discovery that the methylation of histone tails is a reversible process. This discovery was based on the identification of two classes of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs), namely the FAD-dependent amine oxidase LSD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Shi1">[7]</xref> and the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain demethylases, a family of Fe<sup>2+</sup>- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent KDMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Tsukada1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Among the JmjC domain demethylases, KDM3A (also known as JHDM2A or JMJD1A) was first identified as a testis-enriched zinc finger protein that is highly expressed in male germ cells and is involved in germ cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Hoog1">[9]</xref>. KDM3A was later identified as an H3K9me2/1 demethylase that activates the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) gene via an androgen-dependent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Yamane1">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, KDM3A has been demonstrated to regulate genes that are involved in spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Okada1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Liu1">[12]</xref>, metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Tateishi1">[13]</xref>, and cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Lockman1">[14]</xref>. With such a broad functional diversity, the mechanism by which KDM3A regulates the appropriate gene(s) in vivo at the appropriate time and targets the appropriate element is of great interest.</p>
<p>Post-translational protein modification is very important for determining the function of proteins, including JmjC domain-containing proteins such as PHF8, which is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), inducing the dissociation of PHF8 from chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Liu2">[15]</xref>. PHF2 is enzymatically inactive in isolation, but PKA-phosphorylated PHF2 in complex with ARID5B displays H3K9Me2 demethylase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Baba1">[16]</xref>. PKCα–phosphorylated LSD1 forms a complex with CLOCK:BMAL1 to facilitate E-box-mediated transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Nam1">[17]</xref>. However, it is unknown whether KDM3A is phosphorylated, and the consequences of such a modification are also unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that MSK1 is activated and specifically phosphorylates KDM3A at Ser264 under heat shock. The phosphorylated KDM3A (p-KDM3A) is enriched at the regulatory regions of gene loci and co-localizes with Stat1 in the human genome. Extensive experiments indicate that p-KDM3A directly interacts with and is recruited by Stat1 to mediate chromatin remodeling and the expression of its target genes in response to heat shock.</p>

<title>KDM3A Is Phosphorylated at Ser264 by MSK1</title>
<p>Histone modifications are recognized by specific proteins, including transcription factors (TFs), thereby mediating functional signaling to affect chromatin condensation or remodeling near target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Jenuwein1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Kouzarides1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Ruthenburg1">[19]</xref>. Methylated H3K9, a repressive histone mark, must be recognized and demethylated during the initiation of gene activation. Among the identified KDMs, KDM3A was the only KDM that targeted an IFNγ-activated sequence (GAS) in heat-shocked Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s002">S1 Figure</xref>). Using an antibody against pan-phosphorylated serine (p-Ser) to detect the proteins immunoprecipitated for phosphorylated  KDM3A, we found that KDM3A was phosphorylated after 30 or 60 min of heat shock at 42°C (the treatment of cells at 42°C for 60 min is generally defined as “heat shock” or abbreviated as “HS” in this study; it should be otherwise indicated when a shorter incubation time is applied) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). This phosphorylation occurred within the first 661 aa of the N-terminus of KDM3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Analysis of mutants in which serine was substituted with alanine at 264, 265, 445, and 463 aa of KDM3A revealed that only the S264A mutant abrogated the HS-induced phosphorylation of KDM3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Next, we generated an antibody against a serine-phosphorylated peptide (cVKRK(p)SSENNG) and verified its efficacy via western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s003">S2 Figure</xref>). Phosphorylated Ser264-KDM3A (p-KDM3A) was confirmed to be specifically induced under HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>KDM3A is phosphorylated at S264 by MSK1 under HS conditions.</title>
<p>KDM3A phosphorylation was determined via co-IP and western blot assays of Jurkat cells that were treated with heat shock at 42°C (HS) for 0–60 min. (<bold>A</bold>) IP was performed on whole cell extracts (WCE) using an antibody against KDM3A or IgG (as a negative control). The antibodies that were used for western blot, including p-Ser and KDM3A, are shown on the right. (<bold>B</bold>) The truncated FLAG-KDM3A constructs were transfected into Jurkat cells, which were then treated with (+) or without HS (-). The WCE were immunoprecipitated using the FLAG antibody. The FLAG-tagged fragments of KDM3A were as follows: 1-1321 aa, 1-661 aa, and 661-1321 aa. The antibodies used for western blot are shown on the right. (<bold>C</bold>) IP assay of wild-type and at S264A, S265A, S445A, and S463A mutant FLAG-tagged KDM3A-transfected cells treated with (+) or without HS (-).

(<bold>F</bold>) p-KDM3A interacts with p-MSK1 in heat-shocked cells. Co-IP assays were performed using an anti-MSK1 antibody followed by western blot using antibodies for p-KDM3A, KDM3A, and MSK1, and those proteins that immunoprecipitated with anti-KDM3A were subjected to western blot for p-MSK1, MSK1, and KDM3A. (<bold>G and H</bold>) In vitro kinase assays. Recombinant MSK1 was incubated in purified GST-KDM3A (1-394 aa) or the corresponding S264A mutant. Then, the reaction mixtures were separated via SDS-PAGE. The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled proteins were visualized via autoradiography (central panel). Western blots were performed using antibodies against MSK1 and GST (right panel), and the level of KDM3A-GST was assessed via Coomassie staining (left panel) (G). A western blot was performed on MSK1 added to (+) WCE from cells that were transfected with wild-type or S/A mutant KDM3A(1-394). The specific antibody against p-KDM3A was used for western blot, and GST was used as the input (H).

<p>To explore the upstream kinase responsible for KDM3A phosphorylation under heat shock, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) was considered as the most likely candidate because Jil1, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of human MSK1, is activated in response to heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Jin1">[20]</xref>. Because the activation of MSK1 can be identified based on its phosphorylation at S376 (p-MSK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Vermeulen1">[21]</xref>, an antibody against p-MSK was used. An increased level of p-MSK was detected following extended incubation of the cells under HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). In co-IP assays with antibody targeting either MSK1 or KDM3A, co-IP of KDM3A and MSK1 in their phosphorylated forms was found only under HS. In contrast, the non-phosphorylated forms of MSK1 and KDM3A were unable to interact with one another under physiological condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). Furthermore, this interaction in heat-shocked cells was not affected by introducing either a dominant negative mutant of MSK1 or the S264A mutant of KDM3A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s004">S3 Figure</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed the specificity of activated MSK1 for KDM3A via an in vitro kinase assay using γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP to label the phosphorylated substrate. We demonstrated that only the GST-fused wild-type N-terminal KDM3A (1-394 aa), but not the S264A mutant (S/A), was phosphorylated by MSK1 based on <sup>32</sup>P labeling (central panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). Then, MSK1 was incubated in the two GST-fused KDM3A protein fragments as described above, resulting in the specific phosphorylation of wild-type but not mutant KDM3A in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>). Furthermore, we performed an in vitro kinase assay followed by mass spectrometric analysis to determine the specific target serine of MSK1 between the two successive serine residues at 264 and 265 aa in the synthesized KDM3A peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1I</xref>). These in vitro data demonstrated that MSK1 specifically phosphorylates S264 of KDM3A.</p>

<title>p-KDM3A Preferentially Targets Consensus Stat1-Binding Regions in the Human Genome</title>
    <p>To determine the effect of S264 phosphorylation on KDM3A, the demethylase activity of this enzyme was examined in vitro. However, no clear changes in the activity of KDM3A with or without S264 phosphorylation were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s005">S4 Figure</xref>). Then, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequence (ChIP-seq) was performed to determine the global occupancy of p-KDM3A. Chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated using an antibody against p-KDM3A from Jurkat cells subjected to HS (+) or not (-) or using a native KDM3A antibody from Jurkat cells not subjected to HS. A heat map containing more than 25,000 elements (gene promoters) was generated using seqMINER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Ye1">[22]</xref>, and the results presented in four rows based on the antibody used and the heat-shock status. These elements were separated into three clusters, consisting of 12,719 elements in cluster 1 (top), 5,304 elements in cluster 2 (middle), and 7,120 elements in cluster 3 (bottom) (right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The MetaGene profiles indicated that the reads were enriched at the transcription start site (TSS) in cluster 1 genes, whereas both the TSS and the body of the genes were enriched in those of cluster 2 (top and middle, left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We analyzed all of the significant peaks in each sequencing sample using SICER V1.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Zang1">[23]</xref>. The percentages of the peaks of p-KDM3A that occupied the 2,700-MB mappable genome were 0.49% (HS-) and 0.42% (HS+), and their distributions across the genome are shown in a pie chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s015">S1 Table</xref>). The peaks were significantly enriched in the upstream regulatory region (approximate 10-fold, all <italic>p</italic>&lt;1×10<sup>−100</sup>). By screening the differential SICER intervals near gene promoters (from −5 kb to approximately +2 kb) (FDR threshold 10<sup>−20</sup>), KDM3A and the non-treated or heat-shocked p-KDM3A target genes were identified, as shown in the Venn diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s016">S2 Table</xref>).

<title>p-KDM3A Interacts with Stat1 in Heat-Shocked Jurkat Cells</title>
<p>To determine the interaction between p-KDM3A and Stat1, we used antibodies targeting each protein to immunoprecipitate (IP) cell extracts for co-IP assays. We demonstrated that KDM3A and Stat1 interacted with one another only under HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Based on a GST pull-down assay, MSK1 initially bound and phosphorylated KDM3A in vitro, but only p-KDM3A interacted with GST-Stat1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). By introducing S/A point mutations into KDM3A, we demonstrated that KDM3A-S264A, but not KDM3A-S265A, lacked this binding between KDM3A and Stat1 under HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation of KDM3A at S264 is critical for Stat1 binding. Next, we mutated S264 of KDM3A to aspartate (S/D) to mimic the phosphorylation of KDM3A at S264 in these cells. KDM3A-S/D co-immunoprecipitated with Stat1 even without HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), suggesting that although HS induces phosphorylation of both the Y701 and S727 residues of Stat1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Zhang2">[28]</xref>, this phosphorylation was not required for Stat1 to interact with either p-KDM3A or KDM3A-S264D.</p>

<p>Then, we determined which region of Stat1 is required for its interaction with KDM3A-S264D in these cells. Among the Stat1 fragments S1, S2, S4, and S5 that interacted with KDM3A-S/D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>, top of right panel), the fragment S5 (residues 129-317, left panel) were the least required for this interaction. Based on GST pull-down assays, only the recombinant 1-394 fragment of KDM3A in its S264D form pulled down S5-Stat1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Based on co-IP assays, HA-tagged Stat1 (129-317) interacted with full length S/D-KDM3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>) and the shorter fragment S/D-KDM3A (214-306) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>), indicating that this 93-aa fragment of KDM3A interacts with Stat1. By performing another co-IP using an antibody against FLAG to detect FLAG-tagged KDM3A (214-306), we identified the 231-317 aa fragment of Stat1 was co-precipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3I</xref>); this interaction between S264D-KDM3A (214-306) and Stat1 (231-317) was further confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3J</xref>.</p>
<p>Data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3</xref> revealed that p-MSK1 only interacted with p-KDM3A under HS, and p-KDM3A interacted with Stat1 even in its non-phosphorylated form. To address the detail correlations of MSK1, KDM3A, and Stat1 in heat-shocked cells, we further showed that p-MSK1 can be co-precipitated by a 214/306aa fragment of KDM3A under HS, suggesting a likely kinase versus substrate interaction for the phosphorylation of KDM3A at S264 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s008">S7A Figure</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction of Stat1 and p-KDM3A was enhanced by extended incubation under HS, but not the interaction with p-MSK1 in the same cells and was not in the least enhanced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s008">S7B Figure</xref>). However, the fact that the 93aa fragment of p-KDM3A could be co-precipitated by a 213/317aa fragment of Stat1 under HS indicates that the phosphorylated Y701 and S727 of Stat1 were not required for its interaction with p-KDM3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g003">Fig. 3J</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest these three factors do not exist in a complex, but sequentially take parts in the two functional stages: (1) activated MSK1 interacts and phosphorylates KDM3A-S264 under HS and (2) the recruitment of p-KDM3A via Stat1 to the promoter of target gene for HS inducing activation.</p>

<p>ChIP assays were then performed to examine the occupancy of p-KDM3A in the upstream sequences, its impact on the H3K9me2 level and in chromatin remodeling of <italic>hsp90α</italic>. We demonstrated that p-KDM3A was gradually enriched near the GAS element of <italic>hsp90α</italic> over time under HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), while the level of endogenous H3K9me2 decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). This result suggests that p-KDM3A is directly involved in the demethylation of H3K9me2. Interestingly, once Stat1 was knocked down using a specific shRNA, the heat-shock-induced occupancy of p-KDM3A was abrogated in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>), moreover, KDM3A-S/D mimic was no longer occupied even without HS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s009">S8 Figure</xref>). In contrast, Stat1 binding remained following KDM3A knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s010">S9C Figure</xref>). ChIP/reChIP assays also demonstrated that p-KDM3A occupancy at the GAS element is Stat1-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). For DNase I hypersensitivity analysis, we set the sensitivity level without DNase I to 1.00 on the <italic>y</italic>-axis, representing a 100% “resistance” to this enzyme. As the amount of DNase I increased, the resistance to DNase I digestion significantly decreased in the upstream region of <italic>hsp90α</italic> in mock shRNA-transfected cells under HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>, filled bars in left panel). In contrast, the HS-mediated changes in DNase I sensitivity at the GAS element were absent from KDM3A shRNA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>, right panel). Furthermore, in non-functional KDM3A H1120Y mutant (DN-KDM3A)-transfected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Yamane1">[10]</xref>, a similar profile lacking any clear changes in HS-dependent DNase I sensitivity was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>).

<title>MSK1 Is Indispensable for the Occupancy of KDM3A, Chromatin Remodeling, and Gene Activation upon Heat Shock</title>
<p>Jil1, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of human MSK1, is activated in response to heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Jin1">[20]</xref> and phosphorylates H3 to elicit chromatin relaxation, facilitating the binding of additional regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Vermeulen1">[21]</xref>.

To further address the detailed functions of MSK1 in KDM3A, we transfected the cells with either shRNA (i-MSK1) or a dominant negative (DN) mutant of MSK1; the phosphorylation of KDM3A at S264 under HS was blocked in these cells compared to the wild-type control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5A and 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s011">S10A–C Figure</xref>).

These results indicate that MSK1 is the critical kinase that is responsible for the phosphorylation of KDM3A at S264 under HS. Then, we demonstrated that these reduced expression profiles in the presence of i-MSK1 and DN-MSK1 were based on a change in the occupancy of KDM3A at the GAS of <italic>hsp90α</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>); a high expression level of H3K9me2 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). Furthermore, using the S264A mutant of KDM3A, the MSK1-mediated occupancy of KDM3A at the GAS was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>), the expression levels of H3K9me2 remained elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5G</xref>), and HS-induced mRNA gene expression was markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5H</xref>). In contrast, using the S265A mutant of KDM3A, identical results were obtained compared to wild-type KDM3A, as shown in the respective figures.

<p>MSK1 is a major kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of histone H3, including at S10 and S28 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Sawicka1">[29]</xref>, and the phosphorylation of H3S10 facilitates the accessibility and transcriptional competence of a specific chromatin region in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Kouzarides1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Stucki1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Macdonald1">[31]</xref>. Next, we demonstrated via western blot that the expression of phosphorylated H3S10 (p-H3S10) increased in heat-shocked Jurkat cells and was inhibited by transfection with specific MSK1 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5J and 5K</xref>). A ChIP assay also verified the inhibitory effect of this shRNA on the occupancy of p-H3S10 at the GAS region under HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5L</xref>). In addition, the ChIP assay revealed that HP1α, the only HP1 isoform in the GAS region of <italic>hsp90α</italic>, is expressed at high levels preceding HS and reduced rapidly to minimal level within the first 30 min of HS treatment in Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5M and 5N</xref>). Because the expression of p-H3S10 at the GAS was accompanied by an increase in acetylation of H3K9 but not H3K14 upon HS treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Zhang2">[28]</xref>, the phosphorylation of H3S10 by MSK1 may provide an open chromatin structure to recruit p-KDM3A via Stat1, thus facilitating the binding of additional regulatory proteins. This explained why the HS-induced DNase I hypersensitivity was severely impaired by the knockdown of MSK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5O</xref>). Although the outcome elicited by MSK1 was similar with that of the KDM3A-S264A transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g005">Fig. 5I</xref>), it may indicate that a novel aspect of MSK1 functioned on human chromatin remodeling under heat shock.</p>

IFN-γ did not induce the mRNA expression of this gene, independent of the presence of KDM3A in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Unlike HS treatment, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1D and 1E</xref>, IFN-γ treatment did not induce the expression of MSK1 or activate the kinase activity of MSK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), thus preventing the specific phosphorylation of KDM3A at S264 in IFN-γ-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). These data indicate that only HS treatment activates MSK1 to phosphorylate KDM3A at S264, but this pathway is not activated in IFN-γ–treated cells.

<p>To determine the mechanism by which p-KDM3A differentially functions in cells under different treatments, we transfected the cells with mutant KDM3A-S264D to mimic the phosphorylation of the critical S264 of KDM3A. We demonstrated that KDM3A-S264D occupied the GAS element of <italic>hsp90α</italic> either with or without HS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>) and strongly reduced the H3K9me2 expression to the basal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). In contrast, <italic>hsp90α</italic>mRNA expression and DNase I hypersensitivity for the KDM3A-S264D mutant were similar to those for the wild-type enzyme under HS but not the control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6F and 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>Then, the aforementioned transfected cells were treated with IFNγ. The ectopically expressed KDM3A-S264D was efficiently recruited to the GAS region of <italic>hsp90α</italic> and the expression level of H3K9me2 was markedly reduced in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. However, wild-type and S264A mutant KDM3A did not bind to the GAS in IFNγ-treated cells and did not display any demethylase activity on H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6H and 6I</xref>). Notably, KDM3A-S264D, but not the wild-type or S/A mutant counterparts, rendered <italic>hsp90α</italic> to be susceptible to IFN-γ treatment, as that shown under HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6J</xref>, slanted line-filled bars compared to the open bars).</p>
<p>The above results indicate that in untreated Jurkat cells, the ectopic KDM3A S/D mutant occupied the GAS and decreased the H3K9me2 level, but for an unknown reason, <italic>hsp90α</italic>mRNA expression was not induced. Therefore, we transfected wild-type and S/D mutant KDM3A into Jurkat cells to examine the occupancy of the Brg1 chromatin remodeling complex at the GAS before and after HS treatment or after IFNγ treatment. The ChIP data indicated that only when KDM3A-S/D was transfected did Brg1 efficiently occupy the GAS following both HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6K</xref>) and IFNγ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g006">Fig. 6L</xref>), but this binding was never constitutive at the GAS. However, transfected KDM3A and its S/A, S/D mutants did not affect Stat1 binding at the GAS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s012">S11 Figure</xref>). This result agrees with our previous report that Brg1 is only recruited by p-Stat1 that is induced in response to HS treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Zhang2">[28]</xref>. In IFNγ-treated cells, p-Stat1 also occupied the GAS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Cheng1">[32]</xref>, possibly providing a docking site for KDM3A-S/D and activating <italic>hsp90α</italic>. Therefore, it is conceivable that Stat1-mediated p-KDM3A recruitment is necessary but not sufficient for gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Our data indicate that the level of gene activation under HS or IFN-γ treatment is determined by the potential for an external stimulus to activate MSK1, which phosphorylates KDM3A. The two-step model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g007">Fig. 7</xref> shows that, first, MSK1-phosphorylated KDM3A is recruited by Stat1 to remove the repressive mark H3K9me2, and second, p-Stat1 mediates Brg1 complex recruitment to fully activate the target gene.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>KDM3A is the second identified JmjC domain lysine demethylase (JHDM2A) that is specific for the demethylation of H3K9me2/me1. This demethylase contains a JmjC domain at 1058-1281 aa and a zinc finger domain at 662-687 aa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Yamane1">[10]</xref>. Although certain TFs can induce KDM3A expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Tateishi1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Beyer1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Wellmann1">[35]</xref> or interact with KDM3A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Okada1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Lockman1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Krieg1">[36]</xref>, our understanding of the relationship between its modification and function has not been fully elucidated since its discovery.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that KDM3A is phosphorylated at S264 by MSK1 under heat shock. Specifically, S264 of KDM3A is approximately 400 residues from the N-terminus of the zinc finger domain, which performs no known function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Yamane1">[10]</xref>. We then perform ChIP-Seq analysis to determine the genome-wide distribution of HS-induced p-KDM3A in Jurkat cells. To our surprise, ChIP-Seq data have shown that either with or without HS, the peaks of p-KDM3A could occupy the mappable genome at a comparable percentage. We then analyze the MetaGene profiles of p-KDM3A under HS, which shows the reads are enriched around the TSS at all of the five gene loci encoding the <italic>hsp90α</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and the other genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>); while those of the constitutive p-KDM3A only show much lower or minimal occupancy at these loci (the fourth versus the third rows in the bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g002">2</xref>). This finding suggests the p-KDM3As, either induced under stress (HS) or expressed in the normal life cycle of the cells, are functionally diverse through distribution to each distinct gene locus in the genome. In addition, the occupancy of p-KDM3A on Myo7B-Lims2 site is reduced under HS. The p-KDM3A in non-HS cells is likely phosphorylated by other kinase(s) or even the constitutively expressed MSK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002026-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). These kinases can be activated via specific signaling pathway(s), such as IFNα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Vermeulen1">[21]</xref>, and exhibit their own function(s) on the specific constitutively expressed genes in the cells.</p>
<p>The TF motifs from ChIP-Seq data indicate that the p-KDM3A-bound sites are similar to those of some TFs, including Stat1. The phosphorylation of S264-KDM3A is a prerequisite for its efficient interaction with the TF Stat1, and residues 231-317 in the coiled-coil domain of Stat1 interact with the p-KDM3A in vitro. We suggest that this Stat1/p-KDM3A interaction represents a TF that directs KDM3A to an appropriate upstream element of its target gene to demethylate H3K9me2.</p>
<p>Because MSK1 is activated in response to a vast array of environmental stress stimuli via the p38 or ERK pathway to phosphorylate histone and HMG proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Cargnello1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-deNadal1">[38]</xref>, MSK1 is involved in chromatin remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Vermeulen1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Soloaga1">[39]</xref>. We demonstrate that MSK1 is activated by HS but not IFNγ treatment and that p-KDM3A efficiently reduces the level of H3K9me2 at the GAS of <italic>hsp90α</italic> and renders this region susceptible to DNase I treatment.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that the p-KDM3A-mediated reduction in H3K9me2 expression is a major step of gene activation in Jurkat cells. Because no gene expresses efficiently in the presence of high level of H3K9me2 in Jurkat and Raji cells in response to either HS or IFNγ treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002026.s013">S12 Figure</xref> and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Zhang2">[28]</xref>). Hence the outcome of gene activation under HS or IFN-γ treatment is determined by the potential for the stimulus to activate MSK1 to phosphorylate KDM3A.</p>
<p>KDM3A-S264D was used in this study to mimic the function of phosphorylated KDM3A-S264 in vivo. We demonstrate that this S264D mutant directly interacts with Stat1 to occupy the GAS element regardless of heat shock. Although the KDM3A-S264D mutant constitutively binds to the GAS element, H3K9me2 remains at a basal level under IFN-γ treatment, similar to the results under HS treatment; in contrast, non-phosphorylated KDM3A does not interact with Stat1, is not recruited to the GAS element, and does not reduce the level of H3K9me2 when exposed to IFN-γ.</p>
<p>H1120 in the JmjC domain is indispensable for the demethylase activity of KDM3A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Yamane1">[10]</xref>. However, the phosphorylation of KDM3A-S264 exerts the same effects, including H3K9me2 reduction and DNase I hypersensitivity at Stat1 target genes. Therefore, it is logical to propose that the Stat1-mediated recruitment of the p-KDM3A represents a specific pathway by which the demethylase activity of KDM3A is regulated under heat shock.</p>
<p>In summary, heat shock is a physical stimulus that broadly affects the expression of a variety of genes in human cells, likely in a general manner. In addition to the activation of the well-accepted heat shock factor and heat shock element (HSF/HSE) pathways to induce expression of heat-shock-related genes, we present a novel, generalized heat-shock-induced activation mechanism that is centered on the phosphorylation of KDM3A. (1) p-KDM3A-S264 is enriched genome-wide at the promoter region of several genes, including heat-shock-related genes, under heat shock; (2) p-KDM3A is guided by a TF to the binding element of TF in the genome; (3) the genomic occupancy of p-KDM3A at its target genes is a prerequisite for the demethylase activity of KDM3A in situ; and (4) the phosphorylation of KDM3A is specifically dependent on the upstream stimulus-dependent kinase activity of MSK1 in HS- but not IFN-γ-treated Jurkat  cells.</p>

<p>To identify the genome sites with more p-KDM3A after heat shock, we used the p-KDM3A HS (+) MACS interval peaks in Active Regions (in locations where only one sample had an interval, which defines the Active Region) to perform a sample comparison with peak metrics against the p-KDM3A HS (−). The unique intervals were annotated into genes (between 10 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream). The GO analysis of these genes was described above.</p>
<p>Transcription factor motifs were identified around p-KDM3A SICER islands (FA files) after heat shock using MEME (version 4.9.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002026-Machanick1">[45]</xref>. The database JASPAR_CORE_2014_vertebrates was used.</p>
