<abstract>
<p>Activation of the amino acid starvation response (AAR) increases lifespan and acute stress resistance as well as regulates inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of AAR pharmacologically by Halofuginone (HF) significantly inhibits production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and provides protection from intestinal inflammation in mice. HF inhibits IL-1β through general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2)–dependent activation of the cytoprotective integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, resulting in rerouting of IL-1β mRNA from translationally active polysomes to inactive ribocluster complexes—such as stress granules (SGs)—via recruitment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) T cell–restricted intracellular antigen-1(TIA-1)/TIA-1–related (TIAR), which are further cleared through induction of autophagy. GCN2 ablation resulted in reduced autophagy and SG formation, which is inversely correlated with IL-1β production. Furthermore, HF diminishes inflammasome activation through suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which IL-1β is regulated by AAR and further suggests that administration of HF might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Reduced intake of food (also known as dietary restriction) without malnutrition has been shown to benefit health in humans and animals, including an increase in life expectancy, metabolic fitness, and resistance to acute stress. Recent studies have attributed the benefits associated with dietary restriction to the reduced intake of amino acids. However, the underlying mechanisms through which amino acid restriction regulates various homeostatic processes are poorly defined. Here, we show that activation of amino acid starvation response (AAR) by the small molecule Halofuginone (HF) results in a significant inhibition of production of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), a proinflammatory mediator. We find that AAR provides protection from intestinal inflammation–associated pathology in a mouse model of colitis through a novel mechanism involving the formation of riboclusters (groups of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and stalled mRNA complexes) and autophagy. We further show that HF-mediated inhibition in IL-1β production is dependent on general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2), an amino acid deprivation sensor. This study provides the mechanisms regulating AAR-induced benefits in the context of inflammation and further suggests that the administration of HF might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases in mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dietary amino acid restriction, without malnutrition, offers enormous health benefits, including longevity of lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref001">1</xref>], acute stress resistance, increased insulin sensitivity, and modulation of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref003">3</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanisms through which amino acid restriction extends its beneficial effects remain poorly defined. General control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2) is a well-known metabolic sensor, which senses amino acid starvation conditions and programs protein synthesis through activation of the homeostatic integrated stress response (ISR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref004">4</xref>]. The ISR is an evolutionarily conserved homeostatic process that enables mammalian cells to sense, adapt, and appropriately respond to a wide variety of extracellular and intracellular stress signals. Four distinct eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) kinases—including GCN2, RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), protein kinase R (PKR), and heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (HRI)—mediate the ISR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref005">5</xref>]. GCN2 senses amino acid insufficiency, PERK is activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress, PKR senses viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and HRI senses heme deprivation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Depletion of intracellular amino acids results in the accumulation of uncharged transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that bind to GCN2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref006">6</xref>], leading to a conformational change and kinase activation. Phosphorylated GCN2, in turn, triggers inhibitory phosphorylation of eIF2α, a crucial eukaryotic translation initiation factor, resulting in impaired assembly of eIF2-guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-tRNA<sup>Met</sup> and polysome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref005">5</xref>]. This represses translational initiation and protein synthesis in cells to economize energy and adapt to the conditions of amino acid starvation. GCN2-mediated translational blockade results in the accumulation of translationally silenced mRNAs, which further undergo various post-transcriptional reprogramming (PTR) via recruitment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), leading to the formation of RBP–RNA complexes known as “riboclusters” such as stress granules (SGs). In SGs, the RBP–RNA composition determines the fate of mRNAs translatability, decay, or its storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to GCN2, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase, directly senses amino acid availability in the cytosol via an unknown mechanism. mTOR orchestrates anabolic processes such as fatty acid synthesis and cell growth by integrating the supply of energy, nutrients, and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref008">8</xref>]. Pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling also increases lifespan, suggesting cross-talk between GCN2 and mTOR signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref008">8</xref>]. Halofuginone (HF), a mimetic of the amino acid starvation response (AAR), is a small molecule derived from the plant alkaloid febrifugine, extracted from the herb <italic>Dichroa febrifuga</italic>, and has gained significant attention for its therapeutic value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref009">9</xref>]. In mammals, HF has displayed therapeutic promise for conditions such as muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref010">10</xref>], hepatic fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref011">11</xref>], and cancer, by inhibiting tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref013">13</xref>]. HF has also been shown to protect mice from ischemia-reperfusion–induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref002">2</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that HF acts by inhibiting the prolyl-tRNA synthetase activity of glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref014">14</xref>]. HF actively competes with proline for the active site of prolyl-tRNA synthetase, resulting in the accumulation of uncharged tRNA<sup>pro</sup>. This mimicks conditions of cellular proline deficiency, which in turn triggers simultaneous activation of the GCN2–AAR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, system-wide analysis of immunological responses to yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D) identified gene signatures encompassing GCN2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref015">15</xref>], which plays a critical role in programming YF-17D–induced T-cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref016">16</xref>]. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that HF-mediated activation of the GCN2–AAR pathway inhibits T helper 17 cell (Th17) responses and protects mice from Th17-associated pathologies in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref017">17</xref>]. Also, GCN2 has recently been shown to play a central role in controlling intestinal inflammation through the inhibition of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), a key proinflammatory mediator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref004">4</xref>]. While the connections between the GCN2 and AAR pathways controlling immune responses is evident, the mechanism underlying its association with regulation of IL-1β and other inflammatory mediators remains poorly understood. The production of IL-1β includes the processing of inactive IL-1β precursor protein (31 kDa) into the bioactive or mature IL-1β (17 kDa) and release through K<sup>+</sup> efflux-dependent mechanisms, which can be triggered by ATP, a known inducer of potassium efflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref018">18</xref>]. Processing of active IL-1β is largely dependent on caspase-1 activation triggered by inflammasome activation following toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Here, we show that HF dampens endotoxin-induced IL-1β production in macrophages by a novel mechanism of PTR and translation reprogramming. HF-elicited PTR events resulted in the repositioning of IL-1β mRNA transcripts from polysomes to riboclusters, such as SGs, in a GCN2-dependent manner. Also, IL-1β mRNAs targeted to SGs are further cleared through the induction of autophagy. HF impaired the processing and secretion of mature IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages by controlling the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammasome activation. Furthermore, HF protected mice from dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)–induced intestinal inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight a crucial role for the GCN2–AAR pathway in the regulation of IL-1β production and unveil a novel mechanism through which AAR modulates inflammatory responses.</p>

<title>HF ameliorates LPS-induced IL-1β production in macrophages by affecting mRNA stability and processing of mature IL-1β</title>
<p>Recent studies have shown that HF exerts its therapeutic benefits through inhibition of Th17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref017">17</xref>]; however, its role in controlling innate inflammatory responses is not yet clear. To investigate the immunomodulatory function of HF, LPS-primed bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) were treated with nontoxic concentrations of HF for different time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We observed a substantial reduction of IL-1β in a dose- and time-dependent manner by HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>), while tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) showed a decrease, and there was no suppressive effect on IL-6 during HF treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>). HF treatment inhibited IL-1β production in peritoneal as well as transformed macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s002">S2D and S2E Fig</xref>). By contrast, treatment of LPS-primed macrophages with MAZ1310, an inactive derivative of HF, did not show any effect on IL-1β production, indicating that the observed effects are specific to HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Next, we assessed the effect of HF on damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)-induced IL-1β production. HF substantially impaired IL-1β production in macrophages treated with inflammasome activators such as aluminum hydroxide (ALU) or monosodium urate (MSU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Apart from its effects on model TLR ligand (which represent less complex stimuli than bacteria or viruses)–induced IL-1β, HF also inhibited IL-1β production by BMDMs infected with <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Next, we examined the effect of HF on IL-1β processing and secretion. Results in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) show that HF substantially reduces mature IL-1β induced by LPS plus ATP, as well as cleaved caspase-1, in the supernatant of treated cells. These results indicate that HF affects IL-1β production by interfering with inflammasome activation.</p>

<p>Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes activated during microbial infection or stress, and they elicit caspase-1 activation and the processing of IL-1β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref019">19</xref>]. Although the mechanisms underlying inflammasome activation are still unclear, one of the proposed models suggests that cellular ROS play a pivotal role in the inflammasome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref020">20</xref>]. Although the source of ROS is still unclear, studies suggest an association with NADPH oxidase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref021">21</xref>]. We therefore examined the effect of HF on ROS production by stimulating BMDMs with LPS for 3h, followed by HF treatment. We found a significant reduction of ROS levels in LPS plus HF–stimulated macrophages compared to LPS alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), suggesting that HF may limit IL-1β secretion through the suppression of the ROS generation as well.</p>
<p>TLR family members TLR2 and TLR4 recognize bacterial components and play a crucial role in the antibacterial response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref022">22</xref>], and our results suggest that inhibition of IL-1β by HF is pronounced when triggered by a TLR4 ligand compared to TLR2 ligands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). Concomitantly, HF did not show much effect on IL-1β in the macrophages primed with viral nucleotide-sensing TLR ligands TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7. HF dramatically decreased pro–IL-1β levels in the cell lysates, whereas the pro–caspase-1 levels were not affected by HF in LPS- and LPS plus HF–stimulated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s002">S2G Fig</xref>), indicating that HF affects IL-1β not only at the level of processing but also at the level of expression of pro–IL-1β. To examine the mechanism by which pro–IL-1β is reduced by HF, we examined the effect of HF on mRNA for IL-1β and other cytokines by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The results revealed a significant decrease in the levels of mature IL-1β and IL-18 mRNA compared to other cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s003">S3A Fig</xref>); however, pre–IL-1β mRNA was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). These data suggest that the effect of HF on IL-1β mRNA might not be at the transcriptional level. We next speculated that HF might target IL-1β partly through modulation of transcriptional/PTR events. To investigate whether HF-induced inhibition of IL-1β mRNA is a result of PTR, BMDMs were treated with LPS for 2 h, followed by treatment with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin-D (Act-D) for 2h before the addition of HF. Surprisingly, we observed a remarkable reduction in IL-1β mRNA transcripts in LPS plus HF–stimulated macrophages compared to LPS alone in Act-D–primed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). HF also inhibited IL-1β mRNA when IL-1β was constitutively expressed in human embryonic kidney cells 293T (HEK293T) by transfection of an IL-1β–expressing plasmid driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter independent of TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Translational control of IL-1β by HF was further confirmed by inhibiting translation in BMDMs with cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor, prior to LPS and HF treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that HF controls IL-1β production by affecting inflammasome activation and triggering of PTR events without significant effect on transcriptional reprogramming.</p>

<title>HF attenuates LPS-induced IL-1β production through GCN2-dependent activation of riboclustering, such as SG formation</title>
<p>Post-transcriptional control of cytokines and other immune effector mRNAs ensures rapid temporal or spatial changes in protein expression in response to changing environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref023">23</xref>], mediated by sensors such as GCN2, PERK, PKR, and HRI, which sense particular stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref005">5</xref>]. GCN2 senses amino acid deprivation and triggers activation of the ISR pathway, which in turn programs translatability and/or decay of mRNAs as per cellular requirements through riboclustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref007">7</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that HF-induced biological activities are attributed to the activation of the AAR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, we next studied the role of the GCN2–AAR pathways in the ability of HF to regulate IL-1β. We observed elevated phosphorylation of GCN2 and eIF2-α in macrophages with increasing concentrations of HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), which is in agreement with earlier studies performed on T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref017">17</xref>], fibroblasts, and epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref024">24</xref>]. Concomitantly, the formation of punctate SGs increased with HF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In addition, GCN2<sup>−/−</sup>mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) showed impaired ability to form SGs during HF treatment compared to wild-type (WT) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>), suggesting that HF-induced SG formation is GCN2 dependent. To elucidate the role of GCN2 in HF-induced negative regulation of IL-1β production, BMDMs isolated from WT or GCN2<sup>−/−</sup> mice were primed with LPS followed by HF treatment. While LPS plus ATP treatment enhanced IL-1β production in GCN2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDMs when compared to WT cells, HF only suppressed IL-1β production in WT but not in GCN2<sup>−/−</sup>macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). On the otherhand, HF modestly decreased LPS-induced TNF-α in WT cells, and HF did not affect LPS-induced TNF-α levels in GCN2<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Similar results were observed in levels of pro and active IL-1β protein as well as mature IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA in macrophages with transiently silenced GCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g002">Fig 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s005">S5A, S5B and S5C Fig</xref>).The observed effects of HF were specific to GCN2 because PKR-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of PKR—another eIF2 kinase—did not affect HF’s ability to reduce IL-1β production, indicating a PKR-independent effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). HF induces serine 51 (Ser51) phosphorylation of eIF2-α via GCN2, and so we examined the effect of eIF2-α on IL-1β by silencing eIF2-α in macrophages. We found that HF significantly suppressed IL-1β production only in control cells, while no significant inhibition was observed in eIF2-silenced macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that HF limits IL-1β production by activating the GCN2–eIF2-α axis.</p>

<title>HF promotes IL-1β mRNA degradation by targeting them to SGs through recruitment of TIA-1/TIAR</title>
<p>Having observed that HF induces SG formation, we next studied the mechanisms involved by monitoring the expression pattern of the SG proteins TIA-1/TIAR. TIA-1/TIAR are RBPs involved in the regulation of mRNA transcripts. HF alone induces expression of TIA-1/TIAR in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). A similar increase was observed in LPS plus HF–or HF only–stimulated macrophages, while LPS alone shows no effect on TIA-1/TIAR levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s005">S5E Fig</xref>). To elucidate whether HF-induced TIA-1/TIAR plays a role in the suppression of IL-1β expression, we silenced the expression of TIA-1 or TIAR in macrophages using smart pool TIA-1 or TIAR siRNAs. These cells were then primed with LPS followed by treatment with HF. We observed an enhancement of IL-1β production both at the protein and mRNA levels in TIA-1/TIAR–silenced macrophages in response to LPS stimulation, and HF-induced suppression of IL-1β production is reduced in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s005">S5F and S5G Fig</xref>). Conversely, we overexpressed TIA-1/TIAR along with the IL-1β in HEK293T cells, driven by heterologous promoters, and examined IL-1β protein expression by immunoblotting. We detected reduced IL-1β expression in the lysates of HEK293T cells overexpressing TIA-1/TIAR compared to vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). These data strongly suggest that TIA-1/TIAR play a significant role in the regulation of IL-1β expression. Furthermore, we studied whether eIF2-α signaling plays any significant role in controlling the expression levels of TIA-1/TIAR. Our results suggest eIF2-α–dependent expression of TIA-1/TIAR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s005">S5H Fig</xref>). IL-1β mRNA bear ARE sequences in the 3’UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref007">7</xref>], which tempted us to speculate that IL-1β mRNA might recruit RBPs—including TIA-1/TIAR—through these ARE sequences and lead to SG formation during GCN2-eIF2 activation. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated macrophages with LPS or LPS plus HF and prepared cell lysates for RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) using TIA-1/TIAR antibodies or immunoglobulin G (IgG) control. Using both by qRT-PCR and RT-PCR analysis, we found that TIA-1/TIAR pull-downs were associated with IL-1β and TNF-α—but not caspase-1 and IL-6 transcripts—in the LPS plus HF–treated groups but not the LPS-alone groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Control IgG failed to pull down IL-1β transcripts in both LPS- and LPS plus HF–stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, nontarget β-actin was amplified to the same extent in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), indicating the presence of equal amounts of nonspecific contaminating mRNAs in both the immunoprecipitation (IP) material as observed in the earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref025">25</xref>]. Because we noticed that HF induced a significant increase in IL-1β transcripts in the RIP material, we examined its impact on pro–IL-1β expression in the cell lysates. Our results show a substantial decrease in pro–IL-1β expression in LPS plus HF–treated compared to LPS alone–treated cells, whereas pro–caspase-1 levels were comparable in both LPS- and LPS plus HF–treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Furthermore, when RIP was performed using TIA-1/TIAR antibodies in LPS-primed macrophages treated with different concentrations of HF, we observed a proportionate increase in IL-1β transcripts coprecipitating in a HF-dose–dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Because TIA-1/TIAR bind to ARE sequences found at the 3’UTRs of mRNAs and regulate their expression, we reasoned that IL-1β mRNA carrying a mutation in 3’UTR ARE elements might not be affected by TIA-1/TIAR. To test this speculation, we overexpressed IL-1β mRNAs carrying WT (no mutation in AREs of 3’UTR) or ARE mutation (Δ3’UTR) in HEK293T cells using a heterologous promoter (CMV), along with TIA-1/TIAR, and assessed the expression of IL-1β mRNA. We found that TIA-1/TIAR overexpression reduced IL-1β mRNA (as detected by qRT-PCR) only in cells expressing WT plasmid but not in the cells expressing the ARE-deleted plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that HF triggers riboclustering through recruitment of TIA-1/TIAR proteins to the ARE sequences in the IL-1β mRNA and facilitates its movement to cytoplasmic caches of SGs for degradation.</p>

<title>IL-1β targeted to SGs are degraded by autophagy during HF treatment</title>
<p>Recent studies have shown that mice deficient in autophagy proteins, autophagy-related 16-like 1 (Atg16L1) or autophagy related protein 7 (Atg7) are prone to enhanced IL-1β production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref026">26</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that SGs are cleared by autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref027">27</xref>]. Therefore, we examined the status of autophagy during HF stimulation by monitoring autophagy marker, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3). We found that autophagy vesicles (revealed by LC3 punctate staining) were enhanced at 6 and 12 h of HF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of conversion of LC3-I to a membrane-bound form, LC3-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref028">28</xref>], in the cell lysates by immunoblotting revealed an increase in the conversion and accumulation of LC3-II in response to HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s008">S8A Fig</xref>).

<p>Next, we assessed the autophagy flux by monitoring the levels of LC3-II and sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1; a well-known autophagy substrate) in the presence or absence of autophagy inhibitors chloroquine (CQ) or Bafilomycin A1. LPS is known to induce expression of p62 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref029">29</xref>], and we found that there was a dramatic reduction of p62 in macrophages treated with LPS plus HF plus ATP compared to cells treated with LPS plus ATP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). This effect of HF on p62 levels was inhibited by Bafilomycin A1 in LPS plus HF–treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that p62 and LC3-II are degraded by autophagy during long-term starvation, i.e., from 2 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref031">31</xref>]. CQ or Bafilomycin A1 strongly inhibited basal autophagy, marked by the accumulation of LC3 and p62, and HF treatment caused a decrease in p62 and LC3-II levels in the presence of CQ (possibly due to activation of autophago-lysosomal degradation), but not in Bafilomycin A1–treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s008">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>), suggesting that Bafilomycin A1 exhibits more lysosomal inhibitory effect than CQ, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref031">31</xref>]. However, levels of LC3-II are still higher during HF treatment in the presence of CQ compared to cells treated with HF in the absence of CQ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). Together, these data clearly indicate that HF triggers autophagy flux. Furthermore, similar to amino acid starvation–induced p62 mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref032">32</xref>], HF caused up-regulation of p62 expression, which is dependent on GCN2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s008">S8C and S8D Fig</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that HF triggers induction of autophagic processes. We next examined whether autophagy has any effect on expression of SG proteins TIA-1/TIAR in macrophages treated with LPS plus HF. Our results show that LPS plus HF in presence of Bafilomycin A1 induces the accumulation of TIA-1/TIAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Furthermore, TIA-1/TIAR colocalizes with autophagy marker LC3 as revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). Together, these results indicate that autophagy mediates the clearance of SGs.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether manipulation of autophagy had any effect on HF-induced suppression of IL-1β expression in LPS-primed macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by using phosphotidyl inositol 3 kinase inhibitors 3-methyl adenine (3-MA) or Wortmannin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref034">34</xref>], lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1, or knockdown of autophagy gene ATG16L1 in macrophages resulted in elevated levels of IL-1β in LPS plus HF–stimulated cells compared to their controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g004">Fig 4G–4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). These results suggest that HF-induced autophagy plays a significant role in the suppression of IL-1β. To explore the mechanism, IL-1β was overexpressed using a heterologous promoter in HEK293T cells alone, or along with plasmids expressing TIA-1 and TIAR. Following transfection, cells were treated with autophagy inhibitor (Bafilomycin A1) or activator (rapamycin) and levels of IL-1β mRNA were monitored. We observed a significant reduction in IL-1β expression in TIA-1/TIAR–overexpressing cells—which was further decreased by rapamycin treatment—whereas Bafilomycin A1 reversed the inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g004">Fig 4J and 4K</xref>). RIP also revealed an increase in IL-1β mRNA association with TIA-1/TIAR under the conditions of inhibition of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g004">Fig 4L</xref>). Recent studies have shown that activation of autophagy decreases mitochondria-derived oxidative stress (a potent inflammasome activator) by clearing damaged mitochondria, thereby affecting IL-1β levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref029">29</xref>]. We therefore measured the levels of mitochondrial ROS using MitoSOX in LPS-primed macrophages during HF or control MAZ1310 treatment. HF significantly inhibited MitoSOX production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s009">S9C and S9D Fig</xref>). Together, these data suggest that HF-induced autophagy triggers IL-1β suppression via degradation of IL-1β mRNA transcripts bound to SG components, TIA-1/TIAR, and by reducing inflammasome activation signals.</p>

<title>HF-mediated activation of autophagy is dependent on GCN2</title>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated a link between AAR and autophagy in yeast and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref035">35</xref>]. The above results support the previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref017">17</xref>], showing that AAR mimetics such as HF act through the activation of GCN2. However, the link between HF-induced autophagy and GCN2 remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the conversion of LC3 in GCN2<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs treated with varying concentrations of HF as well as in lysates of GCN2-silenced macrophages during HF treatment. We observed a dose-dependent increase in LC3-I to LC3-II conversion in the WT MEFs treated with HF, but not in GCN2<sup>−/−</sup>MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<title>HF mitigates the severity of DSS-induced colitis in mice</title>
<p>Anomalous expression of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, has been shown to be associated with colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref037">37</xref>]. Furthermore, transcriptome meta-analysis performed on publicly available microarray datasets (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO], Array Express) from samples of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients reveals that GCN2 was significantly down-regulated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), whereas it was up-regulated in colon tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s010">S10A–S10C Fig</xref>). Given our findings that HF inhibits IL-1β, we therefore investigated the therapeutic potential of HF in a murine model of DSS-induced colitis. We induced colitis in C57BL/6J mice by oral administration of 5% DSS in drinking water and found that daily intraperitoneal injections of HF (0.2 mg/kg) prevented the loss of body weight observed in the absence of HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Levels of IL-1β in the serum and the colonic tissues of DSS plus HF–treated mice were markedly reduced compared to the DSS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g006">Fig 6B, 6G and 6H</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Amino acid restriction is associated with enormous health benefits, including longevity of lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref038">38</xref>], acute stress resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref039">39</xref>], increased insulin sensitivity, and modulation of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref003">3</xref>] in yeast to nonhuman primates. However, the clinical benefits of amino acid restriction to humans has yet to be achieved. Our study has established that pharmacological activation of AAR with a plant-derived small biomolecule HF modulates innate inflammatory responses by activating the homeostatic ISR pathway. Our findings demonstrate that HF-induced cytoprotective AAR is dependent on GCN2 because HF failed to trigger AAR in GCN2-ablated cells. The HF-induced AAR pathway triggers a significant reduction in LPS-induced IL-1β, with little inhibitory effect on another inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and no effect on IL-6. Although HF has been previously shown to activate GCN2 kinase, the molecular basis by which it controls IL-1β and other inflammatory mediators has been poorly understood. Our study has revealed the mechanisms by which HF suppresses IL-1β expression in response to LPS.</p>
<p>IL-1β is a potent inflammatory cytokine with diverse cellular and physiological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref040">40</xref>] and as such, requires stringent regulatory mechanisms to control its expression and secretion. IL-1β is translated as an inactive 31 kD precursor protein (pro–IL-1β) in response to TLR4 stimulation, which is further cleaved into mature bioactive IL-1β (p17) by caspase-1, triggered by inflammasome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref041">41</xref>]. Our study shows that HF impairs processing of mature IL-1β by reducing inflammasome activation, which could be partly attributed to reduced ROS production. We further show that HF reduces mature IL-1β transcripts, but not its transcription. These findings suggest that HF inhibits IL-1β production by programming PTR/translational events. It is notable that dexamethasone was recently reported to inhibit IL-1β production by programming PTR events, without much effect on transcriptional machinery function, similar to what we find for HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref042">42</xref>]. Various studies have reported that IL-1β plays a crucial role in the commitment of Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref004">4</xref>], and it was recently demonstrated that HF inhibits the Th17 response and protects mice from EAE-associated inflammation through the activation of the GCN2–AAR pathway in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref017">17</xref>]. However, how HF controls innate regulation of Th17 cell responses remained elusive. Our findings suggest that HF likely determines the effector commitment of Th17 cells in part by also inhibiting IL-1β production through programming PTR/translational events. In line with the above studies, it was recently shown that the AAR sensor GCN2 plays a pivotal role in controlling intestinal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref004">4</xref>]. HF preconditioning protects the mice from surgical stress–induced inflammation in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref002">2</xref>]. Our study mechanistically supports previously published work highlighting the beneficial aspects of HF preconditioning or AA restriction in the context of inflammation.</p>
<p>It is well known that HF activates GCN2 by acting competitively with proline, thereby inhibiting prolyl-tRNA synthetase activity of EPRS, known to participate in the interferon γ (IFNγ)-activated inhibitor of translation complex (GAIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref014">14</xref>]. Activation of the GAIT complex by IFNγ results in the suppression of proinflammatory gene expression through the binding of the GAIT complex to the 3’UTRs of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref043">43</xref>]. However, LPS-induced IL-1β production is not impaired in PBMCs incubated with IFNγ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref044">44</xref>], indicating stress-specific regulation of IL-1β. Our findings indicate that HF-induced eIF2-α phosphorylation triggers riboclustering or SG formation, an important PTR event in the regulation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref007">7</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that cytokine mRNAs, including IL-1β, bear ARE sequences at 3’UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref045">45</xref>], which confer tight post-transcriptional regulation mainly mediated by stress-driven activation of ISR pathways, resulting in translational blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref007">7</xref>]. Translationally silenced mRNAs trigger ribocluster or SG formation via recruitment of RBPs, which in turn dictate the mRNA’s stability/decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref023">23</xref>]. The existence of such regulatory mechanisms assist the cells in turning “on” or “off” its protein synthesis machinery as per cellular requirements to overcome stressful conditions like amino acid starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref007">7</xref>]. Our findings reveal that HF-induced GCN2 activation causes translational silencing of IL-1β mRNA through enhanced expression of translation silencer RBPs, TIA-1 and TIAR, which in turn assists cytoplasmic repositioning of the IL-1β mRNA transcript from polysomes to SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005317.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the eukaryotic SGs are cleared by autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref027">27</xref>]. In line with the earlier observations, our findings also reveal that HF induces autophagy and facilitates the post-transcriptional degradation of SG-bound IL-1β mRNAs. Furthermore, autophagy could also influence mature IL-1β production post-translationally through ROS-dependent inhibition of inflammasome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref046">46</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that HF-induced autophagy suppresses ROS production, thereby inhibiting active IL-1β production post-translationally. These findings highlight the centrality of autophagy in controlling post-transcriptional as well as post-translational regulatory events.</p>

<title>Proposed model of the mechanism by which HF suppresses IL-1β expression.</title>
<p>HF induces activation of the amino acid starvation sensor, GCN2, which triggers SG formation and autophagy. SG formation regulates IL-1β expression at mRNA level via translational silencers, TIA-1/TIAR and RBPs. Later, these SGs are cleared by autophagy. On the other hand, the activated autophagy process decreases ROS levels, thereby inhibiting inflammasome activation, leading to decrease in active caspase-1 and secretion of mature IL-1β. eIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; GCN2, general control nonderepressible 2 kinase; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; HF, Halofuginone; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; RBP, RNA-binding protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SG, stress granule; TIA-1, T cell–restricted intracellular antigen-1; TIAR, TIA-1–related.</p>

<p>Exacerbated expression of IL-1β is associated with the development of IBDs such as colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref036">36</xref>], and pharmacological neutralization of these cytokines reduces the severity of colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005317.ref047">47</xref>]. Meta-analysis of publicly available UC and CD gene expression data revealed a substantial reduction of GCN2 expression in the PBMCs. Our data indicate that HF significantly reduces serum IL-1β levels and the inflammatory pathology in a murine model of DSS-induced colitis and highlight the therapeutic potential of HF-induced GCN2–AAR pathways in controlling intestinal inflammation. Altogether, this study reveals a novel mechanism of IL-1β regulation and further suggests that pharmacological activation of the evolutionarily conserved cytoprotective AAR pathway might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases.</p>

<title>Site-directed mutagenesis for deletion of ARE sequence in IL-1β mRNA 3’UTR</title>
<p>pCMV6 IL-1β plasmid (Origene, Rockville, MD) served as the template to design the 3 sets of primers lacking 3 stretches of ARE sequences (TATTTATTTAT, TATTTATT, and TATTTA) in IL-1β 3’UTR. Three different sets of primers were designed to amplify the entire sequence of the plasmid except the 3 regions enriched with AT sequences to be deleted. The primers were designed in such a manner that the first mutant plasmid serves as a template to generate the second mutant. Likewise, the second mutant serves as a template for the third deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005317.s012">S2 Table</xref>). The 3 oligonucleotide-based deletions were carried out using 2.5U of Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB Labs) in a 50 μl PCR containing 50 ng of source plasmid, 125 ng of forward and reverse primer each, and 300 μM of dNTP mix. The reaction was carried out with 18-cycle PCR using a 3-step PCR method with conditions 98°C for 30 s, 98°C for 30 s, 55 to 60°C for 1 min, 68°C for 7 min, and 72°C for 10 min. Subsequently, <italic>Dpn</italic> I was added to PCR reaction and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C to remove the native plasmid from PCR reaction followed by transformation into XL1-Blue cells.
