<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cognitive control, which continues to mature throughout adolescence, is supported by the ability for well-defined organized brain networks to flexibly integrate information. However, the development of intrinsic brain network organization and its relationship to observed improvements in cognitive control are not well understood. In the present study, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), graph theory, the antisaccade task, and rigorous head motion control to characterize and relate developmental changes in network organization, connectivity strength, and integration to inhibitory control development. Subjects were 192 10–26-y-olds who were imaged during 5 min of rest. In contrast to initial studies, our results indicate that network organization is stable throughout adolescence. However, cross-network integration, predominantly of the cingulo-opercular/salience network, increased with age. Importantly, this increased integration of the cingulo-opercular/salience network significantly moderated the robust effect of age on the latency to initiate a correct inhibitory control response. These results provide compelling evidence that the transition to adult-level inhibitory control is dependent upon the refinement and strengthening of integration between specialized networks. Our findings support a novel, two-stage model of neural development, in which networks stabilize prior to adolescence and subsequently increase their integration to support the cross-domain incorporation of information processing critical for mature cognitive control.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Adolescence is a unique period of brain development, with major changes occurring across the brain at many different levels of brain functioning. At the macroscopic level, the brain is composed of individual regions that collaborate in networks to perform diverse cognitive functions. Some networks of brain regions perform lower-level sensorimotor processing, while other networks orchestrate more complex functions, such as cognitive control. The affiliation of each region to a network is referred to as network organization. Brain regions not only can communicate with other regions belonging to their own network but also with regions in other networks. Brain regions that communicate with regions belonging to other networks display a high level of <italic>integration</italic> since they link their network with another network. We found that during adolescence, network <italic>organization</italic> does not change. However, <italic>integration</italic> continues to increase, underscoring the notion that brain function becomes more distributed and collaborative during this unique period of development. Furthermore, this increased network <italic>integration</italic> underlies improvements in cognitive control. Thus, we provide a network-based account for improvements in cognitive functioning during adolescence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cognitive control refers to the ability to execute voluntary, goal-directed behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref003">3</xref>]. It requires flexible and adaptive coordination of core executive systems that are supported by integration among widely distributed, specialized brain circuitries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref004">4</xref>]. The core components of cognitive control are available early in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref005">5</xref>]. However, in adolescence, cognitive control abilities become significantly more reliable and flexible, as response accuracy and speed stabilize in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref006">6</xref>]. These developmental gains in information processing occur in parallel with brain maturational events, including synaptic pruning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref007">7</xref>] and myelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref008">8</xref>], which predominantly enhance collaboration among brain systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref009">9</xref>]. The nature of the interaction between brain network maturation and cognitive development during adolescence is not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref010">10</xref>], limiting our ability to understand the neural basis of psychopathologies that emerge at this time, many of which are characterized by deficits in cognitive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Characterizing functional brain network interactions during the resting state (i.e., while the subject is not engaged in any particular task) has become a valuable emerging approach for investigating the brain basis of cognitive development. Studies using this approach have revealed roles for these networks in supporting cognitive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref012">12</xref>]. Approximately 20 functional networks have been identified in the functional connectome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref013">13</xref>], including sensory networks, such as the somatomotor (SM) and visual networks; cognitive networks, such as the fronto-parietal (FP) and cingulo-opercular/salience (CO/Salience) networks; and a task-negative default mode (DM) network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref014">14</xref>]. Each functional network operates as a module within the full connectome. Networks are demarcated by dense internal connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref016">16</xref>], defining a foundational organization for the functional brain. Thus, network <italic>organization</italic> refers to the network affiliation of each region of the connectome. Initial studies characterizing age-related changes in functional network organization suggested that the organization of these networks continued to change into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref017">17</xref>], such that development proceeded from short-distance anatomical networks in infancy and childhood, to long-range, widely distributed networks in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref020">20</xref>]. However, age-related differences in head motion artifacts may have confounded the connectivity distance findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref023">23</xref>]. Advances in data processing methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref023">23</xref>] and recent findings suggest that foundational aspects of functional network <italic>organization</italic> are established early in development, while processes related to network <italic>integration</italic> continue to mature into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref024">24</xref>]. Network <italic>integration</italic> refers to the level of functional coupling between networks, measured by participation coefficient (PC), a graph theoretical construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref025">25</xref>]. PC is a particularly useful construct to measure network integration, given its sensitivity to between-network connectivity, while maintaining robustness to the total number of connections (degree). Degree-based measures of integration have been shown to be dependent on the size (number of nodes) of a network and therefore can skew results towards a greater number of hubs within larger networks, such as the default mode network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref026">26</xref>]. PC is normalized by the degree of the node. As a result, increases in PC are driven mainly by increases in the number of between-network connections.</p>
<p>Properties of network organization and integration could parallel cognitive development, which is characterized by enhanced adaptive and flexible integration of mature core control components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref001">1</xref>]. Thus, in the present study, we sought to identify whether age-related changes in functional networks are determined by changes in network <italic>organization</italic> and/or network <italic>integration</italic> and whether these changes are related to developmental improvements in cognitive control. We applied graph theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref028">28</xref>] to a rich developmental resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) dataset obtained in 10–26-y-olds who also performed the antisaccade task. In this inhibitory control paradigm, subjects fixate a central target on a computer screen. A stimulus is then presented at an unpredictable horizontal location. Subjects are instructed to refrain from making a saccadic eye movement towards the stimulus (i.e., inhibitory response) and instead make a voluntary saccadic eye movement to the mirrored opposite location on the horizontal meridian.</p>
<p>Given that core cognitive components are on line by childhood and that the ability to adaptively and flexibly engage these components improves into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref033">33</xref>], we hypothesized that network <italic>organization</italic>, which supports component processes, would not change with age, but that network connectivity <italic>strength</italic> and <italic>integration</italic>, which both support interaction between components, would increase with age. In turn, we hypothesized increased control network integration would predict age-related improvements in cognitive control, as measured by the antisaccade task.</p>

<title>Development of Functional Network Organization</title>
<p>We used a previously defined functional connectome parcellation of 264 functional regions of interest (ROIs) across cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref014">14</xref>] in a sample of 192 individuals, aged 10–26 y old (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002328.t001">Table 1</xref>). For each subject, we correlated the time series of each ROI with that of every other ROI. We then formed group matrices by averaging each subject’s connectivity matrix within categorical age groups (10–12-, 13–15-, 16–19-, and 20–26-y-olds) (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). For each group, we partitioned the full functional connectome into modules using Newman’s Q-metric coupled with an efficient optimization approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref035">35</xref>] across network densities ranging from the top 1% to 25% of pair-wise correlations in terms of correlation strength. Notably, Newman’s Q-algorithm returns modules of densely interconnected nodes. We interpret these modules as being functionally connected collections of brain regions sub-serving common functions and therefore refer to them as functional brain networks. The representative network partition of the full connectome was given a threshold of a density of 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) to partition the network into a meaningful structure while maintaining high connectedness, which would be limited with lower thresholds. This approach identified more comprehensive networks compared with those incorporating lower thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref014">14</xref>], such that a single network encompassed the cingulo-opercular, subcortical, and salience networks. We refer to this network, which includes regions critical to cognitive control, as the CO/Salience network.</p>

<p>We tested changes in network organization using normalized mutual information (NMI), which measures the mutual dependence of two variables (i.e., how much information in variable one is also contained in variable two). NMI values range from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no mutual dependence (no shared information), while a value of 1 indicates complete dependency (completely shared information). We calculated NMI for networks between consecutive age groups and between children and adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We used a random permutation test to compare observed NMI values to a null distribution of 1,000 NMI values. For the adult versus child contrast, observed NMI = 0.73 (null mean [<italic>M</italic>] = 0.68, null standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] = 0.07); between children and early adolescents, NMI = 0.67 (null <italic>M</italic> = 0.73, null <italic>SD</italic> = 0.08); between early adolescents and late adolescents, NMI = 0.69 (null <italic>M</italic> = 0.76, null <italic>SD</italic> = 0.06); and between late adolescents and adults, NMI = 0.77 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Importantly, all observed NMI values fell maximally just over one standard deviation of the null mean, indicating no significant differences in network organization from late childhood into adulthood. To provide statistical evidence for findings reflecting stable network organization, we took a Bayesian approach, weighting evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (stable network organization) versus the evidence for the alternative hypothesis (dynamic network organization) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref036">36</xref>]. First, we generated a distribution of observed NMI values by performing a leave-one-out cross validation. We removed one subject from each group for any given contrast and calculated NMI on the remaining group-averaged matrices. Then, we compared the resulting distribution to the previously generated null distribution for each contrast by calculating the Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow (JZS) Bayes factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref036">36</xref>]. Values greater than 1 provide evidence supporting the null hypothesis, while values between 0 and 1 provide support for the alternative hypothesis. With respect to the null hypothesis of stable developmental network organization, values ranging from 1 to 2 indicate anecdotal evidence and from 3 to 10, substantial evidence. For children versus early adolescents, JZS Bayes factor = 3.82; for early adolescents versus late adolescents, JZS Bayes factor = 2.49; for late adolescents versus adults, JZS Bayes factor = 5.34; and for children versus adults, JZS Bayes factor = 8.01. These results indicate substantial evidence in favor of stable network organization throughout late childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Importantly, these results were robust across network densities; thus, our results were not due to our choice of representational network density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002328.s004">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Within- and Between-Network Changes in Connectivity Strength</title>
<p>Given network <italic>organization</italic> is on line by childhood and remains stable throughout this developmental period, it cannot account for cognitive changes during adolescence. Hence, we investigated developmental changes in network connectivity strength within networks (reflecting the integrity of specialized networks) and between networks (reflecting the integration of information processing across functional domains). First, we partitioned each group-averaged matrix into networks according to the adult network assignment. Consecutive age group comparisons of within- and between-network connectivity were conducted using a two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test that was Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p>Age-related changes in connectivity strength were unique to developmental stages. From childhood (10–12 y) to early adolescence (13–15 y), there was a global decrease in connectivity strength for both within-network and between-network connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, corrected). From early adolescence (13–15 y) to late adolescence (16–20 y) within-network connectivity remained stable, while between-network connectivity increased across networks, with the exception of DM/FP network connectivity, which remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Lastly, from late adolescence (16–19 y) to adulthood (20–26 y), within-network connectivity strength again decreased, while between-network connectivity continued to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). These results indicate that the transition to adult-level network connectivity is characterized by a shift from predominance of within-network connectivity to reliance on between-network connectivity. Together, these results suggest that increased collaborative brain function may underlie improvements in cognitive control.</p>

<title>No Changes in Distance-Dependent Connectivity through Adolescence</title>

<title>Developmental Trajectories of Network-Level Integration</title>
<p>In addition to characterizing age-related changes in the strength of connectivity both as a function of network organization and as a function of distance, we also aimed to quantitatively characterize the <italic>distribution</italic> of these between-network interactions using graph theory. Brain regions (nodes) within networks may either contain connections (links) solely to nodes within the same network or may also contain between-network links. A node that has distributed links across multiple networks can be regarded as a highly integrated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Here, we operationally define <italic>integration</italic> as the level to which a region contains distributed links from its “home” network to a foreign network. Participation coefficient (PC) is a graph theoretical construct that is used to calculate integration between brain networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref025">25</xref>]. PC refers to the level to which a node establishes links to foreign networks, with values ranging from 0 to 1. Nodes that link solely to other nodes within their “home” network would have a PC of 0, while nodes with many distributed between-network links would have a PC closer to 1. Delineating the level of integration using a node’s PC extends beyond defining the degree (i.e., number of links) of a node, to defining the relative importance of those links with other networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

<p>To analyze developmental trajectories of integration at the network level, we calculated PC for every node within individual subject matrices at each network density. As an important aside, to remove the arbitrary bias in thresholding, all subsequent calculations involving PC are represented as the mean value across the range of network densities. Though we chose this method, PC across all nodes is significantly positively correlated with the PC of all nodes at each network density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002328.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). If our results were only driven by a specific threshold (e.g., 5%), but not others (e.g., 20%), a significant relationship between mean PC and the specific threshold driving the effect (5% in this example) would exist, but would not exist in others (20% in this example). This provides evidence that PC is robust to any biases that could be introduced by thresholding.</p>
<p>For each subject, nodes were grouped according to the network to which they were assigned in the adult group. Then, we calculated the mean PC value for each network and tested each network for significant age-related effects on individual subjects, fitting both linear and inverse regression models, which are known to best fit this period of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref037">37</xref>]. The choice of superior model fit was made quantitatively, using Akaike information criterion (AIC). The PC of the CO/Salience network significantly increased over the age range studied (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.09, t = 3.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), optimally fit with an inverse model. No other network displayed age-related changes in PC for either linear or inverse models (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) (Sheet “Fig5Fig6” in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002328.s001">S1 Data</xref>). One purported role of the CO/Salience network is the maintenance of cognitive control. Thus, increased integration of the CO/Salience network with other brain networks may underlie improvements in cognitive control performance during adolescence. We tested this hypothesis by investigating associations between network integration and behavioral performance in the antisaccade task.</p>
<p>To identify any long-term fluctuations in PC that may not be captured at the individual subject level, we sorted individual subject matrices by age and then calculated average subject correlation matrices using a moving average approach (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Materials and Methods</xref>). After calculating PC for each region within each moving average group, we computed the mean PC within each network. We then fit linear, inverse, quadratic, and cubic regression models to the data, with the best fit model defined as the one with the lowest AIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The best fit model for the CO/Salience network was an inverse fit (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), showing an increase in PC from late childhood through approximately 14 y of age, followed by relative stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, black curve). The quadratic model best fit age-related changes in the DM network (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), which decreased in PC throughout adolescence, but increased slightly into early adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, red curve). A quadratic model best fit the visual network (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with peak levels of integration occurring late in adolescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, blue curve). A cubic model best fit the FP network (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), where PC increased from late childhood through approximately 14 y of age before declining from approximately 14 to 20 y, and then increasing again throughout early adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, yellow curve). Lastly, the SM network remained relatively stable throughout development (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.01, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, cyan curve). The fact that no other network demonstrated significant age-related effects in the individual subjects analysis compared to the moving average approach suggests the lack of differences is likely due to a high amount of individual subject variability.</p>

<title>Cingulo-Opercular/Salience Network Integration Moderates the Relationship between Age and Antisaccade Latency</title>
<p>The antisaccade task is a particularly robust test of inhibitory control that reliably shows sensitivity to cognitive development through adolescence as accuracy and reaction times (RTs) during successful response inhibition improves through adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref040">40</xref>].

<p>Next, we tested the association between PC of the CO/Salience network (i.e., CO/Salience network integration) and antisaccade accuracy and RT, controlling for age. Results showed no association between CO/Salience network PC and accuracy (<italic>p</italic> = 0.34). However, as CO/Salience network PC increased, RT to correct inhibitory responses decreased (t = -2.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), suggesting that greater CO/Salience network integration supports timely successful inhibitory control. Notably, no other network displayed a significant relationship between PC and accuracy or RT (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>
<p>Given the relationship between age and both antisaccade performance and CO/Salience network PC, we assessed whether CO/Salience network PC moderates the relationship between antisaccade performance and age. To test this, we ran two moderation analyses, one including CO/Salience network PC as a moderator of age and antisaccade accuracy and a second including CO/Salience network PC as a moderator of age and antisaccade RT. In each model, both regressors were centered prior to model fitting. CO/Salience network PC did not significantly moderate the relationship between age and accuracy (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, CO/Salience network PC did moderate the relationship between age and correct antisaccade RT (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, t = -3.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). To identify when in development this interaction was most prominent, we investigated effects on RT within age groups by performing a median split of CO/Salience network PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). We observed a significant difference in individual subjects within the child group (10–12 y) between RTs of subjects with high versus low CO/Salience network PC. Lower CO/Salience network PC resulted in slower RTs, while higher CO/Salience network PC resulted in faster RTs (t = 2.84, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02, Bonferroni corrected). When we extracted the data for each subject, the results showed that as PC increased, antisaccade RT decreased (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.18, t = -2.99, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002328.g006">Fig 6E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We sought to characterize the development through adolescence of functional brain network organization, connectivity strength, and integration. Furthermore, we tested the relationship between network integration and developmental improvements in inhibitory control. Our results provide evidence that: (1) network organization—as measured via Bayesian inference of NMI between module assignments of age groups—is stable by late childhood; (2) connectivity strength changes with development, reflecting concurrent decreases in within-network connectivity and increases in between-network connectivity; (3) anatomical distance does not account for age-related changes in connectivity strength through adolescence; (4) increased integration of the CO/Salience network occurs throughout the adolescent period; and (5) CO/Salience network PC moderates the relationship between age and antisaccade reaction time, such that higher PC, and thus integration, of this network contributes to faster RTs on the antisaccade task. These findings suggest that foundational aspects of functional network architecture, specifically network <italic>organization</italic>, are established early in development, while the processes underlying network <italic>integration</italic> continue to mature into adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref024">24</xref>]. This process reflects the way cognitive control develops, as characterized by more adaptive and flexible interactions of earlier maturing core components.</p>

<title>Developmental Stability in Functional Brain Network <italic>Organization</italic></title>
<p>Within the human functional connectome, densely interconnected brain regions are organized into well-defined functional networks, subserving sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. Our findings indicate that this network organization is stable between 10 and 26 y of age, countering earlier findings that suggested developmental changes in network organization reflect a shift from localized to distributed organization, which may have been confounded by head motion artifact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref046">46</xref>]. The current study applied a wide array of advanced preprocessing steps to limit head motion artifact, including wavelet despiking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref047">47</xref>], simultaneous bandpass filtering the time series data and nuisance regressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref023">23</xref>], as well as scrubbing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref021">21</xref>]. These results suggest that, after controlling for head motion, there are no changes in network organization from late childhood to adulthood.</p>
<p>Previous studies found that many aspects of human functional network topology remain stable throughout adolescence, including small-worldness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref048">48</xref>], global efficiency, and hub organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref024">24</xref>]. Combining these findings with our results showing the stability of network organization, we see strong evidence that the large-scale organization of functional networks is present by late childhood, possibly even earlier. Despite the fact the brain undergoes continual structural maturation of both gray and white matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref051">51</xref>], key fundamental properties of large-scale functional circuitry, including organization, are stable throughout late childhood to adulthood. While non-significant age-related changes to network organization cannot be concluded through inferential statistics, Bayesian inference via JZS Bayes factors allowed us to test the likelihood of the null versus the alternative hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref036">36</xref>]. Using this method, we confirmed the finding that network organization does not change significantly with age.</p>

<title>Age-Related Changes in Connectivity <italic>Strength</italic></title>
<p>Our results show age-related changes in connectivity strength. Within-network connectivity strength decreased with age, suggesting that maturity results in network refinements akin to pruning unnecessary connections, which improves signal transmission within networks. On the other hand, we found between-network connectivity strength decreased into early adolescence and subsequently increased into adulthood, ultimately enhancing the ability for different networks to collaborate. Interestingly, adolescence demarcated the period when between-network connectivity began to increase, perhaps reflecting a qualitative shift in network interactions towards collaborative network functioning. The overall trend towards increased between-network connectivity is at odds with a previous study by Stevens and colleagues, who found causal between-network coupling decreased in strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref052">52</xref>], reflecting greater segregation of specialized networks. However, this study used an independent components analysis approach to define functional networks, which only coarsely correspond to the canonical networks used in the current study. Furthermore, this study was conducted before advances concerning mitigation of head-motion–related artifacts.</p>
<p>Changes in within- and between-network connectivity strength were sensitive to network organization, not solely by the distance between regions, as initial studies had suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref053">53</xref>]. Divergences from previous results are not surprising given our implementation of recent advances in head motion control that minimized its confounds on age differences in connection strength as a function of distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref022">22</xref>]. Distance-related changes in connectivity strength by age have been found after controlling for head motion, albeit with a weaker effect than previously reported, in a sample that included children younger than those in the current sample (8 versus 10 y of age) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref053">53</xref>]. Decreasing short-range connectivity and increasing long-range connectivity may be specific to an earlier developmental stage, when greater changes in white matter connectivity are occurring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref008">8</xref>]. These results suggest that the adolescent transition to maturity is a period of refinements in connectivity within stable networks and concomitant increases in connectivity across widely distributed circuitry.</p>

<title>Increased Integration of the Cingulo-opercular/Salience Network</title>
<p>While between-network connectivity increased with age, the distribution of links (i.e., integration) among networks remained stable for most networks studied. This suggests that the framework for network integration is available by childhood, with continued increases in the strength of these established between-network links. An exception, however, was the CO/Salience network, which displayed age-related changes in integration with other networks, as assessed by PC. The CO/Salience network is involved in maintaining a task set, saliency, and configuring sensory information, cognitive state, and motor output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref054">54</xref>]. The continued enhancement of CO/Salience network integration follows what is known about the development of cognitive control. Core cognitive control abilities are present early in development, but the consistent successful implementation of control continues to improve into adulthood. This developmental pattern has been found for a wide range of cognitive control tasks, such as the antisaccade, go-no-go, and stroop tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref055">55</xref>]. Our findings of stable network organization, coupled with increased integration, are consistent with these behavioral findings, suggesting that the underlying architecture supporting mature brain functioning is present early in development, with refinements continuing into adolescence.</p>
<p>Age differences in integration patterns at the regional scale within the CO/Salience network corroborated the network-level findings. From childhood into early adolescence, specific regions that drove increased integration of the CO/Salience network included the right aIns, bilateral dACC, anterior and mediodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, and putamen. Both the aIns and dACC are extensively anatomically connected to many major brain networks across cortical and subcortical regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref057">57</xref>]. Together these regions drive a control network guiding mental activity and behavior through an interaction of cognitive, affective, and homeostatic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref061">61</xref>]. We observed an increase in the number of links between the CO/Salience network and the SM network from every region that became more integrated within the CO/Salience network, enabling more rapid access from this control system to the motor system to guide goal-directed behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref060">60</xref>]. Specifically, the right aIns has been shown to play a critical developmental role as an outflow hub in directing cognitive control processes, having greater directed causal influence on other brain regions (dACC and posterior parietal cortex (PPC)) critical for proper cognitive control execution in adults compared to children. Furthermore, these functional refinements were shown to be supported structurally via enhanced white matter fiber density with development between the right aIns and PPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref062">62</xref>]. Additionally, it has been shown that the right aIns increases in connectivity strength to regions within network (e.g., dACC) and between networks (e.g., DLPFC and PCC), supporting its increased role in network integration over the adolescent period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref063">63</xref>]. Due to its roles in detecting salient stimuli and acting as a switch between large-scale networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref061">61</xref>], the aIns likely plays a particularly important role in normative development, supporting enhanced integration of multiple brain processes. In addition to the right aIns, the dACC also plays a critical role in cognitive control execution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref064">64</xref>]. Using a multimodal approach, Fjell and colleagues found the surface area and white matter integrity of the dACC accounted for a significant portion of variance in performance on a flanker task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref065">65</xref>]. In sum, much like the aIns, the dACC plays a critical role in control abilities and shows a protracted development. In support of their critical developmental role, there is evidence that abnormal engagement of the aIns and dACC may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref067">67</xref>].</p>
<p>Many of the regions within the CO/Salience network that significantly increased in integrative properties were subcortical, including the putamen and thalamus. These regions show larger changes than cortical areas with respect to fractional anisotropy in white matter, increasing 30% to 50% from childhood into early adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref068">68</xref>], and also show a protracted neurophysiological development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref069">69</xref>]. This parallels our findings of increased integration of these subcortical structures with cortical networks. Given that adolescence is a period of enhanced sensation seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref037">37</xref>], the steep increase in the integrated nature of these regions with other brain networks during early adolescence suggests a mechanism by which motivational systems are reconfigured with more cognitive, sensory, and affective systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref070">70</xref>].</p>

<title>Cingulo-opercular/Salience Network Integration Moderates Age-Related Improvements in Inhibitory Control</title>
<p>In agreement with an extensive literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref040">40</xref>], we found age-related decreases in reaction times of correct inhibitory responses. Our network analyses indicated that increased CO/Salience network integration predicted faster RTs on the antisaccade task, underscoring the importance of the CO/Salience network integrating with other networks, subserving cognitive control. Importantly, we found that CO/Salience network integration moderated decreases in antisaccade latency as a function of age. This moderation was significant in the transition from late childhood to early adolescence, when (at both the network and the regional scale) the CO/Salience network became significantly more integrated with other functional networks. Together, these results indicate that development brings greater integration between the CO/Salience network, supporting sustained cognitive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref012">12</xref>], and regions that underlie action such as the SM network, resulting in the ability to generate quicker execution of correct cognitive control signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref064">64</xref>].</p>

<title>The Role of Intrinsic Functional Couplings in Integration</title>
<p>Although intrinsic, spontaneous coupling between regions at frequencies &lt;0.1 Hz has been studied for nearly 20 y, the neural substrate and the meaning of the slow frequency signal remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref072">72</xref>], though functional networks observed using fMRI have also been identified using magnetoencephalography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref073">73</xref>]. Many ROI-ROI pairs demonstrate high correlations between their time courses despite a lack of monosynaptic connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref075">75</xref>]. Though the functional purpose of spontaneous slow frequency BOLD oscillations is not known, a range of possibilities exist. Resting-state functional networks may be groups of regions that often coactivate in task-based settings, reflecting a history of coactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref077">77</xref>]. This interpretation is supported by studies finding strong resting-state correlations, despite the lack of a direct anatomical connection. However, the existence of strong functional connectivity in the absence of direct anatomical connections allows for other alternatives, including the notion that resting-state networks are constantly sampling a possibility of configurations, constrained by anatomy, to make predictions about optimal network configurations for a given input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref072">72</xref>]. Furthermore, over long timescales, such as in this study, resting-state functional brain networks are dependent on anatomical connectivity; however, at shorter timescales, numerous configurations are possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref078">78</xref>]. That said, changes in the framework of integration within the functional connectome during adolescence may reflect differences in the pattern in which information is shared across distributed neural networks. Specifically, from a graph theoretic view, the regions that significantly increased in participation coefficient are areas that integrate across multiple functional networks to a greater extent. Importantly, the role these brain regions play in integrating information may reflect a particular vulnerability for the emergence of psychopathology, which emerges during adolescence—a time when the brain is reorganizing the way it shares and processes information across these networks.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study was not without limitations. The sample was cross-sectional, undermining our ability to analyze subject-specific growth trajectories. We are also limited by some inherent drawbacks of fMRI, including residual head motion, though we took multiple processing steps towards mitigating these effects, including wavelet despiking, simultaneous bandpass filtering of the time series and nuisance regressors, and scrubbing. Additionally, 5 min of resting-state data is considered a minimum requirement for analyses of resting-state fMRI data, with recent pushes for longer acquisitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref075">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref079">79</xref>]. However, longer acquisitions may lead to even greater differences between age groups in head motion. Lastly, because PC was averaged over all nodes within a network, it is possible that some single brain regions could be driving this effect more than others. That said, we still found CO/Salience network increases in integration with age that moderated the relationship between cognitive control performance and age. This finding stresses the importance of network integration for adult-like cognitive control performance, rather than the maturation of any singular brain region. Future studies could aim to elucidate specific brain regions driving cognitive control maturation via integration.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred and ninety-five subjects aged 10–26 y participated in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002328.t001">Table 1</xref>). Written informed consent was obtained from every subject and minors did sign assents. This research was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. A phone screen questionnaire was used to assess medical history and history of psychiatric disorders at the time of recruitment. Subjects were excluded at the time of recruitment if the subject or a first-degree relative currently or previously had a psychiatric disorder. Subjects also completed a battery of self-report measures of psychopathology. As determined through the interview process, neither subjects included in this study nor their first-degree relatives currently or previously had any neurological disease, brain injury, or diagnosed psychiatric illness. Substance use was assessed using the drug use and history questionnaire. Subjects included in this study were free from substance use or abuse. A post-scan questionnaire was used to inquire if subjects had fallen asleep. Sixteen subjects reported periods when they may have briefly drifted into sleep but none reported sleeping throughout the entire resting state scan. Data from three subjects were discarded due to excessive head motion. Therefore, we report data from 192 subjects. While age was considered as a continuous variable, some analyses considered developmental stages by binning ages after first sorting individual subjects by age, similar to methods used in the past to characterize changes in childhood (<italic>n</italic> = 41 10–12 y olds), early (<italic>n</italic> = 41 13–15 y olds) and late adolescence (<italic>n</italic> = 53 16–19 y olds), and adulthood (<italic>n</italic> = 57 20–26 y olds).</p>

<title>Antisaccade Task</title>
<p>The antisaccade task was performed by subjects outside of the MR scanner on a separate day from the MR visit. For a full description of the antisaccade task used, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref080">80</xref>]. Briefly, neutral trials were extracted from an incentivized antisaccade task, consisting of reward, loss, and neutral trials. There were a total of 40 of each trial type. Each neutral trial began with a white central fixation, which then turned red for 1.5 s, prompting subjects to prepare a response. Next, a peripheral stimulus (yellow dot at approximately 0.5 degree/visual angle) appeared at an unpredictable location on the horizontal meridian (±4 and 8 degrees/visual angle) for 1.5 s. Subjects were instructed to inhibit making a saccade towards the stimulus, and instead to saccade to the mirror location of the stimulus. Eye movement data were scored online using interfaced E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) and ASL (Applied Science Laboratories, Bedford, MA) eye tracking software. A script detected if at any time during the first 1,000 ms a subject made a saccade to the stimulus or if no eye movement was generated. An auditory tone (1,163 Hz) was played for 400 ms if the subject made a saccade to the stimulus. If the subject made a correct saccade a “cha-ching” sound (1,516 Hz) was presented for 400 ms. Correct responses were defined as those in which the first eye movement in the saccade was directed toward the mirror location at a velocity greater than or equal to 30°/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref081">81</xref>] and extended beyond a 2.5°/visual angle from the central fixation. A response was considered incorrect when the first saccade was directed towards the target beyond a 2.5°/visual angle from central fixation, but were subsequently directed to the hemifield opposite the target, similar to previously published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref080">80</xref>].</p>

A correct antisaccade response was one in which the first saccade following stimulus onset was towards the mirror location of the stimulus and extended beyond a 2.5 degrees/visual angle central fixation zone.

<title>MR Data Acquisition</title>
<p>Data were acquired using a 12-channel Siemens 3T Tim Trio at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Magnetic Resonance Research Center. The resting-state scan was acquired at the end of the scanning session and was always at the same time of acquisition for all subjects. For each subject, we collected 300 s (200 TRs) of resting-state data. Structural images were acquired using a sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (repetition time [TR] = 1,570 ms, echo time [TE] = 3.04 ms, flip angle = 8°, inversion time [TI] = 800 ms, voxel size = 0.78125 × 0.78125 × 1 mm). Functional images were acquired using an echo-planar sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (T<sub>2</sub>*; TR = 1.5 s, TE = 29 ms, flip angle = 70°, voxel size = 3.125 × 3.125 mm in-plane resolution, 29 contiguous 4-mm axial slices).

<title>RS-fMRI Preprocessing</title>

Standard preprocessing steps were completed, including (1) normalization based on global mode, (2) wavelet despiking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref047">47</xref>], (3) simultaneous multiple regression of nuisance variables from BOLD data and bandpass filtering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref023">23</xref>] at 0.009 Hz &lt; <italic>f</italic> &gt; 0.08, and (4) spatial smoothing using a 6 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian blur. Freesurfer was used to segment gray matter, white matter, and ventricular voxels. Nuisance regressors included ventricular signal averaged from ventricular regions of interest (ROIs), six head realignment parameters obtained by rigid body head motion correction, and the derivatives of these signals and parameters. In addition to wavelet despiking, we removed any remaining high motion volumes via a scrubbing procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref022">22</xref>]. For the original 195 subjects, we calculated two quality control measures with respect to head motion, volume-to-volume framewise displacement (FD) and the root mean square derivative of fMRI timeseries (DVARS). We censored and removed volumes in individual subjects that had an FD &gt; 0.5 mm and DVARS &gt; 5, as well as the frame preceding the motion artifact and the two subsequent frames. FD is calculated on the original motion time series (i.e., before motion correction with wavelet despiking). On the other hand, DVARS is calculated after motion correction with wavelet despiking. Large DVARS values after wavelet despiking would indicate motion/artifact-related noise in the global signal (i.e., brain-wide change from one volume to the next) still remained after despiking, which we did not observe (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002328.t001">Table 1</xref>: note DVARS after wavelet despiking is considerably lower in all four groups than DVARS calculated prior to wavelet despiking). Because we collected 300 s of data, subjects were dropped entirely if &gt;20% of their volumes were removed, leaving the minimum amount of rest data for any subject 240 s. This procedure resulted in the removal of three subjects from further analyses. Of the remaining 192 subjects, only four did not contain a full 300 s of data.</p>

<title>Individual and Group Correlation Matrices</title>
<p>Network-level age-related changes were assessed using individual correlation matrices.

Notably, no standard for binning age groups over adolescence currently exists, though binning roughly follows Luna and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref037">37</xref>]. Since short-distance correlations (Euclidean distance &lt;20mm) can arise from artifacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref021">21</xref>], these connections were not included in tests for age-dependent significant strength changes in connectivity.</p>

<title>Network Detection and Comparison</title>
<p>Since there is no ideal, biologically salient threshold that definitively defines functional networks, we explored a range of network densities from 1%–25% to avoid any thresholding bias. Results involving PC at the group level reflect values that are averaged across all network densities to remove any bias of a single threshold. For a representative network assignment, we chose a network density of 10%, since this threshold results in meaningful network organization (i.e., five networks), while maintaining full connectedness. Importantly, we did not impose network assignments according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref014">14</xref>], since that would erode the ability to make conclusions concerning developmental changes in network organization.</p>
<p>To define and examine the developmental trajectory of functional network organization, we partitioned the full connectome of 264 ROIs into modules using Newman’s Q-metric coupled with an efficient optimization approach proposed by Blondel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref035">35</xref>]. This method has been verified to be one of the best-performing community detection algorithms of undirected networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref086">86</xref>]. We then calculated normalized mutual information (NMI) to determine the level of similarity between network assignments across age groups, with values closer to 0 indicating dissimilar network assignments and values closer to 1 indicating similar assignments. NMI is a standard measure for assessing the degree of similarity between two distributions, which has been used to compare sets of network assignments in resting-state fMRI data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref021">21</xref>]. NMI measures information shared between two probability distribution functions, specifically measuring how much knowing one distribution leads to certainty of the other. Furthermore, NMI will detect any type of relationship between two distributions, making it more robust than a simple correlation coefficient. In this way, we can empirically test the level of similarity of these distributions across subjects. To this end, we permuted the labels of individual matrices between contrasts 1,000 times to generate a null distribution of NMI values for each contrast. Matrices between groups were randomly shuffled and partitioned into functional networks, and NMI was calculated. Upon the finding that the observed NMI values fell around one standard deviation of the mean of the null distribution, we executed a leave one out cross validation to generate a distribution of observed NMI values for the following analysis. Because conventional significance testing does not allow stating evidence in favor of null findings, we implemented a Bayes factor alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref036">36</xref>] to compare the observed NMI distribution with the null distribution. Values greater than 1 indicate the likelihood of stable functional network organization is “n” times more likely than the likelihood of developmental changes in functional network organization.</p>

<title>Connectivity Strength Changes during Adolescence</title>
<p>A general concept in the development of functional networks is that they develop from “local to distributed” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref017">17</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, given methodological improvements for head motion and a denser, more representative functional network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref014">14</xref>], we contrasted connectivity values from averaged weighted matrices in children versus adults for each ROI-ROI pair. Euclidean distance was also calculated for each pairwise relation. We then performed a simple linear regression with distance as a predictor of change in connectivity strength between the children and adult matrices.</p>
<p>We also addressed changes in connectivity strength as a function of within- and between-network interactions. First, within each group-averaged matrix, we averaged all within-network pairwise relations and all between-network pairwise relations, separately. We then performed a two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test for each consecutive age contrast. We then wanted to test for significant increases or decreases in connectivity with respect to specific network interactions. To this end, within each group-averaged matrix, the average connectivity strength was calculated for each network. We then tested each combination of within-network (e.g., DM/DM network) and between-network (e.g., DM/FP networks) interactions to determine significant increases or decreases in connectivity strength between consecutive age groups. For each comparison, we ran a two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test to determine significance (Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons).</p>

<title>Developmental Changes in Participation Coefficient at the Network-level</title>
<p>For each subject, we partitioned the full network into sub-networks imposing the module assignments from the adult group in the analysis outlined above, and subsequently calculated PC for every node within each group. PC is a graph measure quantifying the degree to which a node engages in inter-network communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref026">26</xref>]. Higher PC indicates more distributed between network connectivity, while a PC of 0 signifies a node’s links are completely within its home network (within network). Nodal PCs were then averaged within each network and were tested for significant age-related effects using linear and inverse models.</p>

<sec id="sec030">
<title>Long-Term Fluctuations in Network-Level Participation Coefficient</title>
<p>To determine any long-term fluctuations in PC that may not be captured at the individual subject data, we calculated average subject correlation matrices using a moving average approach, used previously in functional brain network data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref017">17</xref>] and commonly used in economics research. Averaged group matrices were formed using a moving average of age-ordered subjects (e.g., group1: subjects 1–30, group2: subjects 2–31, … group163: subjects 163–192), thus generating 163 groups of 30 subjects in each group. Each group matrix was then parcellated according to the adult network assignment and PC was calculated for each ROI within each group. For each group, the PC for ROIs within a network were averaged and plotted as a function of age.</p>

<title>Relating Changes in Integration to the Development of Inhibitory Control</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that the relationship between age and performance (accuracy and RT) on the antisaccade task is moderated by integration of the CO/Salience network with other functional networks, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted separately for accuracy and reaction time. If a significant interaction was observed, age groups were binned into the four age groups previously defined and a median split of the averaged PC within the CO/Salience network was conducted. Within each bin, we tested for significant differences in RT using a <italic>t</italic> test between high and low PC groups and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method.</p>

<title>Identifying Specific Nodes Increasing in Participation Coefficient</title>
<p>We sought to discover brain regions that significantly increased in the ability to integrate information from widespread functional networks using graph theory. PC was calculated for each node within each categorical age group. Importantly, the degree, or number of links a node has, was not considered as a metric for integration since network measures that are degree-based have recently been called into question in Pearson correlation RS-fMRI networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002328.ref026">26</xref>]. PC for each node was contrasted between each set of chronological age groups (children versus early adolescents, early adolescents versus late adolescents, and late adolescents versus adults) and between adults and children by subtracting the younger group’s PCs from the older group’s PCs resulting in four total contrasts. Permutation tests were conducted on each node to test nodes for significant changes in PC. To generate a null distribution of PCs for each node, subject labels were randomized within groups 1,000 times and PC was calculated for every node in each run. Contrasts between age groups were then generated by subtracting the PCs for each node for the younger group from the older group. This process was repeated for each age contrast. A significant increase or decrease in participation coefficient for a node was Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons.</p>

<title>Age-Related Changes in the Distribution of Regional Participation Coefficient</title>
<p>Within each group, and for each node that significantly increased in PC, we calculated the degree of the ROI to each network, including its “home” network, and then contrasted these values for consecutive age groups for comparison. The degree of a node is determined by the number of links a node has. This approach allowed us to contrast the distribution of links to each network between consecutive age groups (i.e., within-network versus between-network connectivity), giving us the ability to characterize the driving factor(s) behind the observed significant increases in PC.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These results provide evidence that the period of childhood through adulthood is characterized by increased integration of widely distributed but stable networks. As such, a critical component underlying the adolescent transition to adult-level execution of control is the refinement and strengthening of integration between existing specialized networks. In particular, the CO/Salience network continues to increase its integration with and, thus, its influence on other networks, providing a mechanism for developmental improvements in cognitive control. These findings support a novel two-stage model of adolescent brain development in which network organization stabilizes prior to adolescence, while the integration of information across widely distributed circuitry increases in the transition from adolescence to adulthood.</p>
