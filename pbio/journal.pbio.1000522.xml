<p>A systematic search for human ribosome biogenesis factors shows conservation of many aspects of eukaryotic ribosome synthesis with the well-studied process in yeast and identifies an export route of 60S subunits that is specific for higher eukaryotes.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The assembly of ribosomal subunits in eukaryotes is a complex, multistep process so far mostly studied in yeast. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, more than 200 factors including ribosomal proteins and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors are required for the ordered assembly of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. To date, only few human homologs of these yeast ribosome synthesis factors have been characterized. Here, we used a systematic RNA interference (RNAi) approach to analyze the contribution of 464 candidate factors to ribosomal subunit biogenesis in human cells. The screen was based on visual readouts, using inducible, fluorescent ribosomal proteins as reporters. By performing computer-based image analysis utilizing supervised machine-learning techniques, we obtained evidence for a functional link of 153 human proteins to ribosome synthesis. Our data show that core features of ribosome assembly are conserved from yeast to human, but differences exist for instance with respect to 60S subunit export. Unexpectedly, our RNAi screen uncovered a requirement for the export receptor Exportin 5 (Exp5) in nuclear export of 60S subunits in human cells. We show that Exp5, like the known 60S exportin Crm1, binds to pre-60S particles in a RanGTP-dependent manner. Interference with either Exp5 or Crm1 function blocks 60S export in both human cells and frog oocytes, whereas 40S export is compromised only upon inhibition of Crm1. Thus, 60S subunit export is dependent on at least two RanGTP-binding exportins in vertebrate cells.</p>

<p>Ribosomes are molecular machines that synthesize proteins and are found in every cell. Each ribosome has a small and a large subunit, each of which is in turn composed of ribosomal RNA and many ribosomal proteins. In eukaryotic cells, the generation of these ribosomal subunits is a complex process requiring the participation of hundreds of factors. Originating from the nucleolus (a nuclear region specialized in ribosome synthesis) immature ribosomal subunits pass through the nuclear interior and are exported to the cytoplasm, where their assembly is finalized. In recent years, it has become apparent that defects in ribosome production are associated with human diseases, but our knowledge about this fundamental process is largely based on knowledge derived from yeast, a unicellular eukaryote. We set out to systematically identify factors involved in making ribosomes in human cells by individually depleting around 500 different cellular proteins. Using microscopic analysis, we identified approximately 150 human ribosome synthesis factors, thereby significantly extending our knowledge about human ribosome biogenesis. Our dataset not only revealed many evolutionarily conserved aspects of this essential cellular process but also led us to characterize an export route for the large ribosomal subunit that is specific for higher eukaryotic cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The synthesis of ribosomal subunits is a major cellular task in all living organisms. Ribosomal subunit assembly requires deposition of numerous ribosomal proteins on ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to yield two ribonucleoprotein particles, a small and a large subunit, that together form a ribosome competent for protein translation. Our knowledge about ribosomal subunit biogenesis is most advanced for unicellular model organisms such as bacteria (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) and budding yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>).</p>
<p>Pioneering early experiments demonstrated that simple subunits such as <italic>E. coli</italic> 30S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Mizushima1">[1]</xref> and 50S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Nierhaus1">[2]</xref> can be reconstituted from rRNA and ribosomal proteins in vitro. Still, in vivo various non-ribosomal factors assist subunit assembly by promoting rRNA folding, modification, and protein deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Connolly1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Kaczanowska1">[4]</xref>. With the increase in ribosome complexity and the establishment of cellular compartments in eukaryotes, ribosome biogenesis became dependent on a greater variety and number of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Hage1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Tschochner1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>In yeast, more than 200 proteins are necessary for efficient ribosomal subunit assembly, which starts in the nucleolus with RNA polymerase I-mediated transcription of a large rRNA precursor molecule containing rRNA pieces of both subunits. Co-transcriptionally, the first <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and ribosomal proteins assemble with the nascent pre-rRNA, generating an 80–90S precursor particle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Dragon1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Grandi1">[9]</xref>. During nuclear pre-rRNA maturation, numerous small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) are involved in guiding and promoting various rRNA modification and processing reactions. The U3 snoRNP as part of the small subunit (SSU) processome is required for early endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-rRNA at sites A0, A1, and A2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Henras1">[6]</xref>. Cleavage at site A2 results in the conversion of the 90S pre-ribosome into separate pre-40S and pre-60S particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Granneman1">[10]</xref>. Subsequently, the two subunit precursors mature independently of each other through a series of rRNA processing and RNP remodeling steps in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. After export from the nucleus, both subunits are subjected to final maturation in the cytoplasm, including the release of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and the completion of rRNA processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Panse1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Zemp1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Systematic approaches such as proteomic analysis of preribosomal particles and genetic screens have greatly helped the rapid advancement of our understanding of ribosome biogenesis in yeast and have yielded a comprehensive picture of the biogenesis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Tschochner1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Li1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Hurt1">[20]</xref>. In higher eukaryotes, this global view is still lacking, but particular aspects of ribosome biogenesis such as rRNA transcription and processing, snoRNP biogenesis and function, and nuclear export have been studied in different vertebrate model systems such as cultured cells and frog oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Henras1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Grummt1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Smith1">[23]</xref>. These studies revealed that many aspects of ribosome synthesis are well conserved from yeast to human and many yeast <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors possess functional homologs in vertebrate species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Zemp1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Adachi1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Westendorf1">[38]</xref>. However, for most human homologs of yeast <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, a function in ribosome biogenesis has not yet been established. Moreover, vertebrate ribosome synthesis is dissimilar in several aspects, including the genomic organization of rDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Richard1">[39]</xref>, differences in rRNA processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Henras1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Rouquette1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Peculis1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Craig1">[43]</xref>, and links to stress response pathways unique for higher eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Zhang1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we present a systematic approach to directly assess the functional requirement of 464 selected proteins in ribosome maturation in human cells. We depleted these factors by RNAi and scored for ribosome maturation defects using microscopic readouts. Our analysis provides a list of 153 proteins required for human ribosome synthesis. For 40S biogenesis, we can attribute their requirement to nucleolar, nucleoplasmic, or cytoplasmic maturation steps. Collectively, our data show that core features of 40S biogenesis are indeed conserved from yeast to humans. However, we also uncover unexpected differences such as the requirement of the pre-miRNA export receptor Exp5 for 60S subunit export to the cytoplasm.</p>

<title>Assays to Monitor Ribosomal Subunit Biogenesis in Human Cells</title>
<p>To identify proteins required for ribosome biogenesis by RNAi in HeLa cells, we established visual readouts suitable to detect defects in ribosomal subunit maturation in a high-throughput manner using microscopic endpoint assays.</p>
<p>For the 40S subunit, we applied two different readouts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Zemp2">[45]</xref>, namely an inducible, fluorescent ribosomal reporter protein, Rps2-YFP, and immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor Enp1(BYSL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Adachi1">[24]</xref>. Tetracycline-induced expression of Rps2-YFP allows for selective visualization of newly synthesized 40S subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Zemp2">[45]</xref>. After 14 h of induction, Rps2-YFP-containing 40S have largely completed maturation, giving rise to a prominent cytoplasmic signal of the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, control RNAi). RNAi against Crm1, the RanGTP-dependent nuclear export receptor required for both pre-40S and pre-60S export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Thomas1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Trotta1">[35]</xref>, resulted in a nucleoplasmic accumulation of Rps2-YFP, reflecting the dependence of pre-40S export on Crm1. In contrast, inhibition of nucleolar steps of ribosome biogenesis, as exemplified by depletion of the box C/D snoRNPs-associated methyltransferase fibrillarin (Fbl) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Granneman1">[10]</xref>, led to accumulation of Rps2-YFP in nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, two phenotypes can be distinguished using the Rps2-YFP reporter, reflecting early (nucleolar) and late (nucleoplasmic) defects in nuclear pre-40S maturation.</p>

<p>The IF analysis of Enp1 complements the Rps2-YFP readout, as it allows for detection of both nuclear and cytoplasmic defects in 40S biogenesis. Enp1 is nucleolar at steady state but accompanies pre-40S to the cytoplasm from where it is recycled during cytoplasmic subunit maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Zemp2">[45]</xref>. Inhibition of 40S export (Crm1 RNAi) resulted in a nucleoplasmic accumulation of Enp1, whereas interference with cytoplasmic 40S maturation led to cytoplasmic Enp1 localization, as observed upon downregulation of the 40S <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor Ltv1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Altogether, these readouts enable us to monitor the entire 40S maturation pathway, from the nucleoli through the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm, and to identify factors required for subunit assembly and nuclear export as well as recycling of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors in our RNAi screening approach.</p>
<p>To monitor 60S biogenesis, we established a HeLa cell line carrying an inducible copy of the ribosomal reporter protein Rpl29-GFP. Rpl29-GFP is efficiently incorporated into 60S subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and the GFP-readout faithfully illustrates the Crm1 dependency of 60S export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, this cell line is suitable to study nuclear 60S biogenesis, but currently we do not have the means to detect defects in cytoplasmic 60S maturation.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Systematic RNAi Analysis of Candidate Factors for Human Ribosome Synthesis</title>
<p>Based on curation of the literature, we compiled a list of proteins with a known or potential function in human ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s009">Table S1</xref>), including ribosomal proteins, nuclear pore complex (NPC) components, proteins of the nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking machinery, and potential or established human homologues of yeast <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. Additionally, we included factors that function in various other cellular pathways that may or may not impact on ribosome biogenesis, like mRNA or tRNA metabolism, protein modification, and degradation (miscellaneous category).</p>
<p>The RNAi screen was performed in a 96-well format using three different siRNAs per target at an siRNA concentration of 10 nM. On each plate, three negative (Allstars siRNA, Qiagen) and three positive (Crm1 siRNA) controls were present. Image analysis was performed in an automated fashion, using image segmentation based on the identification of cell nuclei by Hoechst fluorescence as a first step. Then, 30 different features including the mean nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence intensities, morphological descriptors, and texture marks were extracted from the images using a customized version of Cell Profiler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Carpenter1">[46]</xref>. For example, nucleolar and nucleoplasmic accumulation of Rps2-YFP were distinguished by textural features. Phenotypic analysis of the dataset was performed applying a newly developed supervised machine learning software, the Advanced Cell Classifier (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://acc.ethz.ch" xlink:type="simple">http://acc.ethz.ch</ext-link>). Based on this analysis, we obtained for each siRNA and readout a numerical score, termed hit rate, that was defined by the ratio of cells displaying phenotypes indicative of defects in ribosome synthesis to all reporter-positive interphase cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s014">Text S1</xref>). SiRNAs causing a strong defect on cell growth were excluded from subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>Based on the hit rates, we further selected all targets, which were represented by at least two siRNAs resulting in more than twice the hit rate of the negative controls. Subsequently, these targets were ranked relative to both the negative and positive controls of the respective 96-well plate (for details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s014">Text S1</xref>). Next, we defined a cutoff (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s014">Text S1</xref>), generating a high confidence hit list of targets that are involved in ribosome biogenesis based on the phenotypic classification of the different readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Lists of all numerical data are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s010">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s011">S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s012">S4</xref>.

<title>Ranked high confidence hit list.</title>
<p>Compilation of high confidence hits for the three different readouts, Rps2-YFP, Enp1 IF, and Rpl29-GFP. Rank calculation was as follows: [(hit rate siRNA-X1)−(hit rate negative control)]/[(hit rate positive control)−(hit rate negative control)], where (hit rate negative control) and (hit rate positive control) equals the average hit rate of the two negative or positive controls with the highest hit rate from the same 96-well plate as siRNA-X1. For each hit, the average of the two highest ranked siRNAs is shown. For the Rps2-YFP readout, overall nuclear accumulation (nucleoplasmic and nucleolar) of the reporter was used for hit definition. Note that for “cytoplasmic” Enp1, absolute hit rates are given (ranking could not be performed due to a lack of an appropriate positive control for cytoplasmic accumulation). We set a cutoff to &gt;0.2 for Rps2-YFP, &gt;0.3 for Enp1 IF, and &gt;0.25 for Rpl29-GFP (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s014">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Proteins Required for Efficient Ribosome Synthesis in Human Cells</title>
<p>Altogether, we identified 153 targets that displayed a phenotype in one or several of our readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A Venn diagram of these high confidence hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) shows that there is a large coherence for the 40S readouts, with 84% of nuclear Enp1 IF hits also scoring as Rps2-YFP hits. Interestingly, there is also a significant fraction of targets common to nuclear steps in both 40S and 60S biogenesis (see below). Hits shared between all readouts are highly enriched for nucleoporins, the constituents of NPCs. Analysis of the hit distribution with respect to the functional categories of targets revealed that, as expected, ribosomal proteins were retrieved to a large extent, whereas only very few hits were found within the miscellaneous category, further illustrating the specificity of the used readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>).</p>

(B) Distribution of high confidence hits to the different categories for each readout. (C) Phenotypic classification of targets with respect to different nuclear 40S biogenesis defects based on nucleolar or nucleoplasmic accumulation of Rps2-YFP. Classification was performed using the ratio of cells with a “nucleoplasmic” phenotype to all cells with a nuclear phenotype (nucleolar and nucleoplasmic). A value of 0 equals 100% of the hit-classified cells have a “nucleolar” phenotype, and a value of 1 equals 100% “nucleoplasmic” hits. Representative images after depletion of selected human SSU processome components (Utp11, Utp3, Imp4, Utp18, Nol14) and NPC components (Nup107, Nup98, Nup54, Nup214, Nup155) are shown.</p>

<p>To test the reproducibility of the screening results, we performed two tests. First, the screen was repeated for a random subset of plates (∼50%). This analysis verified the high quality of the hit annotation, as 88% of the included high confidence hits for Rps2-YFP, 86% for Enp1, and 88% for Rpl29-GFP were confirmed (unpublished data). Notably, original hits that were not reproduced mostly turned up either just below the cutoff or were confirmed by only one siRNA during repetition. Second, to address whether the siRNA concentration was limiting, we repeated the whole analysis for the Rps2-YFP readout at an siRNA concentration of 25 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Importantly, this analysis confirmed 93% of our hits obtained at 10 nM. Although we obtained more hits at 25 nM, the higher siRNA concentration caused stronger effects on cell growth and likely increased off-target effects.</p>

<title>Nuclear 40S maturation</title>
<p>The Rps2-YFP readout allowed us to distinguish between nucleolar and nucleoplasmic defects in 40S subunit maturation. To delineate the contribution of individual factors along the nuclear 40S maturation pathway, we determined a numerical score for each target by calculating the ratio of cells displaying nucleoplasmic Rps2-YFP accumulation to all cells with a phenotype (nucleoplasmic and nucleolar) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). All targets were then sorted by their score on an ascending scale from 0 to 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s013">Table S5</xref>). Low values (approaching 0) are indicative of nucleolar defects, whereas high values (approaching 1) reflect nucleoplasmic accumulation of the Rps2-YFP reporter. The power of this analysis is demonstrated by the fact that various factors that are human homologs of subunits of the yeast nucleolar SSU processome complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Granneman1">[10]</xref>, which is involved in early subunit maturation, indeed have low scores. In contrast, NPC components required for subunit export are clustered at the high, “nucleoplasmic” end of the scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Overall, the majority of targets have low scores, with 82% of targets having predominantly “nucleolar” classified cells, i.e. scores below 0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s013">Table S5</xref>). Thus, most of the identified factors are required for 40S maturation in the nucleolus. Likewise, early stages of ribosome biogenesis in yeast are known to depend on the largest fraction of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Tschochner1">[7]</xref>.</p>

<title>40S biogenesis responds to 60S biogenesis defects</title>
<p>The biggest group of hits consists of ribosomal proteins (RP). For the Rps2-YFP readout, ribosomal proteins of the small subunit (RPS) are numerous and the highest ranked; likewise, for the Rpl29-GFP readout, the highest ranked hits are ribosomal proteins of the large subunit (RPL). Interestingly, depletion of various RPL also impaired 40S biogenesis. In comparison, depletion of RPS only weakly affected 60S biogenesis, as indicated by the lack of RPS in the Rpl29-GFP hit list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In yeast, the early precursor for both subunits (90S particle) was shown to contain both RPS and 40S biogenesis factors, whereas RPL and 60S biogenesis factors were virtually absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Grandi1">[9]</xref>. Therefore, it seems counterintuitive that depletion of human RPS does not severely affect 60S biogenesis. However, this apparent weak sensitivity of 60S biogenesis to loss of individual RPS is consistent with a previous report showing that depletion of Rps6 in mouse blocks 40S biogenesis but leaves 60S biogenesis unaffected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Volarevic1">[47]</xref>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, depletion of RPS has a very strong effect on 18S rRNA production, whereas 25S rRNA biogenesis is significantly less affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-FerreiraCerca1">[48]</xref>. Also data on individual <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors in yeast support the conclusion that defects in 60S production have a stronger impact on 40S biogenesis than vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Dez1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Shirai1">[50]</xref>, in agreement with our global analysis in human cells.</p>
<p>Taken together, these observations indicate that a subunit imbalance caused by 60S shortage is more deleterious to the cell than a 40S deficit. Possibly, subunit imbalance in the cytoplasm, i.e. decreased levels of 60S subunits, generates a signal relayed into the nucleus to tune down de novo synthesis of 40S. A plausible trigger may be the accumulation of mRNA-bound 40S subunits that are unable to complete translation initiation due to insufficient amounts of free 60S subunits. In the future, it will be interesting to learn which mechanism(s)—other than the processing from a common pre-rRNA transcript—might contribute to maintain an optimal subunit balance.</p>

Positive control: Crm1; negative controls: Allstars (Qiagen) and Rps4Y1 (Y-chromosome encoded). Rps3 depletion is shown as an example of differences detected with the Rps2-YFP (nuclear accumulation) and Enp1 IF (cytoplasmic accumulation) readouts. (B) Rio2 localization after depletion of RPS by RNAi (10 nM siRNAs, 72 h) in the absence or presence of 10 nM leptomycin B (LMB) for 2 h prior to fixation. Endogenous Rio2 was detected by immunofluorescence. Representative images are given for control, Crm1, Rps3, and Rps3A depletion. (C) List of RPS proteins that caused defects in nuclear accumulation of Rio2 upon LMB treatment when downregulated by RNAi in (B). An RPS was defined as a hit if more than 20% of cells were classified as “cytoplasmic” Rio2 after LMB treatment. The average of the two highest scoring siRNAs is given. *For RspA, only 1 siRNA gave a phenotype. (D) RPS were sorted according to the phenotypes detected in the Rps2-YFP, Enp1 IF, and Rio2 IF readouts and grouped with respect to their nuclear or cytoplasmic requirement for human 40S biogenesis. “Nuclear” classified RPS were either detected with Rps2-YFP only (red) or with both the Rps2-YFP and Enp1 IF readouts (orange). Classification of “cytoplasmic” RPS is based on Enp1 IF (yellow), Rio2 IF (+LMB) (brown), or both (green; depletion of these RPS also caused nuclear Rps2-YFP accumulation). FAU was scored as a nuclear Rps2-YFP hit and a cytoplasmic Rio2 IF (+LMB) hit (blue). RPS marked by an asterisk scored positive for one siRNA by at least 7 times the hit rate of negative controls. The yeast RPS classification into four groups (I–IV) is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-FerreiraCerca1">[48]</xref> and described in the text.

<p>For the remaining RPS, a few were classified as hits that caused nuclear Rps2-YFP accumulation but cytoplasmic enrichment of Enp1. Because cytoplasmic Enp1 localization in principle could also stem from Enp1 not bound to pre-40S subunits, we additionally monitored the localization of another <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor, Rio2, that allows for a second readout on cytoplasmic subunit maturation. Rio2, which is a stable component of late, cytoplasmic pre-40S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Zemp2">[45]</xref>, appears cytoplasmic at steady state, but rapidly accumulates in the nucleus upon inhibition of the export receptor Crm1 by the drug leptomycin B (LMB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Zemp2">[45]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, when pre-40S subunits are stalled in their cytoplasmic maturation, Rio2 is trapped on these particles in the cytoplasm and fails to relocalize to the nucleus upon inhibition of Crm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, Rps3 RNAi ± LMB). Using this approach, we confirmed that all RPS, which had caused a cytoplasmic Enp1 phenotype upon depletion, were indeed required for cytoplasmic pre-40S maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g004">Figure 4B, C</xref>). The nuclear export defect observed using the Rps2-YFP readout upon depletion of these particular RPS might be caused by a kinetic delay in export because the Rps2-YFP readout readily senses kinetic delays in nuclear subunit maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Zemp2">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>When we compile these data and classify human RPS according to their requirement for nuclear or cytoplasmic 40S maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), we find a striking agreement with the yeast data, except for Rps7, which we classified as a “nuclear” hit but was assigned to group IV in yeast. All human homologs of yeast groups I and II RPS score as “nuclear” hits, whereas those corresponding to yeast group III RPS are predominantly found among the “cytoplasmic” hits. The respective human RPS of group IV also score “cytoplasmic”. When compared to bacterial ribosome formation, human RPS that correspond to <italic>E. coli</italic> primary and secondary binders cluster as nuclear hits, whereas homologs of tertiary binders are “cytoplasmic”. We confirmed our classification for selected RPS by Northern blot analysis of rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Moreover, our data fit well with recent data on the effects of depletion of a subset of human ribosomal proteins on rRNA processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Robledo1">[52]</xref>. Thus, the specific requirement for individual ribosomal proteins of the SSU along the 40S maturation pathway is conserved from <italic>E. coli</italic> to man.</p>

<title><italic>Trans</italic>-acting factors involved in subunit synthesis</title>
<p>For all our readouts, many targets that were identified as hits belong to the ribosome biogenesis category based on their homology to yeast <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. Hence, our dataset establishes a functional conservation of these human proteins in ribosome synthesis. Altogether, 65 factors of this class caused severe defects in ribosome synthesis when downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). For example, the Rps2-YFP and Enp1 hit lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g002">Figure 2</xref>) are enriched for human homologs of yeast 40S <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, such as BMS1, PNO1, and WBSCR22, corresponding to yeast <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors Bms1, Dim2, and Bud23, respectively. Likewise, the Rpl29-GFP hit list contains human homologs of yeast 60S <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, such as Mrt4 (MRTO4), Sqt1 (AAMP), or Rea1 (MDN1). Thus, the pathway-specific role of these factors is conserved in humans. However, we note that depletion of 60S biogenesis factors can also affect the 40S biogenesis pathway as observed for Sqt1 (AAMP)—in agreement with the finding that knockdown of RPL proteins influences 40S formation. Generally, a functional conservation of factors between yeast and human as revealed by our dataset may also motivate efforts to understand their molecular role in more detail.</p>

These data showed that both 40S and 60S biogenesis were slightly compromised upon miRNA-10a inhibition.

In these experiments we found no evidence for a phenotype in nuclear 60S biogenesis similar to that caused by Exp5 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s006">Figures S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s007">S7</xref>).

However, defects in 60S biogenesis were more prominent. Thus, there appears to be a stronger dependence of 60S than 40S biogenesis on the presence of Exp5.

Note that the HeLa cell extract had been pre-depleted for ribosomes and tRNAs. The depletion of ribosomes ensured that the TAP-purified particles were the sole ribosomal particles present.

<p>Reflecting their requirement for pre-60S export, both Exp5 and Crm1 bound to this pre-60S particle in a RanGTP-dependent manner, whereas exportin-t (Exp-t), another exportin that was not detected as a hit in the screen, did not bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

The addition of competitor pre-miRNA to the binding reaction inhibited Exp5 binding but left Crm1 binding unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s008">Figure S8C</xref>), showing that Crm1 binds independently of Exp5 and indicating that Exp5 uses its RNA-binding interface for pre-60S particle association. Overall, the observed RanGTP-dependent binding of Crm1 and Exp5 to pre-60S TAP particles reflects a bona fide exportin/cargo interaction.</p>
<p>Since the depletion of Exp5 had also affected 40S biogenesis, albeit to a lesser extent than 60S synthesis, we analyzed whether Exp5 binding is 60S-specific or can also be observed for pre-40S particles. Pre-40S particles were similarly purified by TAP using the 40S <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor PNO1 (Dim2) as bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These pre-40S particles contain other expected 40S <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors such as Rio2 and Nob1, as well as 40S ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g006">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). Crm1 bound to this particle in a RanGTP-dependent manner and the particle can therefore be considered an export-competent pre-40S. In contrast, Exp5 did not bind to this pre-40S particle (or another purified pre-40S particle, unpublished data), further illustrating the specificity of 60S binding. These data substantiate a direct role for Exp5 in 60S export.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that RanGTP-dependent binding of Crm1 to pre-40S and pre-60S particles has not been demonstrated previously. Thus, this analysis of exportin binding to pre-ribosomal subunits also provides the first biochemical evidence for the prevailing model of a direct role of Crm1 in the export of both ribosomal subunits.</p>

Injection of Crm1 antibodies resulted in nuclear accumulation of both 28S and 18S rRNAs, consistent with previous experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Thomas1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Trotta1">[35]</xref>. Upon injection of the Exp5 antibody, 28S rRNA and 6S rRNA, the precursor to 5.8S rRNA, accumulated in the nucleus, but 18S rRNA export was unaffected. Thus, Exp5 is the second exportin besides Crm1 required for 60S export in higher eukaryotes.</p>

<p>In yeast, deletion of Msn5, the homolog of Exp5, does not impair ribosomal subunit export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-StageZimmermann1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Moy1">[19]</xref>, indicating that pre-60S export is different between yeast and man. Moreover, recent studies have identified two additional export factors besides Crm1 that contribute to 60S export in yeast: the general mRNA export receptor Mex67/Mtr2 and the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor Arx1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Bradatsch1">[65]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Yao1">[67]</xref>. The domains in Mex67/Mtr2 and Arx1 required for pre-60S binding and NPC interaction, respectively, are not conserved from yeast to humans; hence, their human homologs are not expected to contribute to 60S export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Bradatsch1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Yao1">[67]</xref>. Notably, we did not detect the human homolog of Mex67 (Tap, NXF1) on our purified pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000522.s008">Figure S8B</xref>) and also found no evidence for the involvement of Tap or EBP1 (Arx1) in 60S biogenesis in our screen. However, we note that in yeast the depletion of Arx1 alone causes no 60S export defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Bradatsch1">[65]</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus, at least two export receptors are required for 60S export in both humans and yeast. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the binding of two exportins to a pre-60S particle. Importantly, neither receptor on its own is sufficient to promote 60S export in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000522-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Together, these data suggest that a particle as big as a 60S pre-ribosome requires more than one transport receptor for NPC passage. The usage of the pre-miRNA export receptor Exp5 for 60S subunit export opens the possibility for crosstalk between miRNA biogenesis and 60S export, but it remains to be seen whether cells make use of this. In yeast, a crosstalk between mRNA and 60S export has been proposed based on the shared usage of the export receptor Mex67/Mtr2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Yao2">[68]</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Perspective</title>
<p>We present a first, partial protein inventory for human ribosome biogenesis. The scope of this RNAi screen was to evaluate candidate genes for human ribosome synthesis, building largely on the knowledge about eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis obtained in yeast. We provide a list of 153 proteins (including 91 non-ribosomal proteins) that are required for ribosome synthesis in human cells. Moreover, both primary and analyzed data of all investigated targets can be accessed through an online database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hcpb.ethz.ch" xlink:type="simple">http://hcpb.ethz.ch</ext-link>). Additionally, we demonstrate a direct requirement for the RanGTP-binding transport receptor Exp5 in the biogenesis of 60S subunits in vertebrates.</p>
<p>The presented RNAi screen can be extended in future to perform unbiased genome-wide searches for additional factors that participate in ribosome biogenesis. We anticipate that many features of the process in vertebrates will be found to be analogous to those in yeast, but differences have already been identified. These include proteins that participate in ribosome biosynthesis in yeast or humans and are not conserved between yeast and vertebrates, for example vertebrate nucleophosmin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Maggi1">[69]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Yu1">[71]</xref>, as well as the many uncharacterized proteins present in human nucleoli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Ahmad1">[72]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Andersen1">[73]</xref>. Moreover, regulation of ribosome synthesis is likely to be more complex in vertebrates than in unicellular organisms.</p>
<p>Systematic RNAi together with complementing approaches might ultimately lead to a comprehensive inventory of proteins involved in this fundamental process in mammalian cells and may pave the way towards a deeper mechanistic knowledge. Given the emerging evidence for numerous links between human diseases and ribosome biogenesis/function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Dai1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000522-Narla1">[76]</xref>, such progress is eagerly awaited.</p>
