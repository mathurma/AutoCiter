<abstract>
<p>Microbes are predominantly found in surface-attached and spatially structured polymicrobial communities. Within these communities, microbial cells excrete a wide range of metabolites, setting the stage for interspecific metabolic interactions. The links, however, between metabolic and ecological interactions (functional relationships), and species spatial organization (structural relationships) are still poorly understood. Here, we use an individual-based modelling framework to simulate the growth of a two-species surface-attached community where food (resource) is traded for detoxification (service) and investigate how metabolic constraints of individual species shape the emergent structural and functional relationships of the community. We show that strong metabolic interdependence drives the emergence of mutualism, robust interspecific mixing, and increased community productivity. Specifically, we observed a striking and highly stable emergent lineage branching pattern, generating a persistent lineage mixing that was absent when the metabolic exchange was removed. These emergent community properties are driven by demographic feedbacks, such that aid from neighbouring cells directly enhances focal cell growth, which in turn feeds back to neighbour fecundity. In contrast, weak metabolic interdependence drives conflict (exploitation or competition), and in turn greater interspecific segregation. Together, these results support the idea that species structural and functional relationships represent the net balance of metabolic interdependencies.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Understanding the structure and functioning of polymicrobial communities is a major challenge in biology, as witnessed by the dramatic yet mysterious roles played by the human microbiome in human health. Microbial multispecies communities often show complex spatial structures and patterns of metabolic exchange, yet our understanding of how species spatial and ecological relationships emerge from the metabolic rules of species interactions is still limited. What mechanisms underlie multispecies community self-organization? In this study, we simulate the growth of a minimal—two species— community and show how the emergent properties of community spatial structure and function depend on the nature of metabolic interactions between the two species. We found that strong mutual need for help (strong metabolic interdependence) favours the emergence of mutualism, increased productivity and lineage mixing via striking and highly stable branching patterns. In contrast, when the mutual need for help is low, conflict dominates and the two species tend to segregate. Finally, we show how the emergent species mixing follows from a positive feedback of providing aid to neighbouring helpers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is now widely accepted that most polymicrobial communities living in natural environments form spatially structured and surface-attached consortia (biofilms) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Costerton1">[1]</xref>. There has recently been a great interest in investigating how spatial structure may forge and stabilize the complex web of interactions occurring within these multispecies communities, including mutualistic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Elias1">[2]</xref> and competitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Rendueles1">[3]</xref> relationships. Empirical work in multispecies biofilms has acknowledged that species composition affects community structure and species distribution within the biofilm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-TolkerNielsen1">[4]</xref> as a result, for example, of mixing species that have distinct monoculture structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Murga1">[5]</xref>, or via metabolic interactions, such as cross-feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Christensen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Hansen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Nielsen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Breugelmans1">[9]</xref> or detoxification of exogenous waste products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Cowan1">[10]</xref>. The type of carbon source also plays a major role in generating the diversity of spatial arrangements observed in polymicrobial communities, as varying the source of carbon likely alters the metabolic interactions between members of the community. For example, in a two-species biofilm consisting of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, Nielsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Nielsen1">[8]</xref> observed that when the two species were competing for a common resource (non-cross-feeding medium), the biofilm consisted of separate microcolonies (high species segregation). In contrast, when the two species were involved in a one-way obligate cross-feeding interaction (cross-feeding medium), the microcolonies consisted of both species (greater mixing).</p>
<p>Evolutionary theory has suggested that spatial mixing favours the evolution of mutualism because it keeps mutualistic partners in close proximity, thereby allowing for stronger reciprocity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Frank1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Doebeli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Foster1">[13]</xref>, which may in turn facilitate the exchange of metabolites between partners. However, it has also been proposed that, under some conditions, spatial mixing may impair mutualism because of spatial limits on exchange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Verbruggen1">[14]</xref>, or because it hinders cooperators' clustering in within-species cooperation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Hauert1">[15]</xref>. Empirical work on the evolution of microbial cross-feeding mutualisms has also found opposite responses to environment structure. For example, Harcombe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Harcombe1">[16]</xref> provided empirical support for the benefits of spatial structure in the evolution of mutualistic cross-feeding between <italic>Salmonella</italic> and auxotrophic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. However, another study on the nascent cross-feeding mutualism between <italic>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Methanococcus maripaludis</italic> showed that mutualism was initially favoured in a well-mixed rather than static environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Hillesland1">[17]</xref>. Although the authors suggested that this different response to environmental structure is due to the lack of a direct fitness cost of cooperation in the latter cross-feeding model system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Hillesland2">[18]</xref>, other mechanisms may be at play as well. The spatial separation (distance) between species has also been identified as a key factor for the stable coexistence of a synthetic mutualistic bacterial community <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Kim1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>While evolutionary ecology has traditionally assumed that structure is a fixed environmental property (i.e. either structured or well-mixed), there has been a recent interest in regarding structure as an emergent property of the aggregate behaviour of individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Lion1">[20]</xref>). Individual-based simulations of microbial growth have started to shed some light on this topic. For example, Nadell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Nadell1">[21]</xref> explored how physical and biological parameters of bacterial growth in biofilm affect lineage segregation, which in turn determines the fate of within-species cooperation. Using the same framework, it has also been proposed that within-species cooperation can be favoured due to social insulation of cooperators from non-cooperators by a second species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Mitri1">[22]</xref>. Recently, using a mix of experiments and simulations, Momeni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Momeni1">[23]</xref> showed that strong inter-population cooperation led to inter-population mixing in microbial communities, and specifically in a pattern of successive layering. Despite this, however, far too little attention has been given to how specific metabolic interactions generate the emergent spatial and functional properties of microbial communities.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to address this question by investigating how metabolic constraints of individual species shape the emergent functional relationships and spatial structuring of a two-species community. For this, we focus on a specific type of interspecific metabolic interaction - trading food for detoxification (for empirical examples see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Samuel1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Hillesland1">[17]</xref>; for a theoretical approach see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Estrela1">[25]</xref>), and we explore how a partner's need for help (either detoxification to the producer or food to the cross-feeder) affects the ecology, spatial structure, and productivity of the two-species community.</p>
<p>Using an individual-based modeling (IBM) framework that models microbial population growth on a solid surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Lardon1">[26]</xref>, our results show that stronger metabolic interdependence generates more mutualism, more interspecific mixing, less sensitivity to initial conditions and enhanced community productivity. The emergence of this metabolism-dependent community structure and functioning is driven by demographic feedbacks, such that providing aid to a mutualistic partner generates a positive feedback on the individual's growth whereas providing aid to a competitor or exploiter generates a negative feedback on the individual's growth. In consequence, demographic feedbacks strengthen mutualistic relationships via increased lineage mixing, and weaken competitive relationships via increased segregation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We model the growth of a two-species microbial community on an inert surface using an individual-based modeling (IBM) framework described in detail in Lardon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Lardon1">[26]</xref>. Individual-based models have proven useful in addressing ecological and evolutionary questions in biofilms and are a powerful approach to study the emergent properties of microbial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Nadell1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Mitri1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Schluter1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Xavier1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Bucci1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Kreft1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Merkey1">[31]</xref>. Briefly, this framework simulates the growth of bacterial cells on a surface that grow by consuming nutrients present in their local environment, and then divide. The transport of solutes into and within the biofilm occurs through diffusion, which is assumed to occur much faster than cell growth and division. Cell movement within the biofilm occurs as a result of cell growth, division, shrinking and death. Bacterial cells interact mechanically with neighbouring cells by shoving for space, a process that minimizes cells overlap. Metabolic interactions are introduced by the explicit modeling of metabolic intermediates, subject to defined stoichiometry of metabolic reactions and rates of diffusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s012">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, and for more details on the assumptions of the IBM framework see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Lardon1">[26]</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Metabolic interdependence shapes emergent functional relationships</title>
<p>The ecological outcome of the food for detoxification interaction depends on the balance between costs and benefits of interspecific association. The potential costs are interspecific competition for common nutrients and space, while the potential benefits are food for the cross-feeder and detoxification for the producer. To determine the type of ecological interaction forged between producer and cross-feeder, we measured the net costs and benefits from association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Bronstein1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Connor1">[33]</xref> by comparing species growth rates when grown alone with their growth rates when grown in coculture (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). If both species have an increase in growth rate relative to their growth rate in monoculture, the association is mutualistic. If both species have a decrease in growth rate when grown in coculture relative to their growth rate in monoculture, the association is competitive. If one species benefits at the expense of the other, then there is exploitation.</p>
<p>Analytical work under the limiting assumption of a well-mixed (planktonic) community found that diverse ecological relationships can emerge from a one-way cross-feeding interaction where nutrients are traded for detoxification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Estrela1">[25]</xref>. Does the same result hold when the environment is spatially structured? To address this question, we first investigated how the degree of metabolic interdependency (varying along two species axes) shapes the ecological relationships between two species. Specifically, we vary by-product toxicity from non-toxic to highly toxic (variations in metabolite toxicity can occur, for instance, via changes in pH or the type of metabolite produced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Davison1">[34]</xref>) and the degree of cross-feeder obligacy from non-cross-feeder to obligate cross-feeder (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s001">fig. S1A</xref> for a schematic representation of species interactions, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Metabolic interdependency implies that a species' chemical environment is improved in at least one specific dimension by the presence of another species (for instance, detoxification or provision of a growth substrate). However this specific chemical aid does not imply that the recipient gains a net growth advantage from association, as the two species may also compete for other limiting resources (space and/or nutrients). We found that metabolic interdependency gives rise to diverse ecological interactions, ranging from mutualism to competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g001">figs. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s002">S2</xref>), thus corroborating our previous finding for well-mixed populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Estrela1">[25]</xref>. Specifically, mutualism only emerges when the specific help received outweighs the competitive costs endured for both partners.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g001">fig. 1A</xref> we have assumed that the two species compete for space and limited nutrients (unless cross-feeding is entirely obligate). We next ask what is the relative contribution of competition for space and nutrients to our results? Importantly, these two limiting resources are linked as winning the competition for space means getting access to nutrients, and similarly, winning the competition for nutrients means getting access to space. To disentangle their effects we relax nutrient competition (see schematic <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s001">fig. S1B</xref>). As expected, we found that removing competition for nutrients leads to less negative associations, as seen by a shift from competition to exploitation, or from exploitation to mutualism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g001">fig.1A, B</xref>). As toxicity increases, the ability of the producer to compete for a shared nutrient resource is diminished. Therefore, removal of nutrient competition has a disproportionately positive effect on mutualism as toxicity increases.</p>
<p>Our definition of mutualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Estrela1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Bronstein1">[32]</xref>) implies that the total productivity of the two species community will be greater than the summed productivities of the two species apart. However, our results also show that enhanced community productivity does not itself imply mutualism, as exploitative relationships can also lead to a community gain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s003">figs. S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s004">S4</xref>). This is consistent with empirical studies that have documented that resource (niche) partitioning via cross-feeding interactions enhances community productivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Ramsey1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Lawrence1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Poltak1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Periasamy1">[38]</xref>, with the caveat that enhanced community productivity does not alone dictate a mutualistic relationship.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Metabolic interdependence drives species intermixing</title>
<p>Theoretical modelling has suggested that population segregation (high relatedness) can favour within-species cooperation because segregation keeps the benefits of cooperation close to cooperators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Nadell1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Mitri1">[22]</xref>, although these benefits are potentially mitigated by enhanced competition among kin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Frank2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Queller1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-West1">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been suggested that population mixing favours between-species cooperation because it facilitates the exchange of the benefits of cooperation, therefore creating a tension between within-species cooperation and between-species cooperation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Mitri1">[22]</xref>. In our food for detoxification interaction, the effect of within-species cooperation on population segregation is relaxed, therefore allowing for between-species mutualism to occur under a broader range of conditions. In a recent simulation and experimental study, it has been shown that strong inter-population cooperation leads to inter-population mixing in microbial communities, and specifically in a pattern of successive layering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Momeni1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on these observations, we next hypothesized that varying metabolic interdependence would dictate the degree of species intermixing within the two-species community, and in a way that reflects the net costs and benefits of interspecific association. In particular, we would expect that increasing metabolic interdependence would result in higher species intermixing within the biofilm to facilitate trade. We generally found that, as by-product toxicity increases, intermixing increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g002">figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s005">S5</xref>). Similarly, increasing cross-feeder obligacy leads to higher intermixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g002">figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s005">S5</xref>), except in the non-cross feeding medium (and intermediate to high by-product toxicity). The latter scenario likely occurs because the fast growing cross-feeder cells insulate the poorly growing producer cells in separate enclaves, thus leading to greater mixing. The segregation index (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) provides a global statistic of population structure, but does not reveal the developmental patterning of the two intermixing species or their resulting shared architecture. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s014">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s015">S2</xref> illustrate the resulting development and architecture of the two-species community, and highlight that strong mixing is achieved via a striking and emergent branching pattern producing increased inter-digitation and contact surface between interdependent cell lineages. Branching-like patterns within single clonal lineages have been observed previously under conditions of low nutrient availability, due to stochastic variations in a thin active growth layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Nadell1">[21]</xref>. The resulting separated ‘towers’ (observable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g002">fig. 2D</xref>) are mutually repulsive, as growth towards conspecifics increases competition for limiting resources. In contrast, as mutual interdependence increases, demographic movement towards heterospecifics becomes increasingly rewarding, resulting in branching of lineages towards heterospecifics and away from conspecifics, generating a robust and stabilising mixing pattern.</p>

<title>Strong interdependence generates more robust mixing</title>
<p>It has been recently documented that population intermixing of a yeast obligate cooperative community is robust to a broad range of initial conditions, including initial ratio and densities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Momeni1">[23]</xref>. In this study, however, the authors assumed that cells were randomly seeded. Given this, we hypothesized that the degree of intermixing at inoculation may influence the ecological and structural relationship of the two species trading food for detoxification, by modulating the establishment of key metabolic and demographic feedbacks. Indeed, increasing segregation at inoculation might have two opposite effects: on the one hand, we would expect the costs of interspecific competition to be delayed, but on the other hand, the benefits of trade would be reduced.</p>
<p>To examine this, we repeated the simulations of monoculture, facultative cross-feeding coculture, and obligate cross-feeding coculture, but now the cells were inoculated in two microcolonies of size 30 µm and separated by a distance of 70 µm from each other (coculture) or in a single microcolony of size 30 µm (monoculture). The degree of initial intermixing was changed by varying the proportions of producer and cross-feeder in each microcolony but keeping the total number of inoculated cells constant and 1∶1. This means that, for example, when both microcolonies were inoculated with equal number of cells of producer and cross-feeder type, then they were completely intermixed (i.e. segregation index, <italic>s</italic>, equal to 0, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). When one microcolony was inoculated with cells of producer type only and the other microcolony with cells of cross-feeder type only, then they were fully segregated (i.e. segregation index, <italic>s</italic>, equal to 1). Note that monoculture simulations were repeated using the same seeding rule to prevent any bias from inoculation crowding effects when we are comparing monoculture and coculture growth.</p>
<p>In the absence of metabolic interaction, the two species (here, differing only in colour) tend to segregate, independently of initial intermixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g003">fig. 3B</xref>). This agrees with modelling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Nadell1">[21]</xref> and empirical work on the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Buttery1">[42]</xref> showing that spatially structured growth is a passive mechanism that increases relatedness (or lineage segregation). But what happens when the lineages experience metabolic interactions? Our results suggest that the emergent patterns of lineage mixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g002">fig. 2A</xref>) are highly robust against variation in initial inoculum mixing, except when the two species are completely segregated in two separate microcolonies at inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g003">fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s006">fig. S6A–C</xref>). Indeed, if the two species are strongly interdependent, they are conditioned to mix to grow. Thus, when initially segregated, such strong initial segregation may delay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s007">fig. S7A, B</xref>) or even prevent (e.g. when interdependency is too high; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s007">fig. S7C</xref>) the structural relationship to be forged. This result also supports the idea that spatial distance between species plays a critical role for the stable coexistence of obligate mutualistic bacterial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Kim1">[19]</xref>. We also found that the strongly interdependent community shows a strong signature of negative frequency dependent selection (the rare lineage is favoured), ensuring a stable coexistence frequency of around 34% producers, regardless of their initial frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g003">fig. 3C</xref>). In contrast, the control community is sensitive to the proportion of producers at inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g003">fig. 3D</xref>), due to the absence of stabilising mechanisms of interaction.</p>

<title>Demographic drivers of intermixing</title>
<p>To further understand the demographic drivers of intermixing, we break the demographic feedbacks by modifying both initial segregation conditions and the mass-transfer regime (by-product diffusion). First, we simulated the growth of an initially segregated two-species community and separately tracked the growth rates of cells situated nearer towards or further apart from the heterospecific lineage. We found that when metabolic interdependence is high, the cells that are closer to interspecific cells grow better than the cells that are further away from interspecific cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s008">fig. S8A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s016">Video S3</xref>, obligate cross-feeder cells closer to producer cells grow towards the producer cells, i.e. towards the by-product. In turn, this reduces the concentration of toxic by-product in the microenvironment of producer cells that are closer to the obligate cross-feeder, thus favouring the growth of those neighbouring producer cells. This result highlights the importance of demographic feedbacks that follow from growth benefits of trading resources for detoxification in shaping community function and spatial structure. At a more macroscale, the results of demographic feedbacks among mutualists are clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g003">fig. 3C</xref>, where we see the signature of negative frequency-dependence driving the two partners to a stable coexistence point irrespective of initial frequency, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g004">fig. 4AB</xref> where we see an accelerating growth of mutualists with increasing heterospecific proximity and mixing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as observed earlier for intermixed inocula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g002">fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s014">Video S1</xref>), the community branching structure emerges as the community grows, but the branching pattern is now- with separated inocula- more pronounced, probably because of reduced space constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g004">fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s016">Video S3</xref>). The emergence of similar architectures and intermixing statistics between <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s016">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s014">S1</xref> (i.e. separate and intermixed inocula, respectively) highlights the robust community developmental programme that results from strong metabolic interdependencies, which in turn deliver a high-functioning community.</p>
<p>Given facultative cross-feeding, the cross-feeder can grow using the shared limiting nutrient (e.g. glucose) as well as the producer by-product. When the by-product is weakly toxic both producer and cross-feeder cells that grow closer to interspecific cells grow better than the cells that are further away (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s008">fig. S8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s017">Video S4</xref>), but the disadvantage of cells growing further away is now smaller and mixing is reduced. As by-product toxicity increases, producer cells growing closer to the cross-feeder can even grow more slowly than those further away, despite receiving greater detoxification benefits. The producer cells adjacent to cross-feeding cells suffer due to the increased competition for the shared limiting nutrient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s008">fig. S8B</xref>). At a more macroscale, the results of demographic feedbacks among weakly interdependent partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g004">fig. 4CD</xref>) can be seen by a negative correlation between the densities of producer and cross-feeder across replicates following lineage contact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s009">fig. S9B</xref>), as a stochastic advantage to one lineage spells a cost to the competitor lineage (generating the increased variance around the mean in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g004">fig. 4D</xref>). In contrast, strong interdependence generates a positive correlation between producer and cross-feeder across replicates following contact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s009">fig. S9A</xref>), as a stochastic advantage to one lineage drives further advantages to its partner lineage.</p>
<p>The ability to effectively carry out a food-for-detoxification exchange depends ultimately on an effective process of molecular transport from producer to consumer cell. In our final manipulation, we vary the rate of diffusion to explore the importance of mass-transfer processes on the establishment and maintenance of metabolic and demographic feedbacks. We found that when the two species are initially spatially segregated, increasing diffusion improves the performance of both species, due to an enhanced metabolic flux kick-starting the exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g005">figs. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s010">S10A</xref>). In contrast, when the two species are initially mixed, performances (lineage growth rates) are scarcely touched by changes in diffusion over two orders of magnitude, as the initial proximity of the partner lineages assures effective inter-cellular transport even at very low rates of diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g005">figs. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s010">S10B</xref>). The effect of diffusion is however very pronounced on the resulting strength of mutualism. When diffusion is very low, mutualism is far stronger simply because the producers are in much more trouble when alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g005">fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, as diffusion increases, solitary producer colonies suffer less from their byproduct toxicity due to a rapid abiotic removal process, making the net benefit of partnership much weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003398-g005">fig. 5B</xref>). Together, these results illustrate the important and interacting roles played by initial segregation and diffusion in establishing an effective metabolic exchange, and consequently the emergent function and spatial structure of communities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While it is well acknowledged that spatial structure plays a critical role in shaping the ecological outcome of species interactions, our understanding of how community structure and function emerge from the mechanistic bases of species interactions is still poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question by investigating how metabolic constraints of individual species shape the emergent functional and structural relationships of a two-species microbial community that trades food for detoxification.</p>
<p>Specifically, our main findings reveal that mutual interdependence generates a robust and highly stabilising mixing pattern. This happens because demographic movement towards heterospecifics becomes increasingly rewarding, resulting in branching of lineages towards heterospecifics and away from conspecifics. These demographic feedbacks strengthen mutualistic relationships via increased lineage mixing, and weaken competitive relationships via increased segregation. Furthermore, we show that initial mixing and diffusion play a critical role in establishing effective metabolic exchange, and therefore in defining the emergent functional and structural relationships among species.</p>
<p>Strong metabolic interdependence is commonly found in syntrophic (cross-feeding) relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Schink1">[43]</xref>, and empirical evidence for the importance of spatial distribution in the functioning of metabolically interdependent syntrophic consortia is growing in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Pernthaler1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Haroon1">[45]</xref>. But, what if mutualism is based on bidirectional cross-feeding rather than a food for detoxification mutualism? Recent work has suggested that strong inter-population cooperation, in which each strain depends on the provision of an essential metabolite by the other strain, leads to population mixing in a pattern of successive layering (for yeast see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Momeni1">[23]</xref>, for <italic>E. coli</italic> see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Brenner1">[46]</xref>). One potential explanation for this discrepancy in spatial pattern between their findings and ours is the specific nature of the mechanistic interaction (e.g. bidirectional cross-feeding <italic>vs</italic> food for detoxification cross-feeding). To assess this possibility we ran additional simulations assuming bidirectional cross-feeding instead of food for detoxification cross-feeding and we observed a hybrid result. We still observe a characteristic emergent branching pattern, although now the producer forms a mantle layer at the top of the biofilm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s011">fig. S11</xref>). Understanding the drivers of these distinct spatial patterns is an interesting area of research to be pursued.</p>
<p>A striking result in our simulations is the emergent two-species branching structure of communities that exhibit strong interdependence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s014">Videos S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s016">S3</xref>). Branching patterns are commonly found in nature (e.g. neurons, blood vessels, trees). In bacteria, branching has been observed in swarming colonies, including <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Julkowska1">[47]</xref> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Xavier2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-vanDitmarsch1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Kohler1">[50]</xref>, but what may explain such community architecture here? Branching seems to emerge because of lineage growth with demographic movement away from conspecifics and towards interspecifics (helpers), thereby maximizing the surface contact area with interspecifics. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s016">Video S3</xref> suggests that the first mover is the obligate cross-feeder which branches into regions of high by-product concentrations (high toxicity for producer). This relieves inhibition on the producer, which can now grow until toxicity returns.</p>
<p>Here, we have assumed that the facultative cross-feeder is able to use both the common resource and the by-product independently of their concentrations in the environment. This means that the trade-off between the cross-feeder's ability to use both nutrients is fixed, and not under regulatory control. Regulatory control, however, plays a critical role in bacterial metabolism and social dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Xavier2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Kummerli1">[51]</xref>. One could relax this assumption and allow for regulatory control in our cross-feeding model. For example, common resource vs by-product consumption could be a plastic trait that depends on the local concentration of the by-product. Specifically, one could assume a scenario where the metabolism of the by-product inhibits the uptake of the common resource <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Brown1">[52]</xref>. While outside the scope of this study, we believe that investigating how metabolic plasticity in resource use affects the structure-function dynamics of interspecific interactions would add to our understanding of mapping metabolism to ecology and structure in polymicrobial communities.</p>
<p>Our work looks at interspecific mutualisms that arise due to by-product mutualisms, as the benefit provided to the other species occurs as a result of a trait carrying no immediate, direct cost to the actor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Connor1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Sachs1">[53]</xref>. Additionally, our model assumes that cell movement is purely due to demographic processes of cell growth. This means that there is no behavioural mechanism that preferentially directs help towards a mutualistic partner (such as in partner choice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Foster1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Sachs1">[53]</xref>) or makes an individual preferentially move towards a mutualistic partner. While it is unclear whether partner choice exists in bacteria, motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-An1">[54]</xref> and chemotaxis are behavioural mechanisms that allow bacterial cells to move towards favourable environments (e.g. food gradient) and therefore influence species functional and structural relationships. It would be interesting to see how these mechanisms would affect the functioning and structuring of our food for detoxification association. One would nevertheless expect a similar general structural pattern even when behavioural processes are at play, i.e. mix when the benefits of association outweigh the costs, but segregate when the costs of association outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>Another explicit assumption of our model is that cells are growing on an inert surface and that the nutrient diffuses from the bulk (above) into the biofilm. This implies that only the cells that are at the surface of the biofilm are able to access the nutrient and grow. This is a common assumption when using this individual-based framework, but this may not always be the case as in, for example, the gut environment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Schluter1">[27]</xref> for an individual-based model of host-microbiota interactions where the authors assume bidirectional nutrient gradient). Under these conditions, and assuming sloughing of microbial cells, different emergent structures and branching patterns may arise.</p>
<p>Our study illustrates how community structural and functional relationships emerge from metabolic signatures of interspecific interaction. Although we focused on a specific mechanism of trade - food for detoxification of a metabolic by-product - we believe that our approach of mapping metabolism into function and spatial organization can be extended to other types of microbial associations. It would be interesting, for instance, to investigate what are the emergent functional and structural relationships of a two-species community trading food for detoxification of an exogenous toxic metabolite (e.g. antibiotic). Also, trading food for detoxification implies that when mutualism emerges, it is intrinsically resistant to interspecific cheating strategies. This conclusion lends greater relevance to our ecological results, however it still leaves open a number of questions on the potential for coevolutionary dynamics within this mutualistic space, for instance towards greater rates of waste production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Estrela1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, we suggest that further research into the interplay between the molecular mechanisms of species interactions and the ensuing population and community dynamics is needed to foster our understanding of how natural microbial communities emerge and are maintained in the first place, as well as predict how they may be affected by environmental perturbations on both ecological and evolutionary timescales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-OBrien1">[55]</xref>.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Model</title>
<p>Our model assumes two species, a producer (A) of a metabolic by-product (E), and a cross-feeder (B) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s001">fig. S1</xref> for a schematic representation) growing on an inert surface. The producer and cross-feeder are ecological competitors for a common limiting nutrient (R, e.g. glucose) that diffuses from the bulk (above) into the biofilm. The bulk consists of a liquid and well-mixed compartment where the concentration of nutrient (R<sub>bulk</sub>) is held constant. Thus, the growths of species A, and species B, are a function of the rates of uptake of R in the local microenvironment of A and B, respectively. In addition, the cross-feeder's growth is enhanced by its ability to use the producer waste product E, while the producer's growth is decreased by E (i.e. toxic waste product). Thus the concentrations of R and E vary in space and time due to production/consumption reactions and diffusion.</p>
<p>The metabolic reactions and stoichiometric matrix used in the model are described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s012">Table S1</xref>. Briefly, the reaction of transformation of R into E and biomass A (X<sub>A</sub>, cell growth of A) follows a Monod-form kinetic, and E inhibits this reaction via simple inhibition. The reaction of transformation of R and E into biomass B (X<sub>B</sub>, cell growth of B) follows a Monod-form kinetic on R and E, respectively. Also, we assume that the producer has more affinity and is more efficient at using the main nutrient (R) than the cross-feeder, such that <italic>K<sub>R, A</sub>&lt;K<sub>R, B</sub></italic> and <italic>Y<sub>R, A</sub>&gt;Y<sub>R, B</sub></italic>, respectively. This may represent, for example, a cost of resource generalism to the cross-feeder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Kassen1">[56]</xref>. We assume that the obligate cross-feeder (B<sub>obl</sub>) is specialist on the producer's waste product and incapable of using the limiting nutrient. This means that the two species do not use overlapping nutrients and that the cross-feeder depends on its partner's waste product for growth. Specialization on a partner's waste product of metabolism can occur via mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Rosenzweig1">[57]</xref> or due to an exclusion mechanism in which the metabolism of the waste product inhibits the uptake of the limiting nutrient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Brown1">[52]</xref>. In addition, we assumed three facultative cross-feeders. Consistent with previous empirical work we assume that the facultative cross-feeders are able to use both the common limiting nutrient and the metabolic by-product (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Lawrence1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Poltak1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Rosenzweig1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Turner1">[58]</xref>), but differ in their degree of obligacy, varying from strongly dependent (B<sub>facS</sub>) to intermediately dependent (B<sub>facI</sub>) to weakly dependent (B<sub>facW</sub>) on the producer's waste product for growth (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s013">Table S2</xref>). Finally, in the producer- non-cross-feeder (B<sub>ncf</sub>) association there is complete overlap of resource use. Specific parameter values used for the simulations are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003398.s013">Table S2</xref>, and other simulation parameter values used for the simulations are described in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003398-Mitri1">[22]</xref>. Unless otherwise stated, we assume cyclic boundary conditions.</p>
<p>Inoculation densities are 60 cells in monoculture, and 60 cells of each species (1∶1) in coculture. This means that the initial density of each individual species is held constant across culture type (i.e. monoculture and coculture), and thereby the total inoculation density of monoculture is half the total inoculation density of coculture (additive experimental design). This approach gives us a measure of how an individual species is affected by diversity only, and not by initial individual species densities.</p>
