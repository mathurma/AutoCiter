<abstract>
<p>The rapid and robust synthesis of polymers of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose (PAR) chains, primarily catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), is crucial for cellular responses to DNA damage. However, the precise mechanisms through which PARP1 is activated and PAR is robustly synthesized are not fully understood. Here, we identified Src-associated substrate during mitosis of 68 kDa (Sam68) as a novel signaling molecule in DNA damage responses (DDRs). In the absence of Sam68, DNA damage-triggered PAR production and PAR-dependent DNA repair signaling were dramatically diminished. With serial cellular and biochemical assays, we demonstrated that Sam68 is recruited to and significantly overlaps with PARP1 at DNA lesions and that the interaction between Sam68 and PARP1 is crucial for DNA damage-initiated and PARP1-conferred PAR production. Utilizing cell lines and knockout mice, we illustrated that Sam68-deleted cells and animals are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA-damaging agents. Together, our findings suggest that Sam68 plays a crucial role in DDR via regulating DNA damage-initiated PAR production.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Maintaining genome integrity is crucial for all organisms, and failure to do so can lead to fatal diseases such as cancer. Exposure to challenging environments can induce DNA strand breaks or other lesions; thus, rapid and appropriate DNA damage responses (DDRs) need to be in place to detect and repair the damage. Cellular networks use a variety of signaling molecules and post-translational modifications that are crucial for the signaling of DNA breaks to repair machineries. Poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and activation of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a post-translational modification that occurs within seconds upon DNA damage detection and triggers downstream DDR signaling; however, it remains obscure whether other molecules, beyond DNA strand breaks, stimulate or control PARP1 activity. We report here that a novel DDR signaling molecule, Src-associated substrate during mitosis of 68 kDa (Sam68), has a crucial function in governing the DNA damage-initiated PARP1 activation and polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) production. We show that Sam68 is recruited to and significantly overlaps with PARP1 at DNA lesions and that the Sam68-PARP1 interaction is critical for DNA damage-initiated PARP1 activation and PAR production both in vitro and in vivo. Sam68-deleted cells and animals have a diminished PAR-dependent DNA repair signaling and are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA-damaging agents. Hence, our data reveal an unexpected function for Sam68 in DNA damage-initiated early signaling and provide a novel mechanism on the activation and regulation of PARP1 in DDR.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA damage responses (DDRs) that occur promptly are essential for maintaining genome integrity, which is consistently challenged by internal and external insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref006">6</xref>]. Failure to do so can lead to loss of genomic integrity and also cause cancer, immune deficiency, premature aging, and other critical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref005">5</xref>]. Sophisticated cellular networks, consisting of a variety of molecules and post-translational modifications, are crucial for signaling the presence of DNA strand breaks to repair machineries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref003">3</xref>]. In particular, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), catalyzed by the enzymes from the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase/diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyl transferase (PARP/ARTD) family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref008">8</xref>], is one of the earliest events (within seconds) in DDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref011">11</xref>]. Previous studies have underscored an indispensable role of PARylation in DNA repair pathways including base excision repair (BER), single-strand break repair (SSBR), homologous recombination (HR), and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref017">17</xref>]. Importantly, the elongated and branched structure enables polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) to serve as a docking platform for the focal assembly of DNA repair complexes, thus orchestrating appropriate DDR signaling cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref026">26</xref>]. For instance, following γ-irradiation, phosphorylation/activation of the proximal checkpoint kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) as well as ATM substrates checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and Chk2 occurs in a PAR-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref027">27</xref>]. As the founding member of PARP/ARTD superfamily, PARP1 (also named ARTD1) is the major enzyme responsible for the rapid and vigorous PAR synthesis triggered by damaged DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref010">10</xref>]. Binding of PARP1 to DNA strand breaks results in conformational changes in PARP1 and elevates its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref004">4</xref>]. Upon activation, PARP1 vigorously synthesizes and adds ADP-ribosyl polymers to a variety of target proteins, including PARP1 itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref009">9</xref>]. Albeit these important advances in understanding of the critical function of PARylation in DDR, the precise mechanisms of stimulation and regulation of PARP1 catalytic activity during DDR are still obscure. In particular, recent studies showed that DNA strand breaks appear not to be the sole stimulatory factor for PARP1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref033">33</xref>], which suggests that a more complicated mechanism or mechanisms could be required to robustly activate and elegantly fine-tune PARP1 activity. Moreover, the inhibition of PARP1/PARylation has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating human cancers and inflammatory diseases associated with impaired DNA repair activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref035">35</xref>]. Of note, the current classes of PARP1 inhibitors, either approved by FDA or undergoing clinical trials, are all based on a competitive binding strategy first observed with nicotinamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref036">36</xref>]. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of activation and regulation of PARP1 activity in DDR may provide clinical relevance to aid the rational development of new PARP1 inhibitors.</p>
<p>Src-associated substrate during mitosis of 68 kDa (Sam68) is a versatile RNA-binding protein and plays a role in a wide range of cellular processes, including RNA stability, RNA splicing, RNA nuclear export, HIV-1 replication, adipogenesis, neuronal activity, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref047">47</xref>]. We and others recently showed that Sam68 participates in the transcription of certain genes via its interactions with transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref051">51</xref>], which is in line with the fact that Sam68 binds single- and double-stranded DNA, besides RNA. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that RNA-binding proteins play critical functions in DNA damage signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref054">54</xref>]. In particular, Sam68 was identified as a PAR-binding partner in cells with DNA damage and proposed as a putative substrate of ATM, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref056">56</xref>], which strongly indicates that Sam68 could execute an important function in DDR. Although Sam68, a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein, has been long acknowledged as an almost strictly nuclear protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref041">41</xref>], its potential function in the nuclear-initiated signaling pathways, especially DDR, has not been the subject of intense investigation. In this manuscript, we report that Sam68, as a novel signaling molecule in DDR, plays a crucial function in governing the DNA strand break-triggered PARP1 activation and PAR production. Upon DNA damage, Sam68 is recruited to and significantly overlaps with PARP1 at DNA damage sites. Interaction between Sam68 and PARP1 via their N-termini is critical for DNA dependent-PARP1 activation and PAR production in vivo and in vitro. In line with the attenuated PAR-dependent repair signaling, DNA damage is poorly repaired in Sam68-deficient cells and animals in comparison to the Sam68-sufficient controls. As a consequence, Sam68 knockout mice are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by γ-irradiation and DNA alkylating agents. Hence, our data reveal an unexpected function for Sam68 in DNA damage-initiated early signaling and provide a novel mechanism on the activation and regulation of PARP1 in DDR.</p>

<title>Sam68 Plays a Critical Role in Repairing DNA Strand Breaks</title>
<p>Hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents is one of the hallmarks of defective DDR. To address the role of Sam68 in repair of DNA strand breaks, we first examined the effect of Sam68 deletion in clonogenic survival of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) following exposure to genotoxic stresses. Sam68 deletion in MEFs led to an increased sensitivity to etoposide (a DNA-damaging agent that inhibits DNA topoisomerase II), γ-irradiation, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). To ascertain whether Sam68 is essential for the completion of DNA repair, we performed single-cell gel electrophoresis-based alkaline comet assays, a sensitive method for detecting DNA strand breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref057">57</xref>]. No comet tails were observed in mock-irradiated Sam68<sup>-/-</sup> and Sam68<sup>+/-</sup> primary thymocytes, suggesting Sam68 deletion does not spontaneously cause DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).

The comet tails lessened in a time-dependent manner in Sam68<sup>+/-</sup> thymocytes, and almost no comet tails were detected at 3 h post γ-irradiation. Strikingly, the comet tails remained prominent in Sam68<sup>-/-</sup> thymocytes during the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>), which strongly supports an indispensable role of Sam68 in repairing DNA breaks.</p>

<p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most severe form of damage to DNA, and homology-directed repair (HDR) and NHEJ have been proposed as the major mechanisms used to repair DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref058">58</xref>]. We sought to directly test whether Sam68 facilitates DNA repair through one or more such specific signaling pathways. To this end, we utilized U2OS cell lines that contain chromosomally integrated green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters with recognition sites for the rare-cutting endonuclease I-SceI to assess the rates of HDR and NHEJ, as GFP positivity by flow cytometry analysis suggests that repair has occurred in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref058">58</xref>]. Upon down-regulation of Sam68 by small interference RNA (siRNA), we observed the repair efficiency of the NHEJ and HDR pathways was reduced to 42.3% and 12.2%, respectively, in comparison to the nonspecific control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). The efficiency of Sam68 silencing in the U2OS reporter cell lines was verified by IB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), and Sam68 down-regulation exhibited no substantial effect on transfection efficiency of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Moreover, ectopic expression of a Sam68 construct that is resistant to siRNA markedly rescued the repair efficiency of the NHEJ and HDR pathways in the Sam68 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Sam68 deletion causes defective DNA repair, thus resulting in persistent DSBs and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.</p>

<title>Sam68 Deficiency Impairs DNA Damage-Initiated PARylation and Signaling Cascade</title>
<p>As Sam68 knockdown has a more profound impact on the efficiency of HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>), which is the most important error-free pathway for repairing DSBs, we sought to examine how Sam68 deficiency affects the signaling cascade in response to DSBs caused by γ-irradiation. Phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (γH2AX), a DNA damage marker that promotes the recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes and downstream repair factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref061">61</xref>], was robustly increased in Sam68-sufficient MEFs, primary thymocytes, and U2OS cells treated with γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). In contrast, such DNA damage-triggered γH2AX accumulation was severely attenuated in Sam68-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, the γ-irradiation-induced phosphorylation of ATM (which is the kinase of H2AX) and its substrates Chk1 and Chk2, all of which are essential DNA damage signaling transducers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref001">1</xref>], was consistently more robust in Sam68-sufficient MEFs, thymocytes, and U2OS cells in comparison to Sam68-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2A and 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). These observations further suggest that Sam68 deficiency leads to decreased DNA repair signaling. As DSB-induced ATM phosphorylation is known to rely on the activation of the DNA damage sensor PARP1 and subsequent PAR production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref027">27</xref>], we examined PAR chain formation in γ-irradiated cells in the presence and absence of Sam68. As expected, PAR chains were rapidly and vigorously built up in Sam68-sufficient thymocytes and MEFs following γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2C, 2E and 2F</xref>). However, while Sam68 deficiency did not affect PARP1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>), γ-irradiation triggered PAR production was diminished in Sam68-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2C, 2E and 2F</xref>), which demonstrates that Sam68 is crucial for DNA damage-initiated PAR chain formation. Moreover, supplementing with exogenous Sam68 markedly restored the DNA damage-initiated PAR synthesis and the PAR-dependent phosphorylation of ATM, Chk1, Chk2, and H2AX in Sam68 knockout (KO) MEFs following γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2A and 2E</xref>), highlighting the crucial role of Sam68 in the DSB-triggered PAR production and PAR-dependent signaling to DNA repair.</p>

<title>DNA Damage Enhances Interaction between Sam68 and PARP1</title>
<p>Given that Sam68 deletion almost abolished PAR production following γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>), we first performed immunoprecipitation assays to examine whether Sam68 interacts with PARP family proteins in DDR, thus affecting the DNA damage-initiated PAR formation. Indeed, at 5 min post γ-irradiation, Sam68 substantially associated with PARP1 and ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s005">S4 Fig</xref>); in contrast, no detectable interaction between Sam68 and PARP2, PARP3, and PARP5a/b was observed under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s005">S4B Fig</xref>). Given the observed interaction and that PARP1 is the primary nuclear enzyme that transfers PAR chains to various target proteins in response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref002">2</xref>], we further characterized the Sam68-PARP1 interaction following DNA damage.

In contrast, the Sam68-PARP1 interaction in response to γ-irradiation was greatly reduced in the presence of the DNA-binding agent, ethidium bromide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), demonstrating that damaged DNA is critical for the DNA damage-induced Sam68-PARP1 interaction.</p>

<title>Sam68 Is Recruited to and Regulates PAR Production at DNA Damage Sites</title>
<p>The fact that PARP1 is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref062">62</xref>] and damaged DNA enhances the Sam68-PARP1 interaction in DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>) led us to assess whether Sam68 can be recruited to DNA lesions where it interacts with PARP1 and regulates PAR formation. As illustrated by chromatin fractionation assays, Sam68 was remarkably enriched in chromatin fractions in MEFs and U2OS cells following γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). To ascertain whether the damaged chromatin-enriched Sam68 is recruited to DNA lesions rather than generally bound to chromatin, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to monitor the DNA damage-triggered Sam68 recruitment to the proximity of a DSB that is actively generated at a unique chromosomally integrated I-SceI site in HDR-GFP reporter U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). While no association of Sam68 or of PARP1 was detected with chromatin near the I-SceI site in U2OS cells without I-SceI transfection, Sam68 and PARP1 were indeed enriched at the site near the generated DSB in the I-SceI-expressing U2OS reporter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect an enrichment of Sam68 or PARP1 at the site far away from the cut I-SceI site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), which suggests that Sam68 and PARP1 are specifically recruited to the DNA damage site. Moreover, we carried out laser microirradiation microscopy assays to visualize the recruitment of Sam68 to local DNA strand breaks, using MEFs expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged Sam68 as well as GFP-tagged PARP1. Consistent with the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref002">2</xref>], accumulation of ectopically expressed GFP-PARP1 at DNA lesions was manifested as cytological discernable foci in laser-irradiated Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s007">S6A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, RFP-Sam68 formed discrete, cytologically detectable foci, which significantly overlap with the damage foci formed by GFP-PARP1 and endogenous γH2AX, after laser microirradiation in parallel samples all collected at the same time post micro-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s007">S6A Fig</xref>). In contrast, the RFP control failed to form discrete foci, although GFP-PARP1 formed damage foci as expected, under the same condition, in the cells expressing RFP and GFP-PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Of note, endogenous Sam68 and PARP1 also formed discrete DNA damage foci that significantly overlapped with those manifested by γH2AX, after laser microirradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s007">S6B Fig</xref>), further supporting our assertion that Sam68 localizes at sites of damaged DNA significantly overlapping with PARP1 as well as γH2AX during the cellular responses to DNA damage. Moreover, the GFP-PARP1 fluorescence intensities after laser microirradiation were comparable in wild-type and Sam68-deleted cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s007">S6C Fig</xref>), indicating that Sam68 is not required for PARP1 localization to sites of damaged DNA. Similarly, PARP1 inhibition with Olaparib, compared to the vehicle control, did not affect the recruitment of GFP-PARP1 at sites of damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s007">S6D Fig</xref>). In contrast, Olaparib treatment substantially augmented, rather than attenuated, the localization of RFP-Sam68 at DNA damage foci in the MEFs expressing RFP-Sam68 and GFP-PARP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s007">S6E Fig</xref>). These results suggest that Sam68 and PARP1 both localize to sites of damaged DNA independently. To assess the impact of Sam68 on the PAR formation at local DNA damage sites, we carried out immunofluorescence staining assays for PAR production at local DNA strand breaks generated by laser microirradiation in the nucleus in the presence and absence of Sam68. As expected, shortly (1 min) after laser microirradiation, vigorous PAR production was detected locally in the nuclear regions where laser beams were introduced in WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). In striking contrast, PAR formation was barely observed in the laser microirradiated regions in Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3G</xref>), which suggests that Sam68 is crucial for local PAR synthesis at DNA lesions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Sam68 is recruited to and significantly overlaps with PARP1 at DNA damage sites, where it regulates local PAR production in the cellular responses to DNA damage.</p>

<title>Sam68 Stimulates PARP1 Catalytic Activity via the Interaction between Their N-termini</title>
<p>The findings that Sam68 deficiency attenuates DNA damage-induced global PAR production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>) and focal PAR formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3G</xref>) and that Sam68 and PARP1 interact and overlap at DNA strand breaks after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3A and 3F</xref>) led us to hypothesize that Sam68 governs DNA damage-initiated PARylation via directly stimulating the catalytic activity of PARP1. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vitro PARylation assays using recombinant PARP1 and Sam68 proteins. As expected, damaged DNA-activated PARP1 automodified itself with the addition of PAR moieties from the supplemented nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), as indicated by the robust PAR chain formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s008">S7A Fig</xref>). Strikingly, incubation of recombinant Sam68 protein, compared to the GST control, with PARP1 dramatically boosted PARP1 activation and PAR production in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, compare lane 3 with lane 7, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s008">S7B Fig</xref>) in the presence of damaged DNA and NAD<sup>+</sup>.

<p>We sought to understand the key domain(s) in Sam68 critical for the interaction with PARP1 and the PARP1-stimulatory function using various Sam68 truncates. We detected the association of the full-length, ΔC, and ΔKH truncated Sam68 to endogenous PARP1, but not GFP vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal amino acids 1–102 (ΔN) of Sam68 almost abolished the association of Sam68 to PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting a key role of the N-terminus for the interaction between Sam68 and PARP1. Moreover, we carried out pulldown assays using GST-fused full-length and ΔN truncated Sam68 together with PARP1 recombinant proteins. While full-length Sam68 pulled down PARP1, the ΔN truncated Sam68 failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), which further confirms the critical role of the N-terminus of Sam68 for the Sam68-PARP1 interaction. To examine whether the Sam68 N-terminus-mediated Sam68-PARP1 interaction is important for the PARP1-stimulatory function, we conducted the in vitro PARylation assays, supplementing PARP1 with full-length or ΔN mutant Sam68 recombinant protein. Indeed, the stimulatory effect of Sam68 for PARP1 activation and PAR production was substantially reduced when Sam68 (ΔN) recombinant protein was utilized, in comparison to full-length Sam68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, compare lane 11 with lane 15). This result underscores an important role of the Sam68 N-terminus in controlling PARP1 activity in vitro. Moreover, to further examine whether the Sam68-PARP1 interaction is functionally important for DNA damage-initiated PAR production in cells, we compared the γ-irradiation triggered PARylation in Sam68 KO MEFs transiently expressing full-length or ΔN truncated Sam68, both of which share strict nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The expression of full-length Sam68, but not GFP control, significantly restored the DNA damage-initiated PAR synthesis in Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4F</xref>), consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). However, ectopic expression of Sam68 (ΔN) mutant failed to restore the γ-irradiation triggered PAR production in Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate that the N-terminus of Sam68, which is critical for the Sam68-PARP1 interaction, is functionally important for PARP1-catalyzed PAR production.</p>
<p>We then performed structural-functional analyses using full-length and truncated PARP1 proteins to explore the domain(s) on PARP1 essential for Sam68 interaction and Sam68-stimulated PARP1 activation. In contrast to the strong interaction between full-length PARP1 and Sam68, PARP1 (663–1,014) truncated protein, containing the catalytic domain, barely bound Sam68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4G</xref>), which indicates that the stimulatory function of Sam68 on PARP1 activity may not be conferred via a direct interaction between Sam68 and PARP1 catalytic domain. Conversely, the PARP1 (1–662) truncated protein, which contains the DNA-binding domain and automodification domain, associated with Sam68 to a similar extent as full-length PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4G</xref>), indicative of a potentially important role of the PARP1 N-terminus for the stimulatory function of Sam68. Indeed, in striking contrast to the robust PAR chain formation by Sam68 and PARP1 in the presence of damaged DNA and NAD<sup>+</sup>, incubation of Sam68 with either PARP1 (1–662) or PARP1 (663–1,014) failed to form detectable PAR chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4H</xref>, compare lanes 18, 20, and 22), suggesting that the Sam68-PARP1 interaction and PARP1 catalytic domain are both required for Sam68 to stimulate PARP1 activation. Moreover, in the absence of damaged DNA, incubation of Sam68 with PARP1 exhibited no detectable PARP1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s008">S7D Fig</xref>), which demonstrates that Sam68 primarily stimulates the DNA-dependent PARP1 activation. Altogether, our results suggest that Sam68 stimulates the DNA-dependent PARP1 activation and subsequent PAR production through the interaction between their N-termini.</p>

<title>PARP1 Deficiency/Inhibition and Sam68 Deficiency Share Similar Effects on DNA Repair</title>
<p>To recapitulate our observed phenotypes due to diminished PAR synthesis in the absence of Sam68, we performed parallel experiments in PARP1-deficient or -inhibited cells. Indeed, pretreatment of thymocytes with PARP1 inhibitors, Olaparib and PJ-34, significantly impeded γ-irradiation-triggered PAR production and the downstream phosphorylation of ATM and Chk1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s009">S8 Fig</xref>), mirroring the impaired PAR synthesis and DNA repair signaling in Sam68-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2</xref>). As a result, PARP1 deletion in MEFs, in comparison to wild-type cells, resulted in increased sensitivity to genotoxicity of etoposide and γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s010">S9A and S9B Fig</xref>), which is comparable to Sam68 KO in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Moreover, alkaline comet assays revealed that DNA damage repair was substantially delayed in the PARP1-inhibited thymocytes compared to the control cells, as illustrated by the persistent comet tail moments within 3 h post γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s010">S9C and S9D Fig</xref>), further supporting a similar effect of Sam68 deletion and PARP inhibition on DNA repair of γ-irradiated lesions in thymocytes. Furthermore, PARP1 down-regulation by siRNA significantly attenuated the repair efficiency of NHEJ and HDR in the U2OS reporter cell lines, in comparison to the nonspecific control siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s010">S9E Fig</xref>), which mirrors the impact of Sam68 silencing on the specific signaling pathways that repair DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). These results suggest that deficiency in either PARP1 or Sam68 similarly causes defective DNA repair, thus resulting in persistent DSBs and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. To examine whether PARP1 loss further impacts the hypersensitivity of Sam68 KO MEFs to DNA-damaging agents, we down-regulated PARP1 expression by siRNA in Sam68 KO MEFs. Indeed, following exposure to DNA-damaging agents, etoposide and γ-irradiation, the clonogenic survival of Sam68 KO MEFs expressing PARP1-specific siRNA was almost identical to those expressing control siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s011">S10 Fig</xref>). These results further highlight the crucial role of Sam68 in controlling the PARP1-catalyzed PAR production in DDR.</p>

<title>Sam68 Deletion Attenuates PARylation and PAR-Dependent Repair Signaling in Radiodamaged Thymi</title>
<p>In light of the crucial role of Sam68 in mediating DNA repair in cultured cells, we additionally examined the thymi, which is known to be hypersensitive to radiotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref064">64</xref>], derived from mice at various periods post whole body γ-irradiation (WBIR) to assess the impact of Sam68 on DNA repair signaling in damaged organs in vivo.

<title>Sam68 Deficient Mice Are Hypersensitive to Genotoxic Stresses</title>
<p>To determine the importance of Sam68 in DDR in vivo, we assessed the impact of Sam68 deletion on γ-irradiation-caused genotoxicity in mice. <italic>Sam68</italic><sup>+/-</sup> male mice subjected to a sublethal dose of WBIR initially showed a modest loss in body weight and consistently regained their weight by 18 d post WBIR, correlating with 100% survival from radiotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein, we report that Sam68 is a previously unappreciated early signaling molecule in the cellular response to DNA damage. Our data demonstrate that the deletion of Sam68 attenuates DNA damage-triggered PARP1 activation, PAR production, and PAR-dependent DNA repair signaling cascades, in line with our observations of an indispensable role for Sam68 in the HDR and NHEJ repair signaling pathways. Moreover, we show that Sam68 KO mice are hypersensitive to genotoxic challenges by DNA-damaging agents. Mechanistically, upon DNA damage, Sam68 is recruited to DNA damage sites, where Sam68 stimulates the catalytic activity of PARP1 at DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<p>The evidence that Sam68 interacts with PARP1 and is recruited to and substantially overlaps with PARP1 at sites of damaged DNA and that Sam68 deletion diminishes the DSB-initiated PAR production suggests that Sam68 regulates PARP1 activity in DDR. The similarity in the phenotypes of Sam68- and PARP1-deficient/inhibited cells and animals in response to DNA damage further supports this notion. First, dramatically attenuated PAR production in response to DNA damage in Sam68-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>) mirrors the abolished DNA damage-triggered PAR synthesis caused by PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s009">S8 Fig</xref>). The role of Sam68 in controlling PARP1 activity is further supported by the evidence that recombinant Sam68 is sufficient to boost PARP1 activity in the presence of damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Secondly, the PAR-dependent DNA repair signaling cascade is dampened in PARP1 KO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref027">27</xref>], PARP1-inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s009">S8 Fig</xref>), and Sam68-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g002">Fig 2A–2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, the retarded repair of DNA strand breaks, as illustrated by comet assays, is similarly observed in PARP1-deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref066">66</xref>] or -inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s010">S9C and S9D Fig</xref>) and Sam68-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>), in line with the PARP1 malfunction-impeded DNA repair signaling and recruitment of the repair machinery. Hence, Sam68-deleted cells are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>), similar to what has previously been reported in cells with repressed PARP1 activity through the use of chemical inhibitors or transdominant mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref067">67</xref>] and in PARP1-deleted cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s010">S9A and S9B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, owing to its key function in DDR, PARP1 is known to be required for protecting mice from genotoxicity. PARP1 KO mice were reported previously to be hypersensitive to the DNA alkylating agent MNU and γ-irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref065">65</xref>], and γ-irradiation has been shown to cause severe acute damage to the small intestine in PARP1 KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref017">17</xref>]. Interestingly, Sam68 KO mice are also hypersensitive to MNU and γ-irradiation challenges and exhibit acute radiodamage in the small intestine and the thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g006">Fig 6</xref>), thus exactly recapitulating the phenotypes in PARP1 KO mice.</p>
<p>One hallmark of DDR factors is that they are rapidly recruited to the proximity of sites of damaged DNA, and ideally, such enrichment can be visualized by laser microirradiation microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref068">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref070">70</xref>]. It has been widely acknowledged that activated PARP1 PARylates itself with such automodification stimulating more PARP1 to be recruited to DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref002">2</xref>]. Notably, in our laser microirradiation microscopy assays, the accumulation of ectopically expressed and endogenous Sam68 also leads to the formation of discrete, cytologically detectable foci at sites of damaged DNA that significantly overlap with the damage foci formed by GFP-PARP1 or endogenous γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s007">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). In addition, we demonstrate that Sam68 and PARP1 are specifically enriched on the chromatin close to the unique DSB at the I-SceI site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Moreover, Sam68 and PARP1 are capable of physically interacting with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), and DNA damage-enhanced interactions between endogenous Sam68 and key initial components of DDR, i.e., PARP1 and ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, recombinant Sam68 is sufficient to facilitate the DNA-dependent PARP1 activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002543.s008">S7D Fig</xref>), and the N-terminus of Sam68 is both critical for the Sam68-PARP1 interaction and functionally important for PARP1-catalyzed PAR production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g004">Fig 4B–4D</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Sam68, functioning as a key initial signaling molecule, is crucial in regulating PARP1 activity and the PAR-dependent signaling cascade in DDR. It is noteworthy that our work here also elucidates a novel role for the less-characterized N-terminus of Sam68 in DDR signaling. Albeit not appearing to harbor any well-defined functional domains or motifs, the N-terminus of Sam68 does contain a cluster of several serine and threonine residues. This cluster could make Sam68 a potential target of serine/threonine phosphorylation, thus potentially serving as an important functional switch that allows Sam68 to interact with PARP1 and regulate PARP1-catalyzed PARylation in DDR, though further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Recent studies underscore the emerging role of RNA-binding proteins in DDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref054">54</xref>]. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like proteins 1 and 2 were shown to promote recruitment of the Bloom Syndrome protein (BLM) helicase to DSBs by functioning downstream of Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex and carboxyl-terminal binding protein (CtBP)-interacting protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref053">53</xref>]. Moreover, RNA-binding proteins RNA binding motif protein, X-linked (RBMX) and non-POU domain containing, octamer-binding (NONO) were reported to be recruited to DNA damage sites in a PARP1/PAR-dependent manner, where RBMX regulates BRCA2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref054">54</xref>] and NONO stimulates NHEJ and represses HR repair signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref052">52</xref>], respectively. It is noteworthy that all these RNA-binding proteins have been proposed to function after PARP1 activation/PAR synthesis in DDR, as their enrichment on DNA lesions relies on the interactions with PAR chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref052">52</xref>]. In contrast, here we propose that the RNA-binding protein Sam68 is a signaling molecule that functions prior to PARP1 activation and in fact controls PARP1 activity in DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002543.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The enrichment of Sam68 on DNA lesions is apparently as rapid as PARP1, and it stimulates and controls rather than depends on PARP1 activation and PAR production. Thus, the identification of Sam68 as an early signaling factor proximal to PARP1 in DDR provides new insight into the sophisticated signaling mechanisms in DDR, in particular the stimulation and regulation of PARP1 activation and PAR production.</p>
<p>In light of their crucial roles in various DNA damage repair-signaling pathways, the inhibition of PARP1 as well as other PARP family proteins has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating multiple human diseases associated with impaired DNA repair activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref035">35</xref>]. However, the current classes of PARP inhibitors undergoing clinical trials and the FDA-approved Olaparib are all based on a competitive binding strategy first observed with nicotinamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref036">36</xref>], and almost all PARP inhibitors are derivatives of the natural PARP inhibitor nicotinamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref010">10</xref>]. There is an urgent need for improving their specificity for each individual PARP family member and lowering their off-target effect and toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref002">2</xref>]. That said, the nature of PARP1’s rapid recruitment (within seconds) to DNA damage sites upon sensing lesions combined with the fact that activated PARP1 vigorously catalyzes the PARylation reaction makes it difficult to elucidate the mechanism of PARP1 activation in DDR. Nevertheless, PARP activation and PAR production need to be elegantly controlled during the cellular response to DNA damage—a sufficient amount of PAR at DNA damage sites is required to recruit downstream effectors to DNA lesions to fulfill their repair function. Meanwhile, excessive PAR chain buildup needs to be avoided, as hyperactivated PARP1 could exhaust intracellular pools of NAD<sup>+</sup> and sabotage ATP production, thus resulting in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref071">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref074">74</xref>]. Although post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins have been proposed to fine-tune PARP1 activity in DDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002543.ref075">75</xref>], the stimulatory mechanism of PARP1 activation at DNA damage sites has remained largely unknown. Our proposed model that Sam68, as a previously unrecognized stimulatory factor beyond DNA strand breaks, stimulates PARP1 activation and PAR production at DNA damage sites could provide a novel strategy to develop a new category of PARP1 inhibitors and therapeutics for human diseases involving DNA repair.</p>

Briefly, near infrared (NIR) excitation was provided by a Mai Tai HP Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, California) tuned to 800 nm, 125 fs pulses, and an 80 MHz repetition rate. The laser beam was introduced through a Leica DMi8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). The pulsed NIR beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot with a 63 × oil-immersion objective (1.4 NA). An electro-optic modulator (EOM) was used to create regions of interest (ROIs) targeted for microirradiation by position-dependent power adjustment of the NIR beam. Prior to every experiment, the NIR beam power at the objective was measured to ensure repeatable laser settings that generated a detectable DDR restricted to ROIs without noticeable cytotoxicity. A coverglass-bottomed dish (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, Massachusetts) plated with cells was placed into a temperature-controlled chamber (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) (Life Imaging Services, Basel, Switzerland) enclosing the entire microscope stand. Immediately after microirradiation, the DDR was captured through time-lapse acquisition of the GFP- or RFP-fused protein recruitment using the FRAP application unit of LAS X acquisition software. All images were processed using the LAS AF Lite software (Leica Microsystems), and we quantified the pre- and post-microirradiation fluorescence intensity of the ROI and an adjacent nuclear area with a similar pre-microirradiation fluorescence intensity, to correct fluorescence intensity for transfection efficiency and photobleaching.</p>

Cells were fixed at 1 min post Micro-IR and stained for endogenous γH2AX. Shown are fluorescence micrographs of RFP-Sam68, GFP-PARP1, and endogenous γH2AX at DNA damage foci. (B) Immunofluorescence micrographs of endogenous Sam68, PARP1, and γH2AX in WT MEFs at 1 min post Micro-IR. (C) WT and Sam68 KO MEFs expressing GFP-PARP1 were subjected to Micro-IR and the increase in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of GFP-PARP1 at damage foci ~10 s post Micro-IR versus pre-Micro-IR in WT, and Sam68 KO MEFs were graphed, normalized to WT controls. (D) WT MEFs expressing GFP-PARP1 were pretreated with DMSO or 10 μM of Olaparib for 90 min, followed by Micro-IR. The increase in RFI of GFP-PARP1 at damage foci ~10 s post Micro-IR versus pre-Micro-IR in DMSO- or Olaparib-treated cells was graphed, normalized to DMSO controls. (E) Sam68 KO MEFs expressing RFP-Sam68 were pretreated with DMSO or 10 μM of Olaparib for 90 min, followed by Micro-IR. The increase in RFI of RFP-Sam68 at damage foci ~10 s post Micro-IR versus pre-Micro-IR in DMSO- or Olaparib-treated cells was graphed, normalized to DMSO controls.
