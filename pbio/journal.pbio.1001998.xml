<p>This study shows how chronic stress and heat shock response exacerbate the phenotype in protein misfolding diseases by triggering a Maladaptive Stress Response; this pathway represents a promising therapeutic target for multiple genetic disorders.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Diseases of protein folding arise because of the inability of an altered peptide sequence to properly engage protein homeostasis components that direct protein folding and function. To identify global principles of misfolding disease pathology we examined the impact of the local folding environment in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), Niemann-Pick type C1 disease (NPC1), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cystic fibrosis (CF). Using distinct models, including patient-derived cell lines and primary epithelium, mouse brain tissue, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, we found that chronic expression of misfolded proteins not only triggers the sustained activation of the heat shock response (HSR) pathway, but that this sustained activation is maladaptive. In diseased cells, maladaptation alters protein structure–function relationships, impacts protein folding in the cytosol, and further exacerbates the disease state. We show that down-regulation of this <underline>m</underline>aladaptive <underline>s</underline>tress <underline>r</underline>esponse (MSR), through silencing of HSF1, the master regulator of the HSR, restores cellular protein folding and improves the disease phenotype. We propose that restoration of a more physiological proteostatic environment will strongly impact the management and progression of loss-of-function and gain-of-toxic-function phenotypes common in human disease.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The function of all proteins is dependent on achieving the correct folded state, a process referred to as protein homeostasis or proteostasis. Cellular proteostasis is maintained by diverse signaling pathways, including the heat shock response (HSR), which protects proteins in the face of acute stress. However, genetic disorders are a challenge to cells, since the mutated protein will often fail to fold properly and function correctly. We have discovered that the chronic expression of such disease-causing proteins can trigger the sustained activation of the HSR in a failed attempt to correct the associated misfolding defect. Such chronic HSR activation presents an unanticipated challenge to the cell by initiating a sustained state of stress management, which leads to a general protein-folding deficiency. This in turn further exacerbates the disease phenotype—a condition we have termed maladaptive. We show that down-regulation of this <underline>m</underline>aladaptive <underline>s</underline>tress <underline>r</underline>esponse (MSR) restores cellular protein folding and improves the disease condition in loss-of-function disorders such as cystic fibrosis, Niemann-Pick disease and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, as well as gain-of-toxic-function diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. MSR management therefore potentially represents an important therapeutic first step in regulating the progression of human disease associated with chronic protein misfolding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The transition from protein folding to misfolding, in both normal physiology and disease, is dynamically managed by multiple proteostatic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch2">[2]</xref>. The heat shock response (HSR) is a central signaling pathway managing the malleable composition of the proteostasis network (PN) of folding and degradation machineries. The cellular PN environment contributes to what we refer to as the <underline>q</underline>uinary (Q) state of the protein fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hingorani1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Roth1">[6]</xref>, which emphasizes that the structure of a protein is tightly integrated with a dynamic proteostatic system to direct structure–function relationships in health and address challenges in response to disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Powers1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Steele1">[71]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Liu1">[11]</xref>. Q-state managers of each protein fold draw from the proteostasis pool of molecular chaperones (Hsp40s, Hsc70s, Hsp70s, and Hsp90), small heat shock proteins, and ubiquitin-based degradation components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hingorani1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Powers1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Labbadia1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Kim1">[14]</xref>. These managers are responsive to multiple signaling pathways including the unfolded protein response (UPR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Walter1">[15]</xref>, controlling compartmentalized folding, and the heat-shock response (HSR), controlling cytoplasmic/nuclear folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Morimoto1">[8]</xref>. The importance of an integrated Q-state is exemplified in the function of coupled protein synthesis and folding machineries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Duttler1">[16]</xref>, linked cargo-specific folding and trafficking machineries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Powers1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Steele1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hutt1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hutt2">[17]</xref>, and the activity of cytoplasmic Q-bodies that actively monitor the health of each protein in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Roth1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-EscusaToret1">[18]</xref>. Together, these proteostasis machineries operate as integrated sensors of individual protein structure–function relationships that now need to be understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hingorani1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Roth1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-vanOostenHawle1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Taylor2">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>The HSR is controlled by the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), with the chaperone Hsp90 regulating its activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Morimoto1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Anckar1">[25]</xref>. Transient stimulation of the HSR pathway, based on the heat shock paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Morimoto2">[26]</xref>, is generally beneficial in that it alters the composition of proteostasis components in the cytosol to provide immediate, but temporary, protection to misfolded proteins in the face of divergent stress insults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Morimoto1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hutt1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Akerfelt1">[27]</xref>. Consistent with this view, transcriptional profiling, in response to acute heat shock, revealed that approximately 500 genes are up-regulated, whereas more than 1,000 genes are repressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Mendillo1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Page1">[30]</xref>, conditions that, if sustained, could negatively impact cell viability. Our understanding of these complex gene expression changes and their impact on protein structure–function relationships in response to chronic folding insults remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Diseases of protein folding arise due to the inability of an altered peptide sequence to properly engage the prevailing local proteostasis components. Gain-of-toxic-function diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Masters1">[31]</xref> and inherited loss-of-function diseases such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Perlmutter1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Bouchecareilh1">[33]</xref>, Niemann-Pick type C1 disease (NPC1), and cystic fibrosis (CF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch3">[34]</xref> present a unique challenge to cells because of the chronic nature of the insult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch3">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Gidalevitz1">[35]</xref>. A current paradigm in disease biology is that stress pathways are not sufficiently activated to provide the necessary protection. Therefore, activation of these pathways, such as the HSR, should improve folding and/or clearance of disease-related proteins. Indeed, HSF1 activation has been shown to provide partial correction for some misfolding diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Westerheide1">[36]</xref>, however, the in vivo benefits for the chronic activation of HSF1 have not been investigated. Recently, HSR activation has been shown to exacerbate the aggregation of mutant huntingtin protein (htt-Q91) in a cellular model of Huntington's disease (HD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Bersuker1">[37]</xref>. Moreover, sustained HSR activation promotes proliferation of cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Mendillo1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Trepel1">[38]</xref>, a pathologic disease state leading to reduced human lifespan. In cancer cells, HSF1 drives a distinct transcriptional program from the classical HSR, implying a more complex function than previously anticipated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Santagata1">[39]</xref>. We have recently suggested that HSF1 activators that partially promote correction of CF do so by activation of unknown cellular pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Calamini1">[40]</xref>, which we now need to understand in the context of the prevailing proteostasis biology to provide new insights into the evolution of chronic disease management by the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Powers1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Herein we have studied four misfolding disorders to address central principles in managing chronic protein folding stress in human disease: (1) the deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del) variant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (F508del-CFTR), a multi-membrane–spanning protein with large cytoplasmic domains, which fails to traffic to the plasma membrane and is responsible for 90% of CF cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Roth2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch3">[34]</xref>; (2) the <underline>Z</underline>-variant of <underline>a</underline>lpha-1-<underline>a</underline>nti<underline>t</underline>rypsin (Z-AAT), which accumulates as a misfolded polymer in the early secretory endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment, leading to liver disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema because of its failure to be secreted and delivered to the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Perlmutter1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Bouchecareilh1">[33]</xref>; (3) the I1061T variant of NPC1, key component in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in the late endosome/lysosome (LE/L) compartment, which fails to traffic from the ER to the LE/L in human disease, resulting in the lysosomal storage disease NPC1; and (4) AD, which arises from aberrant Alzheimer precursor protein (APP) processing and trafficking, resulting in accumulation of extracellular Aβ amyloid aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Masters1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Voisine1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although our primary focus is on the correction of CF disease, we now show that the long-term expression of disease-causing misfolded proteins results in what we refer to as a maladaptive stress response (MSR), a state reflecting the sustained activation of the HSR pathway, which contributes to disease progression by undermining the normal folding capacity of cells. We provide evidence that silencing of HSF1 alleviates the MSR and improves the multiple disease phenotypes, suggesting a general principle that chronic alteration of the prevailing PN contributes to the progression of inherited diseases, a step that will now require active management to mitigate pathophysiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Roth1">[6]</xref>.</p>

<title>Chronic Proteotoxic Stress in CF Negatively Impacts Protein Folding</title>
<p>CF is caused by mutations in the multi-membrane–spanning protein CFTR, a chloride channel responsible for ionic and fluid homeostasis in the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch3">[34]</xref>. The F508del variant of CFTR is characterized by misfolding, ER accumulation, and removal by ER-associated degradation (ERAD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch3">[34]</xref>. F508del-CFTR is retained in the ER in a Hsp70/90-containing chaperone trap, a step that wild-type (WT)-CFTR and temperature-corrected F508del (30°C) are able to navigate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Coppinger1">[42]</xref>. We therefore focused our attention on the HSR pathway that manages cytoplasmic chaperone biology.</p>
<p>To assess the effect of HSR activation on the folding environment, we first heat shocked bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o-) expressing WT- or F508del-CFTR and monitored its impact on CFTR protein stability and trafficking. CFTR stability and trafficking is monitored by Western blot, in which the ER-localized (band-B) and post-ER glycoforms (band-C) exhibit a differential migration pattern. Whereas WT-CFTR remained mostly unaffected, more than 90% of F508del-CFTR was degraded after 60 min of heat shock (HS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>). HS activation was confirmed by increased HSF1 phosphorylation of Serine-326 (HSF1-P at S<sup>326</sup>). Since F508del-CFTR is sensitive to alterations in temperature, we determined whether the destabilization of F508del was caused by HSR activation and not simply elevated temperature. For this purpose, we overexpressed a constitutively active variant of HSF1 (ΔHSF1<sup>186–201</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Zuo1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Newton1">[44]</xref> with F508del-CFTR in CFBE41o- cells. Overexpression of active ΔHSF1<sup>186–201</sup>, confirmed by elevated levels of HSF1-P and the stress-<underline>i</underline>nducible Hsp70 (I-Hsp70), also led to destabilization of F508del-CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These data support the conclusion that activation of the HSR pathway results in destabilization of F508del-CFTR rather than correcting the stability and trafficking defect associated with this disease variant. We also observed that in the absence of HS, F508del-expressing cells already exhibited increased HSF1-P relative to that seen in WT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1A, 1D</xref>), revealing that the HSR pathway was already hyperactive in these cells. To confirm this observation, we compared additional markers of HSF1 activation, including HSF1 trimerization and expression of I-Hsp70. Cells expressing F508del-CFTR exhibited a significant increase in total, trimerized, and phosphorylated HSF1, as well as increased I-Hsp70 levels relative to WT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1D–1F</xref>). We also observed a significant increase in mRNA levels of the HSF1-responsive genes, HspA1A (I-Hsp70), Hsp90α (I-Hsp90), and DNAJB1 (I-Hsp40), relative to that seen in WT-expressing and in isogenic cells lacking CFTR (CFTR −/−) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Additionally, silencing of F508del-CFTR led to a significant decrease in HSF1 and HSF1-P expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s001">Figure S1A, S1B</xref>), suggesting that the observed HSR activation is directly related to the expression of this misfolded CFTR variant. Temperature correction of F508del, which corrects its associated stability and trafficking defects, also led to a reduction in HSF1 and HSF1-P to levels seen in WT-expressing and CFTR−/− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Altogether, our results suggest that the HSR activation observed in F508del-expressing cells at physiological temperature is a direct consequence of the expression of the misfolded F508del-CFTR.</p>

<p>To address whether the observed HSR activation was in response to the immortalized CFBE41o- cell line phenotype, we also examined these markers on patient-derived human bronchial epithelia (hBE) homozygous for WT- or F508del-CFTR. Consistent with the findings observed in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells, F508del-expressing hBE cells also showed elevated HSF1-P and I-Hsp70 protein levels, as well as increased I-Hsp70 (HspA1A &amp; A6), I-Hsp90, and I-Hsp40 mRNA levels, relative to that seen in WT-expressing hBEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1H–1J</xref>). No differences were observed in mRNA levels of non-classical HSF1-responsive genes, previously shown to be increased in cancer cells (CKS2, LY6K, and EIF4A2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1J</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Mendillo1">[28]</xref>, suggesting activation of the classical HSF1 pathway. In order to quantify the magnitude of this HSR activation, we compared the up-regulation of the I-Hsp40 and I-Hsp70 protein levels seen in F508del-expressing cells to that seen after HS. We observed a 1.5- and 2-fold increase in I-Hsp40 and I-Hsp70, respectively, in F508del-expressing CFBE cells relative to that seen in WT-expressing cells, whereas a 3.5- and 4-fold increase in I-Hsp40 and I-Hsp70, respectively, was observed after acute HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1K</xref>). Thus, the level of HSR activation seen in response to chronic expression of F508del-CFTR represents approximately 50% of that seen during acute HS, indicating the presence of a subacute, chronic activation of the HSR pathway.</p>
<p>The transcriptional changes reported to occur in response to HSR activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Mendillo1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Page1">[30]</xref> are likely to have a global impact on cellular function. Thus, we monitored the folding of firefly luciferase (FLuc), a sensor of folding stress in the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Balch3">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Gupta1">[45]</xref> that has also been used to monitor both ER and oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Gupta2">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Badr1">[50]</xref>. Here, we used the FLuc reporter not as an absolute measure of protein folding, but as a sensor for relative cytoplasmic folding stress when comparing control with diseased cells. Importantly, F508del-expressing cells exhibited a 50% reduction in the specific activity of FLuc compared to WT-expressing cells, which was restored to WT-like levels in response to F508del silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1L</xref>). Since the chronic activation of the HSR, observed in response to the expression of a misfolded protein, negatively impacts the folding of other cellular proteins as reported by FLuc, a state which is likely to impact multiple cellular function(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g001">Figure 1M</xref>), we refer to this altered PN environment as a maladaptive stress response (MSR).</p>

<title>The Hsp90 Co-chaperone p23 is a Key Regulator of the MSR</title>
<p>Given the increased activation of HSF1 in cells expressing F508del-CFTR, we next examined the impact of the Hsp90 co-chaperone, p23, an important regulator of HSF1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Morimoto1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Bharadwaj1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Anckar2">[52]</xref>. Since the MSR is a chronic response, we performed all small interfering RNA (siRNA) interventions for a total of six days to allow for appropriate rebalancing of the PN environment. P23 silencing significantly reduced HSF1 activation in response to HS, as exemplified by a reduction in the level of HSF1-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), confirming its central role in the activation cycle of HSF1. At physiological temperature, p23 silencing in F508del-expressing CFBEs also resulted in a significant decrease in HSF1 and HSF1-P protein levels, as well as I-Hsp70 mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g002">Figure 2B, 2C</xref>), to a level similar to that seen in WT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, abrogation of the MSR following p23 silencing led to a concomitant restoration of FLuc folding in F508del-expressing CFBEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Modulation of the MSR by sip23 Improves F508del Channel Activity</title>
<p>Since p23 silencing reduced the MSR state in F508del-expressing cells, we assessed its effect on F508del-CFTR biogenesis. P23 silencing resulted in a significant increase in F508del ER stability (band-B) and trafficking (band-C) compared to control siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

These results suggest that a reduction of the MSR, which restores a WT-like PN state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), supports the increased trafficking efficiency of F508del similar to what is observed following 30°C correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), providing significant benefit to the CF phenotype. P23 silencing did not increase WT stabilization or trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that its effect on F508del correction occurs in response to alleviation of the MSR exclusively seen in F508del-expressing cells.</p>

<p>CFTR pulse labeling in response to sip23 revealed a significant increase in the synthesis of F508del-CFTR but not of WT-CFTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s003">Figure S3B, S3D</xref>), consistent with the results presented above for the steady-state levels of CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g003">Figure 3A, 3C</xref>). This differential synthesis could be due to change in transcription, translation and/or post-translational stability of F508del-CFTR. Although p23 down-regulates the transcription of the glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Freeman1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Freeman2">[55]</xref>, we did not observe any changes in WT- or F508del-CFTR mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). However, p23 silencing did significantly reduce the degradation rate of F508del-CFTR but not that of WT-CFTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s003">Figure S3A, S3C</xref>), suggesting that p23 specifically affects the stability of nascent F508del-CFTR. Increased F508del stability was not due to altered proteasome activity, since combining sip23 with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, resulted in an additive effect on F508del stability and trafficking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). In support of this conclusion, the levels of ubiquitinated F508del following sip23 also remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s003">Figure S3F</xref>). p23 silencing also promoted a significant reduction of Hsc/p70 and Hsp90 (Hsp90α and Hsp90β) levels recovered in F508del-CFTR immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that abrogation of the MSR allows F508del-CFTR to properly navigate early folding intermediates known to contribute to the ER retention of F508del-CFTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Coppinger1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>Given the observed correction of the F508del-CFTR trafficking defect by p23 silencing, we assessed whether the corrected pool of F508del was functional. F508del-expressing cells treated with sip23 exhibited a significant increase in channel activity, as determined by iodide efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) and short circuit current (I<sub>sc</sub>) recordings (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

<title>MSR Poses a General Challenge to Misfolding Diseases</title>

<p>In order to determine whether the MSR observed in CF is a general phenomenon associated with protein misfolding diseases, we monitored the HSR activation state in models of AATD, NPC1, and AD. In AATD, the G342K mutation in AAT, referred to as the Z-variant, results in ER-retention, polymerization, and degradation of this normally secreted enzyme, the loss of which leads to COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Perlmutter1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Bouchecareilh2">[59]</xref>.

Furthermore, HSF1 silencing resulted in increased maturation (AAT-M) and secretion (AAT-S) of the mutant Z-AAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g004">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s004">Figure S4C, S4E</xref>); however, no changes in the polymerization state of the Z-AAT variant were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s004">Figure S4D</xref>).

An analysis of human primary fibroblasts from homozygous I1061T NPC1 patients and healthy donors (WT) reveals that cells expressing the I1061T variant exhibit an elevation in the levels of HSF1-P, suggesting the presence of a MSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g004">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s004">Figure S4F</xref>). Here HSF1 silencing also improved the trafficking defect of I1061T-NPC1, as exemplified by the increased endo H resistance reflecting modification of its N-linked oligosaccharides by Golgi enzymes, relative to that seen with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>We then examined a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> model of cytoplasmic amyloid aggregation. <italic>C. elegans</italic> expressing the β-amyloid-42 (Aβ<sub>42</sub>) peptide fused to CFP (Aβ<sub>42</sub>-CFP) under the control of a muscle-specific unc-54 promoter forms CFP-positive Aβ aggregates in the cytoplasm of muscle cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s005">Figure S5A, S5B</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> model has been extensively used in the field of misfolding diseases and is a validated tool to study the impact of amyloid disease in organismal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-vanOostenHawle1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Taylor1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-NussbaumKrammer1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Lapierre1">[66]</xref>. Here we observed an increase in I-Hsp70 level in Aβ<sub>42</sub> worms (∼150-fold, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s005">Figure S5C</xref>), which was not further up-regulated after HS as seen in WT worms. Up-regulation of I-Hsp70 was reduced in response to HSF1 silencing or reduction of Aβ<sub>42</sub> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s005">Figure S5D</xref>), indicating that the misfolding stress caused by Aβ<sub>42</sub> expression also induces a MSR state. Accumulation of cytosolic Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregates led to paralysis in 75% of diseased worms relative to its WT counterparts, which was significantly reduced by silencing of not only Aβ<sub>42</sub> (silencing of yellow fluorescent protein- [siYFP]) but also in response to I-Hsp70 and HSF1 silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s005">Figure S5E, S5F</xref>). Conversely, HSF1 overexpression resulted in increased Aβ<sub>42</sub> induced proteotoxicity with an approximately 30% increase in paralyzed worms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s005">Figure S5G</xref>).</p>
<p>To extend these observations to a neurodegenerative model of Aβ<sub>42</sub> amyloid aggregation, we examined the expression levels of HSF1 and HSF1-P (phosphorylated at T<sup>142</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Soncin1">[67]</xref> in brain homogenates of WT and AD mice (AβPP Tg) at three different ages (approximately 4 mo, 9 mo, and 16 mo old). We observed a significant increase in both HSF1 and HSF1-P expression in all AD mice compared to their age-matched WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). The toxic Aβ<sub>42</sub> amyloid species (4 kDa monomer and 6-12 kDa multimers) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Podlisny1">[68]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Pham1">[69]</xref>, previously characterized in this AβPP Tg mice model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Havas1">[70]</xref>, were detected in brain homogenates from AD mice but not in that of WT mice. The accumulation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> amyloid in AD mice was also age dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g004">Figure 4H</xref>), consistent with previously published studies showing age-dependent increase in Aβ plaques, and mean plaque size on these mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Havas1">[70]</xref>. Despite the age-related increase in toxic amyloid, we did not observe an age-dependent increase in HSF1-P in the AD mice, a result consistent with the known decline of proteostatic capacity as has been previously documented in aging organisms in the face of increasing cellular stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Liang1">[71]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Taylor3">[73]</xref>.</p>

<title>Silencing of HSF1 Improves F508del Folding and Its Cell Surface Stability</title>
<p>The MSR is a chronic state transferring the misfolding challenges to all aspects of cellular folding biology managed by proteostasis components impacting the activity of the Q-state of F508del <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Coppinger1">[42]</xref>. Thus, we examined in more detail the impact of HSF1 silencing, which in our CF cell model resulted in increased stability and trafficking of F508del-CFTR at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To address whether the observed increased in F508del stability reflected an increase in global protein synthesis, we compared the level of S<sup>35</sup>-labeled proteins in cellular lysates from F508del-expressing cells in the presence or absence of siHSF1 to that seen in WT-expressing cells. Strikingly, we first observed that MSR-affected F508del-expressing cells exhibited a drastic decrease in total protein synthesis, representing less than 50% of that seen in healthy WT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This highlights the negative impact of MSR activation on the proteome and is consistent with attenuation of protein synthesis seen in numerous types of stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hu1">[74]</xref>. HSF1 silencing had no impact on the level of total protein synthesized in F508del-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g005">Figure 5A</xref>); however, we did observe an increase in F508del synthesis after pulse labeling, followed by increased stability of de novo synthesized F508del band-B in the chase phase of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We also observed increased stability of band-C after inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). To determine if band-C stability resulted from increased band B to C trafficking following CHX treatment, we used brefeldin A (BFA) to block ER to the Golgi trafficking and track the stability of rescued F508del-CFTR (rF508del) band-C by preventing egress to the cell surface. The half-life (T1/2) of band-C in temperature-rescued F508del (rF508del) was approximately 2 h, whereas HSF1 silencing significantly increased the stability of the rF508del pool, exhibiting a T1/2 of 6 h, a value similar to that seen for WT-CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These data suggest that alteration of the MSR by siHSF1 increases the stability of rF508del band-C, possibly as a result of improved protein folding.</p>

<p>To directly address whether we have achieved improved protein folding following siHSF1, we used limited trypsin proteolysis, a method previously shown to distinguish between the stable and destabilized fold of the WT and F508del variants, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hoelen1">[75]</xref>. We used antibodies specific for the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1: 18D1) and second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2: M3A7) of CFTR, to assess the susceptibility of these domains to resist proteolysis. HSF1 silencing leads to a significant stabilization of both NBD1 and NBD2, exhibiting a more pronounced stabilizing effect to that seen with temperature correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). It also led to the appearance of an approximately 25 kDa band in NBD1, which has previously been described to represent the stable core fragment seen in WT-CFTR, but not in the F508del variant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hoelen1">[75]</xref>. HSF1 silencing also restored the folding of the FLuc reporter to a level comparable to that seen in sip23-treated F508del-expressing cells and WT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Overall our results suggest that alleviation of the MSR by siHSF1 generates a more permissive cellular environment for productive folding, not only improving the CF phenotype but also that of other protein misfolding diseases by restoring a WT-like proteostasis environment.</p>
<p>To understand the impact of HSF1 silencing on F508del-CFTR stability, we performed gene expression analysis. Here we found that HSF1 or p23 silencing leads to a reduction in the expression of HSF1-responsive genes, such as I-Hsp70, HSPB1, and I-Hsp40. However, they had no effect on the transcription of CFTR itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s006">Figure S6A</xref>), nor the expression levels of markers for other PN cellular pathways, including ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS), autophagy, and oxidative stress (NRF2 pathway) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). In addition to the alleviation of the HSR, both siHSF1 and sip23 also decreased the expression of UPR-related genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). UPR but not the oxidative stress pathway was up-regulated in F508del-expressing cells in comparison with WT-expressing or CFTR−/− cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s006">Figure S6C</xref>), suggesting a link between HSR and UPR activation, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Heldens1">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, we used the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) to examine the impact of proteasome and autophagic pathways on the FLuc folding sensor. Whereas HS of F508del-expressing cells further reduced FLuc activity and folding from a level of 50% to 25% of that of WT-cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s006">Figure S6D</xref>), neither MG132 nor 3-MA impacted FLuc folding in F508del-expressing cells. These results suggest that blocking proteasomal activity or autophagy is not sufficient to rescue FLuc folding in an environment already affected by the MSR.</p>

<title>Chemical Inhibition of HSF1 Activation Promotes Correction of CF</title>
<p>Given the impact of the MSR on the recovery of F508del function, we tested the effect of chemical inhibition of HSF1 in F508del-expressing CFBEs, using the previously characterized HSF1 inhibitor, triptolide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Au1">[76]</xref>. Triptolide reduced the HS-induced up-regulation of I-Hsp70 and I-Hsp90 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), confirming its ability to block HSF1 transactivation, consistent with previously published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Au1">[76]</xref>. Treatment of F508del-expressing cells with triptolide resulted in an increase in band-B stability as well as trafficking to band-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). It also restored cell surface channel activity shown by quenching of the halide sensing YFP-H148Q/I152L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), to a level similar to that seen with VX809 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Since misfolding diseases present a chronic challenge to the cell, we next assessed the benefit a chronic dosing regimen of triptolide on correcting the F508del-CFTR trafficking defect. Chronic treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase in stabilization and trafficking of F508del-CFTR over the course of 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001998-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The effect of triptolide was dependent on HSF1, since combining triptolide and siHSF1 did not result in additivity for F508del stability, trafficking, and function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s007">Figure S7B</xref>), further supporting the conclusion that suppression of HSF1 hyper-activation promotes F508del correction.</p>

We have found that targeting the MSR can significantly alleviate disease progression, thereby improving the disease phenotype in different disease models of protein folding. In CF, this is consistent with the view that folding of CFTR is a multi-step, vectorial process involving sequential folding intermediates that must be therapeutically managed for effective correction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Coppinger1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Okiyoneda1">[78]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Mendoza1">[79]</xref>.

<title>Q-state management of MSR to correct human disease.</title>
<p>Illustrated is the activation state of the HSR in response to acute stress (red) or to the MSR (blue) seen in disease. Acute HSR activation, seen during acute stress insults, protects from and/or corrects misfolding and rapidly returns to basal levels, allowing normal biology to resume. In misfolding disease, chronic activation of the HSR alters the normal, physiologic Q-state (Q<sup>n</sup>) because of the continued expression of misfolded protein. Once chronically elevated (Q*), the folding environment becomes maladaptive as it fails to return to the Q<sup>n</sup> (light yellow area). Down-regulation of the MSR by siHSF1, sip23, or triptolide promotes a reduction of the Q*, which now falls within the proteostasis buffering capacity (green line), promoting a more normal cellular folding environment. This effect can be further improved (purple line) when combined with protein fold correctors (pharmacologic chaperones; PCs) which impart improved thermodynamic stability to the fold, or proteostasis regulators (PRs) that improve protein Q-state biology, improving function of disease-related misfolded protein and its proteome's associated environment, promoting abrogation of the chronic stress and improving health.</p>

Thus, while the mechanism of action of HSF1 activation is poorly understood, perhaps reflecting experimental conditions where a ‘brief’ burst of chaperones provides temporary relief to the misfolding problem, there is limited evidence in vivo that chronic activation of HSF1 provides long-term disease benefit. Indeed, proliferation of cancer cells is also dependent on a MSR characterized by sustained HSR activation and elevated levels of proteostatic components that sustain invasive survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Mendillo1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Trepel1">[38]</xref>, a pathological condition leading to reduced human lifespan.</p>
<p>The global proteotoxic crises that arise in protein misfolding diseases may be a consequence of an amplifying cascade of misfolding challenges as disease progresses, a view consistent with reports of reduced longevity in worms following chronic overexpression of misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Gidalevitz1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Morley1">[90]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Gidalevitz2">[101]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Brignull1">[102]</xref>. Alternatively, disease progression could reflect either the loss of proteostatic capacity associated with aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Wirth1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Morimoto1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Taylor1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Taylor3">[73]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Riedel1">[103]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Vilchez2">[105]</xref> or an overload of the cellular PN capacity. In the latter case, since Hsc/Hsp70 and Hsp90 represent at least 0.5% and 1% of total cellular protein, respectively, and cells exhibiting a MSR have reduced global protein synthesis, it is unlikely that the chaperone capacity per se is saturated, but this remains to be tested directly, given the complexity of the folding environment and lack of understanding of chaperone capacity in each cell type and/or disease environment. However, we have observed that the silencing of key proteostatic chaperones leads to a partial rescue of F508del-CFTR cell surface channel activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001998.s007">Figure S7E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Grove1">[106]</xref>, arguing against a possible overload of the chaperone capacity, at least in CF disease. Indeed, the reduced specific activity of the FLuc sensor suggests a significant challenge to the overall cellular folding environment, a result that is consistent with the recent observation that overexpression of the Hsp40/70 system decreases the fraction of protein that achieves a functional fold using activity-based profiling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Liu1">[11]</xref>. These observations underline the importance in understanding folding mis-management by the chronic MSR that exceeds a set-point defined by chaperone/co-chaperone balance normally required for a healthy cell. It is clear that this new principle of short-term acute versus long-term chronic proteostatic set-points now needs to be considered as an important contributor to the onset and progression of misfolding diseases such as CF, AATD, NPC1, and AD. For example, the activity of FLuc, a sensor of the folding environment of the prevailing PN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Gupta1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Gupta2">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Badr1">[50]</xref>, in cells chronically expressing the misfolded F508del-CFTR was reduced in response to elevated HSF1 activity, but restored to WT-levels upon MSR abrogation by siHSF1, sip23 or, importantly, following removal of the misfolded F508del-CFTR. Here, we suggest that p23, acting in concert with Hsp90 in protein folding and transcriptional activation of HSF1, accentuates the activity of the chaperone trap components, engaging F508del in an inappropriate attempt to resolve progression along the folding pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Coppinger1">[42]</xref>. Consistent with this conclusion, we observed HSF1 phosphorylation and I-Hsp70 levels, in response to sip23, reduced to the levels seen in WT-expressing cells, thereby restoring a WT-like PN that would be expected to be optimized for CFTR biogenesis and proteome function. While abrogation of the MSR by siHSF1 did not affect CFTR transcription, global protein synthesis, or other tested PN pathways (UPS, autophagy, and oxidative stress), it specifically abrogated both the HSR and UPR activation, restoring function. It also improved folding and activity of the FLuc reporter sensor. Thus, we now suggest that early translation-linked events could be critical determinants of HSR, disease onset and/or progression promoting the MSR, a conclusion consistent with the increasing regulatory complexity of the HSR at the level of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Park1">[96]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Raychaudhuri1">[107]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Hipp1">[108]</xref>.</p>

<title>AD Mice and Mouse Brain Homogenization</title>
<p>AD mice, referred to as the AβPP Tg mice model, express the hAPP751 cDNA containing the London (V717I) and Swedish (K670M/N671L) mutations under the regulatory control of the murine (m)Thy-1 gene (mThy1-hAPP751). Mice were generated as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001998-Rockenstein1">[121]</xref>. For this study, the APP line 41 mice (C57/BI6) were utilized, as they produce high levels of Aβ<sub>42</sub> and develop synaptic damage and memory deficits. Young (approximately 4 mo old), middle aged (approximately 9 mo old), and old (approximately 16 mo old), WT and AD mice pairs were humanely killed, and tissue was frozen for analysis. Posterior half of mouse hemibrains were homogenized in 500 µl of PDGF buffer (1 mM HEPES, 5 mM Benzamidine, 2 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 3 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM Magnesium Sulfate, 0.05% Sodium Azide, 2 mg/ml Protease Inhibitor cocktail [Roche], and 1 tablet of PhosSTOP phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail [Roche] per 10 ml of buffer, pH 8.8), using a tissue homogenizer. Samples were spun at 5,000 g for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C to separate the cytosolic and particulated fractions. Pellets were resuspended in 150 µl of PDGF buffer and homogenized by sonication (10% for 10 s). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford, and 20 µg protein from cytosolic fractions were loaded in SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. To detect Aβ monomer and multimers, 40 µg particulate fractions of brain homogenates were loaded in a 4%–12% bis-tris gel and immunoblots were incubated with 6E10 Aβ specific antibody (Covance).</p>

<title>CFTR Trypsin Proteolysis</title>
<p>CFBE41o- cells expressing WT- or F508del-CFTR at the indicated treatment were lysed for 30 min at 4°C with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml Protease Inhibitor cocktail [Roche]), and harvested at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Total protein concentration of pre-cleared lysates was determined by Bradford. Proteolysis was performed by incubating 80 µg of total protein with increasing concentration of Trypsin in PBS (0.01–0.25 mg/ml) at 4°C for 15 min. Proteolysis was stopped by adding 1 mM of PMSF and 6x SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were equally divided and loaded onto two 12% SDS-PAGE for separation of the proteolytic fragments and probed with CFTR antibodies for NBD1 (18D1: epitope 536-545) and NBD2 (M3A7).</p>

<title>NPC1 Endo-H Digestion</title>
<p>Hela cells expressing WT- or I1061T-NPC1 were transfected for 72 h, lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 2 mg/ml Protease Inhibitor cocktail [Roche]), and harvested at 20,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. NPC1 was immunoprecipitated using 400 µg of total protein and 2 µg of NPC1 antibody, for 18 h at 4°C. Complexes were recovered with 40 µl of γ-bind beads incubated at 4°C for 2 h. The beads were washed two times with lysis buffer, and one time with PBS, and eluted with 36 µl of denaturing buffer (NEB) for 10 min at 90°C. Elutions were divided in two tubes, one without and other with 1 µl of endo-H enzyme, and incubate for 1 h at 37°C. Samples were run on 4%–20% gradient gel and immunoblotted for NPC1.</p>
