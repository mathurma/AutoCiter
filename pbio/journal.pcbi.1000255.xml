                <p>We suggest for the first time that the action of multivalent cations on
                    microtubule dynamics can result from facilitated diffusion of GTP-tubulin to the
                    microtubule ends. Facilitated diffusion can promote microtubule assembly,
                    because, upon encountering a growing nucleus or the microtubule wall, random
                    GTP-tubulin sliding on their surfaces will increase the probability of
                    association to the target sites (<italic>nucleation sites or MT ends</italic>).
                    This is an original explanation for understanding the apparent discrepancy
                    between the high rate of microtubule elongation and the low rate of tubulin
                    association at the microtubule ends in the viscous cytoplasm. The mechanism of
                    facilitated diffusion requires an attraction force between two tubulins, which
                    can result from the sharing of multivalent counterions. Natural polyamines
                        (<italic>putrescine, spermidine, and spermine</italic>) are present in all
                    living cells and are potent agents to trigger tubulin self-attraction. By using
                    an analytical model, we analyze the implication of facilitated diffusion
                    mediated by polyamines on nucleation and elongation of microtubules. <italic>In
                        vitro</italic> experiments using pure tubulin indicate that the promotion of
                    microtubule assembly by polyamines is typical of facilitated diffusion. The
                    results presented here show that polyamines can be of particular importance for
                    the regulation of the microtubule network <italic>in vivo</italic> and provide
                    the basis for further investigations into the effects of facilitated diffusion
                    on cytoskeleton dynamics.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Interactions between biomolecules (DNA, proteins, sugar, etc.) represent the link
                    between genome information and function of living organisms. For effective
                    competition between organisms and adaptation to environmental changes, these
                    interactions have to take place at very high rates. As such interactions require
                    successive associations and dissociations between biomolecules, most of the time
                    could be spent in between interactions when biomolecules diffuse freely in the
                    intracellular space until the next interaction occurs. To reduce this waste of
                    time, cells have developed adaptive mechanisms. First, the concentration of
                    biomolecules in the intracellular medium is very high, which increases their
                    frequency of interactions. Second, the possibility for biomolecules to diffuse
                    along linear polymers, a process named “facilitated
                    diffusion,” increases the probability for biomolecules to find their
                    targets. This mechanism was first described to understand how DNA-binding
                    proteins could find their specific targets among thousands of putative binding
                    sites. We show here that facilitated diffusion could also play a significant
                    role in promoting the assembly of cytoskeleton proteins that are involved in
                    critical cell functions (e.g., division or neuron architecture). Alteration of
                    this mechanism may be of particular interest for cancer and
                neuropathologies.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Microtubules (<italic>MTs</italic>) are αβ-tubulin hollow polymers
                that perform major organizational tasks in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Desai1">[1]</xref>. These structures, which
                contribute to the rigidity and structural integrity of the cells, are implicated in
                motor-driven intracellular traffic of organelles and vesicles, in the formation of
                the mitotic spindle and in cell migration and motility. At least two physical
                parameters counteract microtubule assembly in cells: (i) their highly negatively
                charged surface due to the negative charge of the αβ-tubulin
                heterodimer itself (20–30 e<sup>−</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Mejillano1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Sanabria1">[4]</xref>, which
                induces an electrostatic self-repulsion between tubulin molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Sackett1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Schreiber1">[6]</xref>, (ii)
                the viscosity of the cytoplasm which slows down tubulin diffusion (about
                        <italic>5.10<sup>−12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s</italic> as measured in
                sea urchin extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Salmon1">[7]</xref>). Consequently, due to the requirement of a proper
                orientation of tubulin to associate to MT ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Janin1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Northrup1">[9]</xref>, the flow of tubulin
                arriving directly to microtubule ends by 3D diffusion is critical to sustain the
                rapid elongation of microtubules observed in cells (&gt;10 µm/s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Cassimeris1">[10]</xref>).
                We propose here that facilitated diffusion may significantly enhance the association
                of tubulin to growing nuclei or microtubules. The mechanism of facilitated diffusion
                was already introduced to understand how DNA-binding proteins can find their target
                sites by sliding and hopping along DNA molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Berg1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Winter1">[12]</xref>. However facilitated
                diffusion can also favour tubulin association to nucleus and microtubule ends
                provided that an attraction exists between tubulins and microtubules or nucleus to
                enable sliding. This attraction force can be triggered by the presence of small
                multivalent cations that are shared between tubulin dimers. Among small cations,
                polyamines such as divalent putrescine, trivalent spermidine and tetravalent
                spermine are reasonable candidates due to their high concentrations in all cells
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Igarashi1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Thomas1">[14]</xref>. Surprisingly, despite the potential influence of
                polyamines on tubulin dynamics in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Heby1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Pohjanpelto1">[16]</xref>, only a few
                studies have addressed the mechanisms by which they act on microtubule assembly. The
                enhancement of the polymerization rate observed <italic>in vitro</italic> was
                generally attributed to the neutralization of the C-terminal tails of tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Mejillano1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Wolff1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Sackett2">[18]</xref>. In
                addition to this effect, facilitated diffusion can also explain how multivalent
                cations actually act on the different aspects of microtubule assembly, notably

            <p>In this paper we thus decipher, both theoretically and experimentally, if facilitated
                diffusion can interfere with microtubule dynamics. Taking advantage of the recent
                advances in the description of the electrostatic properties of tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Priel1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Sanabria1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Tuszynski1">[19]</xref>, we
                show that the attraction force between highly anionic tubulins, mandatory for
                facilitated diffusion, can indeed occur due to the presence of polyamines. We then
                develop an analytical model to describe the influence of facilitated diffusion on
                microtubule assembly. Considering an attraction between tubulin dimers, we propose
                that facilitated diffusion can act on MT dynamics via two different ways: (i) a
                longer residency time of tubulin onto a growing nucleus which favours association,
                (ii) a facilitated elongation thanks to sliding of free tubulin to the MT ends. A
                series of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments is conducted to test the model
                through the analysis of light scattering curves, sedimentation assays and high
                resolution AFM imaging of MTs. Finally, to approach more physiological conditions,
                we show some preliminary results for MAPs-tubulin.</p>

                <title>Tubulin:Tubulin Attraction Mediated by Polyamine Sharing</title>
                <p>Multivalent cations like polyamines can induce an electrostatic attraction
                    between two highly negatively charged surfaces. The theoretical treatment of
                    this force has been the subject of extensive studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Grosberg1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Angelini1">[23]</xref>
                    in particular to explain the phenomenon of DNA condensation by polyamines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Nguyen1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Pastre1">[26]</xref>. Concerning
                    microtubules, their self-attraction can also be triggered by multivalent salts
                    and can lead to the formation of bundles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Needleman1">[27]</xref>. The energy
                    benefit of association between two like-charged bodies is generally due to the
                    correlations between the multivalent counterions condensed on their surfaces.
                    Here we will show that the interaction between two tubulin heterodimers, which
                    are highly negatively charged proteins with a net charge about 20–30
                        e<sup>−</sup>, at pH around 7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Tuszynski1">[19]</xref>, may also be
                    influenced by this mechanism. Let us first estimate the attraction energy
                    between two tubulin heterodimers in the presence of polyamines. The
                    αβ-tubulin heterodimer is a nonspherical globule, having
                    dimensions of 46×80×65 Å with two long C-terminal
                    tails (<italic>∼35 Å</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Priel1">[3]</xref>. Most of the tubulin
                    charge, at least 40%, is concentrated in the C-terminal tails so that
                    the charge distribution on its surface is non homogeneous. We then need to
                    investigate the electrostatic properties of the C-terminal tails and of the
                    remaining of the heterodimer molecule separately. As described in details in
                        <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000255.s003">Text
                    S1</xref>, we obtained after theoretical developments the energy gain for these
                    two interactions. The attraction energy for two heterodimers without the
                    C-terminal tails is positive for putrescine and spermidine and negative only for
                    spermine (<italic>−0.26 K<sub>B</sub>T</italic>), which means a weak
                    energy benefit. As this result was obtained by considering that there is only
                    spermine on heterodimer surfaces, we might expect that the resulting attraction
                    force is negligible in physiological conditions where spermine competes with
                    other cations or proteins for tubulin neutralization. On the other hand, the
                    attraction energy becomes significantly larger between two interacting tubulin
                    C-terminal tails. We obtained in this case <italic>U<sub>C</sub></italic> values
                    of +4.7, −2.6, −5 and −6.2
                            <italic>K<sub>B</sub>T</italic> for cation valence

                    respectively, showing the presence of an attraction energy when Z&gt;1 and
                    which increases with the valence of ions. The energy benefit per counterion in
                    correlations remains lower than <italic>K<sub>B</sub>T</italic> for divalent
                    putrescine (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000255.s003">Text S1</xref>) so that it could hardly induce an attraction force between
                    C-terminal tails due to thermal agitation. On the other hand, we expect that
                    trivalent spermine and tetravalent spermidine can induce a significant
                    attraction force between the C-terminal tails of tubulin dimers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000255.s003">Text S1</xref> and

                        <p>(A) Attraction between two tubulin heterodimers mediated by polyamines.
                            The attraction is mediated by the two C-terminal tails of one tubulin
                            dimer, which, for entropic reasons (<italic>separation distance between
                                the two C-termini tails on a tubulin dimer</italic>), are likely to
                            share polyamines with two C-terminal tails of another tubulin dimer. (B)
                            In the absence of an attraction force, many collisions between tubulin
                            and nucleus do not result in association, whereas, in the presence of an
                            attraction force, both facilitated diffusion via sliding and an increase
                            of the interaction lifetime favour association to the growing nucleus.
                            (C) In the presence of an attraction force, sliding of tubulin along the
                            cylindrical surface of MT favours tubulin association to the MT
                        ends.</p>

                <p>As the correlations between monovalent cations cannot contribute to the
                    attraction force, the replacement of multivalent cations at high monovalent salt
                    concentrations by monovalent ones lowers the attraction force. The fractional
                    surface concentration of the multivalent cations, which is the ratio of the
                    multivalent counterion surface density to the total surface density of the
                    counterions, is very sensitive to the counterion valence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Rouzina2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Pastr2">[29]</xref>.
                    Higher valence cations are generally better competitors for the surface
                    neutralization than lower valence ones (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000255.s004">Text S2</xref> and
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Rouzina2">[28]</xref>). In addition, the monovalent salt concentration
                    above which multivalent cations are removed from the surface increases with the

                        multivalent cations at high concentrations can promote the formation of
                        large bundles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Needleman1">[27]</xref>. The formation of small oligomers and

                        aberrant structures appear increase with the ionic strength. For example, in

                        As previously reported, increasing the charge of the counterion favors MT
                        assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Wolff1">[17]</xref>. In agreement with our model, the effect
                        of putrescine is negligible due to a lower energy gain in counterion sharing
                        and an easier replacement by monovalent cations whereas the effects of
                        spermidine and spermine on MT assembly are more pronounced. Above
                        150–300 µM, the beneficial effects of spermine and
                        spermidine on the maximum polymerization rate decrease while they still
                        induce a high polymerized mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, under these conditions, we detected by AFM

                        tubulin heterodimers is not due to a simple neutralization effect since
                        neutralization does not lead to attraction between heterodimers. It should
                        be triggered by an attraction force via polyamine correlations between

                                M. (A) Both spermidine and spermine promote microtubule assembly at
                                submilimolar concentrations whereas putrescine is unable to improve
                                tubulin polymerization even at large concentrations
                                    (<italic>&gt;1 mM</italic>). However, at high concentrations
                                of spermidine and spermine (<italic>&gt;200
                                µM</italic>), tubulin aggregates are formed which lowers
                                the apparent assembly slope leading to a bell-shape profile. (B) SDS
                                page analyses reveal that spermidine gradually increases the pellet
                                mass. As observed by AFM, the increase of the pellet mass is due to
                                microtubule formation at moderate spermidine concentrations
                                    (<italic>25–200 µM</italic>) but, at higher

                                oligomers and (or) tubulin aggregates are also observed and
                                participate to the increase of the pellet mass. The dashed line
                                represents the transition between the zones of microtubule assembly

                        multivalent cations by monovalent ones. Therefore, upon increasing KCl
                        concentration, the beneficial effect of polyamines on tubulin assembly
                        should be significantly inhibited (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000255.s004">Text S2</xref>
                        for details). We thus analyzed the light scattering curves for different
                        concentrations of KCl with or without spermidine. For all conditions, we
                        verified using AFM that only MTs and not tubulin aggregates were formed. As
                        predicted by our model, in the absence of KCl, the rate of assembly is
                        higher with 100 µM spermidine than in its absence (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g005">Figure 5B with Figure 5A</xref>).
                        In the presence of 50 mM KCl and 100 µM spermidine, the slopes of

                        no longer observed. This is due to the replacement of polyamines by
                        potassium ions which inhibits the polyamine sharing between tubulin dimers

                <title>Attraction of Tubulin Dimers onto Microtubules Mediated by Polyamines</title>
                <p>As facilitated diffusion requires tubulin sliding on microtubules, we
                    investigated if polyamines can mediate an attraction of tubulin dimers on
                    microtubules. To measure this interaction, fluorescent Cy3-labeled tubulin
                        (<italic>0.3 µM</italic>) was allowed to interact with non
                    fluorescent taxol-stabilized microtubules (<italic>4 µM polymerized
                        tubulin</italic>). This step was conducted without GTP at 22°C and
                    without taxol to avoid the formation of new microtubules with Cy3-tubulin
                    dimers. We then detected the attraction of fluorescent tubulin through the
                    co-precipitation with microtubules at 20,000×g for 10 min at
                    22°C. The analysis of the fluorescence intensities of both supernatants
                    and pellets shows than Cy3-tubulin was indeed co-precipitated with MTs at
                    spermidine concentrations higher than 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Even if the supernatant
                    fluorescence intensity is lower at higher spermidine concentrations, we note
                    that the concentration of free tubulin in the supernatant remains close to its
                    maximum at low spermidine concentrations. Therefore the attraction of tubulin
                    onto microtubule is relatively weak under these conditions, with both free and
                    adsorbed Cy3-tubulin coexisting. We shall see in the
                    “elongation” section that the strength of this interaction
                    is an important parameter which modulates the efficiency of facilitated
                    diffusion. As a control, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000255.s001">figure S1</xref> in supplementary files shows more

                        reaction process, the nucleation step is a more complex mechanism which
                        requires the association of a few tubulin heterodimers to form a stable
                        nucleus. Based on previous models of actin polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Oosawa1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Wegner1">[32]</xref>, Voter and
                        Erikson developed a widely used model of two-dimensional nucleation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Voter1">[33]</xref>.
                        They showed that the tenth time of the assembly curve (<italic>the time
                            necessary to reach 10% of the plateau value</italic>) is
                        expected to decrease at the n<sup>th</sup> power of the tubulin
                        concentration where, for their model, 2n−1 is the number of
                        tubulin dimers in the critical nucleus. More recently, using a different
                        approach, Flyvbjerg and co-workers considered nucleation as process with
                        successive intermediate steps of assembly during which only free tubulins
                        are added to the growing nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Flyvbjerg1">[34]</xref>. In this
                        model, there is still a similar power law dependence but between the final
                        mass of polymerized tubulin and the tenth time of assembly. In addition they
                        proposed that the size of the stable nucleus can be derived from the initial
                        slope of the assembly curve in a log-log plot, this slope being proportional
                        to the number of successive steps required to form the stable nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Flyvbjerg1">[34]</xref>.</p>
                    <p>Whereas it is accepted that the tenth time of assembly decreases with a power
                        law dependence in tubulin concentration (<italic>or the final mass of
                            polymerized tubulin</italic>), the size of the stable nucleus for
                            <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly is still under debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Bonfils1">[35]</xref>. A larger nucleus of 15 dimers was found in
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Flyvbjerg1">[34]</xref> contrary to others which found a smaller

                        was suggested that the nucleus is not a clearly defined structure and that
                        the number of dimers forming the nucleus is rather an average value between
                        many alternative pathways leading to microtubule elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Caudron1">[37]</xref>. This important issue needs however to be
                        tackled specifically. Here we will mainly focus our attention on the
                        influence of facilitated diffusion on nucleation using both the models of

                    <p>Nucleation requires the association of a few dimers <italic>and</italic>
                        implies that the encounters take place via 3D diffusion. The probability of
                        formation of such improbable complex can however be significantly enhanced
                        by facilitated diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Janin1">[8]</xref>. Facilitated diffusion, as already
                        demonstrated for oppositely charged proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Schreiber1">[6]</xref>, requires an
                        attractive interaction between the encounter pair (<italic>nucleus and
                            tubulin</italic>) to be fully operational. It leads to an increase of
                        the interaction lifetime after collision so that there is enough time for
                        diffusion and rotation until the target site is found according to the
                        geometrical constraint (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), assuming that the attractive interaction is weak and
                        will not dramatically affect protein mobility. Hydrophobic and electrostatic
                        attractions between tubulin dimers can play a similar role. For example the
                        tubulin critical concentration is reduced in the presence of glycerol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-OBrien1">[38]</xref>, an effect attributed to a lower water
                        activity and enhanced hydrophobic attraction. Regarding electrostatic
                        interactions, the high negative charge of tubulin is responsive for an
                        electrostatic repulsion which is unfavorable for nucleation. Transforming
                        electrostatic repulsion into electrostatic attraction using polyamines would
                        surely increase the lifetime of interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Janin2">[39]</xref> between a new
                        arriving GTP-tubulin and the nascent nucleus and thus increases the
                        nucleation rate. An increase of the tubulin:nucleus interaction lifetime can
                        be integrated in a simple approach. If the time lapse between two
                        consecutive encounters is shorter than the lifetime of the tubulin:nucleus
                        interaction per encounter, the association constant should weakly depend on
                        the free GTP-tubulin concentration because there will be enough GTP-tubulin
                        to supply specific sites. This occurs above a concentration designated here
                        as C<sub>L</sub>, below which the association rate decreases more abruptly
                        with the free tubulin concentration. This latter feature is typical of the

                    <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows the
                        assembly curve for various concentrations of tubulin with or without
                        spermidine. The measured value of the tenth time is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g007">Figure 7B</xref>. The results are
                        pretty different in control and in the presence of polyamine. Without
                        spermidine, the log–log plot of the tenth time versus tubulin
                        concentrations appears as a straight line in agreement with theories. In the
                        presence of 100 µM spermidine, the tenth time is shorter than in
                        the absence of spermidine whatever the tubulin concentration, thus
                        suggesting that the rate of nucleation is globally higher. We also note that
                        the tenth time decreases to a plateau value of about 0.5–1 min at
                        tubulin concentrations larger than <italic>C<sub>L</sub></italic>
                            (<italic>∼20 µM</italic>). An increase of tubulin
                        concentration has then little effect on nucleation duration, which indicates
                        that 3D diffusion of tubulin to a nascent nucleus is no more the rate
                        limiting step. As predicted by the model of facilitated diffusion, the flux
                        of tubulin delivered to the nucleus may then be sufficient to sustain the
                        highest rate of nucleation via facilitated nucleation. When the tubulin
                        concentration decreases below <italic>C<sub>L</sub></italic>, this is no
                        longer the case since the tenth time increases.</p>

                        which indicates that 5 dimers form the critical nucleus, in agreement with
                        previous reports (the slope is about −2.4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Bonfils1">[35]</xref>,
                        −3.7 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Voter1">[33]</xref> and −4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Leguy1">[36]</xref>). However this
                        curve could not be used to analyze the evolution of the critical nucleus in
                        the presence of spermidine because the experimental data are not properly
                        fitted by a straight line. To proceed differently, we use the theory
                        developed by Flyvbjerg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Flyvbjerg1">[34]</xref>. Assuming
                        some scaling properties of the assembly curves, Flyvbjerg et al. obtained
                        that the critical size of the nucleus is then <italic>3p</italic>, where
                            <italic>p</italic> is the slope of <italic>log
                            [I(t)/I(∞)]</italic> versus

                            a time t</italic>). One of these scaling properties states that the
                        tenth time scales like

                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Flyvbjerg1">[34]</xref>), which indicates that nucleation duration is
                        related to the final mass of microtubules. Our experiments confirmed this
                        scaling property without spermidine but, in the presence of 100 µM
                        spermidine, the power law dependence does not fit properly the data (see
                            <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000255.s002">Figure
                            S2</xref>). Facilitated nucleation explains this finding since the tenth
                        time is roughly constant for tubulin concentrations higher than
                                <italic>C<sub>L</sub></italic>. In spite of this, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g008">Figure 8</xref> the slope of

                        show that spermidine does not change significantly the mean value of the
                        assembly slope at early times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g008">Figure 8</xref>), 2.36 for control and 2.32 with spermidine. This leads
                        to a critical nucleus of about 7 dimers, slightly larger than 5 dimers
                        obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g007">Figure 7B</xref>.
                        The critical size of the nucleus may then be not affected by the addition of
                        spermidine. However, in the absence of a valid theory, this prediction
                        remains to be tested.</p>

                <title>Facilitated Diffusion to the MT Ends</title>
                <p>The probability that free GTP-tubulin molecules encounter long microtubule
                    cylinders can be significantly larger than that of a direct encounter with MT
                    ends. Therefore, after the encounters of tubulin with the MT wall, if the
                    GTP-tubulin can proceed to the random scan of the MT via surface diffusion, a
                    higher association rate of the free GTP-tubulin to the MT ends is expected
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). A parallel
                    can be drawn here between DNA and MTs. Indeed it has been shown that facilitated
                    diffusion of site-specific proteins via 3D diffusion and 1D diffusion on long
                    DNA increases their association rate to target site up to two orders of
                    magnitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-vonHippel1">[40]</xref>. In recent theoretical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-vonHippel1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Halford1">[41]</xref>, simple equations
                    have been developed to describe qualitatively the effect of facilitated
                    diffusion on DNA/protein association constant, in particular, the useful model
                    developed by Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Hu1">[42]</xref> which describes in a simple manner the
                    influence of the attraction energy on facilitated diffusion. Via straightforward
                    modification of this model, we extend its domain of application to free
                    GTP-tubulin diffusion to the MT ends. As the persistence length of MTs is larger
                    than 1 mm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Pampaloni1">[43]</xref>, the MT is considered as a rigid cylinder. In
                    addition, contrary to DNA, its larger radius implies that facilitated diffusion
                    proceeds through 2D diffusion on the MT wall. The main assumption of this model
                    is to consider that the flux of proteins delivered by 3D diffusion to the MT
                    extremities at a distance lower than <italic>λ</italic> from one end is
                    equal to the flux of protein delivered to the end via surface sliding at the
                    equilibrium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Hu1">[42]</xref>. Considering <italic>λ</italic> as the
                    sliding distance on the MT wall, if the separation distance from the nearest MT
                    end and the new coming GTP-tubulin is shorter than <italic>λ</italic>,
                    the GTP-tubulin can find its target site through 2D diffusion whereas for larger
                    distances it will be released from the MT wall before reaching it.

                            <p>(A) Facilitated diffusion of free GTP-tubulin to the MT ends versus

                                        K<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, the effect of facilitated diffusion
                                can be neglected. For
                                    <italic>Uc = −1 and
                                    −2.5 K<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, diffusion of tubulin to
                                the MT ends is facilitated by sliding. When the MTs are short i.e.
                                at the early stage of MT polymerization, the regime I prevails,
                                which is characterized by an increase of
                                    <italic>J<sub>facilitated</sub></italic> with MT length. For
                                longer MTs, for example <italic>L&gt;0.1 µm</italic>
                                for <italic>Uc = −1
                                        K<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, the facilitated diffusion is not
                                increasing with L anymore (<italic>Regime II</italic>). The sharp
                                decrease of <italic>J<sub>facilitated</sub></italic> when MT length
                                approaches its maximum length (<italic>10 µm</italic>) is
                                due to the low free GTP-tubulin concentration near the plateau of
                                the assembly curve. The regime III occurs for
                                    <italic>Uc = −6
                                        K<sub>B</sub>T</italic> and we can observe a rapid decrease
                                of <italic>J<sub>facilitated</sub></italic> with L. It is worth
                                noting that we plotted the average values of the facilitated
                                diffusion to the MT ends versus the average length of the MTs. In
                                other words, it should not be confused with the elongation rate of
                                individual MT. Parameters:

                                The benefit of facilitated diffusion was then maximum. If we now
                                consider that

                                or

                                due to hindered diffusion on microtubules, we observe that the
                                transition from regime I to regime II will arise at shorter
                                    <italic>L values.</italic> This partly inhibits the beneficial

                                energies, which points out the influence of facilitated diffusion on
                                the MT elongation. For this purpose, it is arbitrary assumed that
                                the mean number of MT nuclei is the same for the three different
                                conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000255.s005">Text S3</xref>). It can be though as the
                                last part of the light scattering curve, after the inflexion point,
                                which is more elongation-sensitive. In addition, we assume that the
                                elongation rate is proportional to the difference
                                        (<italic>J<sub>facilitated</sub> -J<sub>0</sub></italic>),
                                where <italic>J<sub>0</sub></italic> is the critical flux of GTP
                                tubulin for which the elongation rate equals the shortening rate.
                                Indeed it is has been shown both experimentally and theoretically
                                that increasing the GTP-tubulin concentration above the critical
                                concentration leads to a linear increase of the mean elongation rate

                                facilitated elongation of MTs through GTP-tubulin sliding both
                                results in a higher amount of polymerized tubulins and a more abrupt
                                slope near the plateau value. Parameters:

                    <p>In this case, there is a sequestration effect of increasing the number of

                        reduce the pool of free tubulin dimers and their diffusion is slower than
                        that of tubulin dimers, which slows the elongation rate. At low magnesium
                        concentrations, the effect of oligomerization is of little importance, as
                        recently shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Krouglova1">[44]</xref> in the presence of 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,
                        but, at high polyamine concentrations (<italic>regime III</italic>), the
                        formation of tubulin aggregates or small oligomers may be favored (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In the regime
                        III, in addition to the sequestration effect, the formation of multimeric
                        structures could thus lower the elongation rate of microtubules.</p>
                    <p>To summarize the influence of facilitated diffusion on elongation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g009">Figure 9A</xref> represents the
                        rate of GTP-tubulin arriving to the MT ends via facilitated diffusion versus
                        the microtubule length for four attraction energies,
                            (<italic>U<sub>c</sub> = −0.1
                                K<sub>B</sub>T, very low;

                            K<sub>B</sub>T, very strong</italic>). Facilitated diffusion can
                        increase significantly the flux of protein arriving to the MT ends for low
                        and moderate attractions (<italic>at L∼1 µm, there is
                            roughly a fourfold increase of J<sub>facilitated</sub> between
                            Uc = −0.1 K<sub>B</sub>T and

                                K<sub>B</sub>T)</italic>. The flux of GTP-tubulin can be related to
                        the MT elongation rate by assuming that the supply of GTP-tubulin is the
                        rate limiting step for MT elongation. It is certainly a rough assumption,
                        though in agreement with experiments showing an increase of the elongation
                        with GTP-tubulin concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Walker1">[45]</xref>, but it is
                        useful to decipher the possible influence of facilitated diffusion on
                        elongation. For example we expect that a strong attraction should induce
                        shorter MT since the flux of GTP-tubulin is significantly smaller for longer
                        MT in the regime III. We can even go a little further and plot the evolution
                        of the MT assembly curve versus time which only arbitrary takes into account
                        a differential elongation. To do so, we consider that stable nucleus are
                        already formed at <italic>t = 0</italic>
                        and are at the same concentration whatever the polyamine concentrations (see
                            <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000255.s006">Text
                        S4</xref>). These hypotheses allow us to observe the influence of elongation
                        only. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g009">Figure 9C</xref> shows
                        that facilitated elongation could potentially increase the plateau value and
                        the steepness of the assembly curve.</p>
                    <p>In our simple analytical treatment, we neglect the high electric dipole
                        moment of tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules are indeed asymmetric and the
                        local electric field generated by tubulin dipoles should influence the
                        orientation of interacting dimers. Microtubule polarity is also known to
                        cause differential elongation rates between the plus (<italic>fast growing
                            end</italic>) and the minus ends (<italic>slow growing end</italic>). As
                        facilitated elongation proceeds via tubulin sliding on microtubules,
                        microtubule polarity may bias the random sliding with a preferential
                        direction. The relation between facilitated diffusion and local electric
                        fields on microtubule surface could then be an interesting subject of future
                        investigations.</p>

                        presence of polyamines. The experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g007">Figure 7A</xref> clearly show that the plateau
                        value is reached quickly in the presence of polyamines. Therefore
                        facilitated diffusion seems to have a beneficial effect on MT elongation for
                        moderate attraction forces between tubulin dimers. However stronger
                        evidences are required to confirm this proposal of facilitated elongation.
                        We thus analyzed the pseudo-first order rate constant of elongation,
                                <italic>k<sub>obs</sub></italic>. This parameter can be obtained by
                        measuring the slope of <italic>log

                        order rates of elongation increase about 3 times in the presence of 100
                        µM spermidine whatever the tubulin concentration (<italic>except
                            for 40 µM, the elongation rate is then lower than expected
                            without spermidine</italic>). In addition, we note that the pseudo-first
                        order rate constant of elongation increases with tubulin concentration in
                        the presence of spermidine, as predicted in Regime II.</p>

                                MES-KOH pH 6.8, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20%
                                glycerol, 1 mM GTP. At the end of the incubation, 50 µl of

                                or with 100 µM spermidine was then added to 50
                                µl of the microtubule solution. The sudden increase of the
                                free tubulin concentration allows one to observe elongation of the
                                preformed microtubule via light scattering. It turns out that the
                                presence of 100 µM spermidine leads to a significant
                                increase of the elongation rate as indicated by the slope of the
                                assembly curve, which is 2.7 times higher with 100 µM
                                spermidine (<italic>see dotted lines</italic>). The plateau value

                        mostly participate in the elongation of preformed microtubules due to the
                        sudden increase of the free tubulin concentration. If 100 µM
                        spermidine is added to the microtubule solution simultaneously with free

                        indicating a rapid consumption of the free tubulin pool in agreement with

                    <p>An attractive interaction mediated by polyamines may increase the flux of new
                        arriving GTP-tubulins to MT ends. The GTP cap should then be larger which in
                        turn favors microtubule stabilization. However, beyond this kinetic effect,
                        the MT structure would be more stable if an attraction force between tubulin
                        dimers could prevent microtubule depolymerization. During depolymerization,
                        the lateral bonds between dimers (−<italic>3.2 to −5.7

                        the electrostatic interactions mediated by polyamines can influence the
                        depolymerization mechanism, we measured the rate of microtubule disassembly
                        at low temperature with or without spermidine and found that spermidine does
                        not significantly lower the rate of MT disassembly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g011">Figure 11</xref>). This suggests that polyamines
                        do not behave like stabilizing agents. A probable explanation for this is
                        that the roots of the C-terminal tails of two consecutive heterodimers in
                        the MT wall are separated from each other by a distance larger than 5 nm in
                        the lateral direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Chretien1">[47]</xref>, which implies only very limited
                        possibility for the overlapping of two C-terminal tails and thus for
                        polyamine correlations to take place between two C-terminal tails. This
                        observation is thus in agreement with our theoretical conclusion.</p>

                    <p>After incorporation in the MT wall, GTP-tubulin is hydrolyzed into its
                        inactive form, GDP-tubulin. As the presence of GTP-tubulin at the MT ends,
                        the “GTP cap”, is necessary to stabilize microtubules, a
                        sufficient supply of GTP-tubulin to the ends of growing MTs needs to be
                        maintained. In case of lack of GTP-tubulin supply, the GTP cap is then
                        hydrolyzed into GDP-tubulin, which increases the probability of shortening.
                        Microtubule shortening results in an important release of GDP-tubulin from
                        microtubule wall and, in this context, facilitated diffusion can play an
                        important role. For example, when a microtubule shrinks, the attraction on
                        its surface of its own GDP-tubulins may lower the probability of rescue.</p>

            <p>To describe microtubule assembly and dynamics <italic>in vitro</italic>, a simple
                model with two phases, nucleation and elongation is generally advanced. Nucleation
                proceeds via the assembly of several tubulin dimers into a nucleus of critical size

                nucleus varies with the ionic composition of the buffer and the presence of tubulin
                partners. Above this critical size, a short microtubule can be formed and then the
                elongation of the microtubule takes place via the addition of free GTP-tubulin to
                its extremities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Voter1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Flyvbjerg1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Leguy1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Caudron1">[37]</xref>, which
                leads to the formation of a long MTs. The elongation phase is nearly completed when
                the flow of new incoming GTP-tubulin is not sufficient to maintain the GTP cap at
                the MT ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Walker1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Pedigo1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Janosi1">[50]</xref> and thus to prevent MT depolymerisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Walker1">[45]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The important point is that microtubule assembly requires the constant supply of

                obtain about 1500–3800 collisions per second. Such a high collision rate
                via 3D diffusion is largely enough to sustain typical elongation rates (about
                    <italic>14 µm/min</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Cassimeris1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Odde1">[51]</xref>). Indeed, there are about 1640 subunits per
                µm of MT and, if we assume that both ends grow at the same rate, thus
                neglecting treadmilling, the association rate of free GTP-tubulin to one end needs
                to be only larger than 190 s<sup>−1</sup> to maintain elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Odde1">[51]</xref>. It could
                then be advanced that MT dynamics is not diffusion limited. However, this conclusion
                is in apparent contradiction with several experimental evidences linking the
                GTP-tubulin supply to the MT ends and the mean rate of elongation. First, upon
                dilution, MTs collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Walker2">[52]</xref>. Second, near critical concentration, the
                GTP-tubulin supply becomes so critical that elongation only compensate shortening
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Walker1">[45]</xref>.
                Third, the larger is the free tubulin concentration, the faster is the elongation
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Walker1">[45]</xref>
                and the rate of tubulin nucleation also increases sharply with the free tubulin
                concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Voter1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Leguy1">[36]</xref>. One possible explanation for the discrepancy
                between the calculated high collision rate and the high sensitivity of both
                nucleation and MT elongation on free tubulin concentration is that the probability
                for a new coming tubulin to dock correctly on its target site (<italic>lateral or
                    longitudinal bounds</italic>) is low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Northrup1">[9]</xref> and thus requires
                several collision trials. To add credit to this idea, theoretical and experimental
                arguments have shown that an encounter can evolve into a stable complex only if the
                two interacting biomolecules are correctly oriented and positioned, with respect to
                theirs binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Janin1">[8]</xref>. This geometrical constraint, which cannot be
                neglected in the case of tubulin and microtubule, leads to an estimated probability
                of complex formation per encounter 3 to 6 orders of magnitudes lower for typical
                proteins, depending on the number of binding sites and their dimensions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Schreiber1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Janin1">[8]</xref>. Taking
                into account this geometrical factor, the net tubulin association rate to the
                nucleus or MT ends in the conditions described above would rather be between
                0.0015–0.0038 and 1.5–3.8 s<sup>−1</sup>, which is not
                sufficient to sustain MT assembly (<italic>190 s<sup>−1</sup></italic>).
                In this context, it is difficult to longer consider that MT assembly is not
                diffusion limited since many more encounters need to occur to allow microtubule
                elongation and the formation of critical nucleus. As an attraction between tubulin
                dimers can be mediated by multivalent counterions, we propose that polyamines could
                significantly increase the elongation and nucleation rates via facilitated diffusion
                mechanisms.</p>
            <p>Facilitated diffusion increases the flow of free tubulin arriving at the MT ends
                through tubulin sliding. As we can reasonably assume that a larger flow of tubulin
                favors elongation, a significant increase of the elongation rate is then expected
                under the best conditions for facilitated diffusion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Such theoretical predictions are in
                close agreement with the experimental results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g010">Figure 10</xref>. A threefold increase of the
                pseudo-first order rate constant of elongation was measured experimentally with 100
                µM spermidine. Such an increase could be critical <italic>in vivo</italic>
                when tubulin supply is scarce. We also observed that the pseudo-first order rate
                constant of elongation constantly increases with tubulin concentration in the
                presence of spermidine. It indicates that microtubule ends are not saturated with
                free tubulin and, therefore, elongation is still diffusion-limited in the presence
                of polyamines. The elongation rate could then be further increased up to GTP-tubulin
                saturation, which may arise at very high concentrations of tubulin.</p>
            <p>For the nucleation step, an attraction force mediated by polyamines induces a longer
                interaction lifetime between a new incoming GTP-tubulin and the forming nucleus. In
                agreement with this, experimental results clearly indicate that nucleation duration
                in the presence of polyamines is significantly decreased compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g007">Figure 7</xref>), whereas, the critical
                size of the nucleus may not be affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, the tenth time
                    (<italic>lag time of assembly</italic>) no longer decreases for tubulin
                concentrations higher concentration than <italic>C<sub>L</sub></italic>
                    (<italic>∼20 µM</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This is an apparent discrepancy with
                classical theory and with typical <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments as a slight
                reduction of the pool of free tubulin increases the lag time by a dramatic factor
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Voter1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Flyvbjerg1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Leguy1">[36]</xref>). In contrast to elongation, the formation of a
                stable nucleus is the result of many relatively stable intermediate aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Flyvbjerg1">[34]</xref>.
                During this slow process, free tubulin dimers could accumulate on growing nucleus in
                the presence of polyamines. Consequently, the rate of nucleation no longer depends
                on GTP-tubulin concentration because of over-supply. This results is in agreement
                with <italic>in vivo</italic> reports from yeast showing that these cells do not
                have very sensitive mechanisms to regulate their tubulin level (<italic>after a
                    two-fold reduction</italic>), and that such regulation was not necessary for
                normal microtubule function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Katz1">[53]</xref>. The discrepancy between the necessity for a
                close regulation of free tubulin <italic>in vitro</italic> and the apparent
                independence of the nucleation rate on free tubulin level <italic>in vivo</italic>
                could thus be partly explained by polyamines beside other nucleation factors such as
                γ-tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Zheng1">[54]</xref>. The reciprocal consequence is that modulation of
                the polyamine level should influence microtubule nucleation.</p>
            <p>Another interesting point raised by the present study is that polyamines do not
                significantly stabilize microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g011">Figure 11</xref>). Indeed, polyamines participate to MT dynamics to both
                enhance nucleation and the formation of long microtubules but, in the same time,
                they do not prevent MT collapse which would have been toxic for living cells. The
                absence of a significant stabilizing effect of polyamines on microtubules was at
                first glance surprising; however it is most probably due to the fact that, in the MT
                wall, the distance between the C-terminal tails of adjacent tubulin heterodimers is
                too long to allow their significant overlapping.</p>
            <p>The model of facilitated diffusion provides basis to enlighten the interplay between
                polyamines and microtubule dynamics in living cells. The polyamine levels vary
                greatly during the cell cycle and in relation to the proliferation status of tissues

                dynamics in living cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Heby1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Pohjanpelto1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Banan1">[56]</xref>. Indeed
                it has been shown that polyamine concentrations increase significantly during
                mitosis with a sequential patterns reflecting the fact that putrescine is a
                precursor of spermidine and spermidine in turn is a precursor of spermine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Heby1">[15]</xref>. In
                parallel to the increase of polyamines during mitosis, the rate of microtubule
                nucleation also increases sharply during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000255-Piehl1">[57]</xref> to reach at anaphase a
                sevenfold increase compared to that observed in the G2 phase. Our results suggest
                that the increase of the polyamine content could support the increase of MT
                nucleation and elongation. Against this proposal it could however be argued that
                MAPs, which are known to neutralize the negative charge of microtubules and to
                stabilize the microtubule wall, are such strong competitors for the microtubule
                neutralization that they might inhibit the overall effects of polyamines. However
                our results show that polyamines influence MT dynamics even in the presence of MAPs
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000255-g012">Figure 12</xref>). Interestingly
                we also observed that the combination of taxol and spermidine cooperate to increase
                the microtubule mass, which indicates that polyamines and taxol could use different
                mechanisms (<italic>facilitated diffusion and stabilization, respectively</italic>).</p>

                    min). The pellet was washed several times to remove free taxol. After

                        spermidine. Fluorescence microscopy of a non fluorescent MT pellet in the
                        presence of 0.1 µM Cy3-tubulin in buffer M without GTP. i)
                        Microtubule pellet alone; ii) 0.1 µM of Cy3-tubulin was allowed to
                        interact with the microtubule pellet for 15 min; iii) Addition of 200
                        µM spermidine (15 min); iv) Addition of 300 mM NaCl (30 min).
                        Following the addition of spermidine, we observe the apparition of the
                        microtubule pellet in the fluorescence image. The signal to background ratio
                        due to Cy3-tubulin attraction in the pellet is about 13% under
                        such condition, as shown in the line profile of fluorescent intensity. As
                        expected for an electrostatic interaction, Cy3-tubulin was partly released
                        from the microtubule pellet upon the addition of NaCl up to 300 mM.</p>
