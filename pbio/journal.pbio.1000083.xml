        <p>Precise neuronal networks underlie normal brain function and require distinct classes of synaptic connections. Although it has been shown that certain individual proteins can localize to different classes of synapses, the biochemical composition of specific synapse types is not known. Here, we have used a combination of genetically engineered mice, affinity purification, and mass spectrometry to profile proteins at parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses. We identify approximately 60 candidate postsynaptic proteins that can be classified into 11 functional categories. Proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism and signaling, such as the protein kinase MRCKγ, are major unrecognized components of this synapse type. We demonstrate that MRCKγ can modulate maturation of dendritic spines in cultured cortical neurons, and that it is localized specifically to parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses in vivo. Our data identify a novel synapse-specific signaling pathway, and provide an approach for detailed investigations of the biochemical complexity of central nervous system synapse types.</p>

          <p>The brain is composed of many different types of neurons that form very specific connections: synapses are formed with specific cellular partners and on precise subcellular domains. It has been proposed that different combinations of molecules encode the specificity of neuronal connections, implying the existence of a “molecular synaptic code.” To test this hypothesis, we describe a new experimental strategy that allows systematic identification of the protein composition for individual synapse types. We start with mice that are genetically engineered to facilitate the purification of one type of synapse from a given neuronal population in the central nervous system, the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapse. The purification is performed using a combination of biochemical fractionation and affinity purification. Subsequent mass spectrometry allows us to identify approximately 60 different proteins present in the resulting sample. We have further analyzed some of the 60 proteins and show that MRCKγ, a newly identified kinase, is localized in the dendritic spines where the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses are formed and that it can modulate the morphogenesis of dendritic spines. The use of this experimental strategy opens up the ability to provide insights into the underlying “molecular code” for the diverse types of synapses in the brain.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Each of the thousands of cell types present in the nervous system receives multiple classes of inputs that are spatially segregated and functionally distinct. The chemoaffinity hypothesis stated that “the establishment and maintenance of synaptic associations were conceived to be regulated by highly specific cytochemical affinities… .” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b001">1</xref>]. Support for this idea has come from studies of specific synaptic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b003">3</xref>]. For example, different sets of neurotransmitter receptors are found at different synapse types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b003">3</xref>], even at excitatory synapses made on the same neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b004">4</xref>]. Precise subcellular targeting of synapses is also dependent on the recognition of specific molecules such as adhesion proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b005">5</xref>]. In addition to these direct-recognition mechanisms, guidepost cells seem to target synapse formation to precise locations: their role has been demonstrated in both invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b006">6</xref>] and vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b007">7</xref>]. Synaptic physiology is also regulated by mechanisms that are synapse type-dependent, since similar stimulation patterns can have opposite effects on plasticity of different synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b008">8</xref>]. Therefore, the formation and function of each type of synapse is controlled by a complex activation of signaling pathways through specific proteins.</p>
      <p>Since the visualization of synapses by electron microscopy, attempts have been made at biochemically purifying them and at identifying their chemical composition, especially for the postsynaptic densities characteristic of excitatory synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b010">10</xref>]. The use of mass spectrometry (MS) to identify proteins in complex mixtures has greatly improved our ability to unravel the protein composition of organelles. Using this technique, over 1,000 different postsynaptic proteins have been identified in “bulk” postsynaptic density preparations or in affinity-purified receptor complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b016">16</xref>]. These proteins have a wide range of functions: receptors to neurotransmitters, scaffold proteins, kinases, enzymes, etc. Recently, combining comparative genomics and proteomics, Emes and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b017">17</xref>] have shown that increased behavioral complexity correlates with a phylogenetic expansion of synaptic proteins that are involved in upstream signaling pathways, such as receptors and adhesion molecules. Microarray analysis also showed a very variable regional expression pattern for these upstream synaptic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b017">17</xref>], in accordance with previously obtained results for neurotransmitter receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b003">3</xref>]. The complexity of the synaptic proteome illustrated by these data highlights the need for studies aimed at systematically identifying the protein composition of individual synapse types, and understanding their mechanistic diversity.</p>
      <p>To address this issue, we have developed synaptic protein profiling as an approach to isolate and biochemically characterize specific types of central nervous system (CNS) synapses. We chose to analyze first the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell (PF/PC) synapse in the cerebellum, because of its unique physiological properties and its involvement in neurological disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b019">19</xref>]. We engineered mice to tag and purify specifically PF/PC synapses and, using MS, we have identified 65 proteins located at the PF/PC synapse. This dataset provides clues to PF/PC synapse-specific signaling pathways, as illustrated by our functional analysis of one of these proteins, MRCKγ. Our results provide an important example of the biochemical complexity of an individual synapse type, and reveal a new mechanism for the regulation of synaptic function.</p>

        <title>Purifying the Parallel Fiber/Purkinje Cell Synapse</title>
        <p>To enable purification of PF/PC synapses, we developed a transgenic line that expresses an affinity tag only at the PF/PC synapse. We generated a fusion between the glutamate receptor delta2, GluRδ2 (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI]# EDK98768), which is specifically localized at the PF/PC postsynaptic density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b020">20</xref>], and Venus, a variant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The resulting fusion protein, VGluRδ2, is properly processed and transported to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). To express the fusion specifically in cerebellar Purkinje cells, the VGluRδ2 cDNA was then incorporated into a Pcp2 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) by homologous recombination, and the resulting Pcp2/VGluRδ2 BAC construct was used to generate transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figures 1</xref>A and S1). Expression of the fusion polypeptide was detected in the cerebellar extracts of Pcp2/VGluRδ2 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated proper assembly of the VGluRδ2 fusion with the endogenous GluRδ2 receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, the localization of VGluRδ2 in the molecular layer and somata of PCs agrees with the synaptic localization of the GluRδ2 receptor. In contrast, the enhanced GFP (eGFP) control protein expressed using the same BAC vector (Pcp2/eGFP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gensat.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.gensat.org</ext-link>) is detected throughout the cell, including marked labeling of both Purkinje cell dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Prior to the affinity-purification step, we sought to produce cerebellar extracts enriched for synaptic structures relative to trafficking complexes, and to maximize the recovery of VGluRδ2-tagged postsynaptic densities (PSDs). This was performed by fractionation of a solubilized crude synaptosome fraction (S3) on a gel-filtration column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g002">2</xref>C, this resulted in an enrichment of postsynaptic and mitochondrial proteins, and a relative depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) components and presynaptic proteins in the high molecular weight fractions. These excitatory synaptic fractions contain essentially all of the PSD95 scaffolding protein. They also contain VGluRδ2, which was distributed amongst the different fractions in the same manner as wild-type GluRδ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This was also observed using a standard synaptosome purification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) and shows that the fusion receptor VGluRδ2 is targeted to the synapse similarly to the wild-type GluRδ2.</p>

            <p>(A) Southern blot was used to identify transgenic mice having integrated the Pcp2 BAC (a Purkinje cell–specific driver) containing the Venus-tagged GluRδ2 receptor, VGluRδ2. Tg, transgenic; Wt, wild type.</p>
            <p>(B) VGluRδ2 expression was detected using an anti-GFP antibody on immunoblots from total protein extracts of transgenic (Tg) versus wild-type (Wt) cerebella. An asterisk (*) indicates a nonspecific band.</p>
            <p>(C) Both VGluRδ2 and GFP were affinity purified using an anti-GFP antibody from 1% Triton X-100 cerebellar extracts from wild-type (Wt), Pcp2/VGluRδ2 (Vδ2), and Pcp2/eGFP control (GFP) mice, as shown by probing the immunoblots with an anti-GFP antibody (left). VGluRδ2 specifically copurified the endogenous GluRδ2, as shown by probing the same blot with an anti-GluRδ2 antibody (right).</p>
            <p>(D) Immunofluorescence on cerebellar sections using an anti-GFP antibody shows the specific localization of VGluRδ2 in the molecular layer and somata of Purkinje cells of Pcp2/VGluRδ2 mice. Soluble GFP is detected in the molecular layer, dendrites, somata, and axons of Purkinje cells in sections from Pcp2/eGFP mice. Scale bars in the upper panels indicate 200 μm; lower panels, 50 μm.</p>

            <title>VGluRδ2 Is Detected in Excitatory Synaptic Fractions Using a New Purification Method</title>
            <p>(A) We prepared a crude synaptosome P2 fraction that was solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 final concentration. The extract was then separated on a Sephacryl S1000 gel filtration column. Calibration of the column indicated that protein complexes smaller than 669 kDa (arrow in [B]) were resolved after fraction 10.</p>
            <p>(B) Protein dosage was performed on every fraction collected.</p>
            <p>(C) Each fraction (0.1% in volume) was run on western blots and assayed for the presence of excitatory postsynaptic markers (GluRδ2, GLUR2, PSD95, and NR2A), presynaptic markers (synapsin I and synaptotagmin), inhibitory synapse markers (GABA(A)Rβ and GABA(A)Rα1), the endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP, and the mitochondrial marker COX. VGluRδ2 was detected using an anti-GFP antibody. The red rectangle outlines the “excitatory synaptic” fractions enriched for synaptic markers and pooled for subsequent affinity-purification of PF/PC PSDs.</p>

Electron microscopy of the affinity purified material showed electron-dense structures that were reminiscent of PSDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b021">21</xref>] on the surface of the beads used for purification of VGluRδ2 extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g003">Figures 3</xref>C and S3).

            <p>(A) Synaptic fractions from Pcp2/VGluRδ2 animals were affinity purified using magnetic beads coated with anti-GFP antibody (VGluRδ2). In parallel, control purifications were performed on preparations from Pcp2/eGFP transgenic mice (GFP); 0.025% of the inputs and flow-throughs (FT), and 25% of the affinity-purified samples (IP) were assayed by western blot using an anti-GFP antibody and showed immunoprecipitation of both VGluRδ2 and GFP, respectively.</p>
            <p>(B) The same blot was probed for different postsynaptic markers, presynaptic markers (synapsin I and synaptotagmin), the mitochondrial protein COX, and the ER marker BiP, showing specific copurification of postsynaptic markers localized to the PF/PC synapse.</p>
            <p>(C) Electron microscopy shows the presence of electron-dense structures reminiscent of PSDs on the surface of the magnetic beads used for affinity purification of Pcp2/VGluRδ2 extracts.</p>

Markers of inhibitory synapses (GABA(A) receptor α6, GABA(A) receptor β, and gephyrin), presynaptic structures (synapsin I and synaptophysin), or of mitochondria (Cox) did not copurify, demonstrating the specificity of this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). As expected, none of these markers copurified with soluble eGFP in extracts prepared from Pcp2/eGFP control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the combination of cell-specific genetic targeting, molecular tagging of specific CNS synapses, biochemical fractionation, and affinity purification can be used to enrich for a specific type of PSD from crude brain extracts.</p>

        <title>Sixty-Five Proteins Identified in Purified Parallel Fiber/Purkinje Cell Postsynaptic Densities</title>
        <p>To systematically identify components of the PF/PC PSDs, we analyzed the protein content of pooled PF/PC PSD preparations using single- and two-stage MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b022">22</xref>]. A first sample, prepared by pooling three experiments using ten Pcp2/VGluRδ2 cerebella each, enabled us to identify 12 components present at the PF/PC synapse but not present in the control sample prepared in parallel from Pcp2/eGFP cerebella (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-st001">Table S1</xref>). To increase the number of PF/PC PSD components identified, we performed a second analysis on a sample prepared with a total of 50 cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). A total of 65 proteins were identified: 37 proteins were detected with high confidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-sg004">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-sg005">S5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-st001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-st003">S3</xref>), and 28 were observed at lower levels and identified with less confidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-sg006">Figure S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-st002">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-st004">S4</xref>). This analysis confirmed the presence of the PF/PC synapse proteins GluRδ2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b023">23</xref>], Homer-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b024">24</xref>], PSD93 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b023">23</xref>], delphilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b023">23</xref>], Shank1, and Shank2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b025">25</xref>], and the absence of proteins located at other excitatory (NMDA receptor subunits, GABA(A) receptor α6) or inhibitory synapses (GABA(A) receptor α6, GABA(A) receptor β, and gephyrin) in the cerebellum. Forty of the identified proteins in our affinity-purified PSDs have been previously detected in preparations of synaptic proteins ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b016">16</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-st001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-st002">S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The 65 proteins we have identified can be grouped into 11 different functional categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g003">Figure 3</xref>E; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-st001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-st002">S2</xref>). These categories have been previously annotated in studies of the postsynaptic density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b013">13</xref>], with the exception of a class of proteins that we have called “phospholipid metabolism and signaling.” In the “scaffolds and adaptors” category, several members of the Shank family (1 and 2) and the PSD family (PSD93 and PSD95) were detected at the PF/PC synapse, illustrating redundancy for scaffold proteins, certainly due to their importance for synaptic function. Other functional categories include proteins important for synapse formation and physiology, such as regulators of small GTPases and protein kinases. Interestingly, eight of the proteins identified in our study can regulate or be regulated by phospholipid metabolism (Iptr1, synaptojanin 1 and 2, phospholipase B, ABCA12, and MRCKγ), or contain phospholipid-binding domains (Plekha7, annexin A6, and MRCKγ), and were thus grouped into a previously unrecognized category “phospholipid metabolism and signaling.” This suggests that phospholipid regulation is a major feature of the PF/PC synapse. Another important category present at synapses groups receptors and ion channels: several glutamate receptor subunits and several G protein–coupled receptors (GABA-B and BAI receptors) were detected in our analysis of the PF/PC PSD. Interestingly, the extracellular domain of BAI receptors contains thrombospondin repeats, which can mediate cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b026">26</xref>]. Several other proteins identified at the PF/PC synapse in our study are involved in cell adhesion and interaction with the extracellular matrix: receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b027">27</xref>], delta-catenin-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b028">28</xref>], Neph1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b029">29</xref>] and laminins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b030">30</xref>]. These diverse potential recognition proteins could form together a “code” defining the PF/PC synapse.</p>
        <p>To provide additional evidence for the synaptic localization of the novel components that we have identified, we performed immunofluorescence studies on cerebellar sections from wild-type mice. Localization in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, which contains the PF/PC synapses, was evident for MRCKγ, Gm941, BAIAP2, RPTPm, Neph1, and delta2-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Delta2-catenin and Gm941 could also be detected in some cerebellar interneurons. We also examined the expression of candidates reported in in situ hybridization databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stjudebgem.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.stjudebgem.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brain-map.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.brain-map.org</ext-link>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genepaint.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genepaint.org</ext-link>).

        <title>MRCKγ: An Example of a New Signaling Pathway at the Parallel Fiber/Purkinje Cell Synapse</title>
        <p>Within our “phospholipid metabolism and signaling” category, we identified the kinase MRCK gamma (MRCKγ, NCBI# Q80UW5), which has not previously been localized to synapses. Since MRCK family members have been shown to regulate cytoskeleton reorganization and cell morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b032">32</xref>], we sought to test the role of MRCKγ in dendritic spine morphogenesis in primary cortical cultures. Comparative analysis of dendritic protrusions was carried out for cultures transfected either with GFP alone, or in combination with full-length MRCKγ (MRCKγFL) or a MRCKγ construct lacking the kinase domain (MRCKγDN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Protrusion density is not significantly affected by overexpression of either form of the kinase (GFP: 9.5 ± 0.7 protrusions per 20 μm; MRCKgDN: 8.0 ± 0.6; MRCKgFL: 9.1 ± 0.6; one-way ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> = 0.29). However, the mean length of dendritic protrusions in neurons overexpressing MRCKγFL decreased when compared to control neurons, whereas the length of protrusions in MRCKγDN-transfected neurons increased (GFP: 1.79 ± 0.07 μm; MRCKgDN: 2.11 ± 0.08; MRCKgFL: 1.48 ± 0.06; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons, Dunn multiple comparison test). The effect of MRCKγDN implies that it can interfere with endogenously expressed MRCK kinases. Indeed, after data mining of previously published results, we found that MRCKβ has been identified in “bulk” PSD preparations from mouse brain, and thus could be present in cortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b016">16</xref>]. Since mean spine length decreases with maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b033">33</xref>], our data demonstrate that MRCK family members, through their kinase function, increase maturation of dendritic spines in primary CNS neurons.</p>

        <p>Given the presence of MRCKγ in our PSD preparations, and its ability to modulate dendritic spine morphogenesis, we were next interested in its subcellular localization in Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). High-resolution confocal immunofluorescence using an antibody against MRCKγ clearly demonstrated its presence in Purkinje cell dendritic spines, which have been shown to contain GluRδ2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b004">4</xref>]. Moreover, colabeling with markers of specific synapses on Purkinje cells showed that MRCKγ is extensively colocalized with VGluT1, a marker for PF/PC synapses. MRCKγ is not present in structures labeled by VGluT2 or GAD65/67, which are present at climbing fiber and inhibitory Purkinje cell synapses, respectively. Taken together, our data support a specific role for MRCKγ in the maturation and plasticity of PF/PC synapses, and confirm the importance of synapse-specific protein profiling for the discovery of signaling pathways that modulate the development and function of specific CNS synapse types.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have demonstrated that the biochemical components of a specific synapse type from a particular neuronal population can be identified using a combination of genetically engineered mice, affinity purification, and MS. Using our approach, we have prepared a fraction enriched in PF/PC PSDs and identified 65 proteins classified in 11 different functional categories. This dataset provides information on signaling pathways specifically tethered to this synapse, as exemplified by our functional analysis of MRCKγ. It also provides information on the variety of proteins that can be part of the code defining the PF/PC synapse.</p>
      <p>Approximately 700 different proteins have been identified in PSD preparations from whole brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b016">16</xref>]. However, it has been estimated that, given the mass of a single PSD, the copy number of scaffold proteins in a PSD, and an average size of 100 kDa for each synaptic protein, only about 100 different proteins can be expected to be found at one particular type of PSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b034">34</xref>]. The number of proteins we find in our study is consistent with that estimate. Although our analysis may not have revealed all PF/PC postsynaptic proteins, the successful identification of AMPA receptor subunits in our preparations suggests that any proteins not detected in our sample must be present at low stochiometries in the PSD.</p>
      <p>Synaptic protein profiling can reveal novel sets of proteins that allow formulation of specific hypotheses regarding synaptic function. For example, we discovered MRCKγ at PF/PC synapses: this kinase is part of a family that has never been described at synapses. This result was striking since MRCK proteins can respond to small GTPases signaling and have been shown to modulate actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology in nonneuronal systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b031">31</xref>]. These characteristics immediately suggest a role for these kinases in spine morphogenesis, which we have now shown for MRCKγ using transfection of cultured cortical neurons. Taken together, these data also have implications for the study of neurodevelopmental diseases. Deficiencies in spine length and spine morphology in Purkinje cells have been found in models of mental retardation and Angelman syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b036">36</xref>]. Given the link between another small GTPase-dependent kinase, PAK3, and mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b037">37</xref>], our results suggest that MRCKγ could participate in the signaling pathways involved in mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders.</p>
      <p>Another interesting finding of our study is the presence of a high proportion of proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism and signaling at the PF/PC PSD. A major regulator of the physiology of the PF/PC synapse is the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) which induces phosphatidylinositol-4,5-P2 (PIP2) hydrolysis through activation of phospholipase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b018">18</xref>]. Our results show the presence of MRCKγ and Itpr1 in affinity-purified PF/PC PSDs: these proteins can respond to, respectively, DAG and IP3, which are the metabolites of PIP2 hydrolysis. This further supports the importance of mGluR1 signaling at the PF/PC synapse and extends the number of regulatory pathways potentially activated by mGluR1. Also included in the “phospholipid signaling and metabolism” category in our data are synaptojanin-1 and −2, two PIP2-metabolizing enzymes. These enzymes are best known for their regulation of vesicle recycling at synapses, but have also been found by other biochemical studies at PSDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b016">16</xref>]. Phospholipid metabolism is known to be critical for the function of the presynaptic side of the synapse, especially vesicle recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b038">38</xref>]. It also plays a role in defining the boundaries of the apical pole and the localization of tight junctions in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b039">39</xref>]. Our results suggest that phospholipid signaling also participates in regulating the structure and stability of PSDs. Given the fact that lithium is used as a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, and that it might act by modulating phospholipids' metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b040">40</xref>], our results may be particularly relevant for studies of a variety of human neurological disorders. Indeed, it has been suggested that synaptojanin-1 is involved in the cognitive defects observed in Down syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b041">41</xref>], and that PIP2 metabolism may be linked to synaptic dysfunctions in Alzheimer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b042">42</xref>].</p>
      <p>The results presented here provide clues to the nature of the “synaptic code” and the types of molecules that may be critical in definition of specific synapse types. As expected from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b002">2</xref>], we find proteins with classical adhesion domains such as Neph1 and the receptor tyrosine phosphatase RPTPmu. SYG1, the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> homolog of Neph1, has been shown to define synapse location in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b006">6</xref>], and may play a similar role for the PF/PC synapse. Receptor tyrosine phosphatases play important roles in axon guidance, and have also been shown to control synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b043">43</xref>]. We also find proteins at the PF/PC synapse with as yet unknown functions in synaptogenesis, such as the BAI receptors or GABA-B receptors. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the GABA-B receptor 1 contains a CCP module in its extracellular domain. This module is also found in proteins of the complement cascade, which have recently been shown to be involved in synapse development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b044">44</xref>]. These proteins, and the majority of the remaining proteins identified in this study, are specifically expressed in Purkinje cells within the cerebellum (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). Since cerebellar granule cells also receive excitatory inputs from mossy fibers, we can conclude that, even within the cerebellum, the synaptic codes for specific synapse types must be quite distinct. This supports the results of expression analysis of proteins identified in bulk synapse preparations showing that receptors and other upstream signaling molecules have a highly variable expression pattern in the vertebrate brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b017">17</xref>]. Taken together, these data indicate that very different sets of molecules must define different excitatory synapse types.</p>
      <p>Although our approach employed the expression of a fusion of GluRδ2 with EGFP in a specific cell type, this basic approach can readily be adapted to characterize a wide variety of synapse types, given the wide range of affinity tags that are now available and the hundreds of BAC vectors that can be used to target expression to specific neurons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gensat.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.gensat.org</ext-link>). We anticipate that these additional studies of the biochemical diversity of synapses will be critical for understanding the development and function of specific CNS circuits and their dysfunction in disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b046">46</xref>].</p>

XProteo computer algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xproteo.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.xproteo.com</ext-link>) was used to search the peptide fingerprint data and collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS data in the NCBI database (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-sd001">Text S1</xref>). Due to the limited amount of samples, all MALDI-IT CID MS/MS spectra were carefully acquired and interpreted manually. A MS/MS hypothesis-driven approach on isolates from control Pcp2/eGFP transgenic mice was used to probe for the specificity of the proteins copurified with VGluRδ2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-sd001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

          <title>Construction of a Fusion between Venus and GluRδ2 (VGluRδ2)</title>
          <p>(A) Venus was fused on the N-terminal extracellular part of GluRδ2 (top left panel). A GluRδ2-positive band was detected in protein extracts from VGluRδ2-transfected HEK293 cells, but not in extracts from Venus-transfected cells (bottom left panel). The band was at the expected size (about 140 kDa), higher than the endogenous GluRδ2 detected in cerebellar extracts. Immunofluorescence using an anti-GFP antibody detected the extracellular Venus in VGluRδ2-transfected cells in nonpermeabilizing conditions (red, right panels), showing the proper topography of the tagged receptor.</p>
          <p>(B) The correct modification of the Pcp2 BAC with the VGluRδ2 construct was checked by Southern blot (left panel, probe shown in [C], BAC DNA digested with EcoRI) and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (right panel, BAC DNA digested with SpeI), before injection in mouse oocytes.</p>

          <p>(A) Following in-gel digestion with trypsin, the mixture of peptides was analyzed by MALDI QqToF MS. The m/z values of the [M+H]+ peptides were searched in the NCBI database using the XProteo software, and PSD93 and PSD95 were the first two hits with high scores. The lists of putative peptides generated by the XProteo software are shown, and their presence in the MALDI QqToF MS is indicated. T, trypsin peptides.</p>
          <p>(B) The identity of the proteins was confirmed using MALDI-IT CID MS/MS analyses, and their specificity of isolation was investigated using a hypothesis-driven tandem MS approach on preparations from Pcp2/eGFP transgenic mice (GFP). Examples of results from MS/MS analyses on peptides of both high- and low-signal-to-noise ratios are shown.</p>
