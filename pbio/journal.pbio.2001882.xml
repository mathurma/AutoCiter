<abstract>
<p>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a key role in regulating the levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Here, we demonstrate that the compound PF-06446846 inhibits translation of PCSK9 by inducing the ribosome to stall around codon 34, mediated by the sequence of the nascent chain within the exit tunnel. We further show that PF-06446846 reduces plasma PCSK9 and total cholesterol levels in rats following oral dosing. Using ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that PF-06446846 is highly selective for the inhibition of PCSK9 translation. The mechanism of action employed by PF-06446846 reveals a previously unexpected tunability of the human ribosome that allows small molecules to specifically block translation of individual transcripts.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Many disease-mediating proteins have proven difficult to target with traditional small-molecule pharmaceuticals. In this paper, we report that a small molecule, PF-06446846, directly inhibits translation of one such protein, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), by acting on the translating human ribosome. PF-06446846 causes the translating ribosome to stall soon after translating the PCSK9 signal sequence. We further show that PF-06446846 activity is dependent on the amino acid sequence of the nascent chain inside the ribosome exit tunnel. In a rat safety study, we observe decreases in plasma PCSK9, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Using mass spectrometry in cell culture and ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that despite acting on the ribosome, which synthesizes every protein in the cell, PF-06446846 displays a high level of selectivity for PCSK9. This unexpected potential for small molecules to selectively inhibit the human ribosome opens the possibility for future development of small molecules targeting disease-mediating proteins that were previously thought to be undruggable.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) through the use of agents such as statins represents the therapeutic standard of care for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref002">2</xref>], the leading cause of death in Western nations. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulates plasma LDL-C levels by preventing the recycling of the LDL-receptor (LDLR) to the plasma membrane of hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref004">4</xref>]. Humans with natural PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations display dramatically reduced LDL-C levels and decreased risk of CVD, yet display no adverse health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref008">8</xref>]. The robust LDL-C lowering observed with recently approved PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) when administered as a monotherapy or in combination with established LDL-C–lowering drugs validates the therapeutic potential of inhibiting PCSK9 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref011">11</xref>]. However, these therapeutic candidates require a parenteral route of administration rather than being orally bioavailable. Utilizing a phenotypic screen for the discovery of small molecules that inhibit the secretion of PCSK9 into conditioned media, we have recently identified a compound family that inhibits the translation of PCSK9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref012">12</xref>]. However, the mechanism of translation inhibition exerted by these compounds remains unknown. Herein we describe a more optimized small molecule, PF-06446846, that demonstrates in vivo activity. We show that PF-06446846 induces the 80S ribosome to stall while translating PCSK9. We further demonstrate using ribosome profiling that despite acting through protein translation, a core cellular process, PF-06446846 is exceptionally specific, affecting very few proteins. The PF-06446846 mechanism of action reveals a previously unexpected potential to therapeutically modulate the human ribosome with small molecules as a means to target previously “undruggable” proteins.</p>

<p>The previously identified hit compound was adequate for initial in vitro characterization, but in vivo assessment required improvements in pharmacokinetic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref012">12</xref>]. The potency, physicochemical properties, and the off-target pharmacology associated with the hit compound were improved by structural changes to two regions of the molecule. These efforts led to the identification of compound PF-06446846 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), which has properties suitable for both in vitro and in vivo evaluation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s016">S1 Table</xref>). The synthesis and physiochemical characterization of PF-06446846 are described in the Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s002">S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s008">S8</xref> Figs and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s017">S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s022">S7</xref> Tables. PF-06446846 inhibited the secretion of PCSK9 by Huh7 cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.3 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). However, metabolic labeling of Huh7 cells with <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys showed that decreases in PCSK9 were not a consequence of global inhibition of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s001">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). Furthermore, proteomic analysis of the Huh7 cells utilizing stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) indicated no general effect of PF-06446846 on the secreted and intracellular proteome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s009">S9 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s023">S8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s025">S10</xref> Tables).

(B) Luciferase activity of HeLa-based cell-free translation reactions programmed with mRNAs encoding PCSK9-luciferase, PCSK9(1–35)-luciferase, and PCSK9(1–33)-luciferase fusions and luciferase alone in the absence (black bars) or presence (grey bars) of 50 μM PF-06446846. All error bars represent one standard deviation of three replicates. (C) PF-06446846 sensitivity dependence on the amino acid sequence of PCSK9(1–33). PCSK9-luciferase fusions encode the native PCSK9 amino acid sequence with common codons or rare codons or a native, double-frameshifted mRNA sequence that results in a changed amino acid sequence (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s001">S1E Fig</xref> for sequences). All error bars represent one standard deviation of three replicates.

The symbols within the graph represent the individual measurements obtained from three independent experiments. B<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> values were calculated using GraphPad PRISM, in which the complete (<italic>n</italic> = 3) dataset was fit to the one site-specific binding equation.

The nucleotide (nt) positions from the “A” of the ATG initiation codon of the first and last of the group of toeprinting peaks are indicated. The expected position of the P-site of the stalled ribosome from ribosome profiling is also indicated. (G) Schematic of ribosomal toeprinting assays. 5ʹ 6-FAM labeled primers are extended by reverse transcriptase, which terminates when blocked by a ribosome. In this case, we also hypothesize that additional factors may be bound to the stalled ribosome, obstructing the reverse transcriptase at more 3ʹ positions and over a broader range of positions then what is normally observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref013">13</xref>].

<p>To identify the specific mechanism responsible for translation inhibition by PF-06446846, we tested mRNAs encoding PCSK9-luciferase fusions in HeLa cell–derived in vitro translation assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref012">12</xref>]. PF-06446846 inhibited translation of PCSK9-luciferase fusion constructs containing only the first 35 residues of PCSK9 and displayed comparable activity towards the first 33 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In the HeLa cell-free translation assay, PF-06446846 inhibited PCSK9(1–35)-luciferase expression with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2 μM, while at the maximum concentration evaluated, 250 μM, the translation of luciferase without the PCSK9 N-terminal sequence was only inhibited by 20% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Translation of the protein fusion constructs was driven by the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site (EMCV IRES), indicating that PF-06446846 is unlikely to target PCSK9 translation initiation directly. When all the codons of PCSK9(1–33) were mutated to either common or rare synonymous codons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s001">S1E Fig</xref>), PF-06446846 still inhibited translation of PCSK9(1–33)-luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), ruling out a role of the mRNA sequence. Conversely, PF-06446846 did not inhibit translation of a PCSK9(1–33) construct with two compensatory frameshifts that result in a near endogenous mRNA sequence but a nonendogenous amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). These data indicate that PF-06446846 sensitivity is primarily dependent on the amino acid sequence of PCSK9. To further define the sequence requirements, we tested the activity of PF-06446846 against sets of N-terminal deletions, C-terminal deletions, and alanine scanning mutations of PCSK9(1–33). The most important regions in PCSK9(1–33) that confer sensitivity to PF-06446846 are Leu15–Leu20, residues 9–11 (which include two tryptophan amino acids) and residues 31–33 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s010">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>). However, most mutations partially reduced the activity of PF-06446846, suggesting that multiple amino acid features of PCSK9(1–35) make contributions to its sensitivity to PF-06446846.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of the extreme N-terminal sequence of PCSK9 to PF-06446846 suggests that PCSK9(1–35) may act as a small molecule–induced arrest peptide in the ribosome exit tunnel, similar to arginine attenuator peptide, TnaC, ErmCL, and CatA86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref014">14</xref>]. [<sup>3</sup>H]PF-06446846 binds to purified human ribosomes (K<sub>d</sub> = 7 μM) in filter-binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). In ribosomal toeprinting assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref013">13</xref>] of cell-free translation reactions programmed with full-length PCSK9 and PCSK9(1–35)-luciferase fusions, 50 μM PF-06446846 induced reverse-transcriptase early termination products consistent with stalling on and after codon 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). In typical ribosomal toeprinting assays, 1–3 major peaks appear 14–16 nucleotides (nt) 3ʹ of the +2 position of the codon in the P-site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref013">13</xref>]. In the case of PF-06446846–stalled ribosomes, the toeprinting peaks appeared in up to 14 nucleotide positions, depending on the construct used, and were 18–31 nucleotides 3ʹ of the +2 positions of the P-site codon, determined using ribosome profiling. The broader distribution of toeprint positions is consistent with the ribosome stalling at multiple codons, as indicated by ribosome profiling. The 3ʹ shift of the toeprint peaks relative to the ribosome profiling stall sites could be due to additional cellular factors recognizing and binding to the PF-06446846–stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). In cell-free translation reactions programmed with mRNA encoding full-length PCSK9 fused to an N-terminal extension, PF-06446846 also resulted in the appearance of polysomes containing three small radiolabeled peptides, suggesting that these PCSK9 nascent chains associated with one stalled ribosome, followed by two queued ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1H–1J</xref>). Most arrest peptides function only in one domain of life—i.e., solely in bacteria or solely in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref014">14</xref>]. In agreement with this phenomenon, PF-06446846 inhibited PCSK9(1–35)-luciferase translation in cell-free translation systems derived from rabbit reticulocytes, wheat germ, and yeast but not from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s010">S10C–S10F Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>PF-06446846 reduces circulating PCSK9 and total plasma cholesterol levels in vivo</title>
<p>To explore the safety of the compound and to gain insight into the in vivo activity of PF-06446846, male rats were orally administered PF-06446846 at doses of 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg daily for 14 d. Plasma PF-06446846 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s026">S11 Table</xref>) and PCSK9 concentrations were measured at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h following the 1st and 12th dose, and total plasma cholesterol levels were assessed in fasted animals just prior to necropsy on day 15. Dose-dependent lowering of plasma PCSK9 was observed following single and repeated dosing of PF-06446846 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). In addition to the reduction in circulating levels of PCSK9, evidence of inhibition of PCSK9 downstream function was observed at the 50 mg/kg dose, with a statistically significant 30% decrease in total plasma cholesterol and 58% decrease in LDL cholesterol but no significant decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL). This encouraging effect on circulating PCSK9 concentration was achieved in the absence of modulating plasma liver function markers, with no treatment-related changes observed for alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) or albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Although reductions in cholesterol were observed, this endpoint is poorly assessed in rodents, and the clinical experience shows that reduced free PCSK9 levels represent the primary determinant of the improved lipid profile in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref011">11</xref>].</p>

<p>During the 2-wk dosing period, PF-06446846 was tolerated. There was a small decrease (11%–13% relative to vehicle) in food consumption at 50 mg/kg PF-06446846 that was not associated with any changes in body weight. Histological and clinical chemistry examination of samples collected at day 15 indicated no dose-limiting changes compared to vehicle at the 5 and 15 mg/kg dose level. Administration of PF-06446846 at 50 mg/kg/day demonstrated a minimal decrease in bone marrow cellularity (primarily involving erythroid parameters) that correlated with a decrease in red cell mass (9%). Furthermore, mild reductions in white blood cells (52%), lymphocytes (54%), T cell (approximately 54% in the total, helper, and cytotoxic T cells) and B cell populations (58.4%), as well as minimal necrosis of the crypt cells of the ileum (in one of five animals), were observed at 50 mg/kg/day. Importantly, no histopathological findings were observed at any dose of PF-06446846 in the liver, the organ responsible for the majority of PCSK9 production as well as maintaining whole-body cholesterol homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

<p>While the absence of adverse histopathological changes is consistent with the high degree of selectivity observed in SILAC experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), we used ribosome profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref019">19</xref>] to provide a higher-resolution understanding of the selectivity of PF-0644846 at the level of mRNA translation.

To measure mRNA abundance and translational efficiencies, we subsequently conducted a second ribosome profiling study in which Huh7 cells were treated with 1.5 μM PF-06446846 or vehicle for 1 h, and both ribo-seq and mRNA-seq libraries were prepared from the same sample.</p>

We also observed high correlation between replicates in reads aligning to individual genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). We consistently observed a compound-independent depletion of reads aligning to the first forty codons of the CDS regions, a large buildup of reads on the stop codon, and a small queued ribosome peak upstream from the stop codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref022">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). This buildup may be due to omission of the cycloheximide pretreatment step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref024">24</xref>], which we omitted to avoid an artefactual buildup of reads near the start codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref019">19</xref>]. PF-06446846 treatment induced no change in the average distribution of reads along the CDS after 1 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and only a small PF-06446846–induced accumulation of reads mapping to the first 50 codons after a 10 min treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), indicating that PF-06446846 does not cause pausing or stalling on most transcripts. The PF-06446846–induced increase in early read counts at the 10 min timepoint, but not at the 60 min timepoint, may indicate the induction of cellular stress upon the initial exposure to PF-06446846 followed by adaptation within the 1 h timeframe.</p>

Only a single gene, EFNA3, displayed a difference in transcript levels (FDR &lt; 10%). mRNA-seq and translational efficiency (TE) analysis reveals that almost all of the change in expression levels occurs at the translation step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g003">Fig 3G–3I</xref>). The two features present in the data at 10 min but not at 1 h—the relative global depletion of reads between nt positions +2 and +100 of the CDS and the large number of genes displaying a brief change in translation levels—could be indicative of cellular stress after 10 min of treatment. Thus, we focused the following analyses generally on the 1-h treatment time.</p>
<p>Examination of ribosomal footprints aligning to the PCSK9 transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>) revealed a PF-06446846–dependent buildup of footprints centered on codon 34, consistent with ribosomal stalling at this position. The number and distribution of fragments from mRNA-seq was unaffected by PF-06446846 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). PF-06446846 treatment also resulted in a decrease in ribosome footprints mapping 3ʹ to the stall site on the PCSK9 transcript. Notably, the magnitude of the decrease in footprints 3ʹ to the stall site is similar to the level of inhibition of PCSK9 expression as measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), indicating that for PF-06446846–sensitive proteins, the decrease in reads mapping 3ʹ to the stall site could function as a surrogate measurement of the extent of translation inhibition for a given protein. Thus, PF-06446846 targets should be detectable through differential expression analysis using only the reads that align 3ʹ to the stall site. In our second ribosome profiling study, we found that the magnitude of the buildup of reads at the stall site was smaller for both PCSK9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and other targets, while the number of reads mapping 3ʹ to the stall site remained consistent. The variability in magnitude of the stall peak could be an artefact of the size-selection step during library preparation; subsequent to our initial set of experiments, it was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref026">26</xref>] that ribosome profiling of stalled ribosomes can yield a broader range of protected footprint sizes than the conventional 26–34 nt range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref019">19</xref>].</p>

<p>To identify and quantify the sensitivity of individual proteins to PF-06446846, we adopted a computational approach to identify transcripts that could potentially have PF-06446846–induced stalls, estimate the position of the stalls, and use differential expression analysis using only reads aligning 3ʹ to the stall site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). To estimate a 3ʹ bound for the positions of potential PF-06446846–induced pauses, we adapted the approach previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref021">21</xref>]. For each gene, we plotted the percentage of the total reads aligning at or 5ʹ to each codon to generate cumulative fractional read (CFR) plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). If PF-06446846 induced a stall, the CFR plot should increase rapidly 5ʹ to the stall and level off 3ʹ to the stall. We define the maximum divergence between the PF-06446846 and vehicle CFR plots as the D<sub>max</sub> and the codon at which D<sub>max</sub> occurs as the D<sub>max</sub> position, which is analogous to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov position previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref021">21</xref>]. For genes with one or more PF-06446846–induced stalls, the D<sub>max</sub> position occurs 3ʹ to the last stall site. For genes with a high D<sub>max</sub> (Z-score &gt; 2), we used reads mapping 3ʹ to the position of D<sub>max</sub> for differential expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref> for details). Using this approach, we identified 22 PF-06446846–sensitive genes at the 60-min timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g005">Fig 5E–5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s014">S14 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s028">S13 Table</xref>) and 44 genes at the 10-min timepoint (Dmax Z-score &gt; 2, DeSeq FDR &gt; 10%). With the exception of cadherin-1 (CDH1) and interferon gamma–inducible protein 30 IFI30, all PF-06446846–sensitive proteins identified at the 1-h timepoint were also identified at the 10-min timepoint. To test the robustness of our approach, we also analyzed the data from the second ribosome profiling experiment with the same pipeline. Despite most stall peaks being smaller in the second study, we identified all of the same PF-06446846–sensitive sequences as for the data from study 1, demonstrating the advantage of using information from the entire transcript instead of a single codon.</p>

<p>SILAC-based proteomic analyses of lysates of Huh7 cells treated for 4 h or 16 h with 0.25 μM or 1.25 μM PF-06446846 (the same cells as those from which the secretome data were obtained) failed to detect most of the hits identified by ribosome profiling, including PCSK9, when data were analyzed using the same criteria as for the secretome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s009">S9E–S9H Fig</xref>). With a reduction in stringency (proteins with 3 unique peptides accepted), a 2- to 3-fold reduction in CDH1 production was detectable after 16 h of treatment with PF-06446846 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s009">S9G and S9H Fig</xref>). These results suggest that depletion of the levels of transcript-stalled proteins are likely to occur at a rate governed by protein turnover.</p>
<p>In addition to stalling on the main open reading frame (ORF), it is possible that stalling on upstream ORFs could lead to a change in translation of the main ORF. We thus analyzed all upstream ORFs for a change in read density and found none that displayed an increase in reads with PF-06446846 treatment that was consistent across replicates. SORCS2, FAM13B, and LRP8, the three genes that are downregulated at the 1-h timepoint but do not have a D<sub>max</sub> Z-score &gt; 2, do not have translated upstream open reading frames (uORFs).</p>
<p>To validate our approach, we tested the translational inhibitory activity of PF-06446846 for a set of the targets identified in the 1-h datasets in HeLa-derived, cell-free translation reactions. In all but two cases, translation of constructs consisting of the predicted stall site fused to luciferase was inhibited by PF-06446846 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g005">Fig 5J</xref>). For the other two proteins, Midikine and BCAP31, the translation of luciferase fusions to the full-length proteins was inhibited by PF-06446846 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g005">Fig 5K</xref>). Four control sequences predicted not to be PF-06446846–sensitive were inhibited at comparable levels to luciferase alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g005">Fig 5L</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested the translation inhibition of PF-06446846 towards four example “stall sequences” identified only in the 10-min dataset. PF-06446846 inhibited translation of all of these transcripts only slightly more than luciferase alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g005">Fig 5M</xref>). These results indicate that the most sensitive PF-06446846 targets are those identified using the 1-h treatment time. The additional effects seen in the 10-min treatment could be due to a partial adaptation of the cells on the 1-h timescale, or the cells could be sensitized during the first 10 min of compound treatment because of the sudden media changes required for the experiment. In either case, these data indicate that 1-h treatment times are most appropriate for evaluation of this and similar compounds.</p>
<p>As a complimentary approach, we also calculated the change in mean read position or center of density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref022">22</xref>] between the 1.5 μM PF-06446846 and vehicle data and used a Z-score transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref027">27</xref>] to identify outliers. 17 transcripts with a significant change in the center of read density (Z &gt; 3) were identified in the 1-h datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s014">S14T Fig</xref>). Of these, 13 were also identified using the D<sub>max</sub> approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s014">S14T Fig</xref>). For the hits identified using only center-of-density analysis, VPS25 and TM2D3 had stalls but no decrease in downstream reads, indicating that the stall was unlikely to result in a decrease in protein production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s014">S14P and S14Q Fig</xref>). MAPRE1 did not have a clear stall site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s014">S14R Fig</xref>). COX10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s014">S14S Fig</xref>) had a series of PF-06446846–induced stalls near the stop codon, which would be difficult to detect using the D<sub>max</sub> approach because of a lack of downstream reads to quantify. We also used center-of-density analysis to confirm the bias for stalling near the 5ʹ ends of the CDS by repeating the center-of-density analyses omitting the first 50, 100, and 150 codons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g006">Fig 6B–6D</xref>). In all cases, the cluster of outliers disappeared, indicating that while there are exceptions, PF-06446846–induced stalls most often occur in the first 50 codons.</p>

<p>To confirm that the decrease in reads downstream from PF-06446846–induced stalls occur as a result of changes in translation as opposed to mRNA levels, we plotted the change Z-score transformed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref022">22</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Materials and methods</xref>) in mRNA-seq reads versus the changes in ribo-seq reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). For all identified PF-06446846–sensitive sequences, the changes in ribosome footprints were due solely to changes at the level of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). We additionally tested how transcript levels of PF-06446846 targets change with longer-scale treatments and under different growth conditions by treating Huh7 cells grown in either standard or lipoprotein-depleted fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 4 and 24-h with 1.5 μM PF-06446846, then measuring the transcript levels by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). With four biological replicates, no consistent changes in target transcript levels were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s015">S15A and S15B Fig</xref>), consistent with PF-06446846–induced changes in protein expression occurring at the translation step.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, PF-06446846 is the first example of an orally-active small molecule that inhibits PCSK9 function through a mechanism that directly reduces its synthesis. Although the narrow margin between PCSK9-lowering and hematopoietic effects likely prevents clinical development of PF-06446846, it demonstrates that it may be possible to modulate PCSK9 function with a small molecule. This has been a challenge for small molecules by conventional means, as it requires the disruption of the small, flat interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR that represents the primary contact patch at neutral pH. The importance of PCSK9 in regulating LDL-C clearance by LDLR is underscored by the greater degree of LDL-C lowering possible with mAbs relative to statins. However, by their nature, anti-PCSK9 mAbs are unable to modulate PCSK9 and LDL-C levels in an intermediate fashion. Inhibition of PCSK9 synthesis by a small molecule could provide additional options for patients and physicians by offering a range of inhibition to balance safety and efficacy.</p>
<p>This work also represents the first demonstration of the potential for selective inhibitors of eukaryotic mRNA translation as a therapeutic approach. The reduction of PCSK9 demonstrated by PF-06446846 in vivo with no sign of toxicity in the liver is consistent with the high selectivity observed by ribosome profiling. It is unclear whether a lack of complete selectivity evident in the very small number of transcripts whose translation was perturbed by PF-06446846 is responsible for the adverse effects seen outside the liver at the highest dose.</p>
<p>PF-06446846 induces the ribosome to stall on the PCSK9 transcript a few codons beyond to the end of the signal peptide. Ribosome profiling reveals that despite acting on the human ribosome, PF-06446846 is exceptionally specific. Interestingly, the validated off-targets have few common features in their primary structures predicted to be present in the ribosome exit tunnel when stalling occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Although a number of the PF-06446846–sensitive sequences include a leucine repeat or hydrophobic stretch N-terminal to their stall sites, the vast majority of hydrophobic stretches in all of the translated proteins are unaffected. These results indicate that, although PF-06446846 sensitivity is determined by amino acid sequence, stalling cannot be predicted by a simple primary structure motif. Additional requirements for stalling are likely to include the structure adopted by the nascent chain in the exit tunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref029">29</xref>] or the context in which the sensitive sequence occurs.</p>
<p>One common feature of the PF-06446846–sensitive proteins is that stalling usually occurs early in the protein coding region; 15 of the 18 stalls identified in the 1-h treatment occur before codon 50, with the most N-terminal stall site occurring at codon 16. The heightened sensitivity of N-terminal regions of proteins to PF-06446846 could be due to a unique feature early in the elongation phase of translation. Most stalls would likely occur before the nascent chain emerges from the ribosomal exit tunnel or when only a few residues are extruded. Our mutagenic analysis also indicates that the most critical residues for PF-06446846–induced stalling reside in the exit tunnel, pointing to the ribosomal exit tunnel as a critical element of PF-06446846 action. This is consistent with previous findings that the ribosomal exit tunnel acts as a functional environment, allowing certain peptides and small molecules to induce ribosome stalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Most translation regulation mechanisms in eukaryotes identified to date act on the initiation step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref036">36</xref>]. PF-06446846 presents a case of protein production rates controlled during elongation. Translation regulation during elongation presents an interesting mechanistic puzzle as, theoretically, every ribosome that initiates should eventually result in a full-length protein, regardless of how long it takes to traverse the CDS. Our mRNA-seq and RT-qPCR data rule out the possibility that the stalled ribosome induces no-go decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref037">37</xref>] or other mRNA quality control mechanisms that decrease overall mRNA levels. It is possible that PF-06446846–induced stalling near the N-terminus could impede initiation, thus lowering the overall initiation rate. Evidence for “queued” ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1H–1J</xref>) suggest impeding of initiation could occur for stalls near the N-terminus. However, an impact on translation initiation could not explain the effects of more C-terminal stalling on CDH1 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s009">S9G and S9H Fig</xref>) and would predict that PF-06446846–sensitive transcripts would display a bias for higher TE, which they do not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s015">S15C Fig</xref>). Alternatively, the stalled ribosomes may be removed from the transcript by a “rescue” mechanism and not complete translation. Future experiments will be required to determine the underlying mechanisms of protein reduction because of ribosome stalling by PF-06446846.</p>
<p>While PF-06446846 directly and selectively inhibits the translation of PCSK9 during the elongation phase, most drugs and drug candidates known to modulate human translation target translation initiation factor complexes or upstream signaling pathways such as mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref039">39</xref>]. Furthermore, they generally modulate translation of a large number of mRNAs. One drug candidate, Ataluren, selectively induces readthrough of premature stop codons while not affecting termination at native stop codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref040">40</xref>]. The present example of PF-06446846 demonstrates that drug-like small molecules have the potential to directly modulate human translation elongation for therapeutic purposes. The variability in the protein primary structures affected by PF-06446846 suggest that each target may be affected by a slightly different mechanism and that analogues of PF-06446846 could be further optimized for improved selectivity for PCSK9 or even to target other proteins.</p>

<p>Data collection was performed on a Bruker APEX diffractometer at room temperature. Data collection consisted of three omega scans at a low angle and three at a high angle, each with 0.5 step. In addition, two phi scans were collected to improve the quality of the absorption correction. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELX software suite in the space group P1. The structure was subsequently refined by the full-matrix least squares method. All nonhydrogen atoms were found and refined using anisotropic displacement parameters. The compound crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit in the chiral space group of P1, but exhibits pseudo-inversion symmetry, emulating P-1, that relates the two molecules to each other. Inversion symmetry is broken by the chirality of the molecules, with both molecules having the same stereochemistry.</p>
<p>All hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and were allowed to ride on their carrier atoms. The final refinement included isotropic displacement parameters for all hydrogen atoms. Analysis of the absolute structure using likelihood methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref042">42</xref>] was performed using PLATON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref043">43</xref>]. The results indicate that the absolute structure has been correctly assigned. The method calculates that the probability that the structure is correct is 100.0. The Hooft parameter is reported as 0.06 with an esd of 0.019.</p>

<title>SILAC analysis</title>
<p>SILAC was used to facilitate proteomic analysis of the effects of PF-06446846 on the protein population secreted from Huh7 cells. Cells were grown in 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum in RPMI medium initially lacking L-lysine and L-arginine but supplemented at 0.47 mM (L-arginine) and 0.46 mM (L-lysine) with one of the following combinations: L-lysine and L-arginine of standard isotopic composition (light label); L-arginine:HCl ([<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>], 99%) and L-lysine:2HCl ([<sup>2</sup>H<sub>4</sub>], 96–98%) (medium label); or L-arginine:HCl ([<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6,</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub>], 99%) and L-lysine:2HCl ([<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>], 99%) (heavy label). Cells were passaged for five to six doublings with density maintained to keep them actively growing in log phase (30%–90% confluency), after which the incorporation efficiency for the isotopically substituted amino acids was measured as &gt;95%. Cells were next cultured to full confluence to synchronize them in G0/G1 phase. Analysis with propidium bromide showed that 75% of the cells were in G0/G1 phase. The isotopically distinct populations were then replated in fresh medium supplemented with 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum containing the appropriate isotopic forms of L-lysine and L-arginine and allowed to plate down for 2 h before being treated with a test compound or vehicle. The timed experiment was initiated by adding 30 mL of the appropriate medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum to plated cells as a medium change. Light cells were treated with medium containing vehicle, and the medium and heavy cells were treated with medium containing 0.25 μM and 1.25 μM PF-06446846, respectively. Separate samples of each differentially labeled population were incubated for 4 or 16 h, at the end of which periods the medium was removed and treated with protease/phosphatase inhibitors before being stored at –80°C to await proteomic analysis.</p>
<p>To 28 mL of conditioned medium from each time/dose sample was added 0.28 mL of Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (100X) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each timepoint (1 h, 4 h, and 16 h), 25 mL of medium from each SILAC condition was combined, and the mixed samples were depleted of bovine serum albumin using anti-BSA agarose beads (Sigma). Depletion was performed on 15 mL portions of samples with 5 mL of beads according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flow-through fractions for each timepoint were combined, concentrated to 0.8 mL using 3 kDa MWCO spin columns, treated with 1/20 volume of 20% SDS to give a final SDS concentration of 1%, and then mixed with 0.05 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 0.2 mL of 4X SDS loading buffer. DTT was added to a concentration of 10 mM and samples were heated to 70°C for 10 min, after which they were allowed to cool to room temperature and treated with 25 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min. A two-thirds portion of each sample (0.7 mL) was loaded to a 1-well 4%–12% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies) and run in NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer, and the remaining material from each timepoint was fractionated on another gel of the same kind run in NuPAGE MES SDS running buffer to resolve lower-mass proteins. Following staining with Coomassie Blue and destaining, each gel was cut into 15 and 12 horizontal slices, respectively, and each sample was subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin by standard methods. Digest supernatant samples were collected, gel pieces were extracted with 0.5% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and extracts were combined with the corresponding original digests. The samples were desalted using StageTips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref044">44</xref>], dried in a centrifugal concentrator, and stored at –20°C.</p>
<p>Peptide mixtures were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid, and an aliquot of each sample was loaded onto a C18 PicoFrit column (75 μm × 10 cm) (New Objective) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were fractionated using a 2 h linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The instrumental method consisted of a full MS scan followed by data-dependent CID scans of the 20 most intense precursor ions, with dynamic exclusion activated to maximize the number of ions subjected to fragmentation. Peptide identification and relative protein quantification were carried out by searching the mass spectra against a database in which the UniProtHuman and UniProtBovine databases were combined with a database of common contaminant sequences (keratins, trypsin, etc.). Searches were performed using the Mascot search engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref045">45</xref>] (Matrix Science) operating under Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The search parameters took into account static modification of S-carboxamidomethylation at Cys, and variable modifications of S-oxidation on Met and stable isotopic substitution (medium and heavy forms) of Lys and Arg. Peptide identifications were made at a 1% false discovery rate. Compound-induced changes in the protein levels were calculated from the peak intensity ratios of unlabeled and isotopically substituted peptides. The ratios of medium-labeled peptides to controls reported effects of 0.25 μM PF-06446846, and the ratios of heavy-labeled peptides to their controls reported effects of 1.25 μM compound. As an important precaution, only sequence-unique peptides were used for these calculations in order to minimize contamination of results for human proteins by peak signals from their bovine orthologs. Specifically, the option "Use Only Unique Peptides" was selected under the Protein Quantification tab in the Workflow Editor of Proteome Discoverer 1.4. In further settings, the options "Replace Missing Quan Values with Minimum Intensity" and "Use Single-Peak Quan Channels" were not selected, and the option to "Reject All Quan Values If Not All Quan Channels Are Present" was activated. The Maximum Allowed Fold Change was set to 15. Further constraints placed on the reporting of SILAC ratios included requiring a minimum of 4 unique peptides per protein, a maximum overall variability of 60% for SILAC ratios, a minimum of 10% sequence coverage, and a minimum of 10 peptide spectral matches per protein. Results for keratins and trypsin were deleted from the output. Protein hit lists (by UniProt accession) were also searched against the UniProt database to identify those designated as "Secreted," and those lacking this designation were designated for present purposes as "Not Secreted." Results exported from Proteome Discoverer were first managed collectively in Microsoft Excel, then exported for graphic viewing using TIBCO Spotfire software.</p>
<p>Proteomic analysis was also performed on the cellular proteomes of the same SILAC-labeled Huh7 cells as those used in the secretome analyses. Each cell pellet was lysed using 0.5 ml of 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 4% glycerol, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and Halt protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the recommended level. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min, and the protein concentration in each supernatant was measured using the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In separate analyses of cells treated for 4 h and 16 h, equivalent amounts of protein (200 μg) from each of the three SILAC conditions were mixed. Each mixture was concentrated to 70 μl and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described. Gel lanes were cut into 12 horizontal slices and the protein was digested in-gel by standard methods using trypsin. Digests were desalted using C18 StageTips, and peptide identification and ratiometric quantification was performed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described above.</p>

[<sup>3</sup>H] PF-06446846 (21 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/mL in 100% EtOH) was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in water. Varying concentrations of the tritiated ligand were added to a Costar 3365 96-well plate, alone (total binding), or along with a 200-fold concentration of unlabeled PF-06446846 (nonspecific binding). 0.6 μM of HeLa 80S ribosomes in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) were added to the assay plate. The reaction was incubated at room temperature on a rotating platform shaker for 30 min before the reaction mixture was filtered onto a GF/B filter plate (pretreated with 0.3% polyethylenimine) using a PerkinElmer Unifilter 96 Harvester. The plate was allowed to dry overnight before adding 50 μL of Microscint and counting on a Trilux counter. Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism using the one site-specific binding equation. Specific binding was calculated by subtraction of the nonspecific binding from the total binding at each concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]-PF-06446846. The K<sub>d</sub> and B<sub>max</sub> values were calculated from three independent replicates consisting of 39 specific binding values and are reported along with their 95% confidence intervals. The radioligand [<sup>3</sup>H]-PF-06446846 was prepared from the 6-bromo PF-06446846 precursor, made by the same methods described for the synthesis of PF-06446846 but starting from 5-bromo-2-chloro-3-nitropyridine. Tritium incorporation was accomplished by tritiolysis of the corresponding 6-bromo derivative in methanol/NaHCO<sub>3</sub> in the presence of 10% Pd/C to afford [<sup>3</sup>H]-PF-06446846.</p>

<title>Generation of mRNA for cell-free translation</title>
<p>For HeLa-based, cell-free translation assays, PCSK9, PCSK9 truncations and mutations, and off-target stall sites identified by ribosome profiling were cloned as N-terminal fusions to firefly luciferase in plasmid pT7CFE1 (Life Technologies). Translation was driven by an EMCV IRES encoded in the mRNA. All mRNAs used the native translation start site except one PCSK9 encoding mRNA used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001882.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>, in which the mRNA encoded an additional 12 residues (MATTHMGSEFAT) encoded as part of the EMCV IRES. The complete EMCV IRES increased the overall translation of this PCSK9 construct, allowing the stalled ribosome trimer peak to be visualized in sucrose gradient profiles.</p>
<p>For rabbit reticulocyte–derived and wheat germ–derived cell-free translation assays, the EMCV IRES was replaced by the rabbit β-globin 5′-untranslated region (5′ UTR). For yeast-derived cell-free translation, the EMCV IRES was replaced by a short synthetic 5′ UTR (5′-GGGAGAAATTAGAATTCAACAC-3′) that included the yeast Kozak sequence (5′- AACACA<underline>ATG</underline>GG-3′; start codon underlined). The yeast Kozak sequence necessitated the mutation of PCSK9 Gly2 to serine. For <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, transcription templates were made using a two-step PCR amplification. PCSK9(1–33)-luciferase was amplified first with primers 5′AGGGGAATTGTATAAGGAGGAAAAAACatgggatcGgaattTgataaacttaagcttgcc3′ and 5′AAACCCCTCCGATTAGAGAGGGGTTATGCTAGttacacggcgatctttccgc3′, then with 5′GCGAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAATTGTATAAGGAGGAAAAAACa3′ and 5′AAACCCCTCCGATTAGAGAGGGGTTATGCTAGttacacggcgatctttccgc3′. Luciferase was amplified with 5′ACTATAGGGCTTAAGTATAAGGAGGAAAAAATATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAGAAAG3′ and 5′AAACCCCTCCGATTAGAGAGGGGTTATGCTAGttacacggcgatctttccgc3′ followed by 5′GCGAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTTAAGTATAAGGAGGAAAAAAT3′ and 5′AAACCCCTCCGATTAGAGAGGGGTTATGCTAGttacacggcgatctttccgc3′. For <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cell-free translation, transcription was carried out using the PCR product.</p>
<p>For in vitro transcription, vectors were linearized with PmeI (NEB Cat # 0560L) then purified with Zymo DNA clean and concentrator kit. Reactions were set up with 5 mM each NTP (Sigma) (pH adjusted to 7), 30 mM Tris-CL pH 8.1, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 mM DTT, 1U/mL pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 50 ng/μL DNA, and 0.1 mg/mL T7 RNA. Reactions were incubated for 1–4 h at 37°C. DNaseI (Promega) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 U/μL, and the reactions were incubated an additional 15 min at 37°C. RNA was purified using the Zymo Research RNA clean and concentrator kit. For yeast lysate, capped mRNA was synthesized using modified reaction conditions containing 2 mM ATP, UTP, and CTP; 0.2 mM GTP; 2 mM Ribo m<sup>7</sup>G Cap Analog (Promga P1712); 10 mM DTT; 1.2 U/μL RNAsin Plus (Promega); 50–100 ng/μL DNA template; and 0.1 mg/mL T7 RNA polymerase. For wheat germ translation, the mRNA was capped using the Vaccina capping kit (NEB) and tailed using Poly-A polymerase (NEB) using the manufacturer’s recommended conditions.</p>

<p>Translationally active HeLa lysates were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref047">47</xref>]. HeLa cell paste was thawed and resuspended in an equal volume of hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM potassium acetate, 1.8 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM DTT), and cells were incubated on ice for 10 min then lysed in a Dounce homogenizer. One-fourteenth of the total volume of a solution consisting of 20 mM HEPES-pH 7.5, 997.5 mM potassium acetate, 1.15 mM potassium chloride, 1.8 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM DTT was added to bring the salt and buffer composition in the lysate to 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 76.5 mM potassium acetate, 76.5 mM potassium chloride, 1.8 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM DTT. The lysate was centrifuged twice at 1,200 x g for 5 min, and the supernatant was recovered each time. Supernatants were aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. Lysates were freeze-thawed only once, as a significant loss of translational activity was observed with each freeze–thaw cycle.</p>
<p>A 50 μL translation reaction was set up by combining 25 μL translationally active lysate, 4.5 μL mix 1, 5 μL mix 2, 1 μL RNasin Plus (Promega), 1 μg RNA template and 5 μL PF-06446846 solution in 5% DMSO or 5% DMSO control.

Mix 2 consisted of 12.6 mM ATP, 1.2 mM GTP, 200 mM creatine phosphate (Sigma), 0.6 mg/mL creatine kinase (Sigma), 0.92 mg/mL bovine tRNA (Sigma), and 1.7X MEM essential amino acids, 3.4X MEM nonessential amino acids, and 0.7 mM glutamine (Life Technologies). Total reaction volumes were scaled based on the needs of downstream analyses, with 10 μL reactions typically being used for luciferase assays and 50μL reactions for toeprinting. Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 45 min for full-length, PCSK9-encoding mRNAs. Other validation mRNAs were found to be more translationally active in the HeLa cell-free systems and were incubated for only 15 min. For luciferase assays, 5–10 μL of the translation mixture was combined with 50 mL Steady-Glo luciferase substrate (Promega), and luminescence was measured using a Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems).</p>

The L-A virus-cured yeast strain, YWG3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref048">48</xref>], was grown in YPD at 30°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 3–5, then chilled on ice. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm 3,300 x g in a Beckman Coulter J6-M1 centrifuge for 10 min with a JS-4.2 rotor. Cells were washed by resuspending and pelleting four times in an ice-cold buffer containing 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, and 8.5% w/v mannitol. Pellets were stored at –80°C until needed. For preparation of translationally active lysates, pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer (30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 8.5% w/v mannitol, 2 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The cell-buffer slurry was combined with 0.5 mm diameter glass beads in a round-bottom tube, and yeast were lysed by manually shaking the tube in a vertical motion of 50 cm, 2 times per second for 3 1-min sessions with 1 min of chilling on ice in between. The lysate was recovered with a Pasteur pipette and centrifuged at 30,000 x g for 15 min, after which supernatants were retained. It was found that at this stage they could be aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at –80°C with minimal loss of activity. The cleared lysates were then buffer exchanged into 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, and 2 mM DTT using a 10-mL G-25 spin column (Zeba).

This procedure allows values for TE, center of density, and D<sub>max</sub> to take into account the increased variability for genes with lower read count values. A full description of the procedure applied to ribosome profiling data used is described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref022">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Identification of additional PF-06446846–sensitive proteins</title>
<p>For each transcript with sufficient read density, we plotted the cumulative percentage of total footprints aligning to each codon using the combined biological replicates from 1.5 μM PF-06446846–treated cells and vehicle-treated cells to generate cumulative fractional read (CFR) plots. CFR curves increase rapidly 5′ to a stall site and level off 3′ to a stall site. If a PF-06446846–induced stall is present, the codon at which the PF-06446846 and vehicle datasets are maximally divergent occurs 3′ to the last stall. We define the maximum divergence between the drug and vehicle CFR plots as the D<sub>max</sub> and the codon at which D<sub>max</sub> occurs as the D<sub>max</sub> position. To select a minimum value of D<sub>max</sub> for our analyses, we examined the distribution of D<sub>max</sub> values obtained when a D<sub>max</sub> is calculated for each gene using two vehicle datasets and the distribution obtained from a single 1.5 μM PF-06446846 dataset and a single vehicle dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). Because we use D<sub>max</sub> only to choose a 5′ boundary for differential expression analysis, we chose a minimum D<sub>max</sub> Z-score of 2, knowing that most genes that fall above this minimum will do so by chance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). For transcripts with a maximum D<sub>max</sub> Z-score of 2 or higher, footprints mapping 3′ to the maximum D<sub>max</sub> site were extracted for DeSeq analysis. Reads mapping 3′ to codon 50 were extracted for DeSeq analysis for all other genes. Decreases were considered significant if they resulted in a DeSeq false discovery rate &lt; 0.1. Precise stall locations were determined by manually examining the read density plots. Results of the analyses above are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001882.s028">S13 Table</xref>.</p>

<title>Center-of-density analyses</title>
<p>Center-of-density analyses were done as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001882.ref022">22</xref>], except that the mean read position was used instead of the median. For each transcript, the average position of all the alignments was calculated. Changes in the average position between the PF-06446846 and the vehicle treatments were calculated and subjected to a Z-score transformation to identify outliers relative to the local expression level bin. Transcripts with a center-of-density Z-score of 3 or higher were manually examined for PF-06446846–induced stalls.</p>

<title>Measurement of transcript levels by RT-qPCR</title>
<p>9,600 Huh7 cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate and returned to the incubator overnight. 1.5 μM PF-06446846 or vehicle (0.5% DMSO) was added to the cells, and the cells were returned to the incubator for 4 or 24 h. Lysates were harvested using Ambion’s cell-to-Ct kit (AM1729) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR was done using Life Technologies FastVirus kit (Cat # 4444432) on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Quantstudio 3 system. The Taqman probes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FAM-labelled) used were PCSK9; HS00545399_m1, RPL27; Hs03044961_g1, HSD17B11; Hs00212226_m1, MST1; Hs00360684_m1, PCBP1/2; Hs01590472_mH, CDH1; Hs01023894_m1, Transferrin; and Hs01067777_m1.

<p>S1 Python Script. Python script used to generate reference multifasta for the initial Kallisto pseudo-alignments. This script combines 5’UTR, CDS, and 3’UTR sequences downloaded separately from ENSEMBL biomart into a single multifasta. It also generates a reference table with the lengths of each element for every annotated transcript. S2 Python Script. Python script that uses the output from Kallisto to calculate the relative abundances of all the transcript isoforms for each gene. S3 Python Script. Python script that makes several histograms summarizing the transcript abundance data from Kallisto and Python Scripts S2 and S1. S4 Python Script. Python script that uses the output from Python Script S2 to generate a list of all transcript isoforms that are unique (the only detectable isoform rom a given gene), that are the most abundant transcript isoform from a given gene, and that are more than a user-specified fraction of isoforms from a given gene. S5 Python Script. Python script that uses a list output by Python Script S4 and a multifasta output by Python Script S1 and generates a new multifasta that has only the sequences in the list. This multifasta is then used for Bowtie input. S6 Python Script. Python script used to remove alignments from a Bowtie output which align to more positions than an input threshold. S7 Python Script. Python script which calculates the number of reads aligning to each position on each transcript based on inferred P-site position. S8 Python Script. Python script which calculates the average distribution of reads relative to the start and stop codons. S9 Python Script. Python script which converts table of reads aligning to each nucleotide positions table based on codon positions. S10 Python Script. Python script which converts a table with the number of reads mapping to each codon to the number of reads per million total reads mapping to each position. S11 Python Script. Python script which takes as input tables with the number of reads mapping to each codon and calculates cumulative maps, Dmax values and Dmax positons. S12 Python Script. Python script that makes input readtables for DeSeq using only reads mapping downstream from the Dmax positon if Dmax is greater than a given threshold. S13 Python Script. Python script that generates input DeSeq readtables from tables of reads aligning to each nucleotide position. This version inputs reads aligning to the entire transcript. S14 Python Script. Python script that generates input DeSeq readtables from tables of reads aligning to each nucleotide position. This version inputs reads aligning to the annotated CDS only. S15 Python Script. Python script which applies a Z-score transformation to raw readcounts from two biological replicates. S16 Python Script. Python script which applies a Z-score transformation to raw readcounts from three biological replicates. S17 Python Script. Python script which applies a Z-score transformation to Dmax values. S18 Python Script. Python script which applies a Z-score transformation to translational efficiency values. S19 Python Script. Python script which calculates the “center of density” or mean position of reads along each CDS, along with changes in center of density induced by treatments and does Z-score transformations of the changes. S20 Python Script. Python script which takes as input a mutifasta file of transcript sequences and a table with 5’UTR, CDS and 3’UTR lengths and identifies all potential uORFs with AUG’s in the 5’UTR and an in-frame stop codon. S21 Python Script. Python script which calculates the number of reads aligning to each specific uORF, the three nucleotide periodicity of each potential uORF and the change between treatment and vehicle datasets.</p>
