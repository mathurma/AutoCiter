<p>The mycobacterial cell envelope has been implicated in the pathogenicity of tuberculosis and therefore has been a prime target for the identification and characterization of surface proteins with potential application in drug and vaccine development. In this study, the genome of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv was screened using Machine Learning tools that included feature-based predictors, general localizers and transmembrane topology predictors to identify proteins that are potentially secreted to the surface of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, or to the extracellular milieu through different secretory pathways. The subcellular localization of a set of 8 hypothetically secreted/surface candidate proteins was experimentally assessed by cellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) to determine the reliability of the computational methodology proposed here, using 4 secreted/surface proteins with experimental confirmation as positive controls and 2 cytoplasmic proteins as negative controls. Subcellular fractionation and IEM studies provided evidence that the candidate proteins Rv0403c, Rv3630, Rv1022, Rv0835, Rv0361 and Rv0178 are secreted either to the mycobacterial surface or to the extracellular milieu. Surface localization was also confirmed for the positive controls, whereas negative controls were located on the cytoplasm. Based on statistical learning methods, we obtained computational subcellular localization predictions that were experimentally assessed and allowed us to construct a computational protocol with experimental support that allowed us to identify a new set of secreted/surface proteins as potential vaccine candidates.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> genome in 1998, great expectations have emerged regarding speeding up the process of developing vaccines against tuberculosis. Our group has been focused on identifying molecules localized on the mycobacterial surface that could act as ligands facilitating this pathogen's entry into host cells. Immune responses exerted against these proteins might block receptor-ligand interactions, thus hampering mycobacterial invasion. Since protein fragments involved in these interactions might serve as vaccine candidates and, taking into account that a relatively small number of mycobacterial surface proteins have been experimentally identified to date due to the inherent difficulty of proteomics studies for characterizing surface proteins, in this study, we used Machine Learning-based tools available on the World Wide Web to obtain accurate predictions of surface and secreted proteins from this pathogen and found experimental support of such predictions for a group of candidate proteins selected based on novel criteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the Statistics reported by the World Health Organization, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> causes 9.27 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) each year and approximately 1.7 million deaths among infected people worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-WHO1">[1]</xref>. Host–pathogen interactions leading to mycobacterial infection are mediated by a variety of cell receptor ligands, signal transduction proteins and enzymes, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Dietrich1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Sigler1">[3]</xref>. A large number of these molecules are exposed on the surface of the tuberculous bacillus where they are in direct contact with the host's cells and likely to play key roles in the initial stages of the bacillus invasion, virulence, pathogenesis and survival inside host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Smith1">[4]</xref>. This has led to focusing most vaccine and drug development efforts on the identification of mycobacterial cell surface and secreted proteins, a goal that has been enormously facilitated by the publication of the complete genomic sequence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (H37Rv strain). However, despite the large amount of data available, the structure, function and localization of a large number of hypothetical or putative proteins have not been yet defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Cole1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Goulding1">[6]</xref>, mainly due to methodological difficulties related to proteomic and transcriptomic analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Zhang1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Secretion of mycobacterial proteins to the membrane and the extracellular milieu is tightly regulated through different secretory routes or pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-DiGiuseppeChampion1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Sargent1">[9]</xref>. In bacteria one of the best characterized secretory systems is the Sec-dependent pathway (or classical pathway), which transports unfolded protein precursors to the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Braunstein1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Tjalsma1">[12]</xref>. There are other protein secretion mechanisms alternative to the classical secretory pathway such as the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) and lipoprotein secretion pathways. Tat has been extensively studied in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Gram-negative bacteria) and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (Gram-positive bacteria) where it is known to mediate secretion of folded proteins containing a conserved consensus N-terminal sequence. In contrast, proteins that are targeted to the lipoprotein secretion pathway contain a consensus sequence known as the “lipobox” motif at the signal sequence's C-terminal portion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Rezwan1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Hirose1">[15]</xref>, which drives prolipoprotein maturation and lipoprotein anchoring to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Kamalakkannan1">[16]</xref>. Other proteins are secreted through different mechanisms despite not containing a distinguishable secretion signal sequence and are commonly referred to as non-classically secreted proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Hirose2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Jeffery2">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>A fundamental goal of cell biology is to define the functions of proteins in the context of the compartments inside which they are organized within the cellular environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Huh1">[20]</xref>. To facilitate making inferences regarding protein function, annotating genomes and designing proteomics experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Gardy1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Shen1">[22]</xref>, proteins reported in the Swiss-Prot protein database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Bairoch1">[23]</xref> have been categorized according to their localization into cytoplasmic, membrane-anchored, cell wall, and extracellular proteins (lipid anchored, secreted and bacteriocine-like proteins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Zhou1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>The identification of both the secretory mechanisms and the subcellular localization of proteins are supported by two computational strategies commonly referred to as featured-based and general localization approaches, respectively; a distinction made based on the different computational protocols available for protein selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Emanuelsson1">[25]</xref>. The first approach is based on sequence pattern or motif recognition, while the second one consists in extracting general amino acid profiles. These two approaches can be combined to postulate better subcellular localization/secretion predictions with the aim of identifying secreted/surface proteins.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind this idea and that only a reduced number of mycobacterial surface proteins are currently annotated, this study was divided into two phases: (a) a computational and (b) an experimental phase which was meant to validate the first phase.</p>
<p>In the computational phase, the genome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Cole1">[5]</xref> was screened with Machine Learning tools (feature-based tools, general localizers and transmembrane topology predictors) to identify proteins that are likely secreted to the mycobacterial surface or the extracellular milieu. The first approach involved the use of the featured-based tools SignalP 3.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Bendtsen1">[26]</xref>, TatP 1.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Bendtsen2">[27]</xref>, LipoP 1.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Juncker1">[28]</xref> and SecretomeP 2.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Bendtsen3">[29]</xref>, while the general localization predictors PA-SUB version 2.5 included in Proteome Analyst 3.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Gardy2">[30]</xref>, Gpos-PLoc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Shen1">[22]</xref> and PSORTb version 2.0.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Gardy1">[21]</xref> were used for the second approach.</p>
<p>The mycobacterial cell envelope has a complex architectural rearrangement with three well differentiated structures of unique composition. The inner layer of plasma membrane is composed mainly of cardiolipin, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidyl mannosides, which are precursors of lipoarabinomanan (LAM). The middle layer is the cell wall that is mainly composed of free lipids, proteins and peptidoglycan, which is covalently bonded to one molecule of arabinogalactan and esterified with mycolic acids. Finally, the capsule or outer layer is composed of polysaccharides such as mannose and arabinomannan, proteins and lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Daff1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Some of the most distinctive morphological characteristics of mycobacteria are precisely due to the composition and structure of the mycobacterial cell envelope, including resistance to decoloration by acid alcohol in Gram staining, its characteristic “strings and tangles” appearance of growth, resistance to drying and to treatments with alkali and physical and chemical agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Barry1">[32]</xref>. Particularly, the resistance of mycobacteria to the most commonly used antimicrobial agents is attributable to the low permeability of the mycobacterial cell envelope, a characteristic that is conferred essentially by the cell wall layer of mycolic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Jarlier1">[33]</xref>. Given its complexity, the Machine Learning tools used in this study were first validated regarding their predictive capacity to classify mycobacterial proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-RestrepoMontoya1">[34]</xref>, and the transmembrane topology of the potentially secreted/surface proteins was determined using TMHMM 2.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Sonnhammer1">[35]</xref> and Phobius <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Kall1">[36]</xref>. The aim of this study was to determine, based on experimental methodologies, that secreted/surface mycobacterial proteins could be identified using computational approaches.</p>
<p>For such purpose, a set of hypothetically secreted/surface mycobacterial candidate proteins were chosen based on the following criteria: (a) prediction of secretion by only one of the four feature-based tools with a probability score of ≥0.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Emanuelsson1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Bendtsen3">[29]</xref>, (b) prediction of cytoplasmic or extracellular localization by at least 2 of the 3 general localizers, (c) prediction of more than one transmembrane helix, preferably not located in the N-terminal region, (d) preferably having no experimental confirmation of secretion/surface localization (a special case occurred with proteins predicted proteins by SecretomeP 2.0 and LipoP 1.0), and (e) not being included within the training sets of any of the Machine-Learning Tools used in this study.</p>
<p>Four proteins were selected from the set of secreted/surface proteins experimentally identified by Gu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Gu1">[37]</xref> and Sinha <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Sinha1">[38]</xref> as positive controls, while two proteins were selected from the set of cytoplasmic proteins reported in the TB Structural Genomics Consortium (TBsgc) protein database as negative controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Goulding1">[6]</xref>. Once these the final protein sets had been defined as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t001">Table 1</xref>, linear B cell epitopes were predicted using classical methods that assign values to each amino acid according to their physicochemical properties and therefore allowed selecting peptides based on inferences made regarding their probable antigenic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Larsen1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Rubinstein1">[40]</xref>. Such peptides were synthesized as polymers and were inoculated into rabbits to obtain specific antisera that were used in the experimental phase to assess protein localization by immunoblotting analysis of mycobacterial subcellular fractions and IEM studies so as to evaluate the accuracy of the computational predictions.</p>

<title>Computational phase</title>
<p>The computational screening of the 3,924 open reading frames (ORFs) reported in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv genome with the feature-based tools reported a total of 825 proteins that are likely secreted to the extracellular milieu or to the mycobacterial surface. These 825 proteins were independently predicted by a single feature-based tool (each representing a different secretory mechanism) with a probability score of ≥0.5 as follows: 162 proteins were exclusively predicted by SignalP 3.0, 106 only by TatP 1.0, 1 only by LipoP 1.0 and 556 only by SecretomeP 2.0. These proteins were then screened with the general localizers and transmembrane topology predictors and 2 candidate proteins were chosen per secretory mechanism with the aim of assessing their localization in the experimental phase. Candidate proteins were selected based on the following criteria: they had to contain at least one predicted transmembrane helix located preferably outside the N-terminal region. Secretion of the candidate proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane or the extracellular milieu had to be predicted by at least two of the general localizers. Preferably, candidate proteins should not have been located in the surface of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> by experimental methodologies yet and should not be part of the training datasets of the Machine-Learning Tools used in this study.</p>
<p>According to such criteria, the following candidate proteins were chosen from the sets of proteins predicted by each of the feature-based tools: Rv0403c and Rv1733c from the set of proteins predicted by SignalP 3.0, Rv3069 and Rv3630 from the set predicted by TatP 1.0, Rv1022 and Rv0835 (the latter also predicted by SignalP 3.0 in our computational analysis and identified by Malen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Malen1">[41]</xref> as an exported protein using proteomics) from the set of proteins predicted by LipoP 1.0, and finally Rv0361 and Rv0178 from the set of proteins predicted by SecretomeP 2.0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

None of these proteins was part of the training data sets of any of the Machine Learning tools.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
<p>It should be taken into account that in case of the proteins predicted by SecretomeP 2.0, Rv0361 was identified by Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> as an integral membrane protein using one-dimensional (1D) gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Xiong1">[42]</xref>, and Rv0178 was identified by Gu <italic>et al.</italic> in membrane fraction by 1D sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) coupled with microcapillary liquid chromatography LC-MS/MS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Gu1">[37]</xref>. These two proteins were chosen as candidates to be assessed in the experimental phase despite having experimental confirmation of surface localization, because they could be used to evaluate the accuracy of SecretomeP 2.0 predictions regarding the non-classical secretion problem. As a result, three of the secreted/surface candidate proteins had been experimentally confirmed by other authors (without the use of bioinformatics tools) while the localization of the other 3 proteins had not been experimentally determined previously.</p>
<p>The same screening over the 100 proteins reported Gu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Gu1">[37]</xref> and Sinha <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Sinha1">[38]</xref> identified 84 as possible secreted/surface proteins. Six of these proteins were only predicted by SignalP 3.0, 1 protein only by TatP 1.0, none by LipoP 1.0, and 48 only by SecretomeP 2.0. On the basis of the screening done with the general localizers and the topology predictors, Rv0200, Rv1280c and Rv0556 were chosen to be assessed in the experimental phase as positive controls of SignalP 3.0, TatP 1.0 and SecretomeP 2.0 predictions, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t002">Table 2</xref>). Since no proteins were exclusively predicted by LipoP 1.0, Rv0418 (predicted also by Signal 3.0 and SecretomeP 2.0) was selected as the positive control for LipoP 1.0. On the other hand, Rv0126 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-DeSmet1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Jarling1">[45]</xref> and Rv1326c <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Garg1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Garg2">[47]</xref> were selected as negative controls based on previously described reports. The same computational screening was applied to positive and negative controls to compare predictions on these proteins with predictions on the candidate proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the computational screening with the feature-based tools, the general localizers and the transmembrane topology predictors on the complete genome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv, from which the candidate proteins were selected, are shown discriminated by feature-based tool in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000824.s001">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000824.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000824.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000824.s004">S4</xref>, while the results for the 100 proteins experimentally identified by Gu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Gu1">[37]</xref> and Sinha <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Sinha1">[38]</xref> from which positive controls were selected are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000824.s005">Table S5</xref> and the screening on the cytoplasmic proteins reported in TBsgc from which negative controls were selected are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000824.s006">Table S6</xref>.</p>
<p>The transition from the computational phase to the experimental phase consisted on predicting linear B cell epitopes on the candidate, positive and negative proteins using ANalyse THE PROTeins (AntheProt) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Deleage1">[48]</xref> and BepiPred 1.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Larsen1">[39]</xref>. These epitopes were synthesized and inoculated into rabbits to obtain antisera specific against each protein. Rabbit hyperimmune sera were used in immunoblotting assays to assess the presence of each protein in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> sonicate and its localization by IEM. Peptide sequences and each protein's molecular weight are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t003">Table 3</xref>. It is important to mention that proteins that are labeled with an asterisk in this table correspond to proteins for which sera were already available in the FIDIC's sera collection and therefore were not subjected to the prediction of linear B cell epitopes.</p>

<title>Experimental phase</title>
<p>The localization of the candidate, positive and negative control proteins was assessed using sera raised against linear B cell epitope polymers of each protein.</p>
<p>Regarding proteins that were predicted to be secreted via the classical secretion pathway by SignalP 3.0, sera raised against the positive control Rv0200 detected a band of ∼26.2 kDa in total protein sonicate (TPS) and in the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which is consistent with the expected molecular weight of this protein (24.0 kDa). Rv0403c, one of the candidate proteins for this pathway was also detected in TPS and the membrane fraction by its specific hyperimmune sera at ∼15.74 kDa, which is close to this protein's theoretical molecular weight of 15.3 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). No proteins were recognized by rabbit antisera raised against Rv1733c, the second candidate protein for this pathway (expected molecular weight of 22.5 kDa).</p>

<p>The same sera raised against B cell epitopes of the three groups of proteins (candidate, positive and negative control proteins) were used in IEM experiments to determine the localization of the candidate proteins and assess whether the localization of the positive and negative controls agreed with their reported localizations. It should be noted that IEM studies were not carried out for Rv1733c, Rv3069 and Rv1326c due to the negative reactivity shown by their antisera, which is probably indicating that peptides used for immunization corresponded to conserved immunologically silent sequences.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of bioinformatics tools and web-available databases has facilitated the identification of proteins that are expressed on the cell surface or secreted to the extracellular milieu of pathogenic organisms by searching for intrinsic secretion signals and membrane anchoring features on the sequences of hypothetical proteins encoded in their genomes. Although the different computational methods currently available can be used to predict the subcellular localization of a given protein, their use has to be first validated by experimentally determining the accuracy of their predictions.</p>
<p>The large number of proteins predicted independently by SecretomeP 2.0 in this study could be explained by the capacity of this tool to identify all proteins that are secreted but do not contain a signal sequence (probability of signal sequence absence), which would include proteins that are secreted through unknown secretion mechanisms. Even though SecretomeP 2.0 is considered a feature-based tool, its predictions are not based on the identification of specific sequence feature or motif, as occurs with Signal 3.0, TatP 1.0 and LipoP 1.0, and therefore this tool can identify proteins independently of their secretory mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Bendtsen3">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>The experimental phase provided evidence of secretion to the mycobacterial surface for six candidate proteins. In the case of proteins predicted to be secreted via the Sec-dependent pathway, the candidate protein Rv0403c contains two transmembrane helices according to TMHMM 2.0, the first of which is located between amino acids 7 and 29 and overlaps with the signal sequence predicted by both SignalP 3.0 and Phobius between amino acids 1 and 33 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t002">Table 2</xref>). Rv0403c was detected in TPS as well as in the membrane fraction and was observed in the surface of intact bacilli by IEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>). All these results are is consistent with the predictions of the Machine Learning tools and would indicate that this protein is anchored to mycobacterial surface and involved in cell wall and cell processes, as appears annotated in TubercuList.</p>
<p>Rv3630, which was predicted in the computational phase to be secreted via the Tat secretory machinery, is also annotated in TubercuList as a probable conserved integral membrane protein involved in cell wall and cell processes. This protein is predicted to contain a signal sequence between amino acids 1 and 40 (according to TatP 1.0), and to have 11 transmembrane helices (according to TMHMM 2.0), whereas Phobius predicted 12 transmembrane helices and no signal sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t002">Table 2</xref>). These predictions of transmembrane helices are in agreement with this protein's annotation as well as with the predictions of localization n the plasma membrane by the general localization tools. This protein was detected in TPS and the surface of intact bacilli by rabbit sera but was not recognized in any of the subcellular fractions nor in culture filtrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g004">Figure 4A and B</xref>), probably due to its low abundance in these fractions, as suggested by its weak reactivity in immunoblotting analyses and the few gold particles observed in IEM studies, or perhaps due to the low immunogenicity of the chemically synthesized peptides used to detect its presence.</p>
<p>In Rv1022, which was predicted by LipoP 1.0, there is no evidence of transmembrane helices since Phobius shows a signal sequence in the same region predicted to be a transmembrane helix by TMHMM 2.0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t002">Table 2</xref>). General subcellular localizers indicate that this protein is intracytoplasmic, which is not consistent with the known subcellular localization of lipoproteins because even though lipoproteins do not contain transmembrane helices, it seems that the lipobox motif and the Lgt and Lsp cleavage sites are necessary and sufficient to ensure their anchorage to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Kamalakkannan1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Sutcliffe1">[49]</xref>. These computational predictions, together with the detection of Rv1022 in culture filtrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) and on the surface of intact bacilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) indicate that secretion of this protein is driven by the signal sequence (nevertheless, gold particles might also correspond to any of the other proteins that were detected in immunoblotting assays), while the lack of transmembrane helices might indicate that it is secreted to the extracellular milieu and is consistent with the lack of any of the residues in position +2 known to be relevant for membrane anchorage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Narita1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Robichon1">[51]</xref>. The presence of this protein both in membrane and culture filtrate could be explained by the gradual liberation of proteins during mycobacterial growth in culture, but it is intriguing that the protein was not also detected in the cell wall fraction considering that mycobacterial secreted proteins are usually expressed in large amounts during the first days of culture and can be found in trace amounts inside the bacillus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Andersen1">[52]</xref>. Regarding Rv0835, the predictions indicated that it contains a signal sequence (which was also predicted by Phobius), is not anchored to membrane and has no transmembrane regions. Interestingly, Gpos-PLoc and PSORTb v.2.0.4 located this protein in the cytoplasm, whereas PA-SUB v.2.5 located it in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t002">Table 2</xref>). In the experimental phase, this protein was detected in TPS and culture filtrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), which provides additional evidence that this hypothetical lipoprotein is exported to the extracellular milieu, as reported by Malen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Malen1">[41]</xref>. This protein is similar to the positive control protein Rv0418 in that it has been reported as a secreted/surface protein by proteomics studies and both are hypothetical lipoproteins; however, the positive control was identified both in the membrane and the culture filtrate by Gu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Gu1">[37]</xref> and Mawuenyega <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Mawuenyega1">[53]</xref>, in contrast to the candidate protein Rv0835 which has been only reported in the culture filtrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Malen1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Regarding non-classical secretion, important mycobacterial proteins such as ESAT-6 (Rv3875) and CFP-10 (Rv3874) have been detected in culture filtrate even though they do not seem to contain a signal sequence in their N-terminal regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Converse1">[54]</xref>. Both of these proteins were positively identified by SecretomeP 2.0 in the computational phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000824.s004">Table S4</xref>), therefore giving additional support to the use of this tool in our study.</p>
<p>The other two protein candidates, Rv0361 and Rv0178, chosen from the set of secreted/surface proteins predicted by SecretomeP 2.0, have no predicted signal peptides according to the other feature-based tools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000824-t002">Table 2</xref>), which indicates that they are not secreted to the mycobacterial surface via the classical pathway but rather through yet unknown mechanisms. Both proteins were identified in TPS, in the membrane fraction as well as in the bacillus surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g009">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g010">10</xref>); however, sera raised against Rv0178 also recognized protein bands of lower molecular weight in immunoblotting assays, thus suggesting a potential cleavage of this protein.</p>
<p>According to the computational analysis, Rv0178 has a transmembrane helix, as predicted by Phobius, and is located in the extracellular compartment, according to Gpos-PLoc. Previous studies suggest that the mycobacterial <italic>mce1</italic> operon, which contains the gene encoding Rv0178, plays an important role in mycobacterial invasion and persistent infection in mice, as well as a possible role in mycobacterial virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Casali1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Shimono1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>The detection of intense bands at the same molecular weight in immunoblotting analyses of TPS suggests that subcellular fractions were not completely pure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000824-g012">Figure 12B</xref>), which could explain why subcellular fractionation results for positive and negative control proteins (e.g. Rv0126) were not in some cases consistent with their known localizations; nevertheless, rabbit sera did recognize these proteins in their expected localization in IEM studies (surface or cytoplasm). For this reason, IEM results were considered more reliable than the ones obtained in immunoblotting assays with subcellular fractions when analyzing the localization of each candidate protein.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the absence of recognition of Rv1326c, Rv1733c and Rv3069 by rabbit antisera suggests that epitopes were probably not strong enough as to induce a good antibody response and therefore obtain large amounts of antibodies for immunoblotting and IEM assays, or alternatively, that the peptide sequences chosen in this study were immunologically silent, as occurs with malarial high activity binding peptides.</p>
<p>Predicting protein regions that are likely to be exposed on the protein surface and therefore accessible to interaction with host immune system molecules (humoral or cellular) is of key importance both in the design of vaccine components and the development of immunodiagnostic methods. Linear B cell epitopes predicted and synthesized in this study corresponded to continuous epitopes that were selected by using classical sequence prediction methodologies (based on the physicochemical profile of each amino acid). Nevertheless, even though these tools are continuously being improved, there are still limitations in their use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Larsen1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Rubinstein1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Liang1">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the accuracy of the subcellular localization predictions yielded by different computational tools was confirmed by the experimental evidence gathered in this study showing experimental confirmation on the secretion of Rv0403c, Rv3630 and Rv1022 for the first time. Moreover, their possible secretory mechanism is suggested based on the tool that predicted their secretion (SignalP 3.0, TatP 1.0 and LipoP 1.0, respectively). The results indicate that secreted/surface proteins can be pre-identified based on thorough decision-making protocols supported by statistical learning, which would optimize the identification of new drug and vaccine targets and could be extrapolated to the identification of other protein sets, either in the same or in other biological agents.</p>
<p>Even though the mycobacterial cell envelope is a complex structure, it is important to highlight that the Machine Learning methods followed in this study are a good approximation to the problem of identifying surface proteins, which compared to other methodological approaches such as proteomics is a good strategy for narrowing the search to a given set of proteins before conducting expensive and time-consuming experimental studies.</p>

<title>Feature-based subcellular localization predictions (specific approach)</title>
<p>Protein sequences were screened using feature-based tools to identify signal sequences associated to each of the secretory pathways (Sec, Tat and lipobox), taking care of selecting the option Gram-positive bacteria. Prediction of signal sequences for secretion via the classical pathway (Sec-dependent) was carried out using the SignalP 3.0 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/</ext-link>). The threshold for this feature-based tool was set to a ≥0.5 score according to the HMM result. For secretion via the alternative Tat secretory pathway, we used the TatP 1.0 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TatP/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TatP/</ext-link>) to search for Tat motifs between the <italic>n</italic> and <italic>h</italic> regions of the signal peptide sequence, considering a score of ≥0.5. Additionally, we used LipoP1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP/</ext-link>) to predict lipoprotein lipobox motifs within the first 70 amino acids of each sequence. Proteins showing the best type II signal sequence score and a high probability of SPase II cleavage site were included in the analysis. SecretomeP 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SecretomeP/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SecretomeP/</ext-link>) was used to identify proteins with no apparent signal sequence that might be secreted via other pathways, according to a selection threshold of ≥0.5.</p>
<p>Transmembrane topology in the proteins selected based on the predictions of the feature-based tools was predicted using TMHMM 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/</ext-link>). This tool allows identifying the presence, localization and orientation of transmembrane helices. Taking into account the number of amino acids expected in a helix (ExpAA), a protein is likely to cross the membrane or have a signal sequence if this number is larger than 18; if the helix lies within the first 60 residues (first 60 amino acids), the protein might not have a transmembrane helix but could instead have a signal sequence.</p>
<p>Phobius (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phobius.sbc.su.se/" xlink:type="simple">http://phobius.sbc.su.se/</ext-link>) was used in order to distinguish between a signal sequence (either for secretion via classical or alternative pathways) and an N-terminal transmembrane helix, by identifying possible α-helical conformations in the <italic>h</italic> region of the signal sequence that could be mistakenly classified as a transmembrane region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Kall1">[36]</xref>.</p>

<title>Selection of candidate proteins</title>
<p>Proteins predicted to have a signal sequence for secretion via a specific secretory pathway and the ones identified by SecretomeP 2.0 were compared to the set of 100 membrane proteins reported by Gu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Gu1">[37]</xref> and Sinha <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Sinha2">[58]</xref>. Surface proteins derived from this comparison and preferably exclusive for each secretory pathway were selected as positive controls, taking care of selecting those that had at least one published study confirming their secretion or surface localization. On the other hand, negative controls were selected from the list of cytoplasmic proteins reported in the TBsgc database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/TB/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/TB/</ext-link>) and were analyzed using the same prediction methodology applied to candidate proteins and positive controls to confirm the absence of a signal sequence, localization in a subcellular compartment different from the surface or extracellular milieu, and the lack of transmembrane helices.</p>
<p>Likewise, proteins in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv genome predicted to be secreted preferably via a single pathway were chosen as candidate proteins in the experimental phase. These proteins were selected based on a high signal sequence probability score, as mentioned above. Preferably, only proteins that had no previous publications were selected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, proteins selected on the basis of the above mentioned criteria had to be predicted to be located on the cell surface by any of the general subcellular localization tools, especially Gpos-PLoc and PSORTb v. 2.0.4 (algorithms validated for prediction in mycobacterial proteins that have high sensitivity and specificity). Additionally, candidate proteins had to contain at least one transmembrane helix, except in the case of lipoproteins, which are anchored to the cell surface via the lipobox motif.</p>
<p>In summary, each secretory pathway included a protein whose membrane localization had been confirmed by proteomics and two additional proteins obtained from the prediction analysis carried out over the entire genome.</p>

<p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (Paris 4995) were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 Broth with 0.05% Tween 80 enriched with 10% OADC (Oleic Acid, Albumin, Dextrose and Catalase) and 0.2% Glycerol for 15 days to mid-log phase of growth at 37°C and 33°C, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Song1">[60]</xref>. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 12,500 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min, suspended in 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and stored at −20°C. For <italic>E. coli</italic> TOP10 (Invitrogen, CA, USA), 4 ml of Luria Bertani (LB) sterile medium were inoculated with the bacteria and cultured for 16–18 h at 37°C under constant shaking.</p>
<p>Ten grams (wet weight) of mycobacteria and <italic>E. coli</italic> were suspended in 20 ml of 1× PBS containing DNase, RNase and proteinase inhibitor cocktail (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride [PMSF], 1 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml of leupeptin and 1 mg/ml of Pepstatin A). Cells were sonicated for 20 min using a Branson 450 Sonifier ultrasonic cell disruptor, setting the amplitude to 4 and the duty cycle to 90%. The sonicate was centrifuged at 650 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min, skimmed off and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 36,000 <italic>g</italic> for 45 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000824-Smith2">[61]</xref> using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. This <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv total protein sonicate (TPS) was used in the all immunodetection assays.</p>
<p><italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> sonicates were individually coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, NJ, USA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Rabbit antisera (pre-immune and immune) were pre-adsorbed on <italic>E. coli</italic>-Sepharose and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>-Sepharose affinity columns to remove crossreactive antigens. Briefly, 5 ml of each serum was added to 4 ml of sonicate-Sepharose affinity columns and left in a gentle rotating/shaking mode for 20 min at room temperature. This procedure was done twice using a new sonicate-Sepharose affinity column each time.</p>

<title>Separation of culture filtrate and subcellular fractions</title>
<p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv culture aliquots of 25 ml were centrifuged at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was filtered under sterile conditions using a 0.2-µm pore membrane to obtain the culture filtrate. To obtain the subcellular fractions, the pellet was washed thrice with 1× PBS, resuspended in proteinase inhibitor cocktail, sonicated for 15 min on an ice bath (work cycle: 80%, amplitude: 3), let to settle for 15 min at 4°C and again sonicated same as before. This procedure was carried in two stages to avoid sample overheating and thus maintain protein integrity.</p>
<p>This sonicate was centrifuged at 3,000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C, the pellet (unbroken cells) was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged at 27,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing lysozyme (without DNAse and RNAse) and centrifuged one more time for 1 h at 4°C and 27,000 <italic>g</italic>. The pellet from this centrifugation, which corresponded to the cellular wall, was resuspended in ammonium bicarbonate, while the supernatants from the first and second centrifugations were pooled and centrifuged at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> for 4 h at 4°C.

<title>Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting</title>
<p>Proteins from the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> TPS and subcellular fractions were separated in a discontinuous SDS-PAGE system using a 10–20% (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) acrylamide gradient and commercial molecular mass markers (New England Biolabs Inc. MA, USA and BIO-RAD, CA, USA) to estimate protein molecular weights. One milligram of each sample was loaded per gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond 203c, Pharmacia). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk diluted in TBS–T (0.02 M Tris–HCl at pH 7.5, 0.05 M NaCl and 1% Tween 20), cut into strips and incubated with pre-adsorbed rabbit sera diluted 1∶100 in blocking solution. Strips were then incubated for 1 h with 1∶4,500 alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Inc. CA, USA), followed by five washes with TBS–T. The reaction was developed with NBT/BCIP kit (Promega, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
<p>Each membrane strip was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1∶100 dilution of pre-immune or immune sera diluted in blocking solution. Anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) diluted 1∶5,000 in blocking solution was used as secondary antibody.
