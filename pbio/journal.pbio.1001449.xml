        <p>AtLURE1 defensin-like peptides, which show species-specific evolution, are essential in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> for attracting pollen tubes and can function in the breakdown of reproductive isolation barriers.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Genes directly involved in male/female and host/parasite interactions are believed to be under positive selection. The flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has more than 300 defensin-like (<italic>DEFL</italic>) genes, which are likely to be involved in both natural immunity and cell-to-cell communication including pollen–pistil interactions. However, little is known of the relationship between the molecular evolution of <italic>DEFL</italic> genes and their functions. Here, we identified a recently evolved cluster of <italic>DEFL</italic> genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and demonstrated that these DEFL (cysteine-rich peptide [CRP810_1]) peptides, named AtLURE1 peptides, are pollen tube attractants guiding pollen tubes to the ovular micropyle. The <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes formed the sole species-specific cluster among <italic>DEFL</italic> genes compared to its close relative, <italic>A. lyrata</italic>. No evidence for positive selection was detected in <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes and their orthologs, implying neutral evolution of <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes. AtLURE1 peptides were specifically expressed in egg-accompanying synergid cells and secreted toward the funicular surface through the micropyle. Genetic analyses showed that gametophytic mutants defective in micropylar guidance (<italic>myb98</italic>, <italic>magatama3</italic>, and <italic>central cell guidance</italic>) do not express AtLURE1 peptides. Downregulation of the expression of these peptides impaired precise pollen tube attraction to the micropylar opening of some populations of ovules. Recombinant AtLURE1 peptides attracted <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen tubes at a higher frequency compared to <italic>A. lyrata</italic> pollen tubes, suggesting that these peptides are species-preferential attractants in micropylar guidance. In support of this idea, the heterologous expression of a single AtLURE1 peptide in the synergid cell of <italic>Torenia fournieri</italic> was sufficient to guide <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen tubes to the <italic>T. fournieri</italic> embryo sac and to permit entry into it. Our results suggest the unique evolution of <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes, which are directly involved in male–female interaction among the <italic>DEFL</italic> multigene family, and furthermore suggest that these peptides are sufficient to overcome interspecific barriers in gametophytic attraction and penetration.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Defensin-like (DEFL) peptides commonly function as effector peptides and are involved in male-female and host-parasite interactions in eukaryotes. In higher plants, <italic>DEFL</italic> genes belong to a large multigene family and are highly variable between species. However, little is known about the relationship between the molecular evolution of <italic>DEFL</italic> genes and their functions. By comparing multiply duplicated <italic>DEFL</italic> genes between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and its close relative <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, we have now identified pollen tube attractant peptides called AtLURE1 peptides, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. We find that <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes form a species-specific gene cluster and that the AtLURE1 peptides these genes encode are specifically expressed in the synergid (egg-accompanying) cells and are secreted along the path down which the pollen tube elongates to reach the female gametophyte. AtLURE1 peptides attract pollen tubes in a species-preferential manner and their downregulation impairs pollen tube guidance. Interestingly, the genetic introduction of a single <italic>AtLURE1</italic> gene from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> into another plant, <italic>T. fournieri</italic>, is sufficient to breakdown reproductive isolation barriers in pollen tube guidance and penetration. These results suggest that AtLURE1 peptides, which show species-specific evolution, are key molecules that attract pollen tubes from a plant's own species to the embryo sac to enable successful reproduction.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Disease and sexual reproduction are believed to have profound effects on molecular evolution because host–parasite and male–female interactions exert selection pressures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Haldane1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Swanson1">[2]</xref>. Genes involved in these interactions tend to show characteristic molecular evolution under positive Darwinian selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Swanson1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Lazzaro1">[6]</xref> and rapid gene turnover (gain/loss) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Rast1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Yoshida1">[9]</xref>. However, the relationship between the evolutionary pattern and function of each gene still remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Defensins are antimicrobial peptides involved in innate immunity that are generally found in eukaryotes, including mammals, insects, and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Ganz1">[10]</xref>. Plant defensins have a structure consisting of a triple-stranded β-sheet with an α-helix in parallel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Thomma1">[11]</xref>. <italic>Defensin-like</italic> (<italic>DEFL</italic>) genes of flowering plants form a large multigene family, with 317 <italic>DEFL</italic> genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (accession Col-0) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Silverstein1">[12]</xref> and 93 <italic>DEFL</italic> genes in <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Silverstein2">[13]</xref>. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>DEFL</italic> genes are subdivided into 46 subgroups by the number and alignment of cysteine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Silverstein1">[12]</xref>. They have evolved by tandem and segmental duplication events, and some individual subgroups include paralogous, multiply duplicated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Silverstein1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Plant DEFL peptides are involved not only in the innate immune system but also in various steps in male–female interactions in plant sexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Higashiyama1">[14]</xref>. For example, the SCR/SP11 peptide in Brassicaceae is the male determinant of self/nonself-recognition during pollination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Schopfer1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Takayama1">[16]</xref>. LURE peptides of <italic>T. fournieri</italic> (Linderniaceae, Lamiales) are specifically expressed in the synergid cell (an egg-accompanying haploid cell) to attract pollen tubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Okuda1">[17]</xref>. The <italic>Zea mays</italic> EMBRYO SAC 4 (ZmES4) peptide of <italic>Z. mays</italic>, predominantly expressed in the synergid cell, induces pollen tube rupture for the release of the sperm cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Amien1">[18]</xref>. Thus, plant <italic>DEFL</italic> genes are likely to form a unique multigene family directly involved in both defense and sexual reproduction. Genome-wide analysis of the 317 <italic>DEFL</italic> genes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> suggested rapid molecular evolution, including local duplication, to form gene clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Silverstein1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Silverstein2">[13]</xref>. However, whether any characteristically evolving <italic>DEFL</italic> genes exist among the <italic>DEFL</italic> genes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and whether such genes are actually involved in disease or sexual reproduction, are not known.</p>
      <p>In this study, we surveyed the <italic>DEFL</italic> genes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> showing unique molecular evolution (in the form of rapid gene turnover) using whole-genome data of a closely related species, <italic>A. lyrata</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Hu1">[19]</xref>. We especially focused on paralogous genes because rapid gene turnover has sometimes been suggested in multigene families, including the antimicrobial peptides of <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Sackton1">[8]</xref>. We discovered a sole species-specific <italic>DEFL</italic> gene cluster that was demonstrated to encode attractant peptides for pollen tubes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. In addition, the heterologous expression of an attractant peptide was sufficient to overcome reproductive isolation barriers in the final steps of male–female interactions despite a large evolutionary distance between organisms.</p>

        <title>Identification of a Species-Specific Cluster of <italic>DEFL</italic> Genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic></title>
        <p>To survey <italic>DEFL</italic> genes showing lineage-specific expansion, we first identified paralogous genes among the 317 <italic>DEFL</italic> genes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> by a phylogenetic tree analysis using 317 putative DEFL peptide sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Silverstein1">[12]</xref>. We focused on four or more paralogous genes supported by high bootstrap values (≥90%) that could have evolved by recent multiple gene duplication, and found 13 groups of the multiple paralogous genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s010">Table S1</xref>). To investigate interspecific variation and the origin of these genes, we searched for orthologs in the close relative <italic>A. lyrata</italic> (accession CS22696) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Hu1">[19]</xref>. Multiple orthologs for the 13 groups of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes were found in the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> genome by BLAST searches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s010">Table S1</xref>). Notably, a phylogenetic tree analysis for the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes of the 13 groups and the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> orthologous genes showed that a single subtree, which includes six <italic>DEFL</italic> (<italic>Cysteine-Rich Peptide 810</italic>; <italic>CRP810</italic>) genes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and ten orthologs of <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, branched into species-specific gene clades for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g001">Figure 1</xref>). No other clades, including <italic>CRP90</italic> (true plant defensin <italic>PDF1</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Thomma1">[11]</xref>), showed such a phylogenetic relationship between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This result suggested that these <italic>CRP810</italic> genes diverged after the split between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Koch1">[20]</xref>. We decided to further analyze these <italic>CRP810</italic> genes, <italic>CRP810_1.1</italic> to _<italic>1.6</italic> and <italic>AlCRP810_1.1</italic> to <italic>_1.10</italic>, numbered according to their chromosomal locations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s010">Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>To elucidate how these genes evolved, we performed phylogenetic and synteny analyses of the <italic>CRP810_1</italic> and <italic>AlCRP810_1</italic> genes. Consistent with the phylogenetic analysis showing that the <italic>CRP810_1</italic> and <italic>AlCRP810_1</italic> genes clustered independently to form phylogenetically distinct groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g002">2A</xref>), the synteny analysis indicated that a single gene (<italic>CRP810_1.1</italic>) only showed synteny with the <italic>AlCRP810_1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, top). No <italic>AlCRP810_1</italic> gene was present on the contig of <italic>A. lyrata</italic> showing synteny with the <italic>CRP810_1.2</italic>–<italic>1.6</italic> region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). In summary, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, an ancestral gene (<italic>CRP810_1.1</italic>) likely was copied to one of the loci of <italic>CRP810_1.2</italic>–<italic>1.6</italic> on the same chromosome and then duplicated locally (within 15 kb). In contrast to this, the other 12 groups of paralogous <italic>DEFL</italic> genes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> are not phylogenetically distinct groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) and showed synteny with multiple genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). We have thus identified the <italic>CRP810_1</italic> genes as the sole species-specific gene cluster among the 317 <italic>DEFL</italic> genes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p>

        <title>CRP810_1 Peptides Are Specifically Expressed in Synergid Cells and Secreted toward the Funicular Surface through the Micropyle</title>
        <p>To determine the functions of CRP810_1 peptides, we investigated their expression patterns and localization. Quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR with vegetative and reproductive tissues revealed predominant <italic>CRP810_1</italic> expression in pistil tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Consistent with these results, previous data from a genome-wide analysis of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ovules suggested that <italic>CRP810_1</italic> genes are expressed in the female gametophyte inside the pistil and downregulated in a <italic>myb98</italic> T-DNA insertion mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-JonesRhoades1">[21]</xref>. The <italic>MYB98</italic> gene encodes a transcription factor predominantly expressed in the synergid cell and is necessary for pollen tube guidance at the micropyle of the ovule and development of the filiform apparatus of the synergid cell, a cell-wall ingrown structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Kasahara1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Punwani1">[23]</xref>. In addition, we confirmed by custom array analysis that they were upregulated in mature ovules compared with seedlings (unpublished data), suggesting that they might be specifically expressed in the female gametophyte. In ovules expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the promoters of <italic>CRP810_1.1</italic> to <italic>_1.5</italic>, GFP fluorescence was observed exclusively in the synergid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). We also generated transgenic plants that expressed GFP-fused CRP810_1 regulated by their own promoters. All GFP-fused CRP810_1 proteins were localized to the micropylar end of the female gametophyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), possibly at the filiform apparatus of the synergid cell. This was consistent with the previous observation of GFP-fused CRP810_1.2 (DD2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Punwani2">[24]</xref>.

        <p>Immunostaining of the ovule using an anti-CRP810_1.2 antibody showed that the CRP810_1 peptides were secreted from the synergid cell toward the micropylar opening and then diffused to the funicular surface of the ovule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s003">S3A</xref>). The antibody recognized all of the CRP810_1 peptides in an immuno-dot blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). The GFP-fused CRP810_1 proteins did not show this diffuse pattern, most likely due to the increased molecular weight of the fusion protein (∼40 kDa), which is close to the transmission limit of the cell wall. Diffusion of the CRP810_1 peptides suggested the possibility that these peptides may be effective at a distance from the synergid cell. This raised the possibility that the CRP810_1 peptides may be involved in pollen tube guidance on the funiculus.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, we next examined the relationship between the CRP810_1 peptides and known micropylar guidance mutants. <italic>CRP810_1</italic> genes have been suggested to be downregulated in a <italic>myb98</italic> mutant defective in micropylar guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-JonesRhoades1">[21]</xref>. In addition to <italic>myb98</italic>, <italic>central cell guidance</italic> (<italic>ccg</italic>), a mutant defective in a nuclear protein expressed in the central cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Chen1">[25]</xref>, and <italic>magatama3</italic> (<italic>maa3</italic>), a mutant possibly defective in RNA metabolism in ubiquitous cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Shimizu1">[26]</xref>, were investigated as female gametophytic mutants defective in micropylar guidance. We performed immunostaining on <italic>myb98/myb98</italic> homozygous and <italic>myb98</italic>/<italic>MYB98</italic>, <italic>ccg</italic>/<italic>CCG</italic>, and <italic>maa3</italic>/<italic>MAA3</italic> heterozygous mutants (homozygous mutants for <italic>ccg</italic> and <italic>maa3</italic> were not obtained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Chen1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Shimizu1">[26]</xref>). Secreted CRP810_1 peptides were detected in only half of the ovules in the pistils of <italic>myb98</italic>/<italic>MYB98</italic> (51.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 484), <italic>ccg</italic>/<italic>CCG</italic> (51.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 397), and <italic>maa3</italic>/<italic>MAA3</italic> (52.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 179) mutants, in contrast with wild-type (95.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 170) and <italic>myb98</italic>/<italic>myb98</italic> (4.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 499) ovules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3G and 3H</xref>). Therefore, ovules lacking fluorescence in the heterozygous mutants were implicated as mutant ovules because the expected segregation ratio of wild-type to mutant female gametophytes was 50% in the heterozygous mutants. These results indicate that the synergid cells of these micropylar guidance mutants produce less CRP810_1 peptide and support the notion that the CRP810_1 peptides are involved in pollen tube attraction around or toward the micropyle.</p>

        <p>To define the function of CRP810_1 peptides <italic>in vivo</italic>, we simultaneously downregulated the five paralogous genes (<italic>CRP810_1.1</italic> to <italic>_1.5</italic>) using RNA interference (RNAi) against the complete <italic>CRP810_1.2</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).

        <p>Some disordered patterns in pollen tube growth were observed around the micropylar opening in these RNAi lines after aniline blue staining. To evaluate abnormal pollen tube guidance around the micropylar opening, we classified defects in micropylar guidance into two groups. The first included those cases in which one or more pollen tubes wandered around the micropyle but finally entered the micropyle (class I abnormality; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>); the second was more severe, in which no pollen tube entered the micropyle after growing up the funiculus (class II abnormality; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Approximately 10% of the ovules in each RNAi line showed class I and class II abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Of these, ∼1% exhibited a class II abnormality, which was never observed in the ovules of the wild-type or vector control lines. The frequency of class I and class II abnormalities in all three RNAi lines was significant (Student's <italic>t</italic> test; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Thus, we conclude that the downregulation of <italic>CRP810_1</italic> genes impaired micropylar pollen tube guidance, although it did not result in a complete loss of micropylar guidance. In the micropylar guidance mutants, the phenotype of abnormal pollen tube guidance was more severe and was observed at higher frequencies than in the RNAi lines; class I and class II abnormalities were 20%±14% and 65%±12% in <italic>myb98/myb98</italic>, 20%±12% and 14%±11% in <italic>myb98/MYB98</italic>, 22%±13% and 19%±10% in <italic>ccg/CCG</italic>, and 28%±15% and 17%±14% in <italic>maa3/MAA3</italic>, respectively.</p>
        <p>To examine whether <italic>CRP810_1</italic> downregulation actually impaired the ability of the ovules to attract pollen tubes, we performed a competitive assay semi-in vitro using wild-type and RNAi ovules simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). We placed a wild-type and an RNAi ovule together facing the micropylar opening so that a pollen tube could grow between the ovules. Ovules of homozygous <italic>myb98</italic> (<italic>myb98-1</italic>) were also examined. The pollen tubes were rarely attracted to the RNAi ovules (8.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 12) and never to <italic>myb98</italic> ovules (0%, <italic>n</italic> = 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). These results indicate that the loss of CRP810_1 peptides impaired pollen tube attraction to the micropylar opening in vivo and in vitro.</p>

        <p>CRP810_1 peptides expressed in the synergid cell were shown to diffuse toward the micropyle and were involved in pollen tube attraction at the micropyle. We next examined whether CRP810_1 peptides can directly attract pollen tubes. Recombinant His-tagged CRP810_1.1 to _1.5, following the putative cleavage site in the signal peptide, were individually expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. These recombinant peptides were purified and refolded according to the procedures used for TfLUREs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Okuda1">[17]</xref>.

The purified peptides were embedded in gelatin beads ∼15 µm in diameter for micromanipulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s005">Figure S5B and S5C</xref>). First, we investigated the activity of CRP810_1.2 and its concentration dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>), since the expression level of <italic>CRP810_1.2</italic> was the highest among <italic>CRP810_1</italic> genes, except for <italic>CRP810_1.5</italic>, which lacks a conserved cysteine residue. When gelatin beads containing 50 µM CRP810_1.2 were placed in front of the tip of a pollen tube, 100% (<italic>n</italic> = 15) of the tubes turned sharply toward the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Some tubes formed narrow coils around the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Beads containing 5 µM CRP810_1.2 also attracted all of the pollen tubes examined (<italic>n</italic> = 15). As the concentration of CRP810_1.2 in the beads decreased to 500 and 50 nM, the frequency of pollen tube attraction decreased (77%, <italic>n</italic> = 26 versus 32%, <italic>n</italic> = 22). Beads containing buffer alone (0 M) could not attract pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figure 5B</xref>; 7%, <italic>n</italic> = 28). This low frequency (7%) was likely due to random directional change of the pollen tube growth, which was also observed without beads. These results suggest that CRP810_1.2 is sufficient to attract pollen tubes in a concentration-dependent manner.</p>

        <p>Next, we examined each recombinant peptide of CRP810_1.1, _1.3, _1.4, and _1.5 at a concentration of 50 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). Pollen tubes were attracted to CRP810_1.3 and _1.4 at a high frequency (83%, <italic>n</italic> = 29 and 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 20, respectively) and CRP810_1.1 at a lower frequency (35%, <italic>n</italic> = 20). In contrast, CRP810_1.5, lacking one of the conserved cysteines, did not attract pollen tubes (12%, <italic>n</italic> = 17). Note that mutated CRP810_1.5-Y84C, in which the 84th tyrosine reverted to a cysteine, showed significant activity (93%, <italic>n</italic> = 15). This suggests that a single amino acid substitution inhibited the pollen tube attraction activity of CRP810_1.5 and that cysteine residues and possibly the formation of disulfide bonds in CRP810_1 peptides are required for their activity. Furthermore, TfLURE1 and 2, which are attractants from <italic>T. fournieri</italic>, did not show significant attraction of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen tubes (6%, <italic>n</italic> = 17 and 17%, <italic>n</italic> = 18, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). In our pollen tube attraction assay, pollen tubes were frequently trapped or deviated by more than a 90° angle toward beads containing CRP810_1 peptides, but they never deviated by more than a 45° angle toward beads containing buffer alone or TfLUREs, supporting the notion of specific attraction by CRP810_1 peptides. Since CRP810_1 peptides containing six cysteines, including CRP810_1.5-Y84C, had the ability to attract pollen tubes, we named the CRP810_1 peptides AtLURE1 peptides (e.g., CRP810_1.1 is AtLURE1.1). Together with the results from immunostaining the micropylar guidance mutants and the knockdown analysis, we concluded that AtLURE1 peptides are the micropylar pollen tube attractants in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p>

To examine whether such loss-of-function mutations of the <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes are frequently observed in other accessions, we attempted to determine the nucleotide sequences of <italic>AtLURE1.1</italic> to <italic>1.6</italic> using PCR-based direct sequencing from 12 different accessions (ecotypes) of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. We obtained 60 genomic sequences of the <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s006">Figure S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s011">Table S2</xref>). Each accession had at least four copies of <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes although it was unknown whether a set of all paralogous <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes was determined. We found many variations in nucleotide and amino acid sequences, some of which are likely to cause a loss of function, including a base substitution in a splicing acceptor site (Cvi-0 <italic>AtLURE1.3</italic>), the substitution of conserved cysteine residues (Kondara <italic>AtLURE1.5</italic>), and stop mutations (Ms-0 and Bur-0 <italic>AtLURE1.5</italic>). In contrast to the Col-0 accession, we also found putative functional <italic>AtLURE1.5</italic> and <italic>AtLURE1.6</italic> sequences which have no stop mutation and no mutation in conserved cysteines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s011">Table S2</xref>). Furthermore, premature stop codons have been predicted in two accessions for <italic>AtLURE1.3</italic> and in eight accessions for <italic>AtLURE1.5</italic> according to sequence information of 80 accessions from the 1001 Genome Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Cao1">[29]</xref>. These results suggest that a loss of function of some <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes occurred independently in various accessions. <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes without loss-of-function mutations must be sufficient to maintain each ecotype.</p>

        <title>Evolutionary Characterization of LURE1 Peptides from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic></title>
        <p>The <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes diverged after the split of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> and formed a species-specific gene cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). To provide further insight into the evolutionary and physiological properties of the AtLURE1 peptides and the AlCRP810_1 (AlLURE1) peptides in the orthologous clade, we performed the following two analyses: an evolutionary analysis to examine whether any significant positive selection was detected and a physiological pollen tube attraction assay to examine species specificity or preferentiality in pollen tube attraction.</p>
        <p>The rates of nonsynonymous substitutions versus synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) were calculated for the <italic>AtLURE1</italic> and <italic>AlLURE1</italic> genes, as well as other duplicated <italic>DEFL</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s010">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s011">S3</xref>), using approximate methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Nei1">[30]</xref> available in the PAML package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Yang1">[31]</xref>. Although the dN/dS values of some of the duplicated <italic>DEFL</italic> genes were greater than 1, suggesting the occurrence of positive selection, we could detect no significant positive selection between the <italic>AtLURE1</italic> and <italic>AlLURE1</italic> genes. We also calculated the dN/dS values between a putative original copy <italic>AtLURE1.1</italic> and the other paralogous <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes (<italic>AtLURE1.2–1.5</italic>) within <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The values were not greater than 1 in any comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s012">Table S3</xref>). Next, we performed tests for positive selection on any of the individual codons and along any of the branches. A maximum likelihood tree of five <italic>AtLURE1</italic> and six <italic>AlLURE1</italic> genes that have no premature stop codon was used in these analyses. For the individual codons, there was no indication that the dN/dS values were significantly greater than 1 (the lowest probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of neutral evolution was &gt;0.19) using HyPhy implemented in MEGA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Tamura1">[32]</xref>. For the branches, the test was conducted using the program codeml available in the PAML package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Yang1">[31]</xref>. The program calculated the individual dN/dS values for each branch and a single average dN/dS value. By comparing the likelihood ratio for the two values with a chi-square test, the probability was not significant (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.41). This suggested that there was not likely to be variation in the dN/dS values and thus the possibility of positive selection along any of specific branches. Consequently, we did not detect evidence for positive selection in pairwise comparisons of overall sequences, on specific codons, and along specific branches of <italic>AtLURE1</italic> and <italic>AlLURE1</italic> genes.</p>
        <p>Since no evidence that the <italic>AtLURE1</italic> and <italic>AlLURE1</italic> genes are evolving under positive selection was observed, we conducted the McDonald-Kreitman test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-McDonald1">[33]</xref> to test a hypothesis that <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes have evolved under neutral evolution. According to the neutral theory, the dN/dS values between the two species should be equivalent to the rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism within <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Although one-to-one orthologous relationship between <italic>AtLURE1</italic> and <italic>AlLURE1</italic> genes could not be defined, we tried the test for coding sequences of each <italic>AtLURE1</italic> gene of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s011">Table S2</xref>) and <italic>AlLURE1.5</italic> gene as a representative from <italic>AlLURE1</italic> genes. The test was not significant for <italic>AtLURE1.1</italic>, <italic>1.2</italic>, <italic>1.3</italic>, <italic>1.4</italic>, and <italic>1.6</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.69, 0.75, 1.0, 0.16, and 1.0, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s013">Table S4</xref>) except for <italic>AtLURE1.5</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s013">Table S4</xref>). We also observed similar results when compared to other <italic>AlLURE1</italic> genes as a representative (unpublished data). These results implied that most <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes have evolved by drifting neutrally.</p>
        <p>We found that divergence of amino acid sequence between AtLURE1 and AlLURE1 peptides was higher among the subgroups of multiply duplicated DEFL peptides analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s010">Table S1</xref>). Since we did not detect evidence for positive selection for the LURE1 peptides of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, it is suggested that the AtLURE1 peptides have undergone relatively rapid sequence change under neutral evolution, resulting in higher divergence of the sequences, and gene duplication after the divergence of the two species.</p>

        <p>Next, we investigated reciprocal pollen tube attraction activities of AtLURE1 and AlLURE1 peptides in <italic>A. lyrata</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. We were able to prepare only one peptide from <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, being the predicted mature peptide of AlLURE1.3, as a recombinant peptide. We confirmed the ability of AlLURE1.3 to attract <italic>A. lyrata</italic> pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that AlLURE1 peptides are also pollen tube attractants in <italic>A. lyrata</italic>.

These results suggested that the AtLURE1 peptide had species-preferentiality, whereas the AlLURE1 peptide did not.

        <title>Breakdown of Reproductive Isolation Barriers by Transforming the <italic>AtLURE1</italic> Gene into <italic>Torenia</italic></title>
        <p>If AtLURE1 peptides are in fact key molecules in the establishment of reproductive isolation, one may be able to break this barrier by introducing <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes into other plant species. Thus, we produced transgenic <italic>T. fournieri</italic> plants expressing an AtLURE1 peptide and examined whether reproductive isolation can be overcome in this manner. Despite a large evolutionary distance between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Brassicaceae, Brassicales) and <italic>T. fournieri</italic> (Linderniaceae, Lamiales) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-APG1">[34]</xref>, AtLURE1 peptides were partially similar to TfLUREs, including the alignment of conserved cysteines, the CXC motif at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), and specific expression in the synergid cell. The remaining amino acids, however, diverged considerably, demonstrating the loss of a conserved glycine residue for the gamma-core motif, which is generally observed in antimicrobial CRPs. Consistent with this divergence, TfLUREs did not attract pollen tubes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). We then designed a transgenic plant co-expressing <italic>AtLURE1.2</italic> and cytosolic <italic>GFP</italic> specifically within the synergid cell of <italic>T. fournieri</italic>, under the control of the <italic>TfLURE2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g007">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s007">S7B</xref>). In transgenic T<sub>1</sub> heterozygous <italic>T. fournieri</italic> plants, we confirmed the specific expression of GFP in the synergid cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) and the secretion of AtLURE1.2 peptide to the micropylar end of GFP-expressing synergid cells via immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Using the transgenic <italic>T. fournieri</italic>, we performed an interspecific pollen tube attraction assay, in which manipulated ovules of the transgenic <italic>T. fournieri</italic> were placed close to the tip of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen tubes in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). The ovule was applied twice to one pollen tube to determine whether the ovule consistently attracted the pollen tube. Strikingly, the GFP-labeled transgenic <italic>T. fournieri</italic> ovules strongly attracted <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen tubes in both trials (100%, <italic>n</italic> = 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), whereas non-labeled ovules did not (0%, <italic>n</italic> = 11). The attraction was also precise, in that pollen tubes were able to redirect themselves toward the micropylar end of embryo sacs that had been shifted to a slightly different position. Strikingly, all of the attracted pollen tubes that continued to grow (<italic>n</italic> = 9) penetrated the embryo sac of <italic>T. fournieri</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g007">Figure 7F and 7G</xref>), through the region of the filiform apparatus (thickened cell wall) of the synergid cell, as reported in normal fertilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-VanderPluijm1">[35]</xref>. These results demonstrated that the heterologous expression of a single AtLURE1 attractant peptide alone is sufficient to overcome interspecific barriers in micropylar pollen tube guidance and penetration of the embryo sac, despite a large evolutionary distance between organisms.</p>

        <title>Mechanistic Insights into Micropylar Pollen Tube Guidance Mediated by LURE Peptides</title>
        <p>Pollen tube growth and guidance have been intensively studied in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, but the key attractant molecule has not been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Takeuchi1">[36]</xref>. Here, we identified paralogous <italic>DEFL</italic> genes forming the sole species-specific <italic>DEFL</italic> gene cluster in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, compared to its close relative <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, and found evidence that these <italic>DEFL</italic> genes, designated the <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes, encode pollen tube attractants in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. AtLURE1 peptides are small, secreted DEFL peptides that are specifically expressed in synergid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In vivo data showed that AtLURE1 peptides diffused to the surface of the funiculus of the ovule through the micropyle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) and that downregulation of these peptides impaired micropylar guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, recombinant AtLURE1 peptides expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> attracted pollen tubes in a concentration-dependent and species-preferential manner in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g006">6B</xref>). These results provide concrete evidence that AtLURE1 peptides are pollen tube attractants in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> necessary for micropylar guidance.</p>
        <p>Specific and abundant attractant peptide expression in the synergid cell is suggested in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-JonesRhoades1">[21]</xref>), as in <italic>T. fournieri</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Okuda1">[17]</xref>. <italic>AtLURE1</italic> gene duplication appears to have contributed to the increased amount of <italic>AtLURE1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We propose that highly homologous AtLURE1 peptides (80%–95% amino acid sequence identity) are functionally redundant because each recombinant peptide showed attraction activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figure 5</xref>), we could find no combination effect among them (unpublished data), and heterologous expression of the AtLURE1.2 peptide in <italic>T. fournieri</italic> showed sufficient activity to attract <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen tubes into the embryo sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Abundant expression might be a common characteristic of diffusible attractants derived from the synergid cell. The synergid cell is morphologically unique, showing characteristics typical of transfer cells, which are active in secretion and/or molecule uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Higashiyama2">[37]</xref>. The synergid cell has been proposed to be a general source of pollen tube attractants in flowering plants due to its conserved morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Higashiyama2">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Higashiyama3">[38]</xref>. As proposed after the laser-mediated ablation of synergid cells in <italic>T. fournieri</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Higashiyama4">[39]</xref>, the amount of attraction signal may be correlated with the effective range of the signal. The endogenous localization of AtLURE1 peptides, as revealed by the immunostaining, suggests that the peptides diffused to the surface of the ovular funiculus (∼250 µm from the basal edge of the synergid cell). This is consistent with previous estimates of the effective range of pollen tube attraction in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, based on the behavior of pollen tubes in vivo and in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Takeuchi1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Stewman1">[40]</xref>. The abundant expression and active secretion of AtLURE1 peptides might be important for retaining a sharp peptide concentration gradient toward the synergid cell at a sufficient distance.</p>
        <p>Like TfLUREs, AtLURE1 peptides are DEFL peptides, although their amino acid sequences have diverged considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s007">S7A</xref>). The LURE peptides of <italic>Torenia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Okuda1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Kanaoka1">[41]</xref> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed similar alignments of cysteines, which are typical of plant and insect defensins, including a CXC motif at the C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Thomma1">[11]</xref>. A glycine in the gamma core of antimicrobial peptides is contained in <italic>Torenia</italic> LUREs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Okuda1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Kanaoka1">[41]</xref>, but not in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> LURE1 peptides. Because <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Brassicaceae) and <italic>Torenia</italic> (Linderniaceae) are quite divergent dicots, DEFL peptides might function as general pollen tube attractants in dicotyledonous plants. Although searching for attractants in other plant species is difficult due to low homologies, our study suggests that LURE-type DEFL peptides, which are abundantly and specifically expressed in the synergid cell, are candidate attractants. In the monocot <italic>Z. mays</italic>, another type of small secreted peptide, EGG APPARATUS 1 (EA1), was recently shown to be an attractant molecule derived predominantly from the synergid cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Mrton1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Marton1">[44]</xref>. GFP-fused <italic>Z. mays</italic> EGG APPARATUS 1 (ZmEA1) appears to diffuse toward the micropylar opening as the ovule develops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Mrton1">[42]</xref>. EA1-like genes comprise a large family in monocots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-GrayMitsumune1">[45]</xref>. Monocots may use non-DEFL peptides as attractants, although EA1-like genes are not likely to be expressed in synergid cells in rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Ohnishi1">[46]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Various CRPs, including DEFL peptides, are involved in the cell–cell communications underlying male–female interactions during plant reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Higashiyama1">[14]</xref>. The suggestion has been made that nearly 200 of 825 <italic>CRP</italic>s are expressed in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> female gametophyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-JonesRhoades1">[21]</xref>. Not only AtLURE1 peptides but also other DEFL peptides and CRPs could be involved in cell–cell communication among gametophytic cells. Since the downregulation of AtLURE1 peptides partly inhibited micropylar guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g004">Figure 4</xref>), additional attractant peptides may be derived from the synergid cell. As we observed abnormal pollen tube guidance in the micropylar guidance mutants at higher frequencies than in the RNAi lines, such additional attractants may be downregulated in these mutants. In fact, we found that some additional genes belonging to the CRP810 subgroup, which consists of 16 DEFL peptides in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s008">Figure S8</xref>), were downregulated in the <italic>myb98</italic> mutant ovule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-JonesRhoades1">[21]</xref>. Therefore, we performed qRT-PCR analysis for all of the <italic>CRP810</italic> genes and confirmed that some of these were expressed in the pistil at high levels as <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Although whether they function as attractant peptides is unknown, our results suggest the possibility that many more pollen tube attractant peptides are expressed in the synergid cell, which may be required to efficiently attract pollen tubes to all female gametophytes. Nonetheless, our key finding will considerably accelerate the study of the directional control of tip-growing pollen tubes, the determination of precise spatiotemporal control of pollen tube attraction to the ovule, and identification of the receptor(s) of pollen tube attractants, which has not yet been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Takeuchi1">[36]</xref>.</p>

        <title>The Sole Species-Specific Cluster of <italic>DEFL</italic> Genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Encodes Micropylar Pollen Tube Attractants</title>
        <p>Using phylogenetic and synteny analyses, the <italic>AtLURE1</italic> (<italic>CRP810_1</italic>) and <italic>AlCRP810_1</italic> genes were suggested to form species-specific tandem arrays after the divergence of the two species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), possibly via gene duplication and/or gene conversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Leister1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Nei2">[48]</xref>. Other clusters of paralogous <italic>DEFL</italic> genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (≥four genes with ≥90% bootstrap values) were suggested to be formed before speciation occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s001">S1A</xref>), and syntenic conservation was observed between these <italic>DEFL</italic> genes from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Post-divergence, many genes have undergone lineage-specific duplication in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Hu1">[19]</xref>; however, among the 317 <italic>DEFL</italic> genes, the <italic>AtLURE1</italic> attractant genes represent the only recently formed, species-specific cluster. Moreover, some subgroups of mammalian β-defensin gene lineages exist specifically in certain species and are preferentially expressed in the male reproductive tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Patil1">[49]</xref>. Clarifying whether these β-defensins play a role in fertility would be of interest.</p>
        <p>Rapid gene turnover has been reported in multigene families involved in disease, including the effector genes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g., antimicrobial peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Sackton1">[8]</xref>), the recognition genes of the sea urchin <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> (e.g., Toll-like receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Rast1">[7]</xref>), and the effector genes for avirulence activity of the rice blast fungal pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Yoshida1">[9]</xref>, possibly due to a coevolutionary arms race. Our work demonstrates that genes involved in direct male–female interactions in sexual reproduction can also increase rapidly in copy number during speciation. To our knowledge, such a species-specific gene cluster directly involved in male–female interactions has not been reported. The relationship between multicopy factors for sexual reproduction and their rapid molecular evolution is an important issue to be addressed. In addition to the indicated lineage-specific duplication, AtLURE1 peptides showed lower homology (∼70%) among multiply duplicated DEFL peptides when compared to orthologous <italic>A. lyrata</italic> DEFL peptides. This suggests the rapid evolution of <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes possibly by high mutation rate under neutral genetic drift because we were unable to detect any evidence of positive selection. Similarly no evidence for positive selection has been found in multicopy antimicrobial peptides in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but they might not require functional change between species due to a lack of coevolutionary arms race <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Lazzaro1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Sackton1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Jiggins1">[50]</xref>. This seems to be different from the case of <italic>AtLURE1</italic> genes, which encode peptides showing species-preferential activity.</p>
        <p>Various mutations, including cysteine substitutions and stop mutations, were observed in different ecotypes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s006">Figure S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001449.s011">Table S2</xref>). A cysteine substitution in AtLURE1.5 found in the Col-0 line was shown to impair attraction of the pollen tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). <italic>AtLURE1</italic> gene duplication is likely to confer a relaxation of functional constraints due to gene redundancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Ohno1">[51]</xref>. As long as some population of attractant peptides interacts with a receptor, functional changes such as specificity for a receptor of the other population of peptides could be permitted with normal pollen tube guidance. One may speculate that multiple attractant genes may be important for reinforcing species specificity by sequence divergence without loss of correct ligand–receptor pairing.</p>

        <title>Non-Cell Autonomous Regulation of Pollen Tube Attraction</title>
        <p>In addition to the mutant ovules of <italic>myb98</italic>, those of <italic>ccg</italic> and <italic>maa3</italic> could not secrete AtLURE1 peptides, as shown by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3G and 3H</xref>), suggesting that attractant secretion occurs via CENTRAL CELL GUIDANCE (CCG)- and MAA3-related regulatory pathways. CCG is a transcriptional regulator in the central cell (but not the synergid cell) that functions in micropylar guidance. Regarding the phenotype of the <italic>ccg</italic> mutant, whether the central cell directly attracts pollen tubes by emitting a diffusible signal or indirectly controls pollen tube guidance via cell–cell communication between the central cell and synergid cell has been debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Berger1">[52]</xref>. Our results are consistent with the latter model, in which CCG in the central cell indirectly controls the expression of AtLURE1 peptides in the synergid cell. Gametic cells (the egg cell and central cell) communicate with each other, and likely control cell specificity in the synergid and antipodal cells during female gametophyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Pagnussat1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Kgi1">[56]</xref>. Our results suggest that CCG in the central cell is required for full functioning of the synergid cell. The identification of additional downstream genes regulated by CCG and upstream genes regulating attractant production will clarify how the central cell controls attractants secreted from the synergid cell at the molecular level.</p>
        <p>MAA3 helicase is essential for normal development of the female gametophyte and is likely generally involved in RNA metabolism in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Shimizu1">[26]</xref>. Although the phenotype of the <italic>maa3</italic> ovule includes smaller nucleoli in two polar nuclei and failure of fusion of the polar nuclei in the central cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Shimizu2">[57]</xref>, whether the synergid cell and/or the central cell are responsible for abnormal pollen tube guidance in <italic>maa3</italic> remains unclear. AtLURE1 peptides were not secreted from the <italic>maa3</italic> ovule, as shown by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g003">Figure 3G and 3H</xref>). This finding implies that attractant production could be regulated by MAA3-mediated RNA metabolism.

        <title>AtLURE1 Peptides May Overcome Pre-zygotic Reproductive Barriers</title>
        <p>Interspecific cross-pollination with <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pistils was shown to cause mis-targeting of some pollen tubes at the micropylar guidance step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Shimizu3">[61]</xref>. Consistent with this idea, AtLURE1.2 peptide showed species-preferentiality in its attraction activity when pollen tubes from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Unexpectedly, AlLURE1.3 peptide showing low sequence identity (∼70%) with AtLURE1 peptides attracted pollen tubes from both <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> in a similar frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001449-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This might be related to evolutionary pattern of receptor(s) for the LURE peptides between the two species. Elucidating coevolution of the LURE peptides and the receptors of both species would shed light on mechanism of formation of reproductive barriers in pollen tube guidance. In <italic>T. fournieri</italic> and its close relative <italic>T. concolor</italic>, rapid molecular evolution of <italic>TfLURE1</italic> and <italic>TcLURE1</italic> was likely directly involved in the species preferentiality of pollen tube attraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Kanaoka1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Higashiyama5">[62]</xref>. The expression of LURE attractant peptides at the last step of pollen tube guidance is likely to be one of the more severe reproductive isolation barriers. This was supported by the fact that a single <italic>AtLURE1</italic> gene introduced into <italic>T. fournieri</italic> was sufficient to attract competent <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen tubes to the <italic>T. fournieri</italic> embryo sac. The degree of tracking precision shown by these pollen tubes was greater than expected: pollen tubes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> followed the filiform apparatus (only 10 µm in surface diameter) of manipulated ovules of transgenic <italic>T. fournieri</italic>, as is normally observed when <italic>T. fournieri</italic> pollen tubes approach the embryo sac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Higashiyama3">[38]</xref>. Recently, synthetic ZmEA1 peptide was shown to attract maize pollen tubes, and heterologous expression of ZmEA1-GFP in the synergid cell of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> resulted in the attraction of maize pollen tubes toward the micropyle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Marton1">[44]</xref>. These results may open the way for new technologies to overcome reproductive barriers in flowering plants, although further research is required to identify other key factors preventing heterologous fertilization. Our research into the AtLURE1 peptide further showed that heterogeneous pollen tubes can enter the embryo sac normally through the region of the filiform apparatus. This suggests that pollen tube entrance into the embryo sac does not involve any other severe species-recognition mechanism, at least when combining the <italic>T. fournieri</italic> embryo sac with an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen tube. The succeeding steps in fertilization, being pollen tube recognition and triggered rupture by the synergid cell, may show severe species-specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Amien1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-EscobarRestrepo1">[63]</xref>. <italic>FERONIA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-EscobarRestrepo1">[63]</xref> and <italic>ZmES4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001449-Amien1">[18]</xref> expressed in the synergid cell are good candidates for mediating species recognition during these steps.</p>

Pre-immune IgG was not bound to the micropylar opening of the ovule when the ovule was fixed in AcOH–EtOH or paraformaldehyde. Scale bar, 50 µm. (B) Immuno-dot blot analysis confirming the recognition capability of the anti-CRP810_1.2 antibody. 10 µl of purified recombinant His-tagged peptide was blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore); the total amount of blotted peptide is shown on the left. The PVDF membrane was then treated with anti-CRP810_1.2 antibodies (primary antibody, 1∶10,000 dilution) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit goat IgG (secondary antibody, 1∶20,000 dilution; KPL). Signals detected using a chemiluminescent reagent (Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate, Millipore; Light-Capture, ATTO) are represented as black dots. All His-tagged CRP810_1 peptides were detected in a concentration-dependent manner, while His-tagged TfLURE1 and 2 as controls were barely detected. Among the CRP810_1 peptides, the signals for CRP810_1.1, which showed lower identity to CRP810_1.2, and CRP810_1.5, which lacked a single conserved cysteine, are comparatively weak.</p>
