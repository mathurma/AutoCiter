<abstract>
<p>It has recently been appreciated that NK cells exhibit many features reminiscent of adaptive immune cells. Considerable heterogeneity exists with respect to the ligand specificity of individual NK cells and as such, a subset of NK cells can respond, expand, and differentiate into memory-like cells in a ligand-specific manner. MHC I-binding inhibitory receptors, including those belonging to the Ly49 and KIR families, are expressed in a variegated manner, which creates ligand-specific diversity within the NK cell pool. However, how NK cells determine which inhibitory receptors to express on their cell surface during a narrow window of development is largely unknown. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that signals from activating receptors are critical for induction of Ly49 and KIR receptors during NK cell development; activating receptor-derived signals increased the probability of the Ly49 bidirectional Pro1 promoter to transcribe in the forward versus the reverse direction, leading to stable expression of Ly49 receptors in mature NK cells. Our data support a model where the balance of activating and inhibitory receptor signaling in NK cells selects for the induction of appropriate inhibitory receptors during development, which NK cells use to create a diverse pool of ligand-specific NK cells.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells are important cells of the immune system, because they kill abnormal cells such as those infected with viruses or have become cancerous. These abnormal cells can lose proteins known as MHC molecules, which are recognized by inhibitory receptors on NK cells. Thus, when an NK cell interacts with a cell with decreased MHC, the NK cell is disinhibited and can kill the target cell. Each NK cell carries a unique assortment of these inhibitory receptors. However, how developing NK cells determine which inhibitory receptors to put on the NK cell’s surface during development is unknown. In this study, we show that signals generated through NK cell activating receptors are important for inducing a subset of inhibitory receptors on NK cells during development. We propose that the NK cell has an increased chance of acquiring an inhibitory receptor until a balance between activating and inhibitory receptor signals is achieved. This process ensures that NK cells can properly detect abnormal cells that have lost MHC. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that play an important role in defense against viral infections and tumor clearance. NK cells express a wide variety of inhibitory and activating receptors, whose downstream signals integrate to dictate a functional response. For example, the Ly49 family of receptors on murine NK cells plays a key role in NK cell function. Inhibitory Ly49 receptors (e.g., Ly49A, Ly49G, Ly49C, and Ly49I) recognize major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) and allow NK cells to carry out “missing-self” recognition, a process that eliminates cells with abnormally down-regulated MHC I expression due to certain types of infection or neoplastic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref002">2</xref>]. Also, the activating receptor Ly49H binds to cytomegalovirus (CMV)-encoded m157 protein, aiding in the clearance of CMV-infected cells. Ly49 receptors are acquired in a sequential and variegated manner during development, which yields a diverse repertoire of NK cells with various Ly49 receptor expression patterns. Since each Ly49 receptor recognizes a subset of MHC I alleles, the Ly49 receptor expression pattern on an individual NK cell determines its target cell specificity. Thus, unlike T and B cells that create antigen-specific diversity by genetic recombination, NK cells generate ligand-specific diversity by acquiring an assortment of inhibitory and activating receptors; however, the mechanisms that regulate NK cell receptor acquisition during development are not well understood.</p>
<p>NK cells commence their acquisition of Ly49 receptors during the immature NK (CD3ε<sup>-</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>-</sup>) bone marrow (BM) stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref004">4</xref>]. Ly49 receptor genes are activated in a specific order, and each receptor possesses a developmental timeframe for the initiation of expression, which is maintained for the lifetime of the NK cell. However, once this window of opportunity passes, the NK cell can never express that Ly49 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref005">5</xref>]. Ly49 receptor expression patterns are influenced by polymorphisms in the <italic>Ly49</italic> locus and the MHC haplotype expressed in each strain of mouse. Thus, the fraction of NK cells expressing a particular Ly49 receptor is similar within a given mouse strain. For example, ~10% and ~50% of NK cells in C57BL/6 mice express Ly49A and Ly49G2, respectively.</p>
<p>Ly49 receptor gene transcription is controlled by at least two distinct promoters: Pro1, which is active in immature NK cells, and Pro2, which is critical in maintaining expression in mature NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref009">9</xref>]. Each Ly49 receptor possesses a unique Pro1 promoter that acts as a bidirectional switch. Transcription factors bind to Pro1 on either the positive (forward) or negative (reverse) strand in a probabilistic manner, thus determining forward or reverse transcription from this promoter. Transcription of Pro1 in the forward direction leads to activation of Pro2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref007">7</xref>]. Pro2 can be regulated through DNA methylation, and forward transcription of Pro1 is thought to remove a repressor complex, allowing for acetylation of histones and/or demethylation of DNA at the Pro2 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref010">10</xref>]. This promotes <italic>Ly49</italic> transcription in mature NK cells and the stable expression of the receptor. Pro1-mediated transcription in the reverse direction results in no Pro2 activity and therefore no Ly49 receptor expression. Thus, the proportion of NK cells expressing a given Ly49 receptor is determined by the probability of the specific Pro1 promoter to transcribe in the forward versus reverse direction.</p>
<p>Two important factors that shape the NK cell inhibitory Ly49 receptor profile are the MHC haplotype and the MHC-binding specificities of the inhibitory receptors themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref011">11</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which inhibitory receptor specificity and MHC haplotype regulate NK cell receptor acquisition is unclear, especially since inhibitory receptors block (through recruitment of phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHIP) rather than transmit signals to the NK cell. Mice with NK cells lacking SHP-1 or SHIP display increased proportions of Ly49 receptor-expressing NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref015">15</xref>], suggesting that inhibitory receptor-induced phosphatase activity attenuates Ly49 receptor acquisition. To explain how this might work, we hypothesized that activating receptor signals are the driving force behind inhibitory receptor acquisition. We propose that MHC I influences the acquisition of inhibitory receptors by blocking this activating signal, which impedes expression of additional inhibitory receptors. This notion is difficult to test by deleting specific activating receptors, as NK cells express numerous activating receptors that utilize various signaling modules. Instead, we took advantage of mice lacking the adaptor molecule SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein-76 (SLP-76). Although initially described as being dispensable for NK cell activation in IL-2-expanded splenocyte cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref017">17</xref>], subsequent studies have shown that SLP-76 is indeed critical for signal transduction downstream of multiple NK cell activating receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref019">19</xref>]. In this study, we report that activating signals downstream of SLP-76 drive the stable expression of a subset of Ly49 receptors by increasing the probability of forward Ly49 transcription from the bidirectional Pro1 promoter. Our data support a model where competing activating and inhibitory receptor signals determine the probability of Ly49 receptor expression, which ultimately shapes an appropriate inhibitory receptor repertoire during NK cell development.</p>

<title>SLP-76-Derived Signals Are Required for Optimal Induction of Ly49 Receptor and KIR Expression by Developing NK Cells</title>
<p>To test whether NK cell effector function following activation is dependent on SLP-76, wild-type (WT) and SLP-76 knockout (KO) NK cells were stimulated through three distinct activating receptor families (ITAM-dependent: NK1.1, Ly49H; costimulatory-like: NKG2D; SAP-dependent: 2B4). We found that the baseline expression level (MFI) of all activating receptors on SLP-76 KO NK cells was comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Upon stimulation with antibodies (Abs) against the various activating receptors, SLP-76 KO NK cells were significantly defective in degranulation (as measured by surface CD107a) compared to WT NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that SLP-76-mediated signals were critical for NK cell function downstream of multiple activating receptors, we next determined if SLP-76-mediated signals impacted NK cell development. The percentage and absolute number of splenic NK cells in SLP-76 KO mice were higher than WT littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). This increase in NK cells was most likely a consequence of the increased availability of homeostatic cytokines due to the lack of competing T cells in SLP-76 KO mice. We also examined expression of SLP-76 in all stages of NK cell development and found that SLP-76 mRNA was highly expressed in both the early and late stages of NK cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Next, WT and SLP-76 KO NK cells were analyzed for expression of activating and inhibitory receptors, including the Ly49 family of receptors. A strikingly significant decrease in Ly49 receptor-expressing splenic and BM NK cells was observed in SLP-76 KO mice. This included both inhibitory (Ly49A, Ly49G2, Ly49C, Ly49I) and activating (Ly49D and Ly49H) family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). The earliest acquired receptors, Ly49A and Ly49G2, were most affected by the loss of SLP-76 (~90% reduction) compared to Ly49C and Ly49I (~50% reduction). Not all MHC I-binding inhibitory receptors were reduced, as the proportion of CD94/NKG2A expressing NK cells was unaltered in SLP-76 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g001">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Since Ly49 receptor acquisition can also occur at later stages of NK cell development, a maturation defect in SLP-76 KO NK cells could be responsible for the phenotype observed. To test this possibility, we assessed splenic NK cell maturation using the cell surface markers CD27 and CD11b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref020">20</xref>] and found that NK cells were more developmentally mature in SLP-76 KO mice (increased proportion of CD27<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> NK cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). Moreover, Ly49 receptor expression by SLP-76 KO NK cells was decreased at every stage of splenic maturation compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002526.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). These data show that an NK cell maturation defect was not responsible for the reduction in Ly49 receptor expression.</p>
<p>Killer immunoglobulin-like (KIR) receptors on human NK cells are functional orthologs of Ly49 receptors in mice. To test whether SLP-76-derived signals also contributed to KIR acquisition, we differentiated human NK cells from CD34<sup>+</sup> umbilical cord blood cells transduced with SLP-76 or scrambled shRNA in vitro for 21 d. SLP-76 shRNA transduction resulted in a decrease in SLP-76 expression, which correlated with a reduced ability to activate KIR gene expression (KIR cocktail of KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2/DL3, KIR3DL1) but not CD56 or NKp46 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002526.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). These data along with the Ly49 receptor acquisition defect in SLP-76 KO NK cells suggest that NK cells rely on SLP-76-dependent activation signals for a MHC I-binding inhibitory receptor acquisition.</p>

<title>The Loss of Ly49 Receptor Expression in SLP-76 KO NK Cells Is MHC I Haplotype-Independent</title>
<p>To obtain a more global picture of the Ly49 receptor repertoire of SLP-76 KO NK cells, we examined the coexpression pattern of inhibitory Ly49 receptors. This analysis revealed that SLP-76 KO mice have an expanded population of Ly49 receptor-negative NK cells. Although the proportion of NK cells that express Ly49C or Ly49I was reduced in SLP-76 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), there was relative preservation of Ly49C and Ly49I single-positive NK cells that did not coexpress other Ly49 inhibitory receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Ly49C and Ly49I bind to MHC I (H2-K<sup>b</sup>) in C57BL/6 mice, as opposed to Ly49A and Ly49G2 that bind H-2D<sup>d</sup> and do not possess ligands in C57BL/6 mice. Since MHC I interactions with Ly49 receptors shape the Ly49 repertoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref022">22</xref>], we wondered whether the relative preservation of Ly49C and Ly49I expression could be related to their ability to bind MHC I in C57BL/6 mice. To test this, we bred SLP-76 KO mice to the B10.D2 mouse strain. If ligand binding were responsible for the preservation of Ly49 receptor expression, the proportion of Ly49A<sup>+</sup> and Ly49G2<sup>+</sup> NK cells would be relatively preserved in SLP-76 KO.B10.D2 mice, as B10.D2 mice express H-2D<sup>d</sup>. However, we found that SLP-76 KO-B10.D2 NK cells also displayed a similarly defective Ly49 receptor repertoire as compared to SLP-76 KO NK cells on a H-2<sup>b</sup> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>).

<title>SLP-76-Derived Signals Regulate Some, but Not All, Ly49 Receptors in an NK Cell-Intrinsic Manner</title>
<p>As SLP-76 is expressed in almost all hematopoietic cells, SLP-76 KO mice harbor defects in multiple hematopoietic lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref023">23</xref>]. Although we predicted that SLP-76-derived signals controlled Ly49 receptor acquisition in an NK cell-intrinsic manner, it was still possible that the defects arose secondary to cell-extrinsic effects. To address this, we generated mixed BM chimeric mice using BM from congenically disparate WT and SLP-76 KO mice mixed at a 2:1 ratio. Ten to twelve weeks after reconstitution, although some variability was seen, the contribution of SLP-76 KO BM to non-T cell/non-NK cells compared to NK cells was similar, suggesting that there was no significant advantage or disadvantage of SLP-76 deficiency in NK cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the proportion of NK cells expressing Ly49A, Ly49G2, and Ly49I was decreased in SLP-76 KO BM compared to WT BM-derived NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, no differences in the proportion of Ly49C, Ly49D, and Ly49H expressing NK cells was observed between SLP-76 KO BM and WT BM-derived NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Thus, although a subset of Ly49 receptors (Ly49A, G2, and I) was regulated in an NK cell-intrinsic manner, Ly49C, Ly49D, and Ly49H were controlled by a SLP-76-dependent, NK cell-extrinsic mechanism.</p>

<p>It has been published that mice deficient in MHC I or inhibitory receptor signaling harbor increased proportions of Ly49-expressing NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref015">15</xref>]. We hypothesized that the proportion of Ly49 receptor-expressing NK cells is increased in such mice because activation signals are unopposed by MHC-binding inhibitory receptors during NK cell development. The NK cell-intrinsic regulation of some, but not all, Ly49 receptors provided us with an opportunity to test this hypothesis, as we would predict that only NK cells expressing Ly49 receptors regulated by an NK cell-intrinsic mechanism would be increased in MHC I-deficient mice. We examined the Ly49 receptor repertoire of MHC I-deficient β2m KO mice and observed an increase in the proportion of NK cells expressing Ly49 receptors that are regulated in a cell-intrinsic manner (Ly49A, Ly49G2, and Ly49I). In contrast, the proportion of NK cells expressing Ly49 receptors regulated in an NK cell-extrinsic manner (Ly49C, Ly49D, and Ly49H) were the same or reduced in β2m KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). These findings suggest that the lack of inhibitory ligands (MHC I), presumably leading to more NK cell activation, results in an increased chance of NK cells expressing cell-intrinsic Ly49 receptors.</p>

<title>Distinct Signaling Pathways Upstream of SLP-76 Differentially Contribute to Ly49 Receptor Acquisition by NK Cells</title>
<p>In NK cells, SLP-76 can be recruited to the membrane by two independent proximal signaling complexes: one involving LAT family members (LAT1/LAT2) and the other involving ADAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref024">24</xref>]. As both SLP-76 signaling complexes are important for NK cell function downstream of activating receptors, we predicted that both LAT1/LAT2 and ADAP proteins would contribute to Ly49 receptor acquisition by NK cells. Surprisingly, we found that these SLP-76 signaling complexes differentially contributed to Ly49 receptor acquisition. A significantly decreased proportion of NK cells expressing Ly49A and Ly49I was observed in LAT1/LAT2 DKO but not in ADAP KO mice. Conversely, a significantly smaller proportion of NK cells expressing Ly49G2 was observed in ADAP KO but not LAT1/LAT2 DKO mice <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g004">Fig 4A</xref><bold>)</bold>. The LAT1/LAT2/ADAP TKO mice displayed decreased proportions of all three Ly49 receptors similar to the SLP-76 KO NK cells. The upstream ADAP and LAT pathways also differently affected NK cell-extrinsic Ly49 receptors. Ly49C was primarily driven by LAT1/LAT2-dependent signals while Ly49D and Ly49H utilized both pathways for their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These data point to a differential influence of SLP-76 upstream signaling pathways on Ly49 receptor induction during NK cell development.</p>

<p>Ly49 receptor gene transcription is driven off the Pro1 promoter region in immature NK cells and the Pro2 region during maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref009">9</xref>]. Transcription factors can bind to Pro1 on either the positive (forward) or negative strand (reverse) in a probabilistic manner, and this determines the directionality of transcription from this promoter. Forward transcription allows for stable expression of that Ly49 receptor in mature NK cells while reverse transcription leads to no Ly49 expression. To test whether SLP-76-mediated signaling affected transcription from the Pro1 promoter, forward and reverse transcripts from the Ly49G Pro1 promoter were examined. As expected, compared to WT NK cells, DX5<sup>−</sup> (BM iNK cells) and DX5<sup>+</sup> (BM mNK cells) SLP-76 KO NK cells expressed significantly reduced levels of Ly49G Pro1 forward transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). However, we also surprisingly observed that SLP-76 KO NK cells expressed increased Ly49G Pro1 reverse transcripts in iNK and mNK BM subsets compared to WT NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). These data suggest that SLP-76-mediated signaling affects Ly49 receptor acquisition in developing NK cells by promoting Pro1 forward over reverse transcription, thereby increasing the probability of NK cells to express a given Ly49 receptor.</p>
<p>We further investigated the accessibility of chromatin at Ly49G Pro1 and Pro2 in WT and SLP-76 KO NK cells, by performing a chromatin immunoprecipitation for H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac), an indicative marker for open/accessible chromatin. The Pro2 loci of Ly49G is CpG poor and has been previously shown to be epigenetically regulated by H3K9Ac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref025">25</xref>]. Based on the reduction in Ly49G2 expression in SLP-76 KO NK cells, we predicted there to be less H3K9Ac and less Pro2-mediated transcription. H3K9Ac was observed at Pro2 of Ly49g but not at Ly49e (silenced in adult NK cells) in WT NK cells. Surprisingly, however, Ly49G Pro2 H3K9Ac was similar between WT and SLP-76 KO NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), perhaps suggesting that Pro2 chromatin accessibility is not sufficient to drive Ly49G expression in mature NK cells. Although the role of H3K9Ac at Pro1 is unknown, we found SLP-76 KO NK cells showed significantly decreased Ly49G Pro1 H3K9Ac compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). These data suggest that SLP-76-derived signals mainly control transcriptional activity at the Pro1 promoter and that epigenetic alterations at the Ly49 Pro1 loci may control receptor expression in mature splenic NK cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although NK cells are part of the innate immune system, NK cells exhibit many features of adaptive immune cells. Unlike T cells and B cells that create antigen specificity by genetic recombination, NK cells create diversity by expressing a seemingly “random” assortment of inhibitory and activating receptors. The various combinations of expressed receptors generate ligand-specificity, allowing subsets of NK cells to respond, expand, and differentiate into memory-like cells in a ligand-specific manner, as well as create a diverse repertoire within the NK cell pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref027">27</xref>]. However, how NK cells determine which inhibitory receptors to express on their cell surface during a narrow window of development was largely unknown. The data presented in this manuscript support a model by which NK cell activation during development drives inhibitory receptor acquisition on immature NK cells. Our model proposes that during early NK cell development, NK cells are activated via interactions between activating receptors and their ligands expressed by BM stroma. Activation of NK cells results in a signaling cascade that promotes the transcription of different Ly49/KIR genes. The NK cell acquires these receptors until a self-binding inhibitory receptor is expressed on the cell surface and blocks the activating signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002526.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Activating receptor-mediated signaling is the driving force for Ly49 receptor induction during NK cell development.</title>
<p>Activating receptors on developing NK cells are stimulated by their respective ligands via interactions with BM stromal cells. This interaction results in the activation of transcription factors that promote Ly49 receptor expression. If the Ly49 receptor that is acquired does not recognize self-MHC I, the NK cell continues to receive “positive” activating receptor signals, which increases the probability of the NK cell to acquire another Ly49 receptor. This process occurs until a self-MHC I binding Ly49 is acquired, which will dampen the activating receptor signal. This NK cell can then mature and migrate to peripheral tissues to perform “missing-self” recognition.</p>

<p>Our model potentially explains how MHC I interactions with NK cell inhibitory receptors shape the inhibitory receptor repertoire. The regulation of Ly49/KIR induction by activating receptor-derived signals provides a mechanism whereby developing NK cells can generate a ligand-specific receptor repertoire that appropriately recognizes missing self. Furthermore, the expression of a self-binding inhibitory receptor increases the functional capacity of NK cells, a process known as licensing. Thus, our model suggests that strong activating signals during NK cell development increase the likelihood of developing more functionally active licensed NK cells that can carry out missing self-recognition.</p>
<p>SLP-76 KO mice harbored an increased fraction of the most mature subset of NK cells. However, the decreased proportion of Ly49 receptor-expressing NK cells in SLP-76 KO mice could not be explained by differences in maturation, since the proportion of NK cells expressing Ly49 receptors was significantly reduced at each stage of NK cell maturation in SLP-76 KO mice. Our analysis showed that the fraction of Ly49 receptor-expressing NK cells was similar among all maturation stages except for Ly49I, which was overrepresented in the most mature NK cell subset in WT mice. Interestingly, the proportion of Ly49I-expressing NK cells was relatively preserved compared to Ly49A or Ly49G2-expressing NK cells. This could be potentially explained by the increased maturation status of SLP-76 KO NK cells, since almost all Ly49I-positive NK cells in SLP-76 KO mice resided in the most mature NK cell subset. Alternatively, self-binding Ly49 receptors such as Ly49I might drive NK cell maturation, yielding more mature NK cells in SLP-76 KO mice. Further investigation is required to understand how SLP-76-derived signals and self-MHC I binding Ly49 receptors impact NK cell maturation.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find that not all Ly49 receptor acquisition was intrinsically driven by SLP-76 signals in NK cells. While Ly49A, Ly49G2, and Ly49I were acquired in a SLP-76-dependent NK-cell intrinsic manner, Ly49C, Ly49D, and Ly49H were regulated in an NK cell-extrinsic manner. This suggests another cell type is necessary to generate a full Ly49 receptor repertoire. It is possible that myeloid lineage cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) may be responsible for NK cell activation that leads to Ly49 receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref028">28</xref>]. NK cells and DCs form stimulatory synapses, resulting in IL-12 secretion and IL-15 transpresentation. IL-12 is critical for optimal NK cell activation by DCs, and IL-15 is required for NK cell survival and Ly49 receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref029">29</xref>]. Since SLP-76 is critical for murine DC migration and cell–cell contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref030">30</xref>], the interaction of DCs with NK cells may be important for cell-extrinsic Ly49 receptor expression.</p>
<p>We previously reported that LAT1/LAT2 and ADAP can independently recruit SLP-76 to NK cell activation synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref017">17</xref>]. As both signaling pathways are required for optimal NK cell activation, we predicted that they would equally contribute to Ly49 receptor acquisition by developing NK cells. However, LAT1/LAT2 was more important for Ly49A and Ly49I, whereas ADAP contributed to Ly49G2 expression. LAT1/LAT2 signaling pathways primarily contributed to the extrinsically regulated Ly49C and partially impacted Ly49D and Ly49H. ADAP only contributed to Ly49D and Ly49H. The Ly49 receptor phenotype of ADAP KO NK cells is supported from recently published data on SLP-76<sup>ace/ace</sup> mice that contain a mutation in the SH2 domain of SLP-76, where ADAP binds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref031">31</xref>]. Perhaps, activating receptors that preferentially use either ADAP or LAT1/LAT2 to recruit SLP-76 are engaged at different times during NK cell development, leading to the expression of Ly49 receptors in a specific order. Alternatively, each Ly49 receptor Pro1 promoter may be differentially affected by the assortment of transcription factors induced by the ADAP or LAT1/LAT2 signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Alteration of the probabilistic switch function of the Ly49 Pro1 promoter provides a mechanism that explains how SLP-76 signaling could increase Ly49 receptor acquisition. Ly49 receptor expression has been shown to occur in a stochastic manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref033">33</xref>], and the probabilistic mechanism has been explained by differential binding of transcription factors to either forward or reverse promoter elements in the Pro1 bidirectional promoter. Transcription factors, such as NFκB, bind this region and are inducible following activating receptor signaling. One study has explored the role of NFκB in NK cell development and Ly49 receptor expression, but the results showed only a small decrease in the proportion of Ly49 receptor-expressing NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref034">34</xref>]. Other transcription factors, such as AML and Ets-1, are expressed in NK cell progenitors prior to Ly49 receptor transcriptional initiation, but it is possible that activation induced signals and other transcription factors contribute to the stabilization of the transcriptional landscape. For example, calcium-dependent NFAT and CREB binding sites in the Pro1 region of Ly49G2 may contribute to forward transcription. Studies examining the contribution of calcium signaling to Ly49 receptor acquisition by NK cells are currently ongoing.</p>
<p>Since Pro1 forward transcription is thought to control the accessibility of Pro2 in mature NK cells, we predicted that SLP-76 KO NK cells would exhibit decreased Pro2 chromatin accessibility as measured by H3K9Ac at Ly49G Pro2. However, we found that SLP-76 KO and WT NK cells exhibited equivalent H3K9Ac at Pro2, despite decreased Ly49G transcripts in SLP-76 KO NK cells. Instead, we found that H3K9Ac at Pro1 was almost absent in SLP-76 KO NK cells, suggesting that SLP-76-derived signals impacted Pro1 accessibility. This suggests that Pro1 accessibility might be important for Ly49 receptor transcription in mature NK cells and that Pro2 accessibility alone is insufficient to drive Ly49 transcription. This is in line with a recent report proposing that in addition to being a bidirectional switch, Pro1 may act as an enhancer for Ly49 receptor expression in mature NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref035">35</xref>]. Further studies will be required to elucidate the exact role of Pro1 H3K9Ac in control of Ly49 receptor expression.</p>
<p>SLP-76-silenced human NK cells differentiated in culture were defective in human killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) acquisition. Although the in vitro differentiation system may not precisely recapitulate human NK cell development in vivo, these data suggest that KIR acquisition might be influenced by SLP-76-dependent signals. It has recently been shown that KIR expression may be transcriptionally regulated in a manner similar to Ly49 receptors. There are promoter regions in KIRs similar to the Pro1 and Pro2 elements of <italic>Ly49</italic> genes; however, their relative location is inverted. A unidirectional promoter/enhancer is located upstream, and a proximal Pro1-like region near the transcriptional start site is methylated in nonexpressed KIRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref037">37</xref>]. The bidirectional proximal promoter has putative binding sites for transcription factors such as Sp1 and YY1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref038">38</xref>]. It is thought that the antisense transcripts generated from the proximal switch produce a small RNA that is involved in the transcriptional silencing of KIRs through methylation of the proximal promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref040">40</xref>]. The presence of a bidirectional switch in human KIRs and murine Ly49s suggests a conserved regulatory mechanism of inhibitory receptor acquisition by NK cells. Thus, our studies on activation signals driving Ly49 and KIR expression may also shed light on mechanisms by which KIRs are acquired on human NK cells.</p>
<p>Further investigation is needed to determine the exact transcription factors required for inhibitory receptor acquisition, as differences in the proximal signaling pathways suggest differential regulation of the Ly49 receptors. Nevertheless, our work highlights the complexity of Ly49 regulation. The results from this study are likely to be applicable to the regulation of human KIR receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002526.ref043">43</xref>]. Our data support a model where competing activating and inhibitory receptor signals determine the probability of inhibitory receptor expression, which ultimately shapes the inhibitory receptor repertoire during NK cell development and creates appropriate ligand-specific diversity within the NK cell pool.</p>
