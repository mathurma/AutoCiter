        <p>Most genomes of bacteria contain toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems. These gene systems encode a toxic protein and its cognate antitoxin. Upon antitoxin degradation, the toxin induces cell stasis or death. TA systems have been linked with numerous functions, including growth modulation, genome maintenance, and stress response. Members of the epsilon/zeta TA family are found throughout the genomes of pathogenic bacteria and were shown not only to stabilize resistance plasmids but also to promote virulence. The broad distribution of epsilon/zeta systems implies that zeta toxins utilize a ubiquitous bacteriotoxic mechanism. However, whereas all other TA families known to date poison macromolecules involved in translation or replication, the target of zeta toxins remained inscrutable. We used in vivo techniques such as microscropy and permeability assays to show that pneumococcal zeta toxin PezT impairs cell wall synthesis and triggers autolysis in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Subsequently, we demonstrated in vitro that zeta toxins in general phosphorylate the ubiquitous peptidoglycan precursor uridine diphosphate-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (UNAG) and that this activity is counteracted by binding of antitoxin. After identification of the product we verified the kinase activity in vivo by analyzing metabolite extracts of cells poisoned by PezT using high pressure liquid chromatograpy (HPLC). We further show that phosphorylated UNAG inhibitis MurA, the enzyme catalyzing the initial step in bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Additionally, we provide what is to our knowledge the first crystal structure of a zeta toxin bound to its substrate. We show that zeta toxins are novel kinases that poison bacteria through global inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis. This provides a fundamental understanding of how epsilon/zeta TA systems stabilize mobile genetic elements. Additionally, our results imply a mechanism that connects activity of zeta toxin PezT to virulence of pneumococcal infections. Finally, we discuss how phosphorylated UNAG likely poisons additional pathways of bacterial cell wall synthesis, making it an attractive lead compound for development of new antibiotics.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Most bacteria harbor toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems, in which a bacterial toxin is rendered inactive under resting conditions by its antitoxin counterpart. Under conditions of stress, however, the antitoxin is degraded, freeing the toxin to attack its host bacterium. One such TA system, PezAT, has been difficult to study in the past because the PezT toxin is so toxic without its antitoxin counterpart that bacteria die before any useful measurements can be made. Here, we use a truncated version of PezT that kills bacteria more slowly than normal, allowing us to examine the mechanisms of how this TA system operates. We find that zeta toxins convert an essential building block of bacterial cell walls (known as UNAG) into a form that prevents normal cell wall growth, causing distortions in bacterial shape that leave the bacteria vulnerable to the hydrostatic pressure of its contents. Consequently, the bacteria burst, similar to what happens when they are treated with penicillin. These results may serve useful for designing new antibiotics. Additionally, our results support the hypothesis that activation of PezT during bacterial infections may be a method by which rapidly growing bacteria can instigate a suicide program, which would promote the release of virulence factors that facilitate spread of infections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Almost all prokaryotic genomes encode toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Pandey1">[1]</xref>. These loci consist of bicistronic operons that encode for a bacterial toxin and its cognate inhibitor, which neutralizes the toxin under dormant conditions. Once de novo synthesis from the operon is impaired, continuous proteolytic degradation of the antitoxin eventually releases the toxin and, depending on the functional mechanism, induces cell stasis or cell death. Thus, TA systems have been linked with numerous cellular functions, including programmed cell death, maintenance of mobile genetic elements, stress response, persistence, and biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Gerdes1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Nariya1">[5]</xref>. To understand how TA systems fulfill such a variety of tasks, it is crucial to unravel the molecular principles that define the mode of action of the toxins. Moreover, understanding these systems is likely to disclose new strategies for the development of antibiotic agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-EngelbergKulka1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Williams1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Members of the epsilon/zeta TA family have been shown to stabilize resistance plasmids in major human pathogens such as <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Zielenkiewicz1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Schwarz1">[10]</xref>. The epsilon/zeta system is encoded from a bicistronic operon, which is regulated by the repressor protein omega <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Camacho1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-delaHoz1">[13]</xref>. Upon failure of epsilon biosynthesis, the zeta toxin is released from epsilon by continuous antitoxin degradation through AAA+ proteases. Eventually, zeta becomes freed, leading to cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Camacho1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Lioy1">[14]</xref>. In addition to these plasmid-encoded epsilon/zeta systems, chromosomally encoded systems (PezAT for pneumococcal epsilon/zeta) have recently been identified on different integrative and conjugative elements of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Brown1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>. PezT and zeta toxins share 42% sequence identity and are structurally highly homologous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>. In contrast, the antitoxin PezA is a multidomain protein and its C-terminal domain is similar to epsilon in its primary as well as tertiary structure. Although, the N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain of PezA acts similarly to the omega protein as a transcription repressor, the proteins are not evolutionaryily related <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>. The epsilon/zeta and the PezAT system form similar heterotetrameric complexes in which two antitoxin molecules inhibit two toxins. In addition to these pronounced structural similarities, mutational studies have shown that the two systems are functionally equivalent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Meinhart1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PezAT systems are found encoded on pneumococcal pathogenicity islands that support their host with virulence factors and resistance to different antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Brown1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>. Notably, the PezT toxin of such systems was reported to accelerate the progression of pneumococcal infections, implying a role as a possible virulence factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Brown2">[19]</xref>. Although epsilon/zeta systems were thought to be exclusively found in Gram-positive bacteria, recent reports have described homologous systems in Gram-negative pathogens such as <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> and enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> B7A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Pachulec1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-VanMelderen1">[21]</xref>. The broad distribution of epsilon/zeta TA systems within the bacterial kingdom suggests that they utilize a ubiquitous bacteriotoxic mechanism. Structures of zeta toxins as well as mutational studies suggested that their toxicity is connected to an ATP-dependent phosphorylation event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Meinhart1">[18]</xref>. However, whereas all other TA systems known to date poison macromolecules involved in translation or replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Liu1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Critchlow1">[26]</xref>, the target of the cytosolic zeta toxin family remained inscrutable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Zielenkiewicz1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Lioy1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Nowakowska1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we reveal the mechanism used by zeta toxins to induce programmed cell death in bacteria. Since expression of wild-type zeta toxins leads to either instantaneous cell death or spontaneous mutation of the open reading frame <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Zielenkiewicz1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Nowakowska1">[27]</xref>, we established a system with which we could follow formation of the toxic phenotype at moderate time scales. This system enabled us to show that zeta toxins provoke an autolytic phenotype as a consequence of impaired cell wall integrity and breakdown of the osmotic barrier. We found that zeta toxins represent a novel family of kinases that manipulate a central metabolic branch point of bacterial cell wall synthesis. The crystal structure of a zeta toxin bound to its target allowed us to map the enzyme–substrate interactions and revealed that the kinase activity is indeed responsible for the toxic function in vivo. In fact, we were able to show that the phosphorylated product inhibits MurA, the enzyme responsible for the first step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacteria.</p>

        <title>PezT Expression Kills Cells during Division</title>
        <p>Genetic manipulations of the full-length zeta or homologous PezT toxins without the cognate antitoxin are unfeasible because of the high toxicity of the proteins. Moreover, toxin variants that can be isolated from surviving clones are generally inactive because of spontaneous mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Zielenkiewicz1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>. We found that a carboxy-terminally truncated variant lacking the last 11 amino acids (PezTΔC<sub>242</sub>, henceforth referred to simply as PezT) can be stably maintained in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Importantly, sequencing of the plasmid DNA isolated from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells after prolonged expression experiments showed that this variant did not accumulate any spontaneous mutations. Nevertheless, this variant still retained the toxic phenotype. Half an hour after induction of PezT expression, we found that the cells in such cultures formed midcell-positioned bulges following membrane permeabilization and lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g001">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s001">S1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s001">S1B</xref>). Notably, cells that had survived to that point were apparently unable to undergo cytokinesis, even though chromosome replication was complete (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). One hour after induction, massive cell death had occurred and the few intact cells that remained were characterized by small size and an ovoid morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the observed phenotype is due to general overexpression, we performed control experiments with cells bearing the expression plasmid of the nontoxic variant PezT (D66T) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>. We did not observe bulge formation or lysis after induction of PezT (D66T) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the observed phenotype was caused by the specific action of PezT.</p>

        <title>PezT Inhibits Cell Wall Synthesis</title>
        <p>Lysis through bulge formation implied that cells poisoned by PezT suffered from defects in their cell wall integrity. Bacterial growth and binary fission demand a tightly controlled balance between murein synthesis and degradation. Perturbations of this balance are known to cause uncontrolled peptidoglycan degradation by murein hydrolases following lysis because of the intracellular turgor pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Holtje1">[28]</xref>. Since PezT appeared to kill cells predominantly prior to cytokinesis, which requires the build-up of septal murein, we speculated that the toxin targets cell wall synthesis. To test this hypothesis, we induced toxin expression in adherently growing cultures, which are less exposed to osmotic and mechanic stress than liquid cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Pitzurra1">[29]</xref>. One hour after induction, we observed that these cells adopted a bloated, misshapen morphology that was clearly different from the normal rod-like shape of cells expressing nontoxic PezT (D66T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In fact, these cells resembled spheroplasts that form after treatment with β-lactam antibiotics such as ampicillin, which are authentic inhibitors of bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Goodell1">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To further corroborate our hypothesis that PezT targets cell wall synthesis, we probed whether toxin expression resembles β-lactam treatment in general. We found that the onset of cell death caused by PezT expression was preceded by a strong rise in membrane permeability, by measuring influx kinetics of the membrane-impermeable dye propidium iodide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Eventually, membrane permeability increased enough to allow the 31-kDa periplasmatic ribonculease I to enter the cytosol, resulting in massive rRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). Strikingly, we could provoke almost identical characteristics of cell death in <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing nontoxic PezT (D66T) by additional treatment of the culture with ampicillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s001">S1F</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe any of these symptoms when cells were treated with tetracycline, which solely targets protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s001">S1F</xref>).</p>
        <p>In summary, we concluded that the toxic mechanism of PezT causes inhibition of cell wall synthesis that eventually provokes bacterial autolysis. Nevertheless, the identity of the molecular target of PezT remained enigmatic, since inhibition of cytosolic steps of bacterial cell wall synthesis can occur on a multitude of levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Bugg1">[31]</xref>.

This suggested the presence of a putative ubiquitous substrate whose modification by the toxins corrupts a shared metabolic branch point found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Such a fundamental metabolite is uridine diphosphate-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (UNAG), which is produced in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and is found in all kingdoms of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Durand1">[33]</xref>. This nucleotide sugar is essential for the formation of a plethora of glycoconjugates, among them the peptidoglycan macromolecule in prokaryotes.

        <title>Zeta Toxins Phosphorylate the Cell Wall Precursor UNAG</title>
        <p>Given the structural similarity of PezT and zeta toxins with phosphotransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Meinhart1">[18]</xref>, we speculated that they modify UNAG by phosphorylation. Therefore, we purified our toxic PezT variant from poisoned <italic>E. coli</italic> and probed its activity in vitro. Indeed, using anion exchange chromatography, we observed an ATP- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modification of UNAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s002">S2A–S2C</xref>). In addition to adenosine diphosphate formation, we noticed a product that was more negatively charged than the substrate UNAG and that eluted close to the remaining ATP. This strongly suggested that the PezT toxin had phosphorylated UNAG. We could exclude that the observed UNAG modification was the result of a contaminating activity, since addition of stoichiometric amounts of the cognate antitoxin PezA completely inhibited turnover of both UNAG and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s002">S2B</xref>). Further, we showed that the PezT activity was specific for the presence of the 2′-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl group on the sugar moiety and the stereoisomeric form of UNAG, since selectivity for uridine diphosphate (UDP)–glucose and UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine was dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s002">Figure S2E and S2F</xref>). Most importantly, we also showed that the zeta toxin from <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> can catalyze the same reaction as PezT and modifies UNAG using ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

        <p>We investigated next whether PezT indeed phosphorylates UNAG.

        <title>Toxicity Is Caused by the UNAG Kinase Activity</title>
        <p>Site directed mutagenesis studies of PezT and zeta toxins yielded several inactive toxin variants that have been linked with binding of the at-that-time-unknown substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Meinhart1">[18]</xref>. We therefore were interested in a structural characterization of a toxin bound to the substrate. Previous structural reports on epsilon/zeta and PezAT complexes showed that the toxin is structurally similar to poly- and mononucleotide kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Meinhart1">[18]</xref>. Based on these findings, the active site of zeta and PezT toxin has been identified and a mechanism of toxin inhibition has been proposed. Once bound to the antitoxin, side chain groups of the antitoxin block the ATP binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Meinhart1">[18]</xref>. The second substrate binding site, however, remains unaffected by the antitoxin. Thus, we surmised that PezT and zeta toxins are still able to bind UNAG even if they are inhibited by the antitoxin. Indeed, we could determine the crystal structure of the epsilon/zeta TA complex from <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> bound to UNAG at 2.7 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s004">Figure S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s008">Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>UNAG binds to a deep cleft at the molecular surface of the zeta toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The side chain group of Asp67 forms a hydrogen bond (3.2 Å) to the 3′-hydroxyl group of the amino sugar moiety of UNAG. Based on superposition with structurally related phosphotransferases, this particular side chain of the zeta toxin had been suggested to be the catalytic base, which deprotonates the substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Meinhart1">[18]</xref>. For PezT toxin, Asp66 is the functionally equivalent residue, and, as mentioned above, its mutation to a threonine residue totally abolishes toxicity. Since we could not detect any activity of PezT (D66T) in our kinase assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s002">Figure S2D</xref>), we conclude that the phosphoryltransfer reaction is required for the bacteriotoxic mechanism of zeta toxins. Thr118 of the zeta toxin formed a hydrogen bond with an oxygen atom of the β-phosphate group of UNAG (2.8 Å), and exchange of this conserved residue in the PezT toxin to a valine residue also yielded a nontoxic variant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>. The conserved Thr121, which is in close proximity to the bound UNAG but did not contact the substrate directly, has been shown to interfere with toxicity of PezT only mildly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Khoo1">[17]</xref>. Additional specific contacts between the zeta toxin and UNAG are electrostatic interactions of Arg120 with the phosphate groups of UDP. Apart from van der Waals interactions, specific hydrogen bonds are formed between Thr128 and the uracil base and between Glu100 and the 2′-hydroxyl group of the UDP ribose. Most likely, mutations of these residues will affect toxicity as well. Thus, our data show that UNAG binding by the zeta toxin is mediated by residues that yield nontoxic and kinase-deficient zeta and PezT variants in vivo and in vitro.</p>

        <p>Modification of the amino sugar 3′-hydroxyl group by PezT and zeta toxins suggests several possible scenarios by which UNAG-3P can interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis. One of these is inhibition of the conserved enolpyruvyl transferase MurA, which catalyzes the initial step of muramic acid synthesis. Subsequent to the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, MurA modifies the amino sugar 3′-hydroxyl group of UNAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and thereby provides the starting point for peptidoglycan biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Barreteau1">[34]</xref>.</p>

            <p>(A) MurA performs the first step of UDP-muramic acid biosynthesis. After sequential binding of UNAG and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a tetrahedral intermediate is formed that yields enolpyruvyl-UNAG after cleavage of inorganic phosphate. UNAG-3P most likely mimics this tetrahedral intermediate and thereby inhibits MurA catalysis by competitive inhibition. (B) MurA is able to transfer the enolpyruvyl moiety from phosphoenolpyruvate (1 mM) to UNAG (black) but not UNAG-3P (red). MurA enzyme kinetics were followed by coupling the reaction to phosphate-dependent cleavage of fluorescent 7-methylguanosine by nucleoside phosphorylase, resulting in a decrease in fluorescence at 400 nm (λ<sub>exc</sub> = 300 nm).

        <p>MurA catalyzes the transfer of the enolpyruvyl moiety of phosphoenolpyruvate to the 3′-hydroxyl group of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine, forming enolpyruvyl-UNAG and inorganic phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Due to modification of the 3′-hydroxyl group by the phosphate group, we speculated that MurA would be unable to utilize UNAG-3P, which renders the phosphorylated nucleotide sugar unusable for peptidoglycan synthesis. Indeed, we did not observe any MurA-dependent turnover of UNAG once it had been phosphorylated by PezT in an in vitro activity assay designed to measure the release of inorganic phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>During the native reaction of MurA, a negatively charged tetrahedral adduct is formed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Eschenburg1">[35]</xref>. Because of the resemblance of the MurA tetrahedral intermediate and UNAG-3P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), we hypothesized that UNAG-3P could bind to MurA in a fashion similar to that of the normal substrate UNAG. In this hypothesis zeta toxins would not only produce a stable dead-end metabolite but would also halt cell wall synthesis directly by inhibition of MurA. In fact, we found that increasing UNAG-3P concentrations decreased the apparent turnover rate of UNAG by MurA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This strongly suggests that UNAG-3P binds to MurA, forming an inactive, non-productive complex. Furthermore, we observed that increasing UNAG-3P concentrations led to an increase of the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of MurA for UNAG without affecting the maximal reaction rate <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> when we analyzed the initial rate of product formation at varying UNAG and UNAG-3P concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This implies that the phosphate group of UNAG-3P mimics the tetrahedral intermediate during MurA catalysis and is a reversible inhibitor that eliminates turnover of phosphenolpyruvate via the modification of the 3′-hydroxyl group of the <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine moiety. The Michaelis-Menten dataset could be fitted globally by a competitive inhibition mechanism that yielded a <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> of 7 µM for UNAG-3P in the presence of physiological concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, zeta toxins not only produce a metabolic dead-end product but additionally form a competitive inhibitor for peptidoglycan synthesis.</p>

        <title>Slow Growth Protects Cells from Toxin-Induced Autolysis</title>
        <p>Most antibiotics that target peptidoglycan synthesis are known to rapidly kill bacteria during exponential growth but fail to kill slowly growing and stationary cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Tuomanen1">[36]</xref>. Therefore, we considered whether slow growth was also an option to evade cell killing through the mechanism utilized by zeta toxins. When we induced toxin expression at low optical densities, where the general growth rate was rapid, we observed the lytic phenotype described above. In contrast, induction of PezT in cells approaching stationary phase did not result in lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This indicated that UNAG-3P was predominantly toxic for fast-dividing cells, whereas the toxic effect was less severe for cells proliferating more slowly. In order to provoke slow growth, we grew cells in a nutritionally deprived medium. Generally, cells growing in such a medium were much smaller and had an increased doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g006">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s006">S6A</xref>). As expected, lysis caused by PezT expression in nutritionally deprived medium was less severe and observable only after induction at the lowest optical density tested (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We could exclude that this finding was caused by differential expression levels of PezT as the cytosolic concentrations of the recombinant protein were comparable to those of cultures grown in fresh Luria broth (LB) medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). When we inspected cells of cultures surviving toxin expression in nutritionally deprived medium 3 h after induction, the majority of cells had accumulated membrane protrusions and lost their characteristic rod-like shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, PezT was still performing its disruptive activity within peptidoglycan metabolism. However, under the growth conditions tested, the damage done to the cell wall was not sufficient for autolysis of the majority of cells. Therefore, we conclude that minimizing the demand on cell wall precursors through small size and slow growth enables bacteria to survive toxin action for an extended period of time.</p>

      <p>The mechanism of how epsilon/zeta TA systems kill their host cell has remained a mystery to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Zielenkiewicz1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Lioy1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Nowakowska1">[27]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of PezT induces defects in cell wall integrity and eventually causes bacterial autolysis in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. We show that PezT and zeta toxins define a previously unknown family of kinases that phosphorylate the nucleotide sugar UNAG with high specificity at the 3′-hydroxyl group of the <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine moiety. We found that this modification blocks further utilization of the nucleotide sugar for muropeptide synthesis and thereby creates a stable dead-end product that accumulates intracellularly. We further showed that the formation of UNAG-3P yields a potent inhibitor of the enzyme MurA, which synthesizes the first committed step of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Thus, zeta toxins and PezT are to our knowledge the first toxins of TA systems that can be shown to directly target cell wall synthesis. This explains our finding that PezT causes death of primarily fast-growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells requiring significant murein synthesis during elongation and division.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Additional Points of Attack for PezT and Zeta Toxins</title>
        <p>The synthesis of muramic acids is regulated by a negative feedback loop in which MurA is inhibited by its downstream product UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramic acid in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Mizyed1">[37]</xref>. Thus, PezT and zeta toxin activity impairs muramic acid synthesis in two different ways: first, it depletes the pool of UNAG precursors and, second, UNAG-3P is a competitive inhibitor of MurA. Thus, increasing UNAG-3P levels favor UNAG-3P production by inhibition of the competing murein synthesis pathway. UNAG-3P will interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis in Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, since MurA is highly conserved among prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Barreteau1">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, since UNAG is an essential precursor for teichoic and lipoteichoic acid synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Swoboda1">[38]</xref>, formation of UNAG-3P is also likely to be detrimental to their synthesis. UNAG phosphorylation will also compete with lipid A synthesis of Gram-negative bacteria, since condensation of the lipid anchor and UNAG is performed via the amino sugar 3′-hydroxyl group of UNAG. Thus, zeta toxins ubiquitously interfere with synthesis of a variety of cell wall components, independent of the cell wall architecture, and cells harboring an epsilon/zeta or PezAT TA system are provided with a potent killing system.</p>

        <title>Are PezT and Zeta Toxins Always Fatal to the Host?</title>
        <p>UNAG is an abundant metabolite in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Namboori1">[39]</xref>, and we therefore do not expect the activity of PezT and zeta toxins to immediately kill the host. This is in agreement with the previous finding that depending on the dose and exposure time to free toxin, its activity either leads to growth arrest or cell lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Lioy1">[14]</xref>. We argue that the toxin acts as a killer when the toxin activation rages out of control. Such a situation is realized when, for instance, a plasmid encoding an epsilon/zeta system TA is lost and the zeta toxin is released via degradation of the epsilon antitoxin. Moreover, we speculate that the bactericidal action of zeta toxin release will be higher during fast growth, when cells are more vulnerable to inhibition of cell wall synthesis. This matches our finding that cells react differently to the toxin activity, depending on the environmental conditions. We surmise that cells can readjust their cell wall metabolism during situations where toxin activation is temporary and reversible, for instance during transcriptional or translational arrest. Our in vivo experiments suggest that a subpopulation of cells can adapt to the drain in cell wall precursor components by adopting a state of dwarfism paired with slow growth. Such different scenarios can explain the unresolved ambiguity as to why zeta toxins perform postsegregational killing in one situation or trigger cell stasis in another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Zielenkiewicz1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Lioy1">[14]</xref>.</p>

Intriguingly, pneumolysin is located in the cytosol of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and requires a bacteriolytic activity in order to be released into the lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Guiral1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Martner1">[43]</xref>. It is therefore tempting to speculate that pneumococcal strains bearing a PezAT gene cassette are equipped with an additional option to trigger lysis and pneumolysin release in a subpopulation of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

            <title>Model for the function of the pneumococcal PezAT systems during infection.</title>
            <p>Stress conditions lead to release of the UNAG kinase PezT via degradation of the antitoxin PezA. PezT converts the cellular pool of UNAG to UNAG-3P, which leads to inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis and competes with the synthesis of other glycoconjugates. Metabolically silent persister cells as well as slowly dividing cells will survive PezT release. In contrast, cells that require fully functional murein synthesis, such as rapidly dividing cells, will undergo lysis and release cytosolic pneumolysin, a major virulence factor of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Berry1">[55]</xref>. Moreover, partial autolysis and the general inhibition of capsular polysaccharide synthesis by UNAG-3P will favor biofilm formation. Cells surviving PezT release will eventually recover by production of PezA in absence of the stress conditions.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Release of PezT toxin from PezA antitoxin might appear under conditions that lead to either prolonged down-regulation of protein biosynthesis or enhanced PezA degradation. Similar to other TA systems, down-regulation of PezA biosynthesis could occur, for instance, during antibiotic treatment or amino acid starvation, when general transcription or translation is impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Nieto1">[44]</xref>. Under these conditions, constant proteolytic degradation of PezA by constitutive proteases would eventually activate PezT. On the other hand, different TA systems within a single host were shown to be specifically activated under different stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Ramage1">[45]</xref>. Whereas in case of the epsilon/zeta system, constant degradation of epsilon by the constitutive protease Lon and ClpXP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Lioy1">[14]</xref> leads to toxin activation, PezT release seems not to be performed by a housekeeping protease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Mutschler1">[46]</xref>. Thus, it is rather likely, that activation of the PezAT system in its host organism is tightly controlled and requires a specific event such as stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Mutschler1">[46]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The ability of TA systems to induce cell lysis or cell stasis has also been linked to biofilm and persister cell formation in pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Lewis1">[47]</xref>. Biofilm formation of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, for example, is thought to be initiated by the formation of cell aggregates that require autolysis of a subpopulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Havarstein1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Moscoso1">[49]</xref>. Most probably, moderate activation of PezT and zeta toxins will support autolysis of rapidly dividing cells, and thus PezT and zeta toxins can be beneficial for the entire cellular population despite the suicide of individual cells. Cells with reduced metabolism and growth, such as persisters, might survive the toxins' activity and are thus selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001033-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Additionally, UNAG-3P formation is also likely to interfere with hyaluronic acid capsulation of streptococci, which needs to be down-regulated and reduced during biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-MunozElias1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001033-Domenech1">[51]</xref>, since condensation of the polysaccharide in this pathway is linked via the amino sugar 3′-hydroxyl group of UNAG. Eventually, survivors will be protected in a biofilm and can recover from stress conditions and toxin activation by synthesis of new cognate antitoxin.</p>

        <title>Concluding Remarks</title>
        <p>UNAG-3P is a suicide antibiotic, because bacteria are harmed by their self-inflicted enzymatic activity depending on environmental conditions. This is in contrast to common antibiotics that bacteria produce and target against other species. Additionally, UNAG-3P is a naturally derived lead compound for the development of novel antibiotics. Our results imply that either activation or inhibition of epsilon/zeta and PezAT systems will interfere with the fate of the host bacteria and thus make them a potent Achilles' heel for microbes.</p>

        <p>For microscopy, cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) bearing pET28b(<italic>pezTΔC<sub>242</sub></italic>) or pET28b(<italic>pezTΔC<sub>242</sub>(D66T)</italic>) were grown in 100 ml of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 µg/ml) at 37°C in unbaffled flasks with mild shaking. Protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG to 1 mM at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4. To evaluate the effects of toxin expression on cell membrane integrity, the BacLight live/dead bacterial viability kit (Molecular Probes) was used according to the supplier's instructions. Phase contrast and fluorescence images were captured with a ProgRes C3 CCD camera (Jenoptic) on an Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss) using an oil immersion objective lens (100×/N.A. 1.3). The viability of the culture was assessed using filters with 450-nm to 490-nm excitation and 520-nm long pass emission for green fluorescence (live) or 545-nm band pass excitation and 590-nm long pass emission for red fluorescence (dead). To additionally improve visualization of membrane defects, 200 µl of culture was withdrawn and immediately fixed in 1 ml of a 1∶3 (<italic>v/v</italic>) mixture of acetic acid and methanol. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.9% (<italic>w/v</italic>) NaCl, and spotted on an LB agar slab. Subsequently, cells were inspected by phase contrast microscopy using an Axiovert 405M (Zeiss) equipped with a 100×/N.A. 1.25 oil immersion objective lens. Adherent cultures were derived from a liquid culture grown overnight and surviving PezTΔC<sub>242</sub> expression. Cells were spotted on a microscope slide covered with LB agar and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Protein expression was induced by diffusion of IPTG into the agar drop sandwiched between cover slides and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37°C before inspection. Unfixed cells were inspected directly by phase contrast microscopy as described above. Equivalent growth experiments using preconditioned LB medium are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001033.s009">Text S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>To measure time-resolved breakdown of the osmotic barrier, cells were grown in LB medium at 37°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2 in absence of any inducing agent. Next, 75 µl of culture was diluted with an equal volume of LB containing 1 mM IPTG and 20 µM propidium iodide. Control cultures expressing PezT (D66T) were additionally supplemented with ampicillin (50 µg/ml) or tetracycline (15 µg/ml). Samples for baseline correction were not inoculated with bacteria. All samples were transferred to a black 96-well microtiter plate (Corning) and were incubated at 37°C on a Thermomixer comfort (Eppendorf) equipped with a MTP sample holder. Breakdown of the osmotic barrier and staining of cytosolic DNA/RNA was monitored by measuring fluorescence at 620 nm in a Varioskan Flash (Thermo Scientific) with fluorescence excitation set to 520 nm at 20-min intervals. The optical density was recorded from the same samples in absorbance mode. Between measurements, the microtiter plates were covered with an AirPore tape sheet (Qiagen). For each time series, fluorescence intensities were baseline corrected and averaged (<italic>n</italic> = 6).

Note that the band labeled with an asterisk, which is prominent exclusively in cells grown in preconditioned medium, was identified to be chloramphenicol acetyltransferase by peptide mass fingerprint analysis. The same samples were analyzed by a Western blot, which detected the C-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag of the PezT proteins (lower panel).</p>
