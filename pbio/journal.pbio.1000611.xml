<p>The localization of ash mRNA in yeast requires the binding of She2p and the myosin adaptor protein She3p to its localization element, which is highly specific and leads to the assembly of stable transport complexes.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>In eukaryotes, hundreds of mRNAs are localized by specialized transport complexes. For localization, transcripts are recognized by RNA-binding proteins and incorporated into motor-containing messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). To date, the molecular assembly of such mRNPs is not well understood and most details on cargo specificity remain unresolved. We used <italic>ASH1</italic>-mRNA transport in yeast to provide a first assessment of where and how localizing mRNAs are specifically recognized and incorporated into mRNPs. By using in vitro–interaction and reconstitution assays, we found that none of the implicated mRNA-binding proteins showed highly specific cargo binding. Instead, we identified the cytoplasmic myosin adapter She3p as additional RNA-binding protein. We further found that only the complex of the RNA-binding proteins She2p and She3p achieves synergistic cargo binding, with an at least 60-fold higher affinity for localizing mRNAs when compared to control RNA. Mutational studies identified a C-terminal RNA-binding fragment of She3p to be important for synergistic RNA binding with She2p. The observed cargo specificity of the ternary complex is considerably higher than previously reported for localizing mRNAs. It suggests that RNA binding for mRNP localization generally exhibits higher selectivity than inferred from previous in vitro data. This conclusion is fully consistent with a large body of in vivo evidence from different organisms. Since the ternary yeast complex only assembles in the cytoplasm, specific mRNA recognition might be limited to the very last steps of mRNP assembly. Remarkably, the mRNA itself triggers the assembly of mature, motor-containing complexes. Our reconstitution of a major portion of the mRNA-transport complex offers new and unexpected insights into the molecular assembly of specific, localization-competent mRNPs and provides an important step forward in our mechanistic understanding of mRNA localization in general.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, the majority of cells are asymmetric and a way to establish such polarity is directional transport of macromolecules along cytoskeletal filaments. Among the cargoes transported, mRNAs play an essential role, as their localized translation contributes significantly to the generation of asymmetry. To date, hundreds of asymmetrically localized mRNAs in various organisms have been identified. These mRNAs are recognized by RNA-binding proteins and incorporated into large motor-containing messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) whose molecular assembly is poorly understood. In this study, we used the well-characterized process of <italic>ASH1</italic>-mRNA transport in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to address the question of how localizing mRNAs are recognized and specifically incorporated into mRNPs. Surprisingly, we found that the previously implicated mRNA-binding proteins She2p and Puf6p do not bind to cargo mRNAs with high specificity. Instead, the cytoplasmic motor-adapter protein She3p is responsible for synergistic cargo binding with She2p and for the stable incorporation of specific localizing mRNA into the transport complex. We propose that the specific recognition of localizing mRNAs happens at the very last step of cytoplasmic mRNP maturation. Other organisms might employ similar mechanisms to establish cellular polarity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, directional transport and localization of mRNA is widely used to regulate gene expression on a temporal and spatial level. mRNA localization is involved in diverse processes such as inducing cellular asymmetry, guiding key events during embryonic development, and supporting synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-ShavTal1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Paquin1">[4]</xref>. For these processes, motor-containing mRNPs usually translocate translationally silent transcripts from perinuclear areas to their subcellular destination. After anchoring, mRNA translation is activated and encoded proteins are produced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-StJohnston1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Paquin1">[4]</xref>. To date, the basic principles underlying the incorporation of mRNAs into translocating particles, the specific roles of mRNP-core factors, and subsequent mRNA localization are not well understood. Thus, a detailed analysis is required on how mRNA-translocation particles assemble and how RNA-cargo specificity is achieved.</p>
<p>A study on the localization of <italic>Vg1</italic> and <italic>VegT</italic> RNPs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes already showed marked differences between the nuclear and cytoplasmic protein composition of these RNPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Kress1">[5]</xref>. By using immunoprecipitation experiments on cell extracts and antibody stainings, the authors demonstrated that factors sequentially join the maturing complex on its path from the oocyte nucleus to the cytoplasmic vegetal pole. Comparably little biochemical data are available explaining how mRNPs recognize their cargo-transcripts in a specific way. Available studies only revealed a 3–7-fold higher affinity for localizing mRNAs when compared to non-localizing RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Dienstbier1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Du1">[7]</xref>. Because such rather small differences are unlikely to explain the highly selective transport of RNAs observed in vivo, it seems obvious that essential information on the assembly of specific transport complexes is missing. The goal of the present work was to understand such general principles by in vitro reconstituting a major part of a core mRNA-transport complex from yeast and complementing in vivo studies.</p>
<p>During mitosis of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA is transported as part of large mRNPs from the mother cell to the daughter cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Paquin1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mller1">[8]</xref>. <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA contains four <italic>cis</italic>-acting regions, termed zip-code elements E1, E2A, E2B, and E3, mediating mRNA incorporation into the mRNPs and its subsequent localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chartrand1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Gonzalez1">[10]</xref>. After mRNP anchoring, <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA is translated in the daughter cell. The protein product Ash1p acts as a repressor of mating-type switching exclusively in the daughter cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bobola1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Sil1">[12]</xref>. In addition to <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA, more than 30 transcripts are localized by this transport complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shepard1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Oeffinger1">[15]</xref>. Their incorporation into the mRNP is thought to be mediated by its core RNA-binding protein She2p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Kruse1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Long1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>She2p is an unusual RNA-binding protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Niessing1">[19]</xref>. It interacts with <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA already in the nucleus at the site of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen1">[20]</xref> and escorts it into the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Du1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Kruse1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen2">[21]</xref>. After nuclear export, the She2p-<italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA complex binds to the stable cytoplasmic co-complex of the myosin-adapter She3p and the type V myosin motor Myo4p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Long1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mnchow1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Dunn1">[26]</xref>. Recent actin-gliding assays with mRNPs purified from yeast extracts showed that a core complex consisting of Myo4p, She3p, She2p, and a shortened <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA element has motile activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chung1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to this cytoplasmic core mRNP, the RNA-binding proteins Puf6p and Khd1p associate with the <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA-She2p complex and are required for efficient <italic>ASH1</italic>-mRNA localization in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Deng1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Paquin2">[30]</xref>. Whereas the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein Puf6p binds to <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3, cytoplasmic Khd1p interacts with a region encompassing <italic>ASH1</italic>-E1 RNA. Both proteins are involved in translational repression during transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Deng1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Paquin2">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Among all these factors, She2p is the only RNA-binding protein known to bind to all four zip-code elements of the <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chartrand1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Gonzalez1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chartrand2">[31]</xref> and to be part of the core-transport complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chung1">[27]</xref>. She2p is therefore believed to mediate the specific incorporation of localizing mRNAs into the <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNP. To date, it is unclear how She2p mediates this function.</p>
<p>Since the <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 zip code alone can mediate efficient mRNA localization in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chung1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chartrand2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Irie1">[32]</xref>, we concentrated our reconstitution studies on this element. Because Khd1p does not interact with the E3 element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Irie1">[32]</xref>, we excluded this protein from our study.</p>
<p>We found that She2p and Puf6p bind to zip-code elements only with moderately higher affinity than to unrelated RNAs. This raised the question of when and how specificity for mRNP transport is achieved. We further discovered that the myosin adapter She3p is a previously uncharacterized RNA-binding protein. It interacts directly with She2p also in absence of RNA. Addition of zip code containing RNAs results in the formation of highly specific ternary complexes. This specific mRNP has an at least 60-fold higher affinity for zip-code RNAs. Furthermore, incorporation of the RNA increases the interaction between She2p and She3p to a similar extent. Since we find She3p exclusively in the cytoplasm, we propose that highly specific mRNA recognition occurs after nuclear export and is coupled to the assembly of mature, motor-containing transport complexes.</p>

<title>She2p Binds to Unrelated Stem-Loop RNAs</title>
<p>Previous studies showed that She2p (Gene ID: 853728) binds to all four zip-code elements of the <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA (Gene ID: 853650) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chartrand1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Gonzalez1">[10]</xref>. It also binds to the zip-code element of <italic>EAR1</italic> mRNA (Gene ID: 855207) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shepard1">[13]</xref> and to the 5′ zip-code element (<italic>WSC2N</italic>) of <italic>WSC2</italic> mRNA (Gene ID: 855438) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shepard1">[13]</xref>. The equilibrium-dissociation constants (Kd) of She2p binding to these elements are all in the nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, left table) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mller2">[33]</xref>. The strongest binding with a Kd of 0.10 µM was observed for the most 3′-located E3 element of the <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA and the weakest binding for the <italic>EAR1</italic> zip-code element (Kd = 0.77 µM). No binding was detected to an unstructured Poly-A<sub>20</sub> RNA or the MS2-stem-loop RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mller2">[33]</xref>. However, we had previously also observed considerable She2p binding to the stem-loop containing RNA HIV-1 TAR (16 mer) (Kd = 0.91 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, left table) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Du1">[7]</xref>. We therefore wondered whether this binding to an unrelated RNA is an exception or constitutes a more general feature of She2p.</p>

<title>Interaction studies with Puf6p, She2p, and RNA.</title>
<p>(A) RNA-binding studies with She2p. Left table summarizes previously published results of RNA filter-binding assays. Numbers in parentheses indicate respective references. Right table summarizes filter-binding assays with control RNAs performed in this study. The data indicate that She2p binds to localizing RNAs and control RNAs with only a modest difference in Kd. (B) EMSAs show binding of Puf6p to the <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 zip code comprising two <italic>PUF</italic>-consensus sites, the <italic>PUF</italic>-consensus site-lacking <italic>EAR1</italic> zip code, the HIV-1 TAR stem-loop, and a 60 mer poly-A RNA. (C) Competitive EMSA with Puf6p and <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 zip-code RNA reveals a preference of Puf6p for the <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 zip code. Puf6p and <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA were incubated with 10-fold, 100-fold, or 500-fold excess of unlabeled <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA or <italic>EAR1</italic> RNA. (D) Puf6p and She2p do not bind synergistically to <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA. In EMSAs with <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA, Puf6p, and She2p, no increase in affinity was observed. Likewise, using the <italic>EAR1</italic> zip code as control, no difference in affinity was detected. Please note that She2p alone interacts with RNA too transiently for detection in EMSAs. (E) Pull-down experiments with immobilized GST-Puf6p, She2p, and <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA fused to tRNA show an RNA-dependent interaction of Puf6p and She2p (lanes 1–3; asterisk highlights bound She2p). No interaction was observed when a control RNA (<italic>ASH1</italic> E3-33-tRNA fusion) was used (lanes 4–6) or when RNA was omitted from the reaction (lanes 7–9) (I, input; W, final wash; E, elution). Upper part shows SDS-PAGE; lower part shows an agarose gel.</p>

<p>When repeating RNA filter-binding experiments with HIV-1 TAR RNA (16 mer), a longer HIV-1 TAR RNA (57 mer), and the U1 snRNA hairpin II as controls, we observed Kds ranging from 1.1 µM to 1.6 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, right table). These data indicate that the affinity of She2p to zip-code elements is only about 2–10-fold higher than to unrelated stem-loops. In vivo, however, only few mRNAs are associated with She2p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shepard1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Oeffinger1">[15]</xref>. Thus, the low in vitro specificity of She2p binding is unlikely to explain the high selectivity for localizing mRNAs in the cell.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the high specificity in vivo is that another, more selective RNA-binding protein mediates specific binding to localizing transcripts. A recent study suggested that Puf6p (Gene ID: 852107), which binds to the <italic>ASH1-E3</italic> zip-code element, also interacts directly with She2p in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen2">[21]</xref>. Thus, Puf6p could potentially bind specifically to <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA and simultaneously to She2p, mediating cargo specificity for the transport complex.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Puf6p Interacts Indirectly through RNA-Binding with She2p and Shows Limited RNA Specificity</title>
<p>We purified Puf6p to near homogeneity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and confirmed its integrity by size-exclusion chromatography and circular dichroism spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Then we assessed the specificity of Puf6p binding to RNAs by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and observed a rather indiscriminate binding of Puf6p to RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Also the concentration-dependent increasing size of the shifted RNA complexes hints at an unspecific binding of additional Puf6p molecules to RNA. We repeated these experiments with <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA in the presence of excess amounts of either specific (<italic>ASH1</italic> E3) or unspecific (<italic>EAR1</italic>) unlabeled competitor RNA. The <italic>EAR1</italic> zip-code element was chosen as an unspecific competitor because it lacks a <italic>PUF</italic>-consensus site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Gu1">[29]</xref>. Complex formation of <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA and recombinant Puf6p was competed for by excess amounts of <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA, but only poorly by <italic>EAR1</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, in vitro Puf6p displays a limited preference for RNAs with <italic>PUF</italic>-consensus sites.</p>
<p>In order to find out if the combination of She2p and Puf6p results in synergistic RNA binding, we also performed EMSAs with both proteins and RNAs. In none of these experiments did we observe any synergistic binding or increased specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the previously suggested direct interaction of Puf6p with She2p in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen2">[21]</xref>, we performed pull-down experiments with the respective recombinant proteins. Using GST-Puf6p and She2p, no stable interaction was observed in absence of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Next, we investigated whether Puf6p and She2p interact in an RNA-dependent manner. In order to obtain the large amounts of RNA required for these experiments, we used a recently established expression strategy, in which RNAs of interest are recombinantly expressed in fusion with tRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Ponchon1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Ponchon2">[35]</xref>. Wild-type <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA and a shortened control <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA, which fails to bind She2p (unpublished data) and lacks predicted Puf6p binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Gu1">[29]</xref>, were expressed and purified in fusion to the anticodon stem of a methionine tRNA (E3-118-tRNA and E3-33-tRNA, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s002">Figure S2</xref>). When adding E3-118-tRNA, we observed both Puf6p and She2p in the same complex, whereas no interaction was detected with the control E3-33-tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, the interaction between Puf6p and She2p observed in vitro appears to be indirect. Furthermore, from the sum of these experiments we can conclude that Puf6p is unlikely to mediate cargo-specificity to the transport complex.</p>

<title>She2p and She3p Interact Directly with Each Other</title>
<p>In the cytoplasm, the cargo adapter She3p (Gene ID: 852427) joins the She2p:RNA complex. She3p is thought to connect specifically pre-bound mRNAs to the motor Myo4p (Gene ID: 851204) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Long1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mnchow1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Dunn1">[26]</xref>. However, the weak RNA-binding specificities we observed for She2p and Puf6p appear inconsistent with this model. Therefore, we assessed the role of She3p in complex formation. In pull-down experiments with His-tagged She3p and in size-exclusion chromatography, we observed a co-purification of She2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s003">S3A,B</xref>).

<title>She2p, She3p, and Zip-Code RNAs Form Stable Ternary Complexes</title>
<p>Since previous data indicated that She3p might be able to join the co-complex of She2p and RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>, we also tested their assembly with recombinant proteins by size-exclusion chromatography. She2p and She3p indeed co-eluted efficiently with zip code containing E3-118-tRNA at high molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the control E3-33-tRNA did not elute in co-complex with both proteins. Reconstitution could be further expanded by the addition of the C-terminal half of Myo4p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s003">Figure S3C</xref>), which interacts with She3p. In summary, these observations show that She2p, She3p, and zip-code RNA form a ternary complex that can be reconstituted with recombinant proteins in vitro. More importantly, it suggests that only functional zip-code RNAs join the She2p:She3p complex.</p>

<title>Puf6p Is Part of the Cytoplasmic Complex with She2p, She3p, and <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA</title>
<p>Because Puf6p co-purifies with She2p and <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA and colocalizes with <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA at the bud tip, it is considered to be associated with the actively transported <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Deng1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Gu1">[29]</xref>. Thus, Puf6p should also associate with the recombinant She2p:She3p:E3-RNA complex. We performed in vitro pull-down experiments with either His-tagged She3p or GST-tagged Puf6p and analyzed the co-elution with other complex factors. Using either strategy, Puf6p co-purified with She2p, the zip-code element-containing E3-118-tRNA, and She3p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s004">Figure S4A–C</xref>).

These results indicate that Puf6p and the She2p:She3p co-complex can indeed bind simultaneously to the <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 element.

<title>She3p Is an RNA-Binding Protein</title>
<p>To understand the specific role of She3p in ternary complex assembly, we also tested if She3p alone binds to RNA. In EMSAs She3p indeed bound to zip-code RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) but also to HIV-I TAR RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) with affinities comparable to She2p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Du1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mller2">[33]</xref>. Thus, we consider She3p to be a previously undetected, rather unspecific RNA-binding protein. Remarkably, it fails to show sequence similarity to known RNA-binding domains. As with other RNA-binding proteins tested in this study, She3p alone lacks RNA-binding specificity suitable to explain the highly specific transport of a subset of mRNAs in vivo.</p>

<title>She2p and She3p Act Synergistically to Form RNA Complexes with High Affinity and Specificity</title>
<p>Next, we assessed whether the cytoplasmic She2p:She3p complex shows higher specificity for zip-code RNAs than the individual proteins. Whereas the interaction of She2p with zip-code RNAs was barely detectable by EMSAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">Figure S5A,B</xref>), She3p binding was observed even at low nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). In order to detect potential synergisms in binding, we performed EMSAs with increasing concentrations of She2p and a constant, low concentration of She3p (25 nM). At these concentrations, She2p alone did not show any mobility shift (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">Figure S5A,B</xref>), whereas She3p yielded a faint shift for the <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 element (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). In the event of synergistic RNA binding by both proteins, a distinct and stronger band shift corresponding to the ternary complex would be expected.</p>
<p>EMSAs with She2p, She3p, and <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA showed indeed strong binding even at the lowest experimental She2p concentration of 5 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">S5D</xref>). Subsequent Western blot analysis confirmed that She2p is present in the detected RNA-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">Figure S5E</xref>). A similar increase in affinity was also observed with the <italic>EAR1</italic> zip-code element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) and the <italic>ASH1</italic>-E1, E2A, and E2B zip-code elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">Figure S5F–H</xref>). Based on these EMSAs, we estimated the Kds for ternary complex formation with all four <italic>ASH1</italic> zip-code elements and the <italic>EAR1</italic> zip-code element to be around 25 nM. When repeating these EMSAs with unspecific HIV-1 TAR RNA, no complexes were observed even at experimental She2p concentrations of 1.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, it can be estimated that the She2p:She3p co-complex assembles with all tested zip code containing RNAs with at least 60-fold higher affinity. It should be noted that these numbers only provide a rough estimate. They nevertheless clearly indicate that this complex is highly specific.</p>
<p>In order to confirm the synergistic effect observed in EMSAs by a different approach, we also performed filter-binding assays. These experiments with the <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 and <italic>EAR1</italic> zip-code elements also yielded a clear synergistic effect whenever combinations of She2p and She3p were added (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s006">Figure S6A,B</xref>).</p>

<title>She2p and She3p Directly Bind to RNA in the Ternary Complex</title>
<p>Although She2p and She3p are both RNA-binding proteins, it is possible that in the ternary complex only one of them directly contacts the RNA. In such a scenario the effect of the other protein would be limited to an allosteric influence on the RNA-interacting protein. In order to test this possibility, we performed UV cross-linking experiments with She2p, She3p, and radioactively labeled <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA. In order to optimize the experimental conditions, we employed a shortened E3 RNA of 51 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s002">Figure S2</xref>) that still mediated synergistic RNA binding with She2p and She3p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">Figure S5I</xref>). Following UV cross-linking and denaturing gel electrophoresis, we observed distinct bands for She2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, lane 3) and for She3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, lanes 5–6). Those bands for She2p and She3p were both detected also when the ternary complex was subjected to UV cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, lanes 7–8). Since UV light only cross-links direct atomic interactions between proteins and nucleic acids, this experiment indicates a direct RNA binding of She2p and She3p within the ternary complex.</p>

<title>The C-Terminus of She3p Mediates Synergistic RNA Binding with She2p</title>
<p>She3p does not share sequence homology to known protein structures. In order to identify features in She3p that mediate RNA binding, She2p interaction, and ternary complex formation, we analyzed different deletion fragments of She3p. We noticed that a fragment consisting of the very C-terminal 72 amino acids, termed She3p (354–425) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), could be expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a stable protein.

A slightly longer fragment of 92 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), termed She3p (334–425), showed slightly stronger binary interactions with She2p and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">Figure 4B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Mutational Analysis of She3p</title>
<p>Knowing that the C-terminal 92 amino acids of She3p are functionally important, we mutated conserved residues in this region and tested whether synergistic RNA binding with She2p is affected. Two sets of mutations have already been described in the C-terminus of She3p to affect <italic>ASH1</italic>-mRNA localization in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Landers1">[36]</xref>. The first of these mutant proteins, She3p (S343E S361E), did not show a significant defect in synergistic RNA binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s008">Figure S8A,G</xref>), whereas the other mutant She3p (S348E) showed a slight reduction in the synergism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s008">Figure S8B,F</xref>). Since the observed defect is rather weak, it seems likely that both sets of mutations also affect a different step during RNA localization.</p>
<p>We also generated two additional point mutations at conserved amino acid positions of She3p. Whereas She3p (R341E) did not show any defect in vitro (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s008">Figure S8C</xref>), the mutant She3p (L364A V367A) showed significantly reduced synergistic RNA binding with She2p (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s008">Figure S8D</xref>). Further analysis showed that She3p (L364A V367A) alone exhibits impaired She2p binding but wild-type-like RNA binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s008">Figure S8H,I</xref>). Thus, we identified a region in She3p required for direct She2p interaction and synergistic RNA binding with She2p.</p>

<title>Deletion of the Helix E or of the Very C-Terminus of She2p Impairs Synergistic RNA Binding with She3p</title>
<p>We also generated mutant versions of She2p and tested them for interaction with She3p and RNA. Two structural regions of She2p show high sequence conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Niessing1">[19]</xref> but have not yet been assigned to a specific function. One region is the helix E of She2p that we already identified to UV-cross-link to zip-code RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g005">5B–D</xref>), indicating that it is part of the RNA-binding surface of She2p. The second conserved region is the protease-sensitive, very C-terminus of She2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In the modeled tetrameric structure of She2p, the C-terminus is located at the dimer-dimer interface, close to the previously assigned RNA-binding surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mller2">[33]</xref>. We created She2p deletion mutants of both regions and confirmed their integrity by size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s009">Figure S9A</xref>).</p>
<p>When performing pull-down experiments with His-tagged She3p, She2p (ΔC) could be co-eluted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g006">Figures 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s009">S9B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref>; compare with wild-type She2p in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, no binding was observed with She2p (ΔhE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g006">Figures 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s009">S9B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref>). SPR with amine-coupled She3p showed almost wild type-like binding by She2p (ΔC) (2.0±0.2 µM), whereas no binding was observed with She2p (ΔhE) even at experimental concentrations of 150 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We conclude that She2p requires its protruding helix E for the interaction with She3p. In contrast, the very C-terminus of She2p is dispensable for She3p binding.</p>

<title>Complex formation and RNA binding by She2p mutants.</title>
<p>(A) Binding of She2p mutants to She3p was investigated by pull-down (left) and surface plasmon resonance (right) experiments. In pull-down experiments, She2p (ΔC) but not She2p (ΔhE) co-purified with immobilized His-tagged She3p (I, input; W, final wash; E, elution). In steady-state surface plasmon resonance experiments, She2p (ΔC) bound to surface-coupled She3p with a Kd of 2.0±0.2 µM (mean and deviation of two independent experiments). (B) In analytical size-exclusion chromatography, She2p (ΔC) (chromatogram 2) but not She2p (ΔhE) (chromatogram 4) eluted as high-molecular weight complex with She3p and E3-118-tRNA. Please note that She3p co-migrates with the She2p (ΔhE):E3-118-tRNA co-complex, but no ternary complex is formed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s009">Figure S9C</xref> and dotted line indicating the elution volume of the ternary complex). No ternary complexes were observed with E3-33-tRNA (chromatogram 1 and 3). Corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis and are shown below each chromatogram. Dotted lines mark the retention volumes of the indicated components. (C) Also in EMSAs, these She2p mutants show defects in ternary complex formation. Compared to wild-type She2p, an at least 5-fold higher amount of She2p (ΔC) (25 nM) was required for the formation of ternary complexes, whereas She2p (ΔhE) entirely failed to assemble complexes with <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA and She3p. (D) She2p versions harboring point mutations around the helix E were tested by EMSA. The mutants She2p (F195A L196A) and She2p (Q197A E198A I199A) showed defects in synergistic RNA binding with She3p. A summary of all She2p mutants tested is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000611.g006" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Next we assessed ternary complex formation with both She2p mutants by size-exclusion chromatography. Whereas She2p (ΔC) still forms stable complexes with She3p and E3-118-tRNA, no ternary complexes assembled with She2p (ΔhE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g006">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s009">S9C</xref>). When using the control RNA E3-33-tRNA, no ternary complex was observed for any of these proteins.</p>
<p>We also used EMSAs to study synergistic RNA binding of the She2p mutants with She3p. Compared to wild-type She2p, the She2p (ΔC) mutant showed an about 5-fold reduced complex formation with She3p and the E3 zip-code element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g006">Figure 6C</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Since the binary interaction of She2p (ΔC) with She3p is largely unaffected (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g006">Figure 6A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), deletion of the C-terminus mainly impairs the synergistic RNA binding with She3p. No mobility shift was observed with She2p (ΔhE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), which confirms that helix E plays an essential role in the formation of the ternary complex. We also analyzed ternary complex formation of these She2p mutants with the <italic>EAR1</italic> zip-code RNA and observed defects comparable to the ones obtained with <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s009">Figure S9D</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we analyzed the effects of both mutations on the RNA binding of She2p alone. Since in our hands RNA binding by She2p is too transient for detection by EMSAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">Figure S5A,B</xref>), these interactions were tested by filter-binding assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Niessing1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mller2">[33]</xref>. In these experiments, both mutants showed reduced binding to zip-code RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s009">Figure S9E</xref>). Interestingly, She2p (ΔhE) still bound unrelated RNAs like wild-type She2p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s009">Figure S9E</xref>), suggesting a role of helix E in specific RNA recognition. Defects in RNA-binding by She2p (ΔC) were much more pronounced for <italic>ASH1</italic> zip-code elements than for <italic>EAR1</italic> mRNA. These observations are consistent with respective defects in ternary complex formation. Furthermore, they demonstrate that selective reduction of RNA binding, as observed for She2p (ΔC), impairs synergistic RNA binding with She3p.</p>

<title>Point Mutations around the Helix E of She2p Impair Synergistic RNA Binding with She3p</title>
<p>Deletion of the helix E of She2p abolishes synergistic complex formation. Because this deletion constitutes a considerable alteration of the overall shape of the protein, we generated more subtle point mutations around this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g005">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Whereas the mutant versions She2p (E183A D184A G185A) and She2p (T191A D192A) affect the flexible loop region at the tip of helix E (dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), She2p (E195A L196A) and She2p (Q197A E198A I199A) altered amino acids that directly interact with helix E and are part of a joint surface landscape with this helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>). She2p versions with mutations in the flexible loop region did not show any defect in synergistic RNA binding with She3p (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s010">Figure S10A,B</xref>). In contrast, the helix E–affecting mutants She2p (E195A L196A) and She2p (Q197A E198A I199A) displayed reduced synergistic RNA binding with She3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g006">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). With both mutants the interaction with She3p was abrogated and RNA binding was moderately reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s010">Figure S10C–E</xref>). We used circular dischroism spectroscopy to confirm that both mutant proteins adopt the alpha-helical fold observed for the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s010">Figure S10F</xref>).</p>

<title>Deletion of Helix E or the C-Terminus in She2p Abolishes mRNP Assembly In Vivo</title>

Transport-complex assembly was monitored by Western blotting against HA-tagged She3p. The relative amount of co-immunoprecipitated She3p was quantified from two independent blots. Wild-type She2p efficiently co-immunoprecipitated She3p. In contrast, complex assembly was almost abolished in cells expressing either She2p (ΔC) or She2p (ΔhE). Input fractions show equivalent expression levels of HA3-She3p in She2p-mutant strains. Likewise, the She2p mutants were expressed at levels comparable to wild-type She2p.

<title>She3p Does Not Shuttle into the Nucleus</title>

It is therefore a remaining possibility that the ternary complex also plays a functional role in the nucleus. A well-established way of testing nuclear shuttling of proteins that travel together with mRNA is the use of the temperature-sensitive nuclear export mutant <italic>mex67-5<sup>ts</sup></italic>. At restrictive temperature, shuttling proteins such as She2p accumulate in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Kruse1">[16]</xref>.

Also at restrictive temperature She3p remained in the cytoplasm, indicating that it does not shuttle into the nucleus. Because at restrictive temperature She2p and other shuttling factors are retained in the nucleus, mRNA localization is abolished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Kruse1">[16]</xref>. In addition, transport factors like Myo4p and She3p become delocalized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Kruse1">[16]</xref>, serving as an internal control for the efficient block of nuclear export.

<p>(A) Immunofluorescence stainings of HA-tagged She3p in the temperature-sensitive nuclear export mutant <italic>mex67-5</italic>. At permissive temperature (25°) She3p was localized to the bud tip (upper panels). At restrictive temperature (37°) nuclear export is blocked, but She3p still remained in the cytoplasm (lower panels; position of nuclei marked by arrowheads). It indicates that She3p does not shuttle into the nucleus. At restrictive temperature, She2p is trapped in the nucleus and mRNA as well as Myo4p localization is abolished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Kruse1">[16]</xref>, which is consistent with the diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of She3p.

She2p is recruited co-transcriptionally to genes coding for localized and non-localized transcripts, as it was reported recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen1">[20]</xref>. She2p occupancy increases towards the 3′-end of genes.

Again, no significant differences could be observed between wild-type and mutant yeast cells.

<title>She3p Does Not Contribute to Co-Transcriptional Recruitment of She2p</title>
<p>Recent chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed that She2p associates co-transcriptionally with RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen1">[20]</xref> in a gene-unspecific manner. A subsequent comparison of She2p ChIP occupancy in presence or absence of RNase also indicated a selective co-transcriptional binding of She2p to localizing mRNAs. Our studies on She3p localization using <italic>mex67-5<sup>ts</sup></italic> strains yielded no signs of nuclear accumulation of She3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). It is possible, however, that a minor fraction of She3p enters the nucleus, which escapes visualization by immunostaining. If She3p is present in the nucleus, the ternary complex described in this study should also form and stabilize co-transcriptional RNA binding of She2p.</p>
<p>In order to test this possibility, we performed ChIP experiments with wild-type and Δ<italic>she3</italic> cells. A comparison of the She2p occupancy at the <italic>ASH1</italic> locus and three control loci in wild-type cells and in Δ<italic>she3</italic> cells showed no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g008">Figures 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s011">S11</xref>).

However, in contrast to Shen and colleagues, we also observed an RNase-dependent reduction of She2p recruitment to genes, which do not encode for localizing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g008">Figures 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s011">S11</xref>). This RNase-dependent reduction of She2p occupancy is the same in wild-type and Δ<italic>she3</italic> cells. In summary, these data show that She3p does not contribute to co-transcriptional She2p recruitment and is therefore unlikely to play an active role in the nucleus.</p>

<p>To date, all components of the <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNP including the core factors connecting mRNA to the myosin motor have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Paquin1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mller1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chartrand3">[39]</xref>. However, largely due to the lack of quantitative interaction studies, the molecular mechanisms leading to specific mRNA recognition and mRNP assembly remain ambiguous. To our knowledge, we performed the first in vitro reconstitution of the core of an mRNA-transport complex. We followed the path of mRNP assembly from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and assessed binding affinities, specificities, and synergisms in complex assembly. Key findings were confirmed by complementing in vitro and in vivo experiments.</p>
<p>Since She2p binds <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA co-transcriptionally and escorts it until it is anchored at the bud tip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Kruse1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Long1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen2">[21]</xref>, it had been assumed that this protein is responsible for the specific incorporation of zip code containing mRNAs into localizing mRNPs. We found that neither She2p nor Puf6p, which is the other <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 element-interacting protein present in the nucleus, bind zip-code RNAs with high specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Because in a previous study a more specific recognition of <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA by Puf6p had been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Gu1">[29]</xref>, we performed additional control experiments to ensure that Puf6p is folded and active in our experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Whereas RNA-binding assays with unlabeled competitors are virtually identical in both studies, we also observed strong Puf6p binding to unrelated control RNAs in standard EMSAs. Although we arrive at a somewhat different estimation of the binding specificity of Puf6p, it seems clear from both studies that RNA binding by Puf6p is less specific than by other Pumilio/FBP family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Wang1">[40]</xref>. It might be that Puf6p requires an additional co-factor to achieve the specificity reported for its in vivo function.</p>
<p>Previous immunoprecipitation experiments with yeast extracts showed that the Puf6p:She2p complex is RNase-resistant, suggesting that both proteins might interact directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen2">[21]</xref>. With recombinant proteins, we recapitulated an RNA-mediated interaction of Puf6p and She2p, but not a direct protein-protein binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNPs are rather RNase-insensitive, stable particles that allow for co-purification of both factors even after RNase treatment.</p>
<p>When performing in vitro RNA-binding assays with Puf6p and She2p, we also observed that their combination failed to bind synergistically or with higher specificity to zip-code RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these experiments suggest that a complex consisting of <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA, She2p, and Puf6p is able to assemble in the nucleus with moderate specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Although unlikely, we cannot exclude the requirement of other factors not yet implicated in the assembly of specific nuclear mRNPs.</p>

<p>Solid line shows cell boundaries and dotted line indicates the nuclear envelope. (A) She2p is co-transcriptionally loaded on nascent mRNA. (B) She2p and Puf6p bind in the nucleus with modest specificity to <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA. (C–D) Following nuclear export, She2p and <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA are bound by Myo4p-associated She3p to form a stable and specific complex. Puf6p and Khd1p are also associated with the cytoplasmic complex and mediate translational repression during transport. After transport, the complex is anchored at the bud tip and translation is activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Paquin1">[4]</xref> (not depicted). The model combines our results with previous findings.</p>

<p>In the cytoplasm, She3p is thought to link the RNA:She2p complex to the myosin motor Myo4p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Long1">[18]</xref>. The prevailing model proposes that besides Myo4p, the translationally repressed <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 complex harbors She2p, She3p, and Puf6p. To date, it had not been shown that such a complex really assembles on the RNA. In our in vitro assays, we reconstituted this Puf6p-containing complex in an <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Whether Khd1p behaves in a similar manner remains to be shown.</p>
<p>A previous study reported that <italic>E. coli</italic>–expressed, crude-purified GST-She3p causes a supershift in an EMSA with GST-She2p and <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>. From this single experiment, it remained unclear whether this supershift is based on protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions and whether the presence of She3p has implications on RNA-binding affinity and specificity. Diverging models have been proposed on the function of She3p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Long1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Landers1">[36]</xref>, including a scenario where She2p is not required for cytoplasmic <italic>ASH1</italic>-mRNA transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Landers1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>When assessing molecular interactions of She3p, we first identified a direct and specific binding to She2p with a Kd of 1.6 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). This interaction suffices to explain the previously described supershift by She3p in EMSAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>. It is also consistent with a previous report where She3p was immunoprecipitated with a She2p mutant that lacks RNA-binding capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Gonsalvez1">[41]</xref>. However, the modest affinity and transient nature of the interaction between She2p and She3p and the low RNA-specificity of She2p appears insufficient to explain the specific localization of <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA observed in vivo.</p>
<p>More surprisingly, we identified the myosin adapter She3p as a new, rather unspecific RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>) with affinities comparable to She2p and Puf6p. Database searches failed to identify any known RNA-binding motif in She3p. However, the most important finding for a mechanistic understanding of specific cargo recognition and mRNP assembly was our observation that She2p and She3p together form a highly specific ternary complex with all zip-code elements of localizing mRNAs tested in this study. EMSAs demonstrated that the She2p:She3p complex has at least 60-fold higher Kds for zip-code RNAs over unrelated RNA stem-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figures 3C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s005">S5F–H</xref>). In addition, this RNA interaction stabilizes the rather weak binary She2p:She3p complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) to a similar extent. Since for the control HIV-1 TAR RNA no binding was observed even at the highest experimental concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), the true difference in Kd might be even higher. These findings were confirmed by a total of 12 mutations in She2p and She3p, in which for seven of them an impaired complex formation was observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000611-t001">Table 1</xref>). Two of these She2p mutants were also tested in vivo, where they showed a total loss of RNA localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, four of the mutations in She2p and She3p with a defect in synergistic complex formation also showed defects in both binary interactions, RNA and protein binding. This observation suggests that both interactions are spatially and mechanistically intertwined to allow for the synergism described in this study. This conclusion is further supported by UV cross-linking experiments, which demonstrate that She2p and She3p both directly bind to RNA in the ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figures 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">4F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s007">S7</xref>).</p>
<p>No known RNA-binding motif can be identified in She3p. We nevertheless found a C-terminal fragment of 92 amino acids to be sufficient for synergistic RNA binding with She2p. Within this 92 amino acids long fragment, we mapped residues that are of functional importance for the synergism. Our subsequent UV cross-linking/mass-spectrometry experiment with She2p, RNA, and the C-terminal fragment of She3p confirmed that a functionally important subfragment of 20 residues is indeed involved in RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s007">S7</xref>). These cross-linking experiments also showed that the helix E of She2p directly interacts with RNA. The latter finding confirms our observations on the functional importance of the helix E and assigns a direct molecular function, i.e. RNA binding, to this protein region. A surface plot of all She2p-surface regions that are important for RNA binding shows a large continuous RNA-interaction surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s012">Figure S12</xref>).</p>
<p>In a recent study, a She3p-dependent <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA-transport system was reported in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Elson1">[42]</xref>. Although in this yeast species no clear She2p homolog could be identified, <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA is transported in a fashion similar to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Thus, the question arose of how cargo binding is achieved. Our identification of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> She3p as an RNA-binding protein suggests that <italic>C. albicans</italic> She3p could mediate at least part of the RNA binding for mRNP assembly and transport. A sequence alignment of She3p from different yeast species reveals that the C-terminal half of this protein shows great differences between species with and without She2p in their genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s013">Figure S13</xref>). As shown in this study, the C-terminal part of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> She3p binds to She2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Long1">[18]</xref> as well as to RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and is required for synergistic RNA binding with She2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">Figure 4D–F</xref>). It therefore appears likely that the She2p-lacking species have optimized the C-terminal She3p sequence for an interaction with a different RNA-binding protein or even for a more specific RNA-binding by She3p itself.</p>
<p>Previous studies suggested that She3p acts only in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Bhl1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Long1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Takizawa2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Landers1">[36]</xref>. However, this assumption had not been rigorously tested before. We used a nuclear export mutant to show that She3p indeed does not shuttle into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). To scrutinize whether a small sub-fraction of She3p might play a role in the nucleus, we also analyzed the recently reported co-transcriptional recruitment of She2p to chromatin by ChIP experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Shen1">[20]</xref>. Since we observed no significant difference of She2p occupancy in wild-type and Δ<italic>she3</italic> strains, a nuclear role of She3p could be further excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>Shen et al. also reported a reduction of She2p chromatin binding in ChIP experiments after RNase treatment selectively at open reading frames (ORFs) of localizing mRNAs. The authors concluded that part of the chromatin-associated She2p interacts selectively with localizing mRNAs already during transcription. However, we could not confirm this observation. Although we also detected a reduction of She2p-dependent enrichment after RNase treatment, this effect was observed for all transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, our ChIP experiments suggest rather unspecific She2p association with nascent transcripts. They further indicate that She3p does not play a functional role in the nucleus.</p>
<p>In summary, our and previous data suggest the following model: First, She2p binds co-transcriptionally to RNA polymerase II and to nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). After transcription, nuclear mRNAs are bound by She2p and Puf6p with only limited specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), followed by a nuclear export of both proteins together with mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g009">Figure 9B,C</xref>). In the cytoplasm, She2p and localizing mRNAs form a highly specific co-complex with myosin-bound She3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g009">Figure 9C,D</xref>). This transport complex mediates the translocation of cargo mRNAs to the bud cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g009">Figure 9D</xref>), where after anchoring at the bud tip translation is activated.</p>
<p>On one hand, She2p and She3p function together exclusively in the cytoplasm to select zip-code RNAs. On the other hand, the mRNA cargo itself substantially stabilizes the She2p:She3p interaction. Because this interaction brings together the She2p-dependent pre-mRNP with the cytoplasmic motor complex, we conclude that it is the mRNA cargo itself that triggers joining of all components into the mature transport complex. This interpretation is fully consistent with the observation that RNase-treated <italic>ASH1</italic>-mRNPs do not have motile activity in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Chung1">[27]</xref>. We propose that coupling of specific mRNA recognition and assembly of stable transport complexes constitutes a critical quality control step to ensure that only target mRNAs are transported.</p>
<p>Previous publications reported only moderate in vitro selectivity for localizing mRNAs in yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g. between 3- and 7-fold higher Kd for localizing RNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Dienstbier1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Du1">[7]</xref>. Thus it remained ambiguous what difference in affinity to localizing and non-localizing RNAs might be required for specific mRNA transport and how highly specific mRNP assembly is achieved in vivo. In comparison, the ternary complex formation described in this study shows an unprecedented selectivity for zip code containing RNAs. In our understanding, this observation gives a more realistic example for the cargo specificity required for mRNA localization. It also demonstrates that co-complexes of transport factors might play a much more important role in the recognition of transcripts than previously assumed. Last but not least, our finding that the cargo RNA itself triggers the incorporation of all protein-core factors into one mature transport complex provides a new mechanistic paradigm for the assembly of RNA-localization complexes.</p>
<p>An important question arising from this study is whether synergistic binding to RNA cargo is a more general feature in eukaryotes. For instance, during the oocyte-to-embryo transition of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, the RNA-binding protein Staufen is involved in the localization of <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA. In vitro, Staufen yielded strong binding to specific as well as to control RNAs with extensive secondary structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-StJohnston2">[43]</xref>. In contrast, in vivo injection experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos showed that Staufen-containing mRNPs only form and localize efficiently when its native target, the <italic>bicoid</italic> 3′UTR, is injected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Ferrandon1">[44]</xref>. Thus, it might well be that those <italic>Drosophila</italic> complexes also require mRNP assembly for specific mRNA binding and localization.</p>
<p>In the past, in vitro reconstitution of molecular assemblies has been very successful to provide new insights into biological processes as diverse as transcription and membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Liu1">[45]</xref>. By showing that specific mRNA recognition and assembly of stable cytoplasmic transport complexes is coupled, we demonstrate that in vitro reconstitution is also well suited to advance our mechanistic understanding of mRNA-transport.</p>

Bound proteins were eluted with 50 µl of elution buffer (nickel pull-downs: HNMD-buffer supplemented with 750 mM imidazole; GST pull-downs: 30 mM reduced glutathione). One-tenth of the input, 1/5 of the final wash, and 1/5 of the elution fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining.

<p>All experiments were performed using a Biacore 3000 system with a CM-5 chip (Biacore) in HNMD-buffer. She3p was covalently bound to the chip surface by standard amine coupling. For measurements with She2p (wt) and She2p (ΔC) concentrations from 0.123 to 30 µM were used. She2p (ΔhE) binding was probed with up to 150 µM protein. All binding signals were below 300 response units. Experiments were performed as duplicates and double referencing was applied.

(A) In pull-down experiments with immobilized His-She3p, Puf6p and She2p co-eluted in an <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 zip-code-dependent manner (lanes 1–3; pulled-down proteins are indicated by asterisks). No co-elution of Puf6p was observed when the control RNA <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3-33 was used (lanes 4–6) or in absence of RNA (lanes 7–9). As observed previously, She3p bound to She2p also in absence of RNA. The small amount of <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3-33 RNA eluting with She3p from the nickel sepharose beads (lane 6) most likely resulted from unspecific RNA binding by She3p (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

Please note that She3p always migrates as a double band in SDS gels. In a control experiment with immobilized GST protein, no unspecific binding of She2p, She3p, or RNA was observed (lanes 7–9).

<p>Supporting experiments for studies on synergistic RNA binding by She2p and She3p. (A–B) The She2p:RNA interaction is too transient to be resolved in EMSA experiments. Even at micromolar She2p concentrations, no stable complex with either <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 (A) or <italic>EAR1</italic> zip-code RNA (B) was detected. (C) The minimal She3p concentration required for detection of <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 zip code binding in EMSAs was determined to be in the range of 25 nM to 50 nM (position marked by asterisk). (D) This EMSA shows synergistic binding of She2p and She3p on <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3 RNA in direct comparison to the unaffected Puf6p binding in presence of She2p. A shift to larger molecular weight and thus the formation of a ternary complex was only observed for She2p and She3p. Puf6p alone showed strong but unspecific binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g001">Figure 1</xref>). (E) Western blot against She2p after EMSA confirms the presence of She2p in the ternary complex with She3p and <italic>ASH1-</italic>E3 RNA. (F–I) EMSAs with a constant She3p concentration (25 nM) and varying amounts of She2p show specific ternary complex formation with the <italic>ASH1</italic>-E1 zip code (F), <italic>ASH1</italic>-E2A zip code (G), <italic>ASH1</italic>-E2B zip code (H), and a shortened <italic>ASH1</italic>-E3-51 zip-code RNA (I).

<p>The effect of She2p mutations on RNA binding and complex formation. (A) Elution profiles from preparative size-exclusion chromatography (Superose 12 column) show that wild-type She2p and She2p (ΔhE) eluted at the same volume, whereas She2p (ΔC) showed a retarded elution. Thus, deletion of the C-terminus appears to slightly affect She2p tetramerization without completely disrupting it (for further details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000611-Mller2">[33]</xref>). The sharp peaks of all She2p fragments confirm protein integrity. (B) Control pull-down experiments show that neither She2p (ΔC) nor She2p (ΔhE) bound to nickel-sepharose beads. (C) She2p (ΔhE) does not form a ternary complex with She3p and E3-118-tRNA. In size-exclusion chromatography the co-complex of She2p (ΔhE) and E3-118-tRNA (chromatogram 2) eluted at a similar volume as She3p alone (chromatogram 3). When all three components were analyzed together, co-migration but no ternary complex at higher molecular weight was observed (chromatogram 1). Corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and agarose-gel electrophoresis and are shown below each chromatogram. Dotted lines indicate the peak retention volumes of the individual components. (D) In EMSAs, She2p mutants showed defects in complex formation with <italic>EAR1</italic>-zip-code RNA and She3p. Deletion of the She2p C-terminus impaired but did not abolish RNA-dependent complex assembly with She3p. In contrast, She2p (ΔhE) failed to assemble co-complexes at concentrations up to 250 nM. (E) She2p (ΔC) and She2p (ΔhE) showed impaired RNA binding. RNA filter-binding experiments demonstrated a significantly reduced affinity of both She2p mutants to the four <italic>ASH1</italic> zip codes. Binding of both She2p mutants to the <italic>EAR1</italic> zip code and <italic>WSC2N</italic> was only moderately reduced. However, the She2p (ΔhE) interaction with the <italic>WSC2N</italic> element was almost abolished. In contrast, binding of both She2p mutants to unrelated stem-loop RNAs was not reduced. This suggests that helix E and the C-terminus of She2p are dispensable for unspecific RNA binding. “% wt-binding” indicates the percentage of RNA-binding affinity relative to wild-type She2p binding.

Please note that She2p (F195A L196A) migrated slightly slower than the wild type in SDS-PAGE. However, we confirmed the expected mass of both point mutants by mass spectrometry (unpublished data). (D) Control pull-down experiments showed that none of the two She2p mutants bound to nickel-sepharose beads.

Red bar with the label “crosslink” highlights amino acids of She3p that were contained in a UV cross-linked peptide of She3p (334–425) (for further details, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000611-g004">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000611.s009">S9A,B</xref>). Sequence alignment was performed via Fungal Genome Search using WU-BLAST2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org" xlink:type="simple">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>). Based on this alignment, the phylogenetic tree (Neighbor Joining algorithm) and alignment representation were prepared using the CLC Sequence Viewer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clcbio.com" xlink:type="simple">www.clcbio.com</ext-link>).</p>
