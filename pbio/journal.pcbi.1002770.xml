      <abstract>
        <p>We most often consider muscle as a motor generating force in the direction of shortening, but less often consider its roles as a spring or a brake. Here we develop a fully three-dimensional spatially explicit model of muscle to isolate the locations of forces and energies that are difficult to separate experimentally. We show the strain energy in the thick and thin filaments is less than one third the strain energy in attached cross-bridges. This result suggests the cross-bridges act as springs, storing energy within muscle in addition to generating the force which powers muscle. Comparing model estimates of energy consumed to elastic energy stored, we show that the ratio of these two properties changes with sarcomere length. The model predicts storage of a greater fraction of energy at short sarcomere lengths, suggesting a mechanism by which muscle function shifts as force production declines, from motor to spring. Additionally, we investigate the force that muscle produces in the radial or transverse direction, orthogonal to the direction of shortening. We confirm prior experimental estimates that place radial forces on the same order of magnitude as axial forces, although we find that radial forces and axial forces vary differently with changes in sarcomere length.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Locomotion requires energy. Very fast locomotion requires a larger amount of energy than muscle can produce in such a short time period, thus muscle must use energy that it previously produced and stored as elastic deformation. Cyclical or repeated movements can be directly powered by muscle, but energy may be conserved in such cases through elastic energy storage. Traditionally we've looked primarily at tendons, insect exoskeletons, and bones as locations where this energy is stored. However, a small but growing body of literature has recently suggested the backbone filament proteins in muscle act as elastic storage locations. We suggest that the myosin motors themselves are capable of storing more energy than the filaments, energy that may be released to power very fast movements or reduce the cost of cyclical movements. We further suggest that this energy is stored in the radial deformations of myosin motors, in a direction that is perpendicular to the axis of muscle shortening.</p>

        <title>Energy storage in cross-bridges</title>
        <p>Strain energy storage in muscle systems is most often associated with stretched tendons or other elastic supporting materials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Alexander1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Gosline1">[2]</xref>. In many instances, strain energy storage in skeletal and tendon structures has been shown to be a crucial component of the locomotor systems of animals, especially flying animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Ellington1">[3]</xref>. While muscle' role as a force generator has dominated research on animal locomotion, emerging studies posit diverse functional roles for muscles, including those of a brake, actuator, spring, or even a damper (for a review see Dickinson et al., 2000) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Dickinson1">[4]</xref>. Somewhat less attention has focused on the extent to which muscle itself plays a role in strain energy storage. That work which has been done has focused on the possibility of storing energy in the thick filaments, rigor cross-bridges, or the in the extensible accessory protein titin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Tidball1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Monroy1">[7]</xref>. This assumption that active cross-bridges play a minor role is understandable: they generate force in activated muscle and are thought to be constantly cycling between freely diffusing and attached states and so would be expected to develop little deformation.</p>
        <p>However, recent work suggests that in certain situations the cross-bridges may be locked onto muscle' thin filaments, frozen into a lattice that can act to store energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-George1">[8]</xref>. Energy storage may be possible in the subset of bound cross-bridges in antagonistic muscles that absorb inertial energy of a periodically moved appendage. This energy storage permits locomotion that would otherwise be energetically unfeasible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Ellington1">[3]</xref>. Additionally, energy storage in muscle has been proposed in non-cyclical movements such as the tentacular strike of the squid, stomatopods'raptorial appendage strike, or the tongue extension of toads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Kier1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Patek1">[12]</xref>. In these cases of one-off sudden movements, even a set of cycling cross-bridges may store strain energy for release on the initiation of rapid movement through pre-movement activation and subsequent pre-movement strain of the cross-bridges occurring just before the onset of an explosive motion. Our spatially explicit half-sarcomere model lets us parse how strain energy is partitioned between the filaments and the cross-bridges in maximally activated isometric sarcomeres. We show that the cross-bridges may store the majority of the elastic strain energy.</p>

        <title>Force generation in the radial direction</title>
        <p>Cross-bridges are more often thought of as force generators than energy storage sites. The force generated by individual myosin heads arises from deformations as they form cross-bridges between the thick and thin filaments and undergo a rotation about a lever arm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Spudich1">[13]</xref>. Interestingly, generating force by a rotation about a hinge implies that the vector of the generated force will have a component perpendicular to the direction of contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Schoenberg1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Williams1">[15]</xref>. This force component is in the radial direction, orthogonal to the axial force that is generated in parallel to the thick and thin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

            <title>Models produce radial and axial forces.</title>
            <p>The one-dimensional cross-bridge model shown in (A) produces force and exists only in the axial direction. The two-dimensional cross-bridge model shown in (B) produces both axial and radial forces, and responds to changes in lattice spacing. A multi-filament model using one-dimensional cross-bridge, shown in (C), is diagrammed as a three-dimensional system but is insensitive to changes in lattice spacing and unable to explore radial force produced during contraction. Using two-dimensional cross-bridges in the same model geometry, in (D), allows the recording of radial forces and altered force dynamics with altered lattice spacing.</p>

        <p>Radial force was observed during contraction in intact muscle fiber experiments dating back to the 1950s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Hiramoto1">[16]</xref>. Subsequent studies of radial forces placed them on the same order of magnitude as axial force <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Maughan1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Nyland1">[22]</xref>. These more recent experiments addressed radial force production through a proxy such as changes in fiber diameter or alterations of the muscle' radial compliance. The use of a lever-arm cross-bridge (with extensional and torsional springs) in the current spatially explicit model permits direct simulation of radial force production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g001">Figure 1B&amp;D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Williams1">[15]</xref>. This cross-bridge model expands upon prior models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g001">Figure 1A&amp;C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Schoenberg2">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Campbell1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Radial force may have functional implications. The internally generated radial force is a partial determinant of fiber radial compliance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Xu1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Nyland1">[22]</xref>. Alterations in radial fiber compliance are also a hallmark of dystrophic disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Pasternak1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Batchelor1">[29]</xref>. Mis-regulation of the transmission of radial force produced during contraction may be a cause of the ultrastructural disorganization observed in histological studies of dystrophic muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Blake1">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In addition to the more commonly analyzed axial forces, the model presented here addresses both radial force generation and the strain energy in the filaments and cross-bridges of the contractile lattice. These phenomena are linked, and are results of deformation of cross-bridges in the axial and radial directions. The interdependence of these properties is uniquely addressable using spatially explicit models of muscle contraction with lever-arm myosin geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We have developed such models based on protein structural information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Williams1">[15]</xref>. These models permit a fine parsing of energy locations which shows that cross-bridges store substantial elastic strain energy. Correlation of this cross-bridge energy with axial and radial forces suggests that radial cross-bridge strain could supply much of the energy stored in the contractile lattice.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Below we present results for simulations at the level of a half-sarcomere, the smallest fully-regulated component of muscle. Our half-sarcomere is composed of springs representing four myosin (thick) and eight actin (thin) filaments, arranged with boundary conditions which provide a semi-infinite lattice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002770.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Tanner1">[26]</xref>. Forces and energies are plotted as sarcomere length is changed by varying filament end locations. Spacing between the filaments is varied with sarcomere length to maintain a constant lattice volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Millman1">[31]</xref>. Thus results are plotted over the range of the classic isovolumetric length-tension curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Gordon1">[32]</xref> The force decrease in our half-sarcomere model, to 18–21% of maximal values, at extreme sarcomere lengths is comparable to the 25–30% remaining force seen in experimental measurements of striated muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Gordon1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Radial forces produced within the half sarcomere are both large and correlated with energy storage. Our model monitors radial forces produced by lever arm cross-bridge models composed of an angular (or torsional) and an extensional (linear) spring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g001">Figure 1A&amp;B</xref>). The forces and energies used for comparison are steady state values produced on full isometric activation at a range of sarcomere lengths stretching across the length-tension curve. Even though isometric contraction represents only one possible loading regime, it is a computationally simple condition with low cross-bridge turnover, making it a regime well suited to explore how sarcomere length, and thus filament overlap, influences force produced and energy stored.</p>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Axial and radial forces are of the same order of magnitude</title>
        <p>In the fully activated conditions of our simulations, both the axial and radial forces quickly rise to an asymptotic maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This rise to a maximum value takes less than 50 ms. The exponential time constant of the rise to peak force is not significantly different between the axial and radial forces (p = 0.31). After steady force levels are reached, stochastic fluctuations in the number and states of bound cross-bridges show as noise in the force traces. This clean rise gives clear asymptotic maximum forces.</p>

        <p>The radial force, at all sarcomere lengths, is of the same order of magnitude as the axial force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g003">Figure 3</xref>). At most sarcomere lengths below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002770.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where there is significant myofilament overlap, the radial force is larger than the axial force. At very short sarcomere lengths the radial force is as much as 2.4 times the axial force, although this is in a region where overall axial force levels are relatively small. These results agree with prior experimental studies which found radial forces of the same magnitude as axial forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Matsubara1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Nyland1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Godt1">[33]</xref>.</p>

The radial force plateau ends at a shorter sarcomere length than does axial force plateau.</p>

        <title>The cross-bridges store the majority of strain induced energy</title>
        <p>The majority of strain energy stored in the complete contractile lattice of filaments and cross-bridges is partitioned in the cross-bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g004">Figure 4A&amp;B</xref>). The relative distribution of energy between the cross-bridges and the filaments varies with sarcomere length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Even when the filaments reach their peak energy relative to the cross-bridges, at the sarcomere lengths where maximum force is produced, the cross-bridges still have more than three times the energy of the filaments. At very long and very short sarcomere lengths, where little axial force is produced, the energy stored in the cross-bridges dominates the system.</p>

        <p>The elastic energy storage may be more finely parsed: into the components located in each of the two springs constituting every cross-bridge and the components in each of the two filament types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These results show that the energies of the thick and thin filaments vary similarly across all sarcomere lengths. In contrast, the energies of the torsional and extensional spring which comprise the cross-bridge are quite different. The energy of the torsional springs is far less than that of the extensional springs at all but the smallest sarcomere lengths. Thus the majority of the elastic strain felt by the cross-bridge may arise from stretching, rather than rotation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The role that muscle' radial geometry plays in determining its functioning is still poorly understood. It is difficult to experimentally measure the forces muscle generates in the radial direction and the strain and energies which result from such forces. The studies that have attempted to measure radial forces have all done so indirectly, through back-calculating from changes in radial stiffness or lattice spacing changes on activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Cecchi1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Brenner1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Nyland1">[22]</xref>. While these are easier values to quantify, they are not direct measurements of radial force. Our results suggest radial forces, in addition to being quite large, may function as a “idden” energy storage mechanism, that radial force may partition energy into the cross-bridges which is not initially transmitted to the filament ends.</p>

        <title>Substantial energy is stored in muscle's contractile elements</title>
        <p>The elements of the sacomere's contractile lattice, cross-bridges as well as thick and filaments, are storing a substantial amount of energy. At peak energy levels where the 16% of bound cross-bridges in our model store <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002770.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of energy, each bound cross-bridge is storing approximately 20% of the work it is capable of producing across a power stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Mantovani1">[34]</xref>. The peak cross-bridge energy levels we see in of our half-sarcomere model is 0.084 J/kg of stored energy when the lattice is assumed to have the density of water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Millman1">[31]</xref>. This is more than 10% of the flight-permitting energy stored in Hemipteran flight muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Alexander2">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>This strain energy is primarily stored in the cross-bridges—rather than in the thick and thin filaments—despite the turnover and energy dissipation inherent in the our model of cross-bridge kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Williams1">[15]</xref>. Energy storage in the cross-bridges requires low cross-bridge turnover, as the deformation of an individual cross-bridge, and thus the energy in an individual cross-bridge, is released upon detachment. A “locked lattice” of tightly bound cross-bridges is likely to be present in a maximally activated isometric contraction, as simulated here, and where external factors such as temperature differentials reduce cross-bridge turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-George1">[8]</xref>. Energy stored in the muscle's filaments and cross-bridges is then available for later release and utilization.</p>

        <title>Radial force may be a ‘hidden’means of storing energy</title>
        <p>Radial force' role in muscle remains unclear. Radial force may simply be a byproduct of the motor and filament geometry which has evolved to generate force or it may produce a useful effect. The high correlation between radial force and strain energy stored in the cross-bridges may indicate that radial force and distortion act as an energy storage mechanism which permits the cross-bridges to store more strain based energy than the thick and thin filaments. It is possible that radially associated energy could then be redirected to produce axial force, much as happens when energy is stored in the deformation of elastic solids. Such a mechanism would provide a means to store the energy powering after-stretch transient shortening, the shortening of recently stretched muscle against a load equal to its maximal isometric force <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Cavagna1">[36]</xref>. Transient shortening has been suggested to be a result of energy elastically stored in cross-bridges at levels comparable to those seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g004">Figure 4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Mantovani1">[34]</xref>.</p>
        <p>However, radial strain based energy storage will not necessarily register as force at the filament ends. As such, it may be difficult to address in experiments, although radial stiffness observations suggest a means by which such tension and energy storage could be quantified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Nyland1">[22]</xref>.</p>

        <title>The fraction of energy stored varies with muscle length</title>
        <p>The variable energy retention efficiencies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002770-g005">Figure 5</xref> represent a potential mechanism by which sarcomere parameters can determine a muscle' functional role, e.g. motor, brake, or spring. A muscle that stores little of its consumed energy and converts most into force acts as a motor, while a muscle that stores more of its consumed energy for later release is acting, at least prior to use of stored energy, as a spring. There are analogous selections between roles in lengthening and shortening muscle, as contrasted to the isometric conditions simulated here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Dickinson1">[4]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The non-constant storage of input energy means that changing the degree of filament overlap or lattice spacing affects the amount of energy stored in muscle and thus the amount of energy which may be released to power contraction. Thus it is possible that operating at different sarcomere lengths could change the efficiency with which muscle retains energy or dissipates it, driving the muscle towards functioning as a spring or a break.</p>
        <p>Energy storage in muscle is still a relatively unexplored field. The highly structured and three-dimensional nature of muscle makes it likely that, historically, we have overlooked forms of energy storage and efficiency regulation. This work points towards cross-bridges as a site where energy can be stored, either in preparation for use in rapid movements or to reduce the energy requirements of cyclical movements. Further investigation of how energy is partitioned between sub-sarcomeric structures and of how radial force is generated will continue to expand our understanding of these new mechanisms. Particularly, this work may help us to understand cases where energy is stored as deformations in an axis orthogonal to that of the direction of muscle shortening, such as in a proposed mechanism by which the heart stores elastic strain introduced into transverse fibers during filling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-TorrentGuasp1">[37]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Lattice spacing changes with sarcomere length to maintain a constant lattice volume. Thus lattice spacing separating the faces of adjacent thick and thin filaments (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002770.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is given from sarcomere length (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002770.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002770.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002770.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a proportionality constant. This proportionality constant (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002770.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is chosen to set the lattice spacing to 14 nm at a sarcomere length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002770.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, values consistent with a wide range of muscle types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-Millman1">[31]</xref>.</p>

This rotation pattern is measured and described in Al-Khayat et al., 2008 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002770-AlKhayat1">[38]</xref>. As a result of this crown rotation every myosin head faces an opposite a thin filament with which it may interact.</p>

        <p>Future models may treat the filaments as radially-deformable axially-tensioned beams subject to filament persistence length, electrostatic effects, and viscous stresses and thus be able to permit radial movement. Radial bending or deformation of the thick and thin filaments could potentially reduce the level of radial force within the lattice by increasing lattice spacing disorder. Reduced radial force has the potential to affect the partitioning of energy between the cross-bridges and filaments, shifting energy stored in cross-bridge deformation to a newly-created radial deformation component of the thick and thin filaments' energies. Radial bending of the filaments and subsequent changes in the distribution of axial and radial forces will be resisted by the highly constrained nature of the sarcomere lattice as well as the inherent stiffnesses of the filaments themselves.</p>

        <p>A simulated contraction follows the course described in the diagram shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002770.s002">Figure S2</xref>. Briefly, each 1 ms time-step consists of allowing every myosin head to calculate the probability of changing from its current state into another state, check this probability against a random number, and transition or not based on the outcome. After the state of each myosin head has been established, the location of every interior point in the model is allowed to settle so that there is no net axial force on them. The axial force, radial force, and other properties of the system at that time-step are then recorded and a new time-step is begun if the contraction has not yet reached its end.</p>
        <p>The model was allowed to complete 10 contractions (starting from unbound cross-bridges) for every set of input parameters, each continuing for 400 ms (400 time-steps at 1 ms resolution). The asymptotically developed forces and energies were calculated as the mean of the force produced over the last 50 ms.</p>
        <p>These simulations took place on a dynamically created cluster of spot-priced machine instances in Amazon's EC2 service (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002770.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Control of this cluster was with a first-in-first-out command queue hosted by Amazon's SQS.</p>

          <p><bold>Model lattice arrangement.</bold> The model simulates a semi-infinite lattice with four myosin and eight actin filaments, as in Tanner et al., 2007. The bolder filaments and cross-bridge interactions are those which are directly simulated, while the desaturated filaments are the bold filaments mirrored across a boundary. Cross-bridge interactions that cross a boundary condition to a mirrored thin filament are connected only to their non-mirrored thick filament. This lattice geometry is used as it is the smallest arrangement of thick and thin filaments that: 1) maintains the physiological ratio of thick to thin filaments and 2) permits tessellation of the existing filaments without causing a single thick filament to face a thin filament more than once.</p>

          <p><bold>Sequence diagram of remote simulation process.</bold> This sequence depicts the process of running and retrieving results from Amazon's Web Services (AWS). Three AWS services are used: the Simple Storage Service (S3), the Simple Queue Service (SQS), and the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The custom Python code which constitutes the model is sent to and stored in S3. The parameters which describe simulations are parsed into small jobs, which are sent to SQS. The remote cluster which will run the simulation is configured on EC2. When machine instances which make up the cluster are allocated and have started, they connect to S3 and download a copy of the model. They then connect to SQS and request jobs to run on each of their available cores. As jobs are completed, their results are uploaded to S3 and the completed job is removed from the SQS queue. The machine instances of the cluster will continue this process until the job queue is empty at which point they shut themselves down. The complete result set may then be downloaded for local processing, or processed by another EC2 cluster, as needed.</p>

Where possible, values used are common to a wide array of striated muscle. By choosing conserved values, a more general model is produced and the necessity of computationally intractable sensitivity analyses is avoided. All values are given for the half-sarcomere model and thus refer to one half of a thick or a thin filament.</p>
