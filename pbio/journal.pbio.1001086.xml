        <article-title>Not All Genes Are Equal; Shortage of Histones Affects Some Genes More Than Others</article-title>
      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>The basic unit of genome packaging is the nucleosome, and nucleosomes have long been proposed to restrict DNA accessibility both to damage and to transcription. Nucleosome number in cells was considered fixed, but recently aging yeast and mammalian cells were shown to contain fewer nucleosomes. We show here that mammalian cells lacking High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1) contain a reduced amount of core, linker, and variant histones, and a correspondingly reduced number of nucleosomes, possibly because HMGB1 facilitates nucleosome assembly. Yeast <italic>nhp6</italic> mutants lacking Nhp6a and -b proteins, which are related to HMGB1, also have a reduced amount of histones and fewer nucleosomes. Nucleosome limitation in both mammalian and yeast cells increases the sensitivity of DNA to damage, increases transcription globally, and affects the relative expression of about 10% of genes. In yeast <italic>nhp6</italic> cells the loss of more than one nucleosome in four does not affect the location of nucleosomes and their spacing, but nucleosomal occupancy. The decrease in nucleosomal occupancy is non-uniform and can be modelled assuming that different nucleosomal sites compete for available histones. Sites with a high propensity to occupation are almost always packaged into nucleosomes both in wild type and nucleosome-depleted cells; nucleosomes on sites with low propensity to occupation are disproportionately lost in nucleosome-depleted cells. We suggest that variation in nucleosome number, by affecting nucleosomal occupancy both genomewide and gene-specifically, constitutes a novel layer of epigenetic regulation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The accurate preservation and correct retrieval of genetic information is crucial for all living organisms. In eukaryotes, whether single-celled yeast or complex mammals, the DNA containing the genetic information is wrapped around beads of histone proteins to form structures called nucleosomes along the length of the DNA; this packaging arrangement helps protect the genome from damage and may restrict access to the genetic information. Until recently, the amount of histones and, consequently, the number of nucleosomes in the cell were considered fixed. Here, we show that in both mammalian and yeast cells that lack a single protein—HMGB1 in mammals or Nhp6a/b in yeast—the abundance of histones and nucleosomes decreases by 20%–30%. Contrary to expectations, we found that in yeast the nucleosomes do not redistribute along DNA when they are fewer: they largely maintain their positions, but the amount of time each specific DNA site spends wrapped in a nucleosome (i.e., its occupancy) decreases. Sequences that are already less frequently occupied than others in normal yeast cells lose disproportionally more nucleosomes in the mutant yeast that lack Nhp6a/b. This gives rise to a global increase in transcription and specific alterations in the expression of certain genes. This study thus contributes to a deeper understanding of how the DNA is packaged and organized. It also suggests that the cell's histone content might contribute in an important way to gene regulation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In eukaryotic cells, genetic information is organized in chromatin, a highly conserved structural polymer of DNA and histones whose basic unit is the nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Kornberg1">[1]</xref>. Dynamic changes in the local or global organization of chromatin are required in order to perform most nuclear activities, including replication, transcription, and DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Li1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Groth1">[3]</xref>. Maintenance of such a dynamic structure, in terms of spatial distribution of nucleosomes and proper reorganization during nuclear activities, is considered crucial to preserve cellular identity and to protect cells from genomic instabilities that are among the major causative factors in aging and cancer. Until recently, no gross modifications of nucleosome number in cells were described or even looked for, even if differences in nucleosome linker length were observed between different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-vanHolde1">[4]</xref>. However, recent work has showed that aging yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Feser1">[5]</xref> and mammalian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-OSullivan1">[6]</xref> cells contain fewer nucleosomes. We show here that mammalian cells lacking High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) protein contain a substantially reduced amount of histones and nucleosomes. Yeast cells lacking Nhp6a/Nhp6b proteins, which are functionally similar to HMGB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Stillman1">[7]</xref>, have a very similar phenotype, suggesting that the involvement of HMG-box proteins in controlling nucleosome number is conserved in evolution.</p>
      <p>HMGB1 is an abundant non-histone chromatin protein that binds to the minor groove of DNA without sequence specificity and, to a large number of nuclear proteins, contributing to the maintenance, retrieval, and expression of genetic information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Bianchi1">[8]</xref>. HMGB1 is composed by two DNA binding domains, called HMG-boxes, followed by a long unstructured tail that appears to modulate the interaction of the HMG-boxes with DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Thomas1">[9]</xref>. HMGB1 binds to nucleosomes at the dyad axis and appears to compete with histone H1, exerting opposite effects: HMGB1 facilitates nucleosome sliding and makes chromatin more accessible, H1 restrains nucleosome sliding and makes chromatin less accessible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Bonaldi1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Gerlitz1">[11]</xref>. <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− mice die soon after birth with a complex, pleiotropic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Calogero1">[12]</xref>. Yeast cells contain two abundant HMG-box proteins, called Nhp6a and Nhp6b, which are composed of a single, non-sequence-specific HMG-box and are functionally redundant, since the loss of only one of the two Nhp6 proteins causes a very mild phenotype.</p>
      <p>Both mammalian cells lacking HMGB1 and yeast cells lacking both Nhp6a and -b are viable, although they display a number of defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Calogero1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Paull1">[13]</xref>. Specifically, the <italic>nhp6a/b</italic> double mutant (henceforth <italic>nhp6</italic>) yeast cells and <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− MEFs display genomic instability and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents; <italic>nhp6</italic> cells have a shorter life span and increased levels of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (a hallmark of senescence) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Giavara1">[14]</xref>. Curiously, in both mammalian and yeast mutants, a given dose of UV irradiation appeared to produce almost twice as many thymidine dimers as in wild type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Giavara1">[14]</xref>. We show here that these cells are also more sensitive to ionizing radiation, which is due to a genomewide reduction in DNA-binding proteins, notably histones. Thus, both mammalian <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− cells and <italic>nhp6</italic> yeast cells have fewer nucleosomes. This raised the critical question of where available nucleosomes are located when they are fewer. We found that, at least in yeast (but most likely also in mammalian cells), the reduction in nucleosome number does not alter nucleosome spacing and location, but reduces nucleosomal occupancy in a non-uniform way in different sites and is associated with an overall increase in transcript abundance and a specific alteration in the expression of a subset of genes.</p>

        <title>Mammalian Cells Lacking HMGB1 Are More Sensitive to Ionizing Radiation</title>
        <p>Previous results indicated that a given dose of UV irradiation produced almost twice as many thymidine dimers in mammalian cells lacking HMGB1 and yeast cells lacking Nhp6 proteins compared to wild type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Giavara1">[14]</xref>.

        <p>We irradiated primary wild type and <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− MEFs with 10 Gy of gamma rays; we measured the formation of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA breaks in individual cells by means of the comet assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Hartmann1">[15]</xref>, whereby in the presence of an electrophoretic field short DNA fragments migrate out of the lysed cell and into the agarose, whereas intact DNA remains confined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, left). The tail moment, which is a measure of DNA fragmentation, indicated that <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− MEFs contained more DNA breaks before irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, right). The number of DNA breaks induced by irradiation was higher in <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− cells; this could not be ascribed to defective DNA repair since the cells were subjected to the assay immediately after irradiation, before DNA repair could deal with the breaks. We also quantitated γH2AX levels after irradiation with gamma rays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g001">Figure 1B</xref>): substantially more H2AX is phosphorylated in <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− cells relative to wild type cells after 1 h, but the difference subsides after 6 h. This suggests that <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− cells can repair effectively double strand breaks.</p>

        <p>We confirmed these results in HeLa cells stably transfected with a plasmid expressing HMGB1 shRNA (HeLa knockdown, henceforth KD) or a control plasmid. HMGB1 expression was almost abolished by the HMGB1 shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), and cycling KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) contained less core and linker histones (about 80% compared to the control HeLa cells) and more beta-actin (about 120%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s001">Figure S1C</xref>, upper panel).</p>

Control cells were grown for 8 passages in either light medium (Arg0 Lys0) or medium containing C13,N15-labelled arginine and lysine (Arg10 Lys8); KD cells were grown in light medium only. Light and heavy cells were mixed 1∶1 before lysis, subjected to SDS-PAGE and in-gel trypsin digestion; peptides were quantitated by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). HMGB1-derived tryptic peptides were absent in KD cells, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). In the control experiment (which compared heavy and light HMGB1-containing control cells) the ratios of light to heavy proteins had a narrow log-normal distribution (standard deviation close to 0.13). In contrast, when comparing light KD and heavy control cells these ratios showed a much wider distribution (standard deviation close to 0.37) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). The abundance of most proteins changed slightly but significantly, albeit few proteins showed a change larger than 2-fold (MS tracings for a few representative peptides are shown, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). We then investigated the relative abundance of all histone-derived peptides that do not bear post-translational modifications; we excluded peptides known to bear modifications because a difference in their abundance could be due to variations in modification, rather than to a difference in the quantity of the histone protein. Notably, peptides from core and linker histones were reduced by about 25% in HMGB1-depleted cells (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−5</sup> by two-sample Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g002">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s002">S2D</xref>).

        <title>The Histone Content of Mammalian Cells Can Be Reduced Transiently and Reversibly</title>
        <p>A lower histone content might be due to compensatory mutations selected in response to the lack of HMGB1 in <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− cells. In this case, rare mutant cells might be selected during in vitro culture and expand into viable clones. Alternatively, all cells might be able to modulate histone content in response to their physiological state, including the available level of HMGB1 protein. To distinguish between the possibilities, we transfected HeLa cells with 21-mer double-stranded HMGB1 siRNA, verified the disappearance of HMGB1, and grew the cells for 10 d until the amount of HMGB1 returned to normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, the amount of histone H3 decreased concomitantly with the decrease in HMGB1, down to less than 80% of the starting level, and then recovered concomitantly with the recovery in HMGB1 content. HeLa cells transfected with control firefly luciferase siRNA showed no change in either HMGB1 or histone H3 content. Since there was no gross cell death after siRNA transfection, cells with a reduced histone content are not rare clones selected from a large cell population; rather, most cells in the population down-regulate histone content in response to a lack of HMGB1, and this regulation is reversible.</p>
        <p>To further establish the physiological interdependence between HMGB1 and histone content we examined MEFs derived from <italic>Hmgb1</italic>+/− heterozygous embryos; these have one half the amount of HMGB1 protein and contain about 90% of the normal amount of histones, which is intermediate between the amount in wild type and in <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− MEFs (unpublished data). Finally, we verified that <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− embryo livers contain a 20% reduction in histone content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s004">Figure S4</xref>), further excluding that the observed histone reduction in cultured cells can be due to culture conditions.</p>

To verify the hypothesis that the DNA of <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− cells might be wrapped into fewer nucleosomes, cells were partially lysed and chromatin was digested with increasing amounts of micrococcal nuclease (MNase).

        <p>We tested the effect of HMGB1 on histone deposition onto naked DNA using a simple, commercially available assay (Chromatin Assembly Kit by Active Motif).

No DNA remained after nuclease digestion if histones were absent from the assembly reaction (lane 3–4), whereas a clear band of mononucleosomal size was present in the presence of histones (lane 5). We then added to the reaction mix increasing concentrations of HMGB1, and we noted a highly significant dose-dependent increase in the mononucleosome band (lanes 6–9), reaching a maximal yield at 1 µg/ml. At higher HMGB1 concentrations, the efficiency of nucleosome deposition decreased (lanes 10–12).

        <title>Yeast Cells with a Reduced Nucleosome Number Have a Distinct Transcriptional Profile</title>
        <p>A transient model of nucleosome depletion in yeast was examined previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Wyrick1">[22]</xref>. In the UKY403 yeast strain, the sole copy of histone H4 is under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. In glucose medium, UKY403 cells lost around 50% of nucleosomes by 6 h, relative to a control strain with a wild type H4 gene, and the expression of 15% of genes increased and the expression of 10% of genes decreased more than 3-fold.</p>
        <p>We then looked at the relative expression of genes in wild type and <italic>nhp6</italic> cells and compared them to those in the UKY403 strain. By Affymetrix analysis we found that out of 5,447 genes, 219 are up and 251 are down in <italic>nhp6</italic> relative to wild type cells (1.5-fold threshold and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). The Gene Ontology categories that are significantly affected are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s007">Figure S7</xref>. The correlation between gene expression profiles in UKY403 and <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) rises from r<sup>2</sup>&lt;0, when nucleosomes are not depleted in UKY403, to almost 0.16 after 2 h (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−33</sup>), and remains almost constant thereafter. Since about half of the genes transcriptionally affected by nucleosome depletion in the UKY403 strain are also affected by slow growth, we asked whether our results were influenced by the slow growth of the <italic>nhp6</italic> mutant relative to its wild type counterpart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Paull1">[13]</xref>. Indeed, the correlation between the two strains is much stronger for the growth-related gene subset; however, the correlation for the genes unresponsive to changes in growth rate is only slightly smaller (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.15, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>) than the one for all genes. Taken together, these data suggest that nucleosomal depletion affects transcription profiles in broadly similar ways in strains where histone H4 is depleted or Nhp6a/b proteins are lacking.</p>

        <title>In Yeast Cells a Reduced Nucleosome Number Affects Primarily Nucleosome Occupancy and Not Nucleosome Position</title>
        <p>Research in the last few years has highlighted the importance of nucleosome positioning in the control of transcription; we therefore asked how nucleosome depletion affects genomewide nucleosome positioning.</p>
        <p>The hypothesis of statistical positioning states that nucleosomes space themselves between barriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Mavrich1">[23]</xref>. In this case, the position of nucleosomes should vary when their number is lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, hypothesis 1). According to the alternative hypothesis that DNA sequence is the major determinant of nucleosome positioning, nucleosome limitation could lead to the selective loss of a minority of nucleosomes (hypothesis 2). Alternatively, nucleosomes might occupy the same positions, but spend less time on each of them (hypothesis 3; nucleosome “occupancy” of individual sequences is reduced).</p>

In wild type cells five nucleosomes cover ∼1 kb of DNA (first row). The schemes represent a 20% reduction in nucleosome content: 4 nucleosomes can redistribute over 1 kb (hypothesis 1), or 1 nucleosomal site is left vacant (hypothesis 2), or all 5 sites are occupied by nucleosomes but only 80% of the time relative to the wild type (hypothesis 3).

        </fig>
        <p>When we applied high throughput sequencing to MNase-resistant DNA from <italic>nhp6</italic> and wild type cells, we found that the distribution of sequence reads was very similar. Representative snapshots of the nucleosome maps are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; a complete browsable form is available at the website indicated in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.</p>
        <p>The number of times a specific base pair appears in sequence reads, divided by the total number of sequence reads, is the relative occupancy of that base pair. Relative occupancies of all base pairs can then be compared between strains; a density dot plot allows a visual representation of such a comparison. The comparison between biological replicates gives a density plot where most bases cluster around the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, right). The comparison between <italic>nhp6</italic> and wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, left) gives a density plot which is more dispersed about the diagonal and has a characteristic skew with more points below the diagonal at low occupancy and more points above the diagonal at high occupancy. This result is inconsistent with a global redistribution of nucleosomes over the genome (hypothesis 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), which would give a smeared density plot with a lot of points close to the axes (base pairs occupied in one strain but not in the other). Our result is also inconsistent with the disappearance of nucleosomes from a minority of sites (hypothesis 2), which would give a density plot with two separate sub-populations, as simulated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s008">Figure S8A</xref>.</p>
        <p>In fact, the similarity of the <italic>nhp6</italic>/wt density plot to that of biological replicates indicates that most base pairs that are occupied by nucleosomes in wild type cells are also occupied in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells. A complete identity between nucleosome positions in the two strains (although with reduced occupancy in one strain) would give the same density plot of biological replicates. Thus all three hypotheses depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6A</xref> do not correspond to observation, but hypothesis 3 comes closest.</p>
        <p>We next moved from coverage at individual base pairs to examination of nucleosome positions. We used template filtering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Weiner1">[24]</xref> to call nucleosome positions and confirmed that they are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, “nuc calls”). Almost half of the nucleosomes are centered around the same position in both strains, many are offset by about 10 base pairs and some by 20 pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s008">Figure S8B</xref>); we note that 10-bp shifts correspond to those expected from the rotational periodicity of DNA wrapped around the nucleosome. Only about 30% of nucleosomes had shifted by more than 20 base pairs. This confirms that most nucleosomes occupy approximately the same location in the two strains. However, in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells fewer nucleosomes were unambiguously called (45,441 versus 53,643), and the read peaks that identify nucleosome edges were broadened in the <italic>nhp6</italic> sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). This suggests that some nucleosomes may shift from a single favored position into a superposition of multiple overlapping positions (“fuzzy nucleosomes”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Mavrich1">[23]</xref>); beyond a certain degree of fuzziness, nucleosomes would not be called by the algorithm. The length of DNA predicted to be covered by nucleosomes was reduced on average and had increased variability in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s008">Figure S8C</xref>), consistent with increased fuzziness.</p>
        <p>As observed at the single base pair level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), many nucleosomal sites are either less or more relatively occupied in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells. This is clearly visible in the snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, showing three different loci with decreased, unchanged, and increased relative occupancy, respectively. Absolute occupancy is proportional to the nucleosome number, and thus is reduced by about 30% in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells. As a result, on some sites absolute occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells may be comparable to that in the wild type (but not higher), whereas on the vast majority of sites it will be reduced or very reduced. High-resolution primer extension analysis confirmed a similar position of nucleosomes in the <italic>ars1</italic> locus, but with higher accessibility of nucleosome-covered sequences (and thus lower absolute occupancy) in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). Nucleosome ChIP (using an antibody against histone H3) also was in agreement with reduced nucleosome occupancy of the <italic>ars1</italic> locus in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s009">Figure S9B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Overall, these results are in accordance with increased chromatin accessibility in the <italic>nhp6</italic> mutant and suggest that nucleosomes have increased mobility on the sites they occupy (either intrinsic or catalyzed by nucleosome remodelling complexes).</p>

        <title>Nucleosome Position and Occupancy Over Gene Control Regions in <italic>nhp6</italic> Cells</title>
        <p>Nucleosomal organization of the control regions of genes is considered most important for gene expression. In yeast, nucleosomes are regularly arranged on protein-coding genes, starting from the transcriptional start site (TSS). A nucleosome-depleted region (NDR, also called nucleosome-free region, NFR) of about 140 bp is generally found just upstream of the TSS and is surrounded by two well-positioned nucleosomes, called −1 and +1 nucleosome, respectively. We aligned genes by their TSS and ranked them by the severity of nucleosome loss in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, heatmap in the center). All genes had reduced occupancy of the −1 nucleosomes (green streak in the heatmap), and genes with more severe nucleosome loss at the 5′ end also had reduced nucleosome occupancy over the gene body. Once again, we observed that the genes with more severe nucleosome loss in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, center) were the ones already low in nucleosome occupancy in the wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, right, red line). A few genes appeared to have relatively increased occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (red genes in the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g007">Figure 7A</xref>); these genes belong primarily to the Gene Ontology categories “metabolism” and “cell wall”. None of these genes, however, appeared to have increased absolute nucleosome occupancy (i.e., after considering that nucleosome number is reduced by about 30% in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells).</p>

        <title>A Simple Model Predicts Nucleosome Occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> Cells Starting from Nucleosome Occupancy in Wild Type Cells</title>
        <p>In all our analyses, from the correlation of base pair occupancy to the distribution of nucleosomes over genes, a theme stands out: the reduction in nucleosome number is associated with an increase in the variability of relative occupancy. From the point of absolute occupancy, we have already pointed out that some sites might be similarly occupied in wild type and <italic>nhp6</italic> strains, while sites that are intermediately occupied in the wild type are less occupied in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells, and weakly occupied sites in the wild type are much less occupied in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells. The skew in the density plot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g006">Figure 6C</xref> visually represents this pattern of more pronounced loss of occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells from sites that are already less occupied in the wild type.</p>
        <p>Unequal occupancy of nucleosomal sites in vivo is expected, since (1) in vitro the probability of nucleosome occupancy on different sites can vary by a factor of up to 5,000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Lowary1">[25]</xref> and (2) histone octamers are insufficient to package all the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Segal1">[26]</xref>. Thus, in physiological conditions some sites will be occupied close to 100% of the time (“saturated”) and some much less. Based on these considerations, we designed a model to account for the characteristic pattern of nucleosomal occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells. We assume that all sites compete for a finite pool of histones that is insufficient for all of them, and that each site has a certain probability of being occupied, that depends from histone availability. We also posit that the probability of occupation versus availability of histones is a hyperbolic function and is different for each site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). This model recalls formally the formation of a complex between two macromolecules, and we can thus assign a dissociation constant k<sub>i</sub> to each nucleosome. The occupancy O of site i is then O<sub>i</sub> = <italic>x</italic>/(<italic>x</italic>+k<sub>i</sub>), where k<sub>i</sub> is the dissociation constant and <italic>x</italic> is the concentration of available histones. A decrease in the availability of histones will result in a skewed desaturation, with heavy nucleosome loss at sites of high dissociation constant and mild loss at sites of low dissociation constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g008">Figure 8A,B</xref>). This will increase the variability of relative occupancy.</p>

            <p>(A) Affinity model based on saturation of nucleosomal sites. Since there are more DNA sites that can be assembled into nucleosomes than histone octamers, the occupancy of each site (<italic>y</italic>-axis) will be determined by the availability of non-nucleosomal histones (<italic>x</italic>-axis) and the relative dissociation constant (k<sub>i</sub>) of histones at that site (blue, low k<sub>i</sub>; green, medium k<sub>i</sub>; red, high k<sub>i</sub>). Upon decreasing the availability of histones (black vertical line on the left), the occupancy of sites with high dissociation constant decreases more than the occupancy of sites with low dissociation constant.

        <p>Based on the relative occupancy of wild type sites, the model should be able to predict the genomewide occupancy for a certain decrease in available histones (details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s008">Figure S8E</xref>). We then used our model to simulate the relative occupancies in a population of cells which have a 30% reduction in histone content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The density dot plot comparing <italic>simulated</italic> and <italic>observed</italic> occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, right) is almost symmetrical about the diagonal and corrects the observed systematic skew in the density dot plot of <italic>nph6</italic>/wt relative occupancies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, left), although the dispersion of values is not decreased substantially. We also plotted the distribution of the number of nucleosomes at each occupancy value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g008">Figure 8D</xref>); our model correctly predicts the approximate shape of the distribution for <italic>nhp6</italic> cells and the position of the mode. The fitting between the observed and predicted <italic>nhp6</italic> occupancies is optimal at the nucleosome content actually observed for <italic>nhp6</italic> cells. An alternative model based on statistical positioning does not justify our observations, since it predicts that both position and spacing of nucleosomes would be changed when histone content is reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s008">Figure S8F</xref>, red line), contrary to what we observed.</p>
        <p>Overall, our model justifies the disproportionate loss of nucleosomes from weakly occupied sites, and the increase in relative occupancy at the more occupied sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g008">Figure 8D</xref>, far tail of the distribution). We then asked whether the sites with reduced occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells are the ones with lower intrinsic ability to form nucleosomes. To this aim, we compared our dataset with the dataset obtained by reconstituting yeast chromatin in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Kaplan1">[27]</xref>. The comparison of changes in nucleosomal occupancy between our <italic>nhp6</italic>/wt dataset and Kaplan's in vitro/in vivo dataset is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g008">Figure 8E</xref>. The Pearson correlation coefficient between datasets is r<sup>2</sup> = 0.46 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>), indicating that the sites that most lose occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells correspond to the ones with lower occupancy in reconstituted chromatin; conversely, the sites that lose less occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells correspond to the ones that most easily reform chromatin in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g008">Figure 8E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Nucleosome Number Is Not Fixed</title>
        <p>We show here that the absence of HMGB1 or Nhp6a/b proteins causes substantial histone and nucleosome depletion in mammalian and yeast cells; surprisingly, nucleosome depletion is compatible with cell survival.</p>
        <p>While our work was in progress, a substantial reduction in the histone content in chromatin was described in aging yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Feser1">[5]</xref>; forced expression of plasmid-borne histone genes was shown to increase the lifespan of yeast cells. Our results independently confirm that yeast cells can contain a variable amount of chromatinized histones and that reduced histone content leads to aging: <italic>nhp6</italic> yeast mutants, which we show have a reduced histone and nucleosome content, have a reduced lifespan and an increased level of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles, which are a hallmark of aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Giavara1">[14]</xref>. Histone depletion has also been demonstrated in aging mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-OSullivan1">[6]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We also confirm a correlation between nucleosome depletion and an increase in DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-OSullivan1">[6]</xref>. We suggest that a decrease in nucleosome number increases DNA damage because DNA is more exposed to DNA damaging agents, as indicated by in vitro experiments showing that nucleosomes protect DNA from hydroxyl radicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Elia1">[16]</xref>. Reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl radicals, are produced also by basal metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Vilenchik1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Parrinello1">[29]</xref>, which may explain an increase in DNA breaks in non-irradiated <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− cells.</p>
        <p>We also report that nucleosome depletion correlates with a global increase in transcript abundance. Our observation in living cells supports the current notion (based on experiments in vitro) that nucleosomes limit the accessibility of DNA to the transcription machinery.</p>
        <p>We have asked what happens to the basic organization of eukaryotic genomes when only a limited number of nucleosomes can be formed. The prevailing view was that histones are deposited until all DNA is packaged. Indeed, Kornberg and Stryer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Kornberg2">[30]</xref> proposed that the fairly uniform spacing of nucleosomes along DNA arises from the “statistical positioning” of nucleosomes between fixed barriers, so that when the DNA is saturated with histones, each nucleosome finds itself within a narrow distribution of distances from the preceding nucleosome. As a consequence, when the number of nucleosomes is reduced, the distance between nucleosomes should increase. This is not what we find, neither in yeast nor in mammalian cells.</p>
        <p>At least in yeast, nucleosomes largely occupy the same positions also when nucleosome number is lower than usual; nucleosome occupancy drops, but not uniformly. In general, sites that are highly occupied in wild type cells remain highly occupied also in nuclesosome-poor <italic>nhp6</italic> cells, whereas nucleosomes are mostly lost from sites that already had low occupancy in wild type. This creates a ranking of sites for nucleosome occupancy, which can be at least partially explained by a model that assumes formally that each site has its own affinity for histones available for deposition. This is certainly compatible with models that affirm that nucleosome position is driven largely by DNA sequence. Indeed, the comparison between Kaplan's and our datasets indicates that the sites that are more nucleosome-depleted in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells are the ones with lower intrinsic propensity to form nucleosomes. Anyway, our model does not exclude strong contributions to nucleosomal location by active processes such as nucleosome deposition, sliding, eviction, or remodeling, as will be discussed in the following sections.</p>

        <title>Critical Issues in Determining Nucleosome Location and Occupancy</title>
        <p>Nucleosomal position is measured directly in yeast, by identifying the borders of MNase-resistant DNA sequences, as is relative nucleosomal occupancy, by dividing the number of reads of a specific MNase-resistant sequence by the total number of MNase-resistant sequence reads. However, absolute nucleosomal occupancy is calculated by multiplying relative occupancy by the amount of nucleosomally organized DNA. We consider that DNA remaining after MNase digestion represents nucleosomally organized DNA, but an alternative explanation is often favored: chromatin may become more accessible to MNase not because of a variation in nucleosome number but because of unspecified changes in higher-order chromatin organization. This alternative explanation is not compatible with the topological analysis of plasmid supercoiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), which does not depend on MNase digestion nor in fact on any other type of chromatin accessibility, but only on the number of nucleosomes residing on the plasmid at the time of extraction. Most of all, the alternative explanation does not fit with the reduced abundance of histones: since only about 0.1% of histones are not engaged within nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Gunjan1">[31]</xref>, a reduced amount of histones must be reflected in a decreased number of nucleosomes.</p>
        <p>Measuring histone content is therefore critical in interpreting alterations in chromatin organization. Nucleosomes were also recently mapped in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells by Dowell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Dowell1">[32]</xref>; our results, despite the different approach (high throughput sequencing versus hybridization to tiled chips), broadly agree with theirs, but the interpretations are different. Dowell et al. infer that Nhp6 proteins stabilize nucleosomes directly, possibly by interacting with them; we infer that nucleosome occupancy is substantially reduced in most nucleosomal locations, due to decreased histone content. Although they are different, the two interpretations are not mutually exclusive, and indeed specific interaction with Nhp6 proteins might explain the preferential loss of nucleosome +1 at the 5′ end of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Dowell1">[32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Other yeast mutants (for example, <italic>spt10</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Eriksson1">[33]</xref>) show an “altered” organization of chromatin, with increased accessibility to MNase digestion and altered plasmid topology. We speculate that if histone abundances were measured in these mutants, they might turn out to have reduced histone content and decreased global nucleosomal occupancy. This might be a fairly common phenotype that was overlooked so far.</p>
        <p>The same argument—that decreased histone content must correspond to fewer nucleosomes—also applies to mammalian cells. Genomewide nucleosomal location and occupancy are more difficult to determine, however. The decrease in nucleosome number does not cause an increase in internucleosomal distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001086.s001">S1D</xref>), but we cannot show rigorously that nucleosome position is conserved, both because of the significant effort and cost of resequencing entire mammalian genomes and because the majority of sequences in mammals are repeated and cannot be assigned to a specific genome position. Thus, even if all mappable nucleosome borders were conserved, non-mappable nucleosome borders (which are the majority in the mammalian genome) might be substantially altered.</p>

        <title>HMG-Box Proteins Are Involved in Genome Chromatinization in Yeast and Mammalian Cells</title>
        <p>Despite remaining uncertainties on nucleosomal positions and occupancy in mammalian cells lacking HMGB1, the similarity in phenotype between mammalian and yeast mutants is striking. This suggests that HMG-box proteins might have been involved in determining the number of nucleosomes since the emergence of eukaryotes.</p>
        <p>HMGB1 and Nhp6 proteins are functionally similar, and both bend DNA. Since DNA must be bent to wrap around histone octamers and this entails a high energy of activation, DNA-bending proteins might lower the activation energy and provide a chaperone activity on DNA for nucleosome assembly. Expression of a Nhp6 mutant protein unable to bend DNA does not revert the phenotype of Δ<italic>nhp6</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Dowell1">[32]</xref>, suggesting that DNA bending is required for the correct chromatinization of the yeast genome. We observed that there is a significant correlation in the yeast genome between the intrinsic propensity to assemble nucleosomes in vitro from high-salt solutions of histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Kaplan1">[27]</xref> and the nucleosomal occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g008">Figure 8E</xref>); this suggests that sites that have an intrinsic difficulty in assembling nucleosomes most need the presence of a DNA-bending protein.</p>
        <p>Likewise, we argue that HMGB1 can provide a DNA chaperone activity for nucleosome assembly in mammalian cells: we show that in vitro HMGB1 accelerates nucleosome assembly onto naked DNA.</p>
        <p>A chaperone activity only changes the rate of the biological reaction (by lowering the activation energy), and not the equilibrium; thus, we suggest that nucleosome assembly is never at equilibrium in living cells and that the absence of a DNA chaperone will move nucleosome assembly further away from the equilibrium level. This hypothesis has not been formally tested, but we note that the high rate of nucleosome dynamics in living cells makes it very unlikely that equilibrium is ever reached.</p>
        <p>We also note that a delay or reduction in nucleosome assembly would lead to a decrease in histone biosynthesis or an increase in histone degradation, or both, via the activity of several feedback control loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Gunjan1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Marzluff1">[34]</xref>. As a consequence, the steady state level of histones in the cell would fall, which is what we observe.</p>
        <p>HMG-box proteins can also affect nucleosome dynamics in different ways. For example, we had previously shown that HMGB1 enhances nucleosome remodeling in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Bonaldi1">[10]</xref>, and the group of Karen Vasquez had shown that histones are not acetylated after DNA damage in the absence of HMGB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Lange1">[35]</xref>. In yeast, Nhp6 proteins are non-essential components of the FACT complex (in contrast, the absence of the other components Pob3 and Spt16 causes lethality) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Stillman1">[7]</xref>; the absence of Nhp6 proteins can thus affect nucleosome remodeling associated to transcription. All these activities can affect nucleosomal occupancy directly or indirectly.</p>

        <title>Nucleosome Limitation Correlates with Increased Global Gene Expression and with a Specific Transcriptomic Profile</title>
        <p>Nucleosomal occupancy over promoters is a powerful determinant of gene expression. Since we show that genomewide nucleosomal occupancy varies non-uniformly in response to nucleosome depletion, specific transcriptional profiles are expected to ensue. This is exactly what we observe. In both mammalian <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− cells and yeast <italic>nhp6</italic> cells, specific genes have increased or decreased expression relative to the rest. These gene-specific effects are distinct from the overall increase in transcription that also takes place and might depend in part on the specific interactions of HMGB1 and Nhp6 proteins with nucleosomes and transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Dowell1">[32]</xref>. In turn, changes in gene expression can determine changes in the cell cycle and in cell metabolism, which can lead to further changes in nucleosomal occupancy and gene expression; this makes it difficult to disentangle cause from effect in the phenotype of <italic>nhp6</italic> yeast cells and <italic>Hmgb1</italic>−/− mammalian cells. However, the correlation of transcriptomic profiles in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001086-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) and in cells where transcription of histone H4 has been shut off <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001086-Wyrick1">[22]</xref> suggests that histone depletion is by itself partially responsible for the altered expression of a subset of genes. We therefore propose that overall histone content and the associated modulation of the genomewide and gene-specific nucleosomal landscapes represents a novel layer of epigenetic control of transcription.</p>

          <p>SILAC-based quantitative proteomic analysis of control and KD HeLa cells. (A) Scheme of the experimental setup for SILAC, with examples of the MS readout: proteins not responding to HMGB1 depletion show a peptide ratio equal to 1 (orange pairs), whereas peak ratios of protein up- or down-regulated differ from 1 (green and blue pairs). (B) Representative mass spectra for SILAC pairs from various proteins: left column, peptide pairs from reference experiment (control (light) : control (heavy)); right column, peptide pairs from the KD (light) : control (heavy) experiment. Peptide KHPDASVNFSEFSK of HMGB1 has ratio L/H (light/heavy) = 0.1, indicative of 90% depletion efficiency; peptide DAVTYTEHAK from H4 exemplifies histone down-regulation in the light KD sample (L/H = 0.64); peptide LLLEYTDSSYEEK from Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 exemplifies an up-regulated protein (L/H = 1.87); peptide GLFIIDGK from peroxiredoxin-2 represents proteins with ratio ∼1. (C) Left panel: histogram of log<sub>2</sub> normalized protein L/H ratios (<italic>n</italic> = 1,818) of the reference proteomes, fitting a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.13. Right panel: the wider distribution (SD = 0.37, <italic>n</italic> = 1,813) indicates that a large number of proteins changed their expression level after HMGB1 knockdown. (D) Overlay of the log<sub>2</sub> protein L/H ratio distributions from the KD : control and control : control experiments.</p>

          <p>Additional information on nucleosome position and modelling of results. (A) Density dot plot showing the simulated relative occupancy per bp of wild type (<italic>x</italic>-axis) versus <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (<italic>y</italic>-axis), assuming that 75% of nucleosomes have the same occupancy, and 25% have very reduced occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells (not zero, otherwise they would all fall on the <italic>x</italic>-axis). Two subpopulations are immediately apparent. (B) Left: histogram showing the frequency distribution of variation in center positions between nucleosomes from wild type and <italic>nhp6</italic> cells. Right: cumulative frequency distribution of variation in center positions. (C) Distribution of the length of DNA covered by nucleosomes, as identified by template filtering. (D) log<sub>2</sub> ratios (<italic>nhp6</italic>/wt) of nucleosome occupancy over the entire coding regions of genes grouped in 5 classes (down-regulated to unchanged and up-regulated in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells). Blue dots represent the median log<sub>2</sub> ratio in the group and the black line shows the 0.25 and 0.75 quartiles. The correlation of −0.07 is statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>). (E) In our model, the occupancy O of nucleosome i is defined by O<sub>i</sub> = <italic>x</italic>/(<italic>x</italic>+k<sub>i</sub>), where <italic>x</italic> is an unknown parameter of the concentration of available histones and k<sub>i</sub> is the dissociation constant. <italic>x</italic> was set to 1 for the wild type sample and k<sub>i</sub> was extracted using the measured wild type occupancies. Average occupancy in <italic>nhp6</italic> cells is reduced to 70% of the wild type (based on the measured amount of MNase-resistant DNA); using this parameter, the model returns a concentration of available histones of 0.5 and the occupancy of each single nucleosome. (F) Representative results obtained from a simple model of statistical positioning. We assume that one of three events can occur at any given time: nucleosome loading (K<sub>on</sub>), nucleosome unloading (K<sub>off</sub>), and nucleosome sliding (K<sub>slide</sub>). Reducing occupancy (lower K<sub>on</sub> and/or increased K<sub>off</sub>) changes the spacing of nucleosomes (red line) as compared to a wild type fitting (blue line).</p>
