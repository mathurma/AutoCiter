<abstract>
<p>Copy number variation (CNV) is rife in eukaryotic genomes and has been implicated in many human disorders, particularly cancer, in which CNV promotes both tumorigenesis and chemotherapy resistance. CNVs are considered random mutations but often arise through replication defects; transcription can interfere with replication fork progression and stability, leading to increased mutation rates at highly transcribed loci. Here we investigate whether inducible promoters can stimulate CNV to yield reproducible, environment-specific genetic changes. We propose a general mechanism for environmentally-stimulated CNV and validate this mechanism for the emergence of copper resistance in budding yeast. By analysing a large cohort of individual cells, we directly demonstrate that CNV of the copper-resistance gene <italic>CUP1</italic> is stimulated by environmental copper. CNV stimulation accelerates the formation of novel alleles conferring enhanced copper resistance, such that copper exposure actively drives adaptation to copper-rich environments. Furthermore, quantification of CNV in individual cells reveals remarkable allele selectivity in the rate at which specific environments stimulate CNV. We define the key mechanistic elements underlying this selectivity, demonstrating that CNV is regulated by both promoter activity and acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56ac) and that H3K56ac is required for <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV and efficient copper adaptation. Stimulated CNV is not limited to high-copy <italic>CUP1</italic> repeat arrays, as we find that H3K56ac also regulates CNV in 3 copy arrays of <italic>CUP1</italic> or <italic>SFA1</italic> genes. The impact of transcription on DNA damage is well understood, but our research reveals that this apparently problematic association forms a pathway by which mutations can be directed to particular loci in particular environments and furthermore that this mutagenic process can be regulated through histone acetylation. Stimulated CNV therefore represents an unanticipated and remarkably controllable pathway facilitating organismal adaptation to new environments.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Evolutionary theory asserts that adaptive mutations, which improve cellular fitness in challenging environments, occur at random and cannot be controlled by the cell. The mutation mechanisms involved are of widespread importance, governing diverse processes from the acquisition of resistance during chemotherapy to the emergence of nonproductive clones during industrial fermentations. Here we ask whether eukaryotic cells are in fact capable of stimulating useful, adaptive mutations at environmentally relevant loci. We show that yeast cells exposed to copper stimulate copy number amplification of the copper resistance gene <italic>CUP1</italic>, leading to the rapid emergence of adapted clones, and that this stimulation depends on the highly regulated acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56. Stimulated copy number variation (CNV) operates at sites of preexisting copy number variation, which are common in eukaryotic genomes, and provides cells with a remarkable and unexpected ability to alter their own genome in response to the environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Copy number variation (CNV) is widespread in human populations, with 5%–10% of the human reference genome showing CNV between normal individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref003">3</xref>]. CNV of protein-coding genes contributes to multiple disorders, and specific genetic syndromes have been directly attributed to CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref006">6</xref>]. The pathological effects of CNV imply that gene copy number impacts gene expression, and we have recently shown that changing copy number can directly influence RNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref007">7</xref>]. However, CNV of protein coding genes is not always detrimental and can enhance cell growth, particularly in challenging environments. Evolution experiments in yeast give rise to novel CNVs that enhance growth under nutrient starvation, bestow drug resistance, and complement genetic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref012">12</xref>]. CNVs in tumour cells also enhance proliferation, albeit at the expense of the host; for example, copy number amplification can drive tumour growth (e.g., of <italic>FGFR2</italic> or <italic>CDK4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref014">14</xref>]) or mediate drug resistance (e.g., of <italic>DHFR</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>BRAF</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref017">17</xref>]). These yeast and human CNVs are examples of adaptive events in which the emergence of novel heritable alleles increases the reproductive fitness of the cell in the current environment.</p>
<p>The emergence of a novel allele in a population requires extensive selection such that the phenotypic observation is removed from original mutation event by many generations, and therefore causal mechanisms remain uncertain for most adaptive mutations including CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref018">18</xref>]. Neo-Darwinian theory invokes natural selection of randomly occurring mutations to explain adaptation; however, random mutations need not be accidental, as the induction of genome-wide mutation under stress has been well characterised in bacteria and also reported in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, a handful of loci in eukaryotes undergo localised and controlled genetic changes, including the mammalian immunoglobulin loci (widely reviewed, for example see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref024">24</xref>]), as well as the budding yeast ribosomal DNA (rDNA) for which multiple CNV mechanisms have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref027">27</xref>]. These loci are, however, highly specialised and their genetic changes are performed by locus-specific machinery; equivalent mechanisms acting genome-wide to induce beneficial genetic changes have not been convincingly demonstrated and present substantial theoretical difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The budding yeast rDNA has been used extensively as a model system for CNV. The rDNA consists of ~150 tandem copies of a 9.1-kb sequence encoding the ribosomal RNAs and undergoes frequent CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref031">31</xref>]. rDNA recombination is initiated almost exclusively from a replication fork barrier (RFB) present in each rDNA copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). A single protein, Fob1, defines the replication fork stalling site at the RFB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref033">33</xref>], and cleavage of these stalled forks is thought to initiate break-induced replication (BIR), a homologous recombination (HR) process that mediates replication fork restart using a homologous sequence on the sister chromatid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref034">34</xref>]. Because homologous sequences are present in each rDNA copy, nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) occurs readily during BIR, causing frequent CNV. rDNA amplification is partly controlled through transcription; recombination requires RNA Pol I transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref035">35</xref>], and NAHR is enhanced by expression of 2 noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), <italic>IGS1-F</italic> and <italic>IGS1-R</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). <italic>IGS1-F</italic> is a stable ncRNA, whereas <italic>IGS1-R</italic> is a cryptic unstable transcript (CUT), a class of noncoding RNA that is degraded instantly after transcription and is transcribed through the RFB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref037">37</xref>]. Therefore, local transcription in the context of stalled replication forks at the RFB has a profound effect on rDNA CNV and is thought to cause the environmentally regulated rDNA amplification observed in cells with insufficient rDNA copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref039">39</xref>].</p>

<p>Although the rDNA recombination machinery is locus specific, replication fork stalling is not unique to the RFB, and CNV often arises from replication defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref043">43</xref>]. Collisions between replication and transcription are known to be particularly mutagenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref044">44</xref>], and highly transcribed loci are prone to mutation in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref047">47</xref>]. Furthermore, transcription in bacteria has been directly observed to cause replisome dissociation, and mutation rates are higher for bacterial genes oriented against the direction of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref049">49</xref>]. This lead us to hypothesise that environmental nutrients and toxins that invoke strong transcriptional responses may promote mutations such as CNV at induced loci, effectively focusing mutations at genes that are important for growth in the presence of those nutrients or toxins, thereby accelerating the formation of novel alleles that confer increased fitness in the current environment. Here we demonstrate that CNV of high- and low-copy repeated sequences can be directly stimulated at induced loci in response to the environment, giving rise to novel, advantageous alleles at a rate far in excess of the basal mutation rate.</p>

<title>Promoter induction can stimulate CNV</title>
<p>Replication fork stalling (RFS) occurs widely in the yeast genome and is generally mutagenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref052">52</xref>]. By analogy to the rDNA system, we hypothesised that CNV may be instigated from RFS sites upstream of inducible promoters when those promoters are induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g001">Fig 1a and 1b</xref>). This would cause reproducible, environment-specific patterns of gene loss and gene amplification.</p>
<p>RFS sites are marked by S139-phosphorylated histone H2A (γH2A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref042">42</xref>]. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIPseq) for γH2A to generate a high-resolution profile of RFS in the yeast genome, producing a map that is broadly in accord with published ChIP-microarray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref042">42</xref>]. This experiment showed that peaks of &gt;2-fold γH2A enrichment occur within 1 kb upstream of ~7% of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genes, which we classed as γH2A genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s008">S1 Table</xref>). We then performed a meta-analysis of published RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data, comparing steady-state mRNA levels of γH2A and non-γH2A genes; this revealed that γH2A genes are expressed at unusually low levels in yeast grown under optimal culture conditions (30°C in YPD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g002">Fig 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s001">S1a Fig</xref>, compare grey and blue lines). However, these γH2A genes are significantly induced under more challenging conditions, such as respiratory growth and industrial fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g002">Fig 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s001">S1a Fig</xref>, red lines). γH2A genes are therefore biased towards those that are expressed primarily during growth in suboptimal conditions. However, these genes are not rapidly induced by osmotic or oxidative stress and are therefore not simply stress-response factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s001">S1b Fig</xref>). If the induction of RFS genes can instigate CNV, these CNV events should be more frequent at genes induced in response to specific environmental conditions.</p>

<p>To experimentally validate this prediction, we focused on 1 γH2A gene, <italic>CUP1</italic>, a well-studied gene encoding a metallothionein that sequesters excess copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref054">54</xref>]. <italic>CUP1</italic> occurs in a tandem array of 2-kb repeats and has widely varying copy numbers amongst different yeast strains, with higher copy numbers conferring enhanced resistance to copper toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref056">56</xref>]. The haploid strain BY4741 used here has a <italic>CUP1</italic> copy number of 13 in our assays, in keeping with previously reported estimates of <italic>CUP1</italic> copy number in the parental S288C background (10–15 copies); this copy number is high but by no means exceptional compared to wild isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref058">58</xref>]. As expected, most strains that we have tested from the BY4741-derived <bold>a</bold> mating–type deletion collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref059">59</xref>] also have 13 <italic>CUP1</italic> copies, while the S288C-derived MEP diploid has 2 <italic>CUP1</italic> alleles of 13 and 14 copies (see “Stimulated CNV accelerates the acquisition of copper resistance”).</p>
<p><italic>CUP1</italic> is strongly induced by environmental copper, and we performed a northern blot analysis to determine whether the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter is bidirectional like the rDNA ncRNA promoter, as promoter bidirectionality is important for rDNA CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref027">27</xref>]. Bidirectional promoters are common in the yeast genome, but often the antisense RNA produced is an unstable CUT that is hard to detect in wild-type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref060">60</xref>]. We therefore analysed RNA from a wild type and from an <italic>rrp6</italic>Δ mutant that lacks a key exonuclease activity required for CUT degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref036">36</xref>], revealing that the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter is bidirectional, transcribing a CUT through the RFS site in response to copper exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g002">Fig 2b and 2c</xref>). γH2A peaks upstream of the <italic>CUP1</italic> ORFs are readily seen in our γH2A ChIPseq data, and the <italic>CUP1</italic> RFS site is unaffected by growth in copper, in contrast to a previous report that ongoing transcription prevents RFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref042">42</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g002">Fig 2d</xref>). This combination of an inducible bidirectional promoter adjacent to an RFS site fits our model derived from the rDNA locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g001">Fig 1b</xref>), making <italic>CUP1</italic> an excellent candidate for stimulated CNV, particularly as CuSO<sub>4</sub> induces only a handful of other γH2A genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Copper exposure leads to the emergence of cells carrying amplified <italic>CUP1</italic> alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref061">61</xref>], but proving that the environment actually stimulates <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV requires the measurement of CNV in the absence of selective pressure. To achieve this, we reengineered the <italic>CUP1</italic> repeat sequence, replacing the copper-responsive <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter and ORF with a <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter and a <italic>3</italic>x<italic>HA</italic> tag ORF while leaving surrounding sequences, including the RFS region, intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g002">Fig 2b</xref>). This modified construct expresses a nonfunctional protein in response to environmental galactose but not glucose, whereas the endogenous promoter is not induced by galactose. We inserted a construct containing 3 copies of this modified <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> repeat in place of the <italic>CUP1</italic> locus, which fortuitously amplified to 17 copies upon transformation. <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> cells were then grown for 10 generations in glucose or galactose and compared to wild-type controls grown under the same conditions. Growth of the <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> strain in galactose gave rise to multiple de novo CNV alleles, detected by Southern blot, whereas no change was observed in the wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g002">Fig 2e</xref>). This demonstrates that promoter induction in the genetic context of <italic>CUP1</italic> is sufficient to stimulate CNV.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Stimulated CNV accelerates the acquisition of copper resistance</title>
<p>Equivalent experiments, however, on the wild-type <italic>CUP1</italic> locus would not be informative because growth in the presence of copper selects for rare amplified alleles whether they arise through random or stimulated CNV. To determine whether copper stimulates <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV requires the analysis of many individual cells that are allowed to replicate with or without copper while excluding cells born during the exposure period. Quantification of de novo CNV events within this defined cohort would provide a measure of CNV rate independent of selection.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we employed the mother enrichment program (MEP)—a system that selectively renders new-born cells inviable in the presence of β-estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref062">62</xref>]. A cohort of MEP cells in the presence of β-estradiol can be treated for a given period with or without copper, after which time only cells in the initial cohort are viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). Cells from copper-treated and control cohorts are then plated in the absence of copper and estradiol, giving rise to colonies derived from single cells that have (or have not) been previously exposed to copper; these colonies inherit the <italic>CUP1</italic> copy number of the progenitor cell. If copper stimulates heritable CNV at <italic>CUP1</italic>, then a greater number of colonies with <italic>CUP1</italic> alleles that deviate from the parental copy number should be detected in the copper-treated cohort.</p>

<p>We divided 2 populations of β-estradiol–treated MEP diploid cells and grew them for 24 hours in the presence or absence of 1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, then assayed 184 of the resulting colonies for <italic>CUP1</italic> copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g003">Fig 3b</xref>). We observed 31 CNV events (including 6 amplifications) in 56 copper-treated diploid cells (112 <italic>CUP1</italic> alleles, 27% CNV events, 5% amplifications), compared to 7 CNV events (including 1 amplification) in 128 untreated cells (256 alleles, 3% CNV events, 0% amplifications). The difference in the number of CNV events and amplifications between copper-treated and untreated cells is significant (<italic>p</italic> = 1.1x10<sup>-7</sup> for CNV events and <italic>p</italic> = 0.028 for amplifications) and represents a 9-fold stimulation of CNV by copper. Furthermore, based on bud scar counting, the untreated cells undergo more divisions than the copper-treated cells in 24 hours (12 ± 2 versus 8 ± 3 divisions), meaning that 9-fold is an underestimate of the true extent of CNV stimulation. This finding directly demonstrates that environmental copper stimulates CNV at <italic>CUP1</italic>.</p>
<p>Changes in <italic>CUP1</italic> copy number alter copper resistance, and we therefore measured the ability of cells arising in this experiment bearing an amplified (+3) or a contracted (–7) allele to grow at different copper concentrations. As expected, copper resistance was significantly increased in the amplified clone and decreased in the contracted clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g003">Fig 3c</xref>). This demonstrates that stimulated CNV gives rise to de novo alleles with quantifiable phenotypic differences, including increased copper resistance.</p>
<p>To ensure that stimulated CNV is a specific result of promoter induction as opposed to a mutagenic effect of copper treatment, we created diploid MEP cells heterozygous for the wild-type <italic>CUP1</italic> allele and the engineered galactose-responsive <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> allele. As predicted, galactose treatment induced extensive CNV at the P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> allele (96% of <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-3HA</italic> alleles underwent CNV in galactose compared to 9% in glucose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g003">Fig 3d</xref>, left). In contrast, the copper-responsive wild-type allele in the same cells was unaffected (0% of alleles underwent CNV in galactose and only 2% in glucose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g003">Fig 3d</xref>, right). This confirms that CNV is not stimulated uniformly and is highly selective for a transcriptionally induced allele over a silent locus of similar sequence and copy number.</p>

<title>H3K56 acetylation is required for stimulated CNV</title>
<p>Sir2 family histone deacetylases (HDACs) repress rDNA CNV at multiple levels, leading us to question whether HDACs also control <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref063">63</xref>]. Indeed, we observed extensive <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV after treating wild-type cells with the Sir2 family inhibitor nicotinamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g004">Fig 4a</xref>).

<p>To determine the importance of Rtt109 for stimulated CNV, we repeated the MEP-based assay from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g003">Fig 3b</xref> in an <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ background. Remarkably, we found that the transcriptional stimulation of CNV in response to copper was completed abrogated by loss of Rtt109 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g004">Fig 4b</xref> [showing <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ cells] to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g003">Fig 3b</xref> [showing wild-type cells]). This shows that stimulated CNV acts by a defined mechanism involving H3K56ac.</p>
<p>H3K56ac has been implicated in both <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref064">64</xref>] and replication fork stability or restart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref065">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref067">67</xref>]. Nicotinamide may therefore affect the stimulated CNV mechanism in 2 ways: by inducing the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter or by destabilising the stalled replication fork. We observed that nicotinamide stimulates expression of the <italic>CUP1</italic> antisense CUT but causes little or no change in the level of the <italic>CUP1</italic> sense mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g004">Fig 4c</xref>). This suggests that HDAC inhibition by nicotinamide reduces promoter directionality at <italic>CUP1</italic> rather than inducing the promoter per se, as has been recently reported for other (as yet unidentified) HDACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref068">68</xref>]. This loss of directionality cannot be ascribed to H3K56 acetylation as it is also observed in <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ cells, and it must depend on another member of the nicotinamide-sensitive Sir2 family. Importantly, however, loss of promoter directionality cannot be solely responsible for <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV, as an equivalent increase in <italic>CUP1</italic> CUT transcript is observed in <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ cells in which CNV does not occur (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g004">Fig 4a to 4c</xref>). Therefore, nicotinamide treatment makes the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter transcribe bidirectionally, but this effect is not Rtt109-dependent and is not the sole driver of CNV stimulation.</p>
<p>To assess the potential impact of H3K56 acetylation–associated replication fork defects on CNV, we asked whether mutations that destabilise or impair the processing of stalled replication forks phenocopy nicotinamide without affecting <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter induction or directionality. Amongst 11 deletion mutants of replication fork–associated proteins that impact rDNA stability, we observed that <italic>mrc1</italic>Δ and <italic>pol32</italic>Δ cells undergo striking <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV without affecting the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g004">Fig 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s003">S3b Fig</xref>). Mrc1 stabilises stalled replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref069">69</xref>], while Pol32 is required for efficient DNA synthesis following the BIR events that are initiated from broken replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref070">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref071">71</xref>]. The high level of <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV observed in both mutants is consistent with abnormally frequent or inefficient BIR being a key driver of CNV. Importantly, increased H3K56ac was recently shown to impair DNA synthesis during BIR, causing frequent replication fork stalling and recombination events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref072">72</xref>]. Such additional recombination events occurring in a repetitive region should cause extensive CNV, providing a simple explanation for the induction of <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV by nicotinamide, which increases H3K56ac globally through inhibition of Hst3 and Hst4.</p>

<title>Regulation of stimulated CNV by promoter activity and H3K56ac</title>
<p>To our surprise, however, nicotinamide had little effect on the <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> allele, showing that a global increase in H3K56 acetylation is not sufficient to drive CNV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g005">Fig 5a</xref>). One difference between the wild-type <italic>CUP1</italic> allele and the re-engineered <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> allele is that the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter is fully repressed in glucose, and therefore nicotinamide treatment does not cause the expression of an antisense transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

<p>To test this, we grew <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> cells with or without nicotinamide in a range of galactose concentrations known to induce the bidirectional <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter to various extents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref073">73</xref>]. As predicted, the effect of nicotinamide was minimal and not significant without promoter induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g005">Fig 5b</xref>, lanes 9–12), but with higher promoter induction, nicotinamide significantly stimulated CNV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g005">Fig 5b</xref>, lanes 1–8). This effect was particularly striking for the formation of de novo alleles with 1–3 copies, which presumably arise through multiple sequential CNV events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This experiment reveals that promoter activity and H3K56ac make additive contributions to CNV.</p>
<p>However, we observed that CNV becomes largely independent of nicotinamide at high galactose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g005">Fig 5a</xref>, lanes 3–4), which is not consistent with the model proposed above whereby H3K56ac acts during BIR. We therefore tested the importance of H3K56ac in CNV induction from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter by deleting <italic>RTT109</italic>. Just as for the wild-type <italic>CUP1</italic> locus, this completely abrogated CNV induction, confirming that H3K56ac is critical for stimulated CNV in the <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g005">Fig 5c</xref>). These data show that stimulated CNV requires transcription and H3K56ac, but for highly induced promoters the normal physiological level of H3K56ac is sufficient to support extensive CNV such that further deregulation of H3K56 HDAC activity has little effect.</p>

<title>Evidence for stimulated CNV in low-copy repeats</title>
<p>Direct detection of stimulated CNV is facilitated by the high copy number of the <italic>CUP1</italic> locus. However, this raises the question of whether CNV stimulation is restricted to high-copy tandem repeat loci, which are rare amongst protein-coding genes. In contrast, copy numbers of 2–5 are very common in the yeast and human genome sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref074">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref077">77</xref>], and we asked whether a 3-copy <italic>CUP1</italic> locus would show equivalent behaviour to the high-copy system. Individual CNV events are too rare in this 3-copy system for direct detection but, having defined the effects of modulating H3K56 acetylation on CNV, we reasoned that if stimulated CNV acts at low-copy loci then H3K56 modulation should alter the rate at which <italic>CUP1</italic> amplifications emerge under copper selection in a predictable manner.</p>
<p>To test this, we replaced the endogenous <italic>CUP1</italic> locus with a synthetic construct containing 3 wild-type copies of the <italic>CUP1</italic> repeat sequence while maintaining the reading frame of the overlapping <italic>RSC30</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6a</xref>). Stimulated CNV is replication linked, effectively requiring cells to grow in a sublethal concentration of copper. We observed that 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> cells grow slowly in 0.3 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, although fast-growing resistant populations often emerge late in growth, showing that resistant cells are under positive selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s006">S6a Fig</xref>). Importantly, when 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> cells were grown for 10 generations in batch culture in the presence of 0.3 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, copy-number-amplified alleles were almost always detected in the population by Southern blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s006">S6b Fig</xref>), forming a quantitative assay for CNV.</p>

<p>We first tested whether nicotinamide treatment stimulated CNV in 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> cells as in the high-copy system. Nicotinamide largely stimulates contractions in high-copy <italic>CUP1</italic> arrays, and in 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> cells the only reproducible CNV event observed on nicotinamide treatment was a –1 contraction to 2x<italic>CUP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6b</xref>, red arrow). In combination with 0.3mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, the 2x<italic>CUP1</italic> band largely disappeared, as would be expected under copper selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6c</xref>, red arrow), and the proportion of amplified alleles increased marginally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6c</xref>, upper quantification panel). However, the most noticeable difference was that the proportion of large alleles (more than 2-fold the progenitor allele size) increased dramatically with nicotinamide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6c</xref>, lower quantification panel). These results show that copper and nicotinamide both stimulate CNV, and although CNV stimulation causes many copy number contractions, copper and nicotinamide have an additive effect in the 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> system that results in the formation of larger alleles that predominate in batch culture.</p>
<p>In contrast, since deletion of <italic>RTT109</italic> suppressed stimulated <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV in the high-copy system, we then asked if the amplifications observed in 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> cells are also Rtt109-dependent. Indeed, when 3x<italic>CUP1 rtt109</italic>Δ cells were grown for 10 generations in 0.3 mM copper, amplification was completely suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6d</xref>). This demonstrates that H3K56 acetylation is required for <italic>CUP1</italic> amplification in the presence of copper, a very surprising result because previous studies have shown a critical role for Rtt109 in maintaining genome stability rather than promoting genome change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref066">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref078">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref079">79</xref>].</p>
<p>We then asked whether another 3-copy RFS gene would show similar behaviour. We selected to test the <italic>SFA1</italic> gene encoding a formaldehyde dehydrogenase, as this has a clear upstream RFS site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s006">S6c Fig</xref>), is inducible in response to formaldehyde, and higher <italic>SFA1</italic> copy number increases formaldehyde resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref080">80</xref>]. A tandem array of 3 <italic>SFA1</italic> genes with surrounding sequence was inserted at the <italic>CUP1</italic> locus along with a single wild-type <italic>CUP1</italic> copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6a</xref>), while the endogenous <italic>SFA1</italic> gene was deleted. These 3x<italic>SFA1</italic> cells showed a sharp cutoff for growth in formaldehyde, with &lt;0.9 mM allowing robust growth and &gt;1 mM completely suppressing growth, while the formaldehyde concentration that gave slow but reproducible growth (which is required for these assays) varied from 0.9–1.0 mM with formaldehyde batch and had to be empirically determined. We therefore refer to the assay concentration as ~1 mM formaldehyde.</p>
<p>Growth of 3x<italic>SFA1</italic> cells with ~1 mM formaldehyde induced bidirectional transcription from the <italic>SFA1</italic> promoter and again gave rise to amplified <italic>SFA1</italic> alleles detectable by Southern blot over 17 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s006">S6d Fig</xref>). As in the 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> system, growth of 3x<italic>SFA1</italic> cells in nicotinamide induced copy number contractions that were readily detected in the absence of formaldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6e</xref>, red arrows), although the additive effect between formaldehyde and nicotinamide was not observed. Importantly however, the copy number amplification of <italic>SFA1</italic> in 3x<italic>SFA1</italic> cells was completely suppressed in an <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6f</xref>), indicating that <italic>SFA1</italic> amplification proceeds in the presence of formaldehyde by the same mechanism as <italic>CUP1</italic> amplification.</p>
<p>Confirming that CNV is transcriptionally stimulated at <italic>SFA1</italic> requires a high-copy system, but we were unable to create a direct equivalent of the high-copy <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> strain as this amplified fortuitously during transformation. The alternative is to select for an amplified allele using formaldehyde; however, this requires the <italic>SFA1</italic> gene and amplification system to be active, which is not the case if the <italic>SFA1</italic> promoter is simply replaced with <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub>. We suspected that bidirectional transcription into the <italic>SFA1</italic> RFS would stimulate CNV irrespective of where the promoter is placed, so we created a construct in which the promoter and ORF of the upstream divergent gene <italic>UGX2</italic> were replaced with <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-GFP</italic> in each of the 3 <italic>SFA1</italic> repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s006">S6e Fig</xref>). This strain was grown in 0.9 mM formaldehyde, stepped up to 2.2 mM formaldehyde and then recovered in glucose media, yielding a <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub><italic>-GFP-SFA1</italic> strain with an unstable and therefore somewhat heterogeneous copy number but primarily containing 11 copies. Growth of this strain in galactose caused the disappearance of this upper band and the emergence of a prominent ladder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6g</xref>), just as in the original <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL</italic></sub><italic>-HA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g002">Fig 2e</xref>), showing that transcription directly stimulates CNV at the <italic>SFA1</italic> RFS site.</p>
<p>Together, these data show that low-copy systems undergo CNV through a mechanism consistent with stimulated CNV, and that this mechanism is not restricted to <italic>CUP1</italic>.</p>

<title>Stimulated CNV enhances adaptation in a population</title>
<p>The ability of transcription to stimulate CNV and the reliance of this mechanism on H3K56 acetylation suggest that the emergence of copper adaptation, instead of being an inevitable consequence of random mutation, follows a defined mechanism that is highly sensitive to alterations in this histone mark.</p>
<p>To assess this, we initially tested the copper resistance of the 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> wild-type and <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ cells grown with or without 0.3 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6d</xref>. Growth of wild-type cells in copper caused a dramatic rise in copper resistance, with GI<sub>50</sub> (concentration of CuSO<sub>4</sub> causing a 50% inhibition of growth) rising &gt;3-fold from 0.5 mM in untreated cells to ~1.7 mM in cells pregrown in 0.3 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g007">Fig 7a</xref>). This increase was clearly attributable to CNV, as cells that grew in 1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> carried large <italic>CUP1</italic> amplifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s007">S7a Fig</xref>). In contrast, <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ cells underwent a far smaller increase, rising &lt;2-fold from 0.5 mM to ~0.8 mM after pregrowth in 0.3 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g007">Fig 7a</xref>), and of the <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ cells that did survive at 1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, albeit with much reduced growth compared to wild-type cells, only a fraction had undergone <italic>CUP1</italic> amplification, suggesting that most had acquired resistance through other, potentially random, mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s007">S7a Fig</xref>). This shows that acquisition of copper resistance, far from being inevitable, is strongly dependent on an Rtt109-dependent amplification mechanism.</p>

<p>We similarly assessed the effect of nicotinamide on copper resistance using the cells grown with or without CuSO<sub>4</sub> and with or without nicotinamide shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6c</xref>. The additive effect of nicotinamide and copper provided a small and not significant increase to the already substantial copper resistance of cells pregrown in 0.3 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, but more surprisingly, pregrowth in nicotinamide caused a 2.5-fold increase in GI<sub>50</sub> for CuSO<sub>4</sub>, from 0.3 mM to 0.75mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g007">Fig 7b</xref>). This is in contrast to the Southern blotting data, which show that the primary effect of nicotinamide treatment is copy number loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g006">Fig 6b and 6c</xref>) and suggest that a substantial amount of amplifications are also generated. In support of this, the <italic>CUP1</italic> copy number of nicotinamide pretreated cells that grew in 0.75 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> was substantially amplified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s007">S7b Fig</xref>), showing that nicotinamide treatment increases copper resistance by promoting <italic>CUP1</italic> amplification.</p>
<p>These striking effects of H3K56 acetylation on copper resistance suggested that CNV stimulation should provide substantial selective advantages at the population level. As nicotinamide treatment induced constitutive stimulated CNV in the absence of copper, we used this drug to directly test the selective benefit provided by stimulated CNV.</p>
<p>Firstly, we examined strong copper selection based on growth in 0.75 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, a concentration fully inhibitory to growth of 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> cells. We pretreated four 3x<italic>CUP1</italic> cultures for 10 generations with or without 5mM nicotinamide, then obtained 6 growth curves for cells from each culture with or without 0.75mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> in the absence of nicotinamide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s007">S7c Fig</xref>). Maximum growth rates were derived from each growth curve to determine whether any cells had adapted sufficiently to allow as rapid growth in the presence of 0.75 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> as in the absence of copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g007">Fig 7c</xref>). Nicotinamide pretreatment had no effect on growth rate in the absence of copper but dramatically increased adaptation to copper: only 1 of the 24 cultures grown in the presence of 0.75 mM Cu without nicotinamide pretreatment grew normally, whereas over half (13 of 24) cultures derived from the nicotinamide pretreated samples reached growth rates equivalent to cells growing in the absence of copper. This was not due to rare events in a few of the precultures because the distribution of growth rates obtained in samples from each pretreated culture was similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001333.s007">S7d Fig</xref>). Therefore, although CNV stimulation primarily causes copy number contraction, it also dramatically enhances the ability of a subpopulation of cells to thrive in otherwise toxic concentrations of copper.</p>
<p>Secondly, we asked whether stimulated CNV provides a competitive advantage in low-copper environments in which nonamplified cells are still capable of growth. Under these conditions, the fact that stimulated CNV primarily causes copy number reduction (and therefore further slows growth in copper-containing environments) may put a population of cells using stimulated CNV at a disadvantage relative to a population that does not. To test this, we again made use of the nicotinamide to mimic the effect of stimulated CNV prior to growth in copper-containing media, and we directly competed 1:1 mixtures of untreated and nicotinamide pretreated populations in the same cultures, with or without 0.3 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>. Treated and untreated populations carried different selectable markers to allow the composition of the mixture to be determined by plating before and after growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g007">Fig 7d</xref>, left). Nicotinamide pretreatment did not alter the competitive fitness of cells in the absence of copper, but the nicotinamide-treated populations efficiently outcompeted the untreated populations in the presence of 0.3 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, increasing their population share by 40% on average over 10 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g007">Fig 7d</xref> right). These experiments clearly show that although stimulated CNV engenders many more contractions than amplifications, it still provides a major selective advantage in both low- and high-copper environments.</p>
<p>Together, our findings demonstrate that bidirectional promoter induction in the <italic>CUP1</italic> genetic context can stimulate CNV to form novel adaptive alleles and that the rate of stimulated CNV is responsive to a controllable histone modification system. Stimulated CNV provides a clear selective advantage, and amplified alleles conferring improved resistance arise in low-copy strains by a mechanism consistent with CNV stimulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The assertion that adaptation occurs purely through natural selection of random mutations is deeply embedded in our understanding of evolution. However, we have demonstrated that a controllable mechanism exists in yeast for increasing the mutation rate in response to at least 1 environmental stimulus and that this mechanism shows remarkable allele selectivity. This mechanism has the potential to act widely in eukaryotic genomes, even if restricted to repeated sequences, and may therefore underlie a substantial fraction of observed CNV events.</p>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>A proposed mechanism for stimulated CNV</title>
<p>We propose a model for stimulated CNV in which local bidirectional promoter activity destabilises stalled replication forks, increasing the frequency of error-prone BIR events. Replication fork stalling occurs widely though nonrandomly in the yeast genome, but stalled forks are normally resolved through error-free mechanisms that protect genome stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8a</xref>, top left) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref081">81</xref>]). However, we suggest that induction of transcription from an adjacent bidirectional promoter increases the likelihood that stalled replication forks collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8a</xref>, bottom left); this may occur either through direct interference of the transcription machinery with the stalled fork or indirectly through increased topological stress. Either way, the collapsed fork must then be restarted by a mechanism such as BIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8a</xref>, bottom middle), forming a replication fork with reduced processivity that is prone to CNV, particularly when H3K56ac is high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8a</xref>, right). This mechanism is closely related to the fork-stalling and template-switching (FoSTeS) process that is suggested to underlie a wide range of CNV events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref082">82</xref>], but with contributions from transcription and H3K56ac. Our data implicating H3K56ac and Pol32 in <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV is consistent with restart by BIR, since the replication forks newly formed through BIR are error-prone in the absence of Pol32 or the presence of H3K56ac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref070">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref072">72</xref>]. It is worth noting, however, that other error-prone replication fork restart mechanisms are known, and these may have similar dependencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref083">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref084">84</xref>].</p>

<p>This mechanism would be expected to yield both expansions and contractions, and we suggest that 2 additional factors drive the contraction bias we actually observe. Firstly, a fork restarted by HR within a high-copy sequence has a high chance of template switching through strand invasion of a homologous sequence in a different copy, whereas a unique sequence provides only a single homologous template and so template switching is disfavoured. Copy number amplification requires the fork to template switch backwards and re-replicate multiple copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8b</xref>, upper), whereas contraction requires a template switch forwards that moves the fork closer to the end of the high-copy sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8b</xref>, lower). A fork that has switched backwards will therefore spend longer replicating a high-copy sequence than a fork that has switched forwards and would have a higher chance of template switching again, with further potential to generate a contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8b</xref>, right). The scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8b</xref> shows that 2 successive template-switching events can result in a 3:1 ratio of contractions to amplifications.</p>
<p>This factor would prevail in nicotinamide-treated cells in which H3K56ac is uniformly high, but in normal cells, H3K56ac is primarily on the newly synthesised histones behind the fork and so H3K56ac is also asymmetrical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8c</xref>). This means that a template switch forwards would lead to BIR using a previously unreplicated template with low H3K56ac and would result in a high-processivity replication fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8c</xref>, upper). In contrast, a template switch backwards would result in the BIR fork using a previously replicated template with high H3K56ac, and this fork would have low processivity and a higher chance of template switching again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g008">Fig 8c</xref>, lower). Together, we believe that these 2 factors would yield a major bias towards contraction events but would not prevent amplifications occurring at a lower frequency.</p>
<p>We initially hypothesised that CNV at the <italic>CUP1</italic> locus would be mechanistically equivalent to CNV at the rDNA. Indeed, the requirement for bidirectional promoter induction and the effect of H3K56 HDACs are similar in the 2 systems. However, we see important differences: a lack of dependence on Sir2, which is not surprising as Sir2 acts primarily at heterochromatin; and the suppression of <italic>CUP1</italic> CNV in <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ cells, which conversely undergo massive rDNA amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref026">26</xref>]. The mechanistic analysis of rDNA amplification in <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ mutants by the Kobayashi group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref026">26</xref>] provides an explanation for this discrepancy: rDNA amplification in <italic>rtt109</italic>Δ mutants does not proceed via chromosomal BIR; instead, rolling circle amplification of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) forms large arrays of additional rDNA copies that can reintegrate into the chromosomal rDNA locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref026">26</xref>]. <italic>CUP1</italic> circles have been detected but are 3–4 orders of magnitude rarer than ERCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref085">85</xref>], and we suspect that rolling circle amplification of these happens in too few cells to make a detectable contribution.</p>

<title>Adaptive potential of stimulated CNV</title>
<p>Stimulated CNV controls the occurrence of a subset of mutations that allow adaptation to challenging environments. It is commonly assumed that adaptive mutations occur at random, and they are largely inevitable as they occur through multiple poorly defined mechanisms. Under this assumption, loss of many genome stability factors would increase the rate of adaptation, but adaptation cannot be suppressed. In contrast, we show that the adaptation of yeast to environmental copper by amplification of <italic>CUP1</italic> is largely dependent on a defined pathway that requires Rtt109, despite the general role of this protein in maintaining genome stability. Therefore, adaptation occurring through apparently random mutation may in fact be stimulated by a specific cellular mechanism.</p>
<p>How widespread is stimulated CNV? The <italic>CUP1</italic> and <italic>SFA1</italic> model systems we have analysed are multicopy, but although CNV will be most efficient where multiple homologous sequences surround the RFS site, this mechanism should not be restricted to multicopy loci. Recombination events triggered by error-prone replication forks could easily utilise distal homologous sequences or even microhomology as templates, inducing de novo CNVs and chromosomal translocations with limited homology at the breakpoints. Breakpoints in de novo CNVs would therefore be poorly defined because they initiate nearby but not at the RFS site and utilise unpredictable homologous sequences. Interestingly, <italic>CUP1</italic> shows exactly this behaviour in different <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> isolates, as the multicopy <italic>CUP1</italic> repeat has emerged many times with different breakpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>Replication fork stalling is by no means restricted to budding yeast, and bidirectional promoters are the norm in organisms, including mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref086">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref087">87</xref>]. Therefore, the basic machinery required for stimulated CNV is likely to be conserved. Furthermore, the histone deacetylases that regulate CNV outcome are conserved in mammals and appear to have similar functions in modulating DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref088">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref089">89</xref>]. Stimulated CNV in somatic cells of metazoans is rarely likely to be a useful organismal outcome and cannot aid heritable adaptation. However, because stimulated CNV emerges from conserved features of the replication and transcription systems, it seems likely that it would be active in mammalian cells, providing a mechanism that could be readily exploited, for example, by tumour cells. The mechanism that we have proposed is also very consistent with recent reports of nonrandom double-strand breaks formed by neurons in genes important for neuronal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref090">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref091">91</xref>]. As such the stimulated CNV pathway provides a new set of targets by which pharmaceuticals may prevent the emergence of undesirable properties such as drug resistance in tumours or modulate natural genetic changes in particular cell types. Indeed, our observation that adaptation of yeast to copper can be effectively suppressed by removal of Rtt109, a protein for which chemical inhibitors have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref092">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref093">93</xref>], provides good evidence that the emergence of resistance is pharmacologically accessible.</p>
<p>Evidence for adaptation through genome-wide nonrandom mutation is substantial, particularly in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref018">18</xref>], but the ability of stimulated CNV to direct mutations to relevant loci must be reconciled with forceful arguments against previously proposed ‘directed mutation’ systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref094">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001333.ref095">95</xref>]. The primary issue is that any general mechanism that directs mutations to a particular site must ‘know’ in advance the fitness outcome of a particular genetic change, which is not possible except at singular, highly specialised loci such as the rDNA. However, such arguments ignore the wealth of information regarding the function of particular loci in particular environments that is encapsulated in existing gene regulatory systems. In effect, a signalling pathway that strongly induces a gene in response to a particular environmental stimulus marks that gene as being important in that environment relative to a gene that is not expressed. CNV of such a gene is more likely to yield a useful, adaptive result than CNV of a random gene. Of course, it is also more likely to be damaging, and we see exactly this at <italic>CUP1</italic>: most of the CNV events we observed were contractions that reduce copper resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001333.g003">Fig 3b</xref>), but, relative to random mutation, the chance of finding an adaptive CNV remains substantial. Stimulated CNV is therefore a high-risk strategy that does not entail foreknowledge of the fitness outcome of genetic change at a particular locus, only the relative importance of that locus in the current environment.</p>
<p>However, many highly expressed genes are not environment specific, and such housekeeping genes are likely to be poor candidates for improving adaptation. Simply focusing CNV events at highly expressed genes would likely entail an unacceptable number of deleterious CNV events involving housekeeping genes. This problem is avoided by restricting RFS sites to the promoters of inducible genes. We suggest that the distribution of RFS sites has arisen through natural selection acting on randomly located RFS sites, as any RFS site that always engenders detrimental CNVs would have been rapidly lost.</p>
<p>Stimulated CNV is therefore an imperfect but useful cellular mechanism that increases the rate at which adaptive CNV events occur, particularly in suboptimal environments. Importantly, inducible gene expression systems and the placement of RFS sites are products of natural selection acting on random mutations, but these combine to yield a system that accelerates adaptation beyond what is achievable through random mutation.</p>
