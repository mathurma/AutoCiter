        <p>Assessment of conservation status is done both for areas or habitats and for
                    species (or taxa). IUCN Red List categories have been the principal method of
                    categorising species in terms of extinction risk, and have been shown to be
                    robust and helpful in the groups for which they have been developed. A recent
                    study highlights properties associated with extinction risk in flowering plants,
                    focusing on the species-rich hot spot of the Cape region of South Africa, and
                    concludes that merely following methods derived from studies of vertebrates may
                    not provide the best estimates of extinction risk for plants. Biology,
                    geography, and history all are important factors in risk, and the study poses
                    many questions about how we categorise and assess species for conservation

      <title/>
      <p>Conservation of life on earth has become much more than a side interest of a few
                scientists and is now part of mainstream international activity, largely through the
                Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), first ratified in 1992. The CBD has three
                aims: 1) conservation of biological diversity, 2) sustainable use of its components,
                and 3) fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation of
                genetic resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Secretariat1">[1]</xref>. The primary focus of the CBD, therefore, is the fair and
                sustainable use of biodiversity, but its conservation comes first, and with the
                ecosystem services framework developed as part of the Millennium Ecosystem
                Assessment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-MEA1">[2]</xref>, it is
                clear that biodiversity is essential for the delivery of these services, but just
                how this works is not completely clear. The CBD 2010 targets for reversing the rate
                of biodiversity loss were famously not perfectly met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Butchart1">[3]</xref>, but good progress was made
                towards developing new indices for monitoring the degree to which our species,
                    <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, manages to preserve the diversity of life on
                earth that underpins our own well-being <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Walpole1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Secretariat2">[5]</xref>. Biodiversity itself is a
                relatively new concept—it can be thought of as the diversity of life on earth
                at all levels, from genes to ecosystems. This includes species threatened with
                extinction that have been the targets of conservation action for decades.</p>
      <p>Since the recognition of the effect human alteration of habitat has been having on
                the rest of the species with which we share the planet, many different methods of
                assessing both diversity and threat have been established and supported. Hot Spots
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Myers1">[6]</xref>, Important
                Bird (and Plant) Areas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.birdlife.org/action/science/sites/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.birdlife.org/action/science/sites/index.html</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantlife.org.uk/international/campaigns/IPA/ipa_online_database/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.plantlife.org.uk/international/campaigns/IPA/ipa_online_database/</ext-link>),
                and the Global 200 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Olson1">[7]</xref> are among the many categorisation methods or systems that
                have been proposed as good relative importance measures for global area
                conservation. All of these have species diversity (usually as numbers of species) as
                one important component of their definition, thus species themselves are important.
                In recent years, the use of only species numbers (richness) as a measure of
                biodiversity has been augmented with the use of phylogenetic diversity; these
                measures take into account the evolutionary relatedness of the species in an
                assemblage (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Vellend1">[8]</xref>). These measures basically contend that an assemblage
                containing more phylogenetically divergent species is more important than one in
                which all the species are closely related. So, to use an extreme example, a piece of
                woodland with a bluebell, a robin, and a bear would be more “valuable”
                than one with a bluebell, a daffodil, and a daisy; but as you might have noticed by
                now, missing species certainly might matter in how measures of phylogenetic
                diversity are estimated. If these hypothetical lists do not represent complete
                inventories or complete phylogenies, then any measure of value using them is
                nonsense. Measures combining phylogeny and abundance and/or range size can be used
                to better quantify and predict diversity and relative conservation importance of
                sites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Chao1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Cadotte1">[10]</xref>).</p>
      <p>At the species level, assessments of conservation status are generally performed
                using the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria,
                first published in 1994 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-IUCN1">[11]</xref>, and both the categories and criteria have been reviewed
                and improved several times since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-IUCN2">[12]</xref>. The categories used in the Red List range from Least
                Concern (LC) to Extinct in the Wild (EW) to Extinct (EX), and include a category of
                Data Deficient (DD) in order to highlight taxa for which information is not
                sufficient to make a sound assessment of status. The five criteria for evaluation
                are 1) declining population (past, present, or future), 2) a measure of geographic
                range (including fragmentation, decline, or fluctuation), 3) small population size
                and fragmentation, decline, or fluctuation, 4) very small population size or very
                restricted distribution, and 5) a quantitative analysis of extinction risk; in order
                to list a species, only one of these five need be met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-IUCN3">[13]</xref>, but all should be
                considered.</p>
      <p>The overwhelming majority of listed species are vertebrates from terrestrial
                ecosystems (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.iucnredlist.org/</ext-link>); the Red List, however, has become a
                powerful and widely used tool in conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Rodrigues1">[14]</xref>. The vertebrate bias is
                recognised by those managing the Red List, and great efforts are being made to
                expand the scope of the List taxonomically (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Brummitt1">[15]</xref>). Evolutionary relatedness
                (or phylogeny) has also been suggested as an important factor for consideration in
                setting priorities for species-level conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Mace1">[16]</xref>. An index (evolutionary
                distinctiveness, or ED) combining phylogenetic diversity and IUCN Red List
                categories has been developed that sets species-level priorities for conservation
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Isaac1">[17]</xref>; this has
                shown that species with low ED scores are also those at less risk of extinction (as
                measured by their IUCN category). EDGE (evolutionarily distinct globally endangered)
                scores have been calculated for a variety of vertebrates and for corals (see
                    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.edgeofexistence.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.edgeofexistence.org/</ext-link>), and in general, species with few
                living relatives also tend to be those most at risk of extinction.</p>
      <p>Most (but not all) of the indicators of biodiversity status are based on vertebrates,
                but most of the life on earth is invertebrate or micro-organismal by orders of
                magnitude. Do the criteria for setting conservation priorities or assessing risk of
                extinction at the species level that have been developed for vertebrates really work
                for other taxonomic groups? Can we predict extinction risk from biological traits?
                Are the species that have been listed really those most at risk? In Europe at least,
                it appears that this last scenario is not the case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Fontaine1">[18]</xref>. The paper by Davies et al.
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Davies1">[19]</xref> in this
                issue of <italic>PLoS Biology</italic> suggests that in fact, for plants, the
                measures developed for vertebrates may provide misleading indications of extinction
                risk. To do this, the authors used an amazing dataset for flowering plants that
                comprised a complete Red List assessment for all taxa from two regions, the Cape
                floristic region and the United Kingdom, and a complete phylogeny at the generic
                level of the Cape flora. The Cape is one the most species-rich areas on the globe
                for flowering plants, and the flora has extraordinarily high endemism, suggesting
                    <italic>in situ</italic> diversification, while the flora of the United Kingdom
                has been assembled by post-glacial recolonisation and range expansion. These two
                very different assemblages are not only excellent for comparison but in fact are the
                only such datasets for plants anywhere. If key traits are linked to extinction risk,
                then the signal should be detectable in both of the regions, and the idea that
                particular traits (life history, pollination syndrome, etc.) predispose plant
                species to extinction would be supported. An observed trend for rare plant species
                to be in species-rich lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Schwartz1">[20]</xref> suggests that speciation and extinction may be linked. If
                this is indeed true, there is no better place to detect this than in the Cape flora,
                which is full of rare species and where a number of complete species-level
                phylogenies for clades that have diversified within the region have been
                constructed.</p>
      <p>In fact, the taxa at risk (analysing at the level of family) are different in the two
                regions, which is hardly surprising, as geography is probably as important as
                biology in making plant species (or any species, for that matter) vulnerable. The
                finer level of detail in the Cape flora dataset allowed more fine-grained analysis
                of this general pattern, and found only weak evidence for closely related lineages
                to contain similar proportions of species at risk; not at all what might be expected
                if particular traits predicted threat. What did matter in genera endemic to the Cape
                was the species richness of the lineage to which they belonged, and the age of that
                lineage. This analysis shows that the observed link between lineage richness and
                risk of extinction is the result of both richness and risk co-varying with lineage
                age; younger lineages have diversified faster so are species-rich, but a high
                proportion of these species are threatened with extinction. In short, threatened
                species are more common in lineages that are young and diversifying quickly. Quite a
                different result from that obtained for mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Isaac1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Taking the analysis to a finer level in order to explore why this might be, disparity
                through time (DTT) analyses were done using 11 endemic Cape clades for which
                near-complete species-level phylogenies are available. These clades ranged from
                genera of orchids to tribes of sedges, but all are monophyletic and had very high
                species representation. DTT analyses are often used to track the tempo and mode of
                evolutionary radiation, the combination of diversification, and morphological and/or
                ecological change. The tempo and timing of change can be traced through time in both
                extinct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Erwin1">[21]</xref> and
                extant lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Harmon1">[22]</xref>. Modelling rates of change can be tricky, as the null
                model used can be unrealistic and extinctions can cause problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Villier1">[23]</xref>; however,
                using these analyses in a phylogenetic context can mitigate these problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-OMeara1">[24]</xref>. The DTT
                analyses done on these 11 clades from the Cape flora are a bit
                different—rather than using morphology as do most, a continuous linear scale
                was developed for risk using the IUCN categories from LC to EW. The variance in risk
                was partitioned between and among clades using two models, one Brownian (a random
                walk) and another punctuated (where risk was assigned asymmetrically to sister
                taxa). Two common trends emerged. Variation in risk was highest between species at
                the tips of the clades, and towards the root of the tree risk was conserved within
                clades. How peculiar. If risk is conserved in lineages, but differs wildly at the
                tips of those lineages, what is going on?</p>
      <p>Davies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Davies1">[19]</xref>
                suggest that mode of speciation lies at the root of this result; if plants speciate
                via small isolated populations at the edges of larger species ranges, then lineages
                that are diversifying rapidly will have larger numbers of threatened species, since
                range size is important for the assignment of IUCN status. In addition, if plants
                diversify predominantly through peripatric means—edge isolates—then the
                high variation in threat between the tips can also be explained. This pattern of
                widespread species with peripheral sister species of restricted distribution was
                remarked upon by Darwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Darwin1">[25]</xref> as common in plants; he predicted that widespread species
                would be more variable and in effect act as species pumps.</p>
      <p>So maybe plants are different than animals, at least vertebrates, in terms of the
                predictability of extinction risk. But perhaps, too, the risk of extinction is
                really the result of human intervention in natural habitats and we don't need
                to worry about differing biology. Surprisingly, in the Cape flora dataset no
                correlation between anthropogenic transformation and threat was found. So, these
                threatened species in rapidly diversifying lineages are just intrinsically
                threatened; extinction and speciation both seem to be rapid. Small range size can
                mean that these young threatened species are going to expand and become less at
                risk, but the opposite seems to be true; species that are at risk are becoming more
                at risk through time (comparing Red Lists from different years). The authors suggest
                that hot spots are thus both cradles and graves of diversity—a disturbing
                metaphor.</p>
      <p>The Cape flora, with its high levels of endemism and restricted habitat, may not be
                typical of plant assemblages, but the patterns explored in Davies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Davies1">[19]</xref> cannot be
                ignored. Missing species, including species that are already extinct, in a phylogeny
                may make a lot of difference; datasets with which to compare these results will be a
                long time in coming. Few places on earth can boast such generic level endemism.
                Different regions may also exhibit distinct geography that patterns risk differently
                than the Cape; the Andean region, for example, has many isolated valleys with
                distinct biomes that harbour ancient endemics that can go nowhere, in addition to
                areas where rapidly diversifying lineages occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Pennington1">[26]</xref>. Risk signature through
                time would be interesting to explore in these floras, but lower generic level
                endemism could make this more difficult. It may be that restricted range, peripheral
                species are always doomed because they cannot expand their ranges easily; they may
                be on the edge of suitable habitat.</p>
      <p>It is clear that restricted range species are disproportionately at risk of
                extinction, in both plants and animals. Rarity, however, can be thought of in a
                variety of different ways, not just in terms of range size. Rabinowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Rabinowitz1">[27]</xref> suggested
                that species become rare (and by extension subject to extinction risk) by a variety
                of pathways, and if this were so, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of
                rarity would be diverse. Her scheme took into account range size, habitat
                specificity, and local abundance (population size), and she used this to discuss the
                ecological consequences of rarity in terms of competition and co-existence, and the
                selective pressures likely to face rare taxa of the different sorts. Range size is
                important, but biology also matters.</p>
      <p>Davies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Davies1">[19]</xref>
                have shown that if we want to maximise the conservation of the tree of life the
                automatic application of criteria developed using one taxonomic group may not be the
                best idea for another. I suspect insects will be more like plants than like
                vertebrates (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Mallet1">[28]</xref>), and there are a lot of insects! Regions of rapid,
                explosive, recent diversification like the Cape are among those selected by most as
                priorities for conservation; here, perhaps less threatened species may be as worthy
                of effort as those currently doomed to extinction anyway. It is also apparent that
                we may need to rethink our ideas about species with wide distributions. If we
                fragment the ranges of these species of “least concern”, then will they
                lose their ability to generate peripheral isolates and operate as species pumps?
                Widespread species could also be at considerable risk, and not protecting them in
                favour of restricted taxa may in fact cause more loss of evolutionary potential.
                Strategies for implementation of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-UNEP1">[29]</xref> may well need to
                take the results of Davies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001067-Davies1">[19]</xref> into account; if we intend to manage for future
                diversification as well as for current status, evolutionary, rather than only
                ecological, timescales become important. The bottom line is that many factors matter
                – geography, history, and biology. There is clearly no silver bullet for
                setting priorities; a solid, well-researched, and documented science base for
                conservation is critical for its practical and successful implementation across all
                taxonomic groups.</p>
