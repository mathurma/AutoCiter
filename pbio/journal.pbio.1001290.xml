        <p>We show that Mediator, a protein originally isolated on the basis of its ability to respond to transcriptional activators, and thought to be regulated by an activator, can also be the master that controls the activator.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>The proteasome inhibitor MG132 had been shown to prevent galactose induction of the <italic>S. cerevisiae GAL1</italic> gene, demonstrating that ubiquitin proteasome-dependent degradation of transcription factors plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. The deletion of the gene encoding the F-box protein Mdm30 had been reported to stabilize the transcriptional activator Gal4 under inducing conditions and to lead to defects in galactose utilization, suggesting that recycling of Gal4 is required for its function. Subsequently, however, it was argued that Gal4 remains stably bound to the enhancer under inducing conditions, suggesting that proteolytic turnover of Gal4 might not be required for its function. We have performed an alanine-scanning mutagenesis of ubiquitin and isolated a galactose utilization-defective ubiquitin mutant. We have used it for an unbiased suppressor screen and identified the inhibitor Gal80 as a suppressor of the transcriptional defects of the ubiquitin mutant, indicating that the protein degradation of the inhibitor Gal80, and not of the activator Gal4, is required for galactose induction of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes. We also show that in the absence of Gal80, Mdm30 is not required for Gal4 function, strongly supporting this hypothesis. Furthermore, we have found that Mediator controls the galactose-induced protein degradation of Gal80, which places Mediator genetically upstream of the activator Gal4. Mediator had originally been isolated by its ability to respond to transcriptional activators, and here we have discovered a leading role for Mediator in the process of transcription. The protein kinase Snf1 senses the inducing conditions and transduces the signal to Mediator, which initiates the degradation of the inhibitor Gal80 with the help of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>Mdm30</sup>. The ability of Mediator to control the protein degradation of transcriptional inhibitors indicates that Mediator is actually able to direct its own recruitment to gene promoters.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The expression levels of proteins are tightly regulated, not only via their production but also via their degradation. Genes are transcribed only if their encoded proteins are required by the environmental or developmental conditions of a cell, and once a certain protein is no longer needed, it is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Transcriptional activators appeared to contradict this simple economic principle, as it had been claimed that they had to be degraded in order to function. The claim was based upon a correlation: if the degradation of an activator was prevented by drugs or mutations in the UPS, the activator became stable but also nonfunctional. We have now shown that it is not the activator itself but its inhibitor that is the functionally relevant target of the UPS. Furthermore, we have found that the degradation of the inhibitor is controlled by a protein complex called Mediator. The activator is known to recruit Mediator to gene promoters, where Mediator assists RNA polymerase in initiating transcription. Mediator was always considered to be completely under the control of the activator; however, we observe that by regulating the degradation of the inhibitor, Mediator is also able to control the activator and thereby to orchestrate its own recruitment to gene promoters.</p>

      <p>Cells regulate the expression of their genes according to requirement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Ptashne1">[1]</xref>. Activators recruit chromatin-remodeling or chromatin-modifying complexes that change the structure of chromatin to promote transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Bryant1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Floer1">[3]</xref>, while repressors recruit chromatin-modifying complexes that change the structure of chromatin to prevent transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Kadosh1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Jiang1">[5]</xref>. Repressors also bind directly to activators and prevent the recruitment of the transcription machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Wellhausen1">[6]</xref>. According to the reverse recruitment hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Santangelo1">[7]</xref>, the transcription factors do not move to the highly transcribed genes, but the highly transcribed genes move to the gene expression machines (GEMs), which are protein complexes with fixed locations in the nuclear periphery. GEMs, which host all transcription factors that are required for gene expression from RNA Polymerase to RNA capping, splicing, poly-adenylation, and export factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Maniatis1">[8]</xref>, are associated with the nuclear pores, and the mature mRNAs, once produced at the GEM, are immediately exported out of the nucleus to be translated at the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Santangelo1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL</italic> genes are a paradigm for transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Traven1">[9]</xref>. In cells grown with glucose, Gal80 binds to Gal4 and blocks its activation function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Diep1">[10]</xref>, while Mig1 binds to an upstream silencer and recruits the general repressor Tup1 to prevent gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Treitel1">[11]</xref>. Upon the switch to galactose media, Snf1 phosphorylates Mig1, causing its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-DeVit1">[12]</xref>, while Gal80 dissociates from Gal4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Jiang2">[13]</xref> and is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Gal3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Sellick1">[14]</xref>, leaving Gal4 free to activate the <italic>GAL</italic> genes, which are required for galactose utilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Santangelo1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Proteolytic stability of transcription factors offers an intriguing possibility for the eukaryotic cell to control gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Muratani1">[15]</xref>. Ubiquitin proteasome-dependent degradation (UPD) of activators and repressors plays an important role in gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Hu1">[16]</xref>, and treatment of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished galactose induction of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Lipford1">[17]</xref>. Ubiquitin is a small protein of 76 amino acids that is transferred by E3 ubiquitin ligases to proteins to be targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Varshavsky1">[18]</xref>. F-box proteins confer substrate specificity to SCF (Skip1-Cullin-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Skowyra1">[19]</xref>. When cells are grown with galactose, an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the F-box protein Mdm30, SCF<sup>Mdm30</sup>, ubiquitinates Gal4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Muratani2">[20]</xref>. The deletion of <italic>MDM30</italic> stabilizes Gal4 under inducing conditions and leads to defects in galactose utilization, suggesting that recycling of Gal4 is required for its transcriptional activator function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Muratani2">[20]</xref>. Subsequently, however, it was argued that Gal4 remains stably bound to the enhancer under inducing conditions, suggesting that proteolytic turnover of Gal4 might not be required for its function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Nalley1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Nalley2">[23]</xref>. Previously, it had been shown that mono-ubiquitination protected Gal4 from the promoter-stripping activity of proteasomal ATPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Gonzalez1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Archer2">[26]</xref>, suggesting a role for ubiquitin in transcriptional activation other than protein degradation. Recently, it has been reported that the proteolytic stability of Mediator subunits is inversely correlated with their ability to activate transcription when fused to a DNA-binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Wang1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mediator is a complex of more than 20 proteins that is conserved from yeast to man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Malik1">[28]</xref>. It was discovered by its ability to respond to transcriptional activators in vivo and in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Kornberg1">[29]</xref>. Genome-wide gene expression studies with temperature-sensitive alleles have shown that Mediator is required for the transcription of nearly all RNA Polymerase II–dependent genes in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Holstege1">[30]</xref>. Mediator interacts directly with activators, General Transcription Factors, and RNA Polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Taatjes1">[31]</xref>. In higher eukaryotes, Mediator facilitates a DNA loop between enhancer and basal promoter via its interaction with cohesin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Kagey1">[32]</xref>. In addition, Mediator affects steps that are downstream of the recruitment of RNA Polymerase II to the core promoter, as Med26-containing metazoan Mediator switches RNA Polymerase into the productive transcription elongation mode by an interaction of Med26 with TBP (TATA-binding protein) and the CTD (C-terminal domain of RNA Polymerase II) kinase P-TEFb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Takahashi1">[33]</xref>. Mediator also modifies chromatin via its own CDK8 subunit, which phosphorylates histone H3S10, and by its interaction with histone acetyl- and methyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Meyer1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Ding1">[35]</xref>. Metazoan Mediator plays important roles in neurogenesis, cancer formation, and stem cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Taatjes1">[31]</xref>. All of these reported functions of Mediator are genetically downstream of transcriptional activators. Here, we have found that Mediator additionally is able to act upstream of the transcriptional activator Gal4 by controlling the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation of the inhibitor Gal80. In the absence of Gal80, Gal4 is free to recruit Mediator to the promoter of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes. Therefore, Mediator actually orchestrates its own recruitment to the <italic>GAL</italic> promoters upon galactose induction.</p>

        <title>Gal80 Is Stable in a <italic>gal<sup>−</sup></italic> Ubiquitin Mutant Strain</title>
        <p>The role of ubiquitin proteasome-dependent protein degradation in the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes has been controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Skowyra1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Collins1">[22]</xref>. We performed an alanine-scanning mutagenesis of ubiquitin in order to isolate galactose-utilization defective (<italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup>) mutant strains and use these for unbiased multi-copy suppressor screens. However, no ubiquitin single point mutant displaying the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype was isolated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s001">Figure S1</xref>, even lanes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The addition of an N-terminal tag can sometimes enhance the phenotype of point mutants, and so we fused a stretch of 10 N-terminal histidines to all ubiquitin mutant proteins. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells expressing H<sub>10</sub>UbF4A, H<sub>10</sub>UbK6A, H<sub>10</sub>UbI13A, H<sub>10</sub>UbR42A, H<sub>10</sub>UbF45A, H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A, and H<sub>10</sub>UbT66A in the place of endogenous ubiquitin displayed growth defects on galactose plates containing the respiration inhibitor Antimycin A (AA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s001">Figure S1</xref>, lanes 5, 11, 23, 85, 87, 105, 119; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The presence of the respiration inhibitor AA requires the cells to metabolize more galactose molecules in order to form colonies, which serves to translate defects in the transcriptional activation of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes into stronger growth defects on galactose plates. The <italic>H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A</italic> mutant strain was also unable to grow on galactose plates in the absence of AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, line 5), and it was transformed with a multi-copy library of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genomic DNA fragments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Nasmyth1">[36]</xref>. Gal3 was isolated by its ability to confer growth to the <italic>H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A</italic> mutant strain on galactose plates upon over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, line 6). The over-expression of Gal3 also dosage-compensated the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of the other <italic>H<sub>10</sub>Ub</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s003">Figure S3</xref>, compare odd and even lanes; the <italic>H<sub>10</sub>UbF4A</italic> mutant strain was barely viable and was excluded from further studies). Gal3 sequesters Gal80 in the cytoplasm upon galactose induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Diep1">[10]</xref>, and our finding that the over-expression of Gal3 suppressed the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of the <italic>H<sub>10</sub>Ub</italic> mutant strains indicated that ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation of Gal80 could be required for galactose induction of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes and that the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of these <italic>H<sub>10</sub>Ub</italic> mutant strains might have been caused by excess Gal80. Consistently, the additional gene deletion of <italic>GAL80</italic> suppressed the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of the <italic>H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, line 7) and of the other <italic>H<sub>10</sub>Ub</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Reverse transcription coupled with real-time PCR quantification revealed that galactose induction of <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA relative to <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA was abolished in the <italic>H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A</italic> strain and that the over-expression of Gal3 and the additional gene deletion of <italic>GAL80</italic> (partially) restored galactose induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We performed chase assays with the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and found that HA-Gal80 was indeed degraded in galactose-induced <italic>H<sub>10</sub>Ub</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 5 to 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, white bars). Importantly, HA-Gal80 had become stable in galactose-induced <italic>H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 13 to 16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, black bars) as well as in the other <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> <italic>H<sub>10</sub>Ub</italic> mutants strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s005">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting that the galactose-stimulated protein degradation of Gal80 is necessary for transcriptional activation of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes. Our finding that the additional gene deletion of <italic>GAL80</italic> suppressed the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of the <italic>H<sub>10</sub>Ub</italic> mutant strains provides genetic evidence that the failure to degrade Gal80 had been the cause (and not the consequence) of the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of the <italic>H<sub>10</sub>Ub</italic> mutant strains.</p>

The most likely explanation was that over-expression of α2 had titrated Tup1 away from <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter-bound Mig2, which—like Mig1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Treitel2">[39]</xref>—activated transcription in the absence of Tup1.

Therefore, we wanted to see if Gal80 was a functionally relevant target of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases. HA-Gal80 protein was degraded in galactose-induced <italic>SKP1</italic> wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 5 to 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, white bars), while it was stable in galactose-induced <italic>skp1dM</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 13 to 16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, black bars), indicating that wild-type Skp1 was required for the galactose-induced protein degradation of Gal80.

Real-time PCR quantification of <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA relative to <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA confirmed that the additional gene deletion of <italic>GAL80</italic> fully suppressed the transcriptional defect of the <italic>ΔMDM30</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that Mdm30 targets mainly Gal80 for galactose-induced protein degradation. Consistently, GST-Gal80, but not GST, pulled down HA-tagged Mdm30 and Skp1 from yeast extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, lanes 8 and 9; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Coomassie staining demonstrated that Gal80 and Mdm30 interacted at approximately equal amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, lanes 8 and 9). However, Gal80 interacted with Mdm30 (and Skp1) not only in galactose-induced but also in glucose-grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, compare lanes 8 and 9; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s006">Figure S6</xref>), possibly reflecting the (slower) protein degradation of Gal80 in cells grown with glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, lane 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, white bars). The half-life of Gal80 was calculated to be approximately 3 h in glucose-grown <italic>BY4741ΔW</italic> cells and approximately 1 h in galactose-induced <italic>BY4741ΔW</italic> cells. Gal80 had been completely stable in glucose-grown <italic>H<sub>10</sub>Ub</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g001">Figure 1</xref>, lines 1 to 4), indicating that the N-terminal tail of 10 histidines might have interfered with the slow protein degradation of Gal80 in glucose-grown cells. In agreement with the hypothesis that Gal80 is not just degraded in galactose-induced but also in glucose-grown cells (albeit with slower kinetics), Gal80 was poly-ubiquitinated in cells grown with glucose and in cells induced with galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, lanes 6 and 7). The amount of poly-ubiquitinated species of Gal80 was only slightly higher in galactose-induced cells as compared to in glucose-grown cells, suggesting that the generation of the poly-ubiquitinated species of Gal80 is rate-limiting, and once generated, poly-ubiquitinated Gal80 is immediately degraded. The ubiquitinated forms of HA-Gal80 are not visible in the input lanes, indicating that only a very small fraction of the Gal80 inside the cell is ubiquitinated at any point in time. The figure further shows that Gal80 was poly-ubiquitinated in wild-type cells as well as in cells lacking Mdm30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, compare lanes 7 and 9), indicating that Mdm30 is not the only F-box protein targeting Gal80. In order to identify additional SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases targeting Gal80, we tested galactose utilization defective F-box protein gene deletion mutant strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Lim1">[37]</xref> and found that Gal80 was also stable in galactose-induced cells lacking the F-box proteins Das1 and Ufo1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s007">Figure S7A</xref>,B). Importantly, the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of cells lacking Das1 and Ufo1 was suppressed by the additional gene deletion of <italic>GAL80</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s007">Figure S7C</xref>) and GST-Gal80, but not GST, pulled down Das1, and Ufo1 from yeast extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s007">Figure S7D</xref>,E), indicating that targeting of Gal80 by at least these three F-box proteins is required for the efficient galactose-induced protein degradation of Gal80. Gal80 interacted with all three F-box proteins in cells grown with glucose and in cells grown with galactose. Consistently, the deletion of <italic>MDM30</italic>, <italic>DAS1</italic>, and <italic>UFO1</italic> stabilized Gal80 also in glucose-grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s007">S7B</xref>). The signal observed for the pulldown of the F-box proteins with GST-Gal80 was higher in glucose-grown cells than in galactose-induced cells (compare lanes 8 and 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s007">S7D</xref>,E). A possible explanation is that in galactose-induced cells, more than in glucose-grown cells, the protein-protein interaction between the F-box proteins and Gal80 resulted in the protein degradation of Gal80, which means that the amount of the F-box protein pulled by GST-Gal80 does not necessarily reflect the strength of the protein-protein interaction. The over-expression of Mdm30 and Ufo1 suppressed the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of cells lacking Das1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s007">Figure S7F</xref>, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that galactose induction requires a critical threshold of Gal80-targeting SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases.</p>

        <title>Stable Derivatives of Gal80 Inhibit Galactose Induction</title>
        <p>SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases are enzymes that not only target Gal80 for ubiquitin proteasome-mediated protein degradation but also other proteins like Gal4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Muratani2">[20]</xref> and Mig2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Lim1">[37]</xref>.

Some degraded proteins contain an N-terminal degron, and we performed a series of small N-terminal deletions of Gal80 and tested them for causing defects in galactose utilization. The over-expression of wild-type HA-Gal80 reduced growth on a galactose plate in the presence of the respiration inhibitor Antimycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, line 2). The successive deletion of two amino acids increased the growth inhibition, with the deletion derivative lacking the 12 N-terminal amino acids of Gal80 showing the biggest growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, line 6). N-terminal deletions of more than 12 amino acids resulted in less inhibition, with the Gal80 deletion derivative lacking the N-terminal 20 amino acids (which removes the first four residues of the Rossmann-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Kumar1">[44]</xref>) having lost the ability to inhibit growth on the galactose plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, line 10).

        <p>The SNF1 kinase is activated by the absence of glucose, but transcriptional activation of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes requires additionally the presence of galactose, as transcription of <italic>GAL1</italic> is not activated in cells grown with—for example—raffinose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s013">Figure S13B</xref>). Consistently, Gal80 was more stable in cells grown with raffinose than in cells grown with galactose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s014">Figure S14</xref>). The half-life of Gal80 in <italic>BY4741ΔW</italic> cells was calculated to be approximately 3 h when the cells were grown with glucose, 2 h when the cells were grown with raffinose, 1 h when galactose-induced cells had been pre-grown with glucose, and half an hour when the galactose-induced cells had been pre-grown with raffinose. However, our observations also indicate that active SNF1 kinase is necessary but not sufficient for the galactose-stimulated protein degradation of Gal80. An additional transducer that signals the presence of galactose is apparently required. A possible candidate for such a signal transducer is Gal3, as it is known to bind both galactose and Gal80 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Sellick1">[14]</xref>.

We have shown here that Mediator additionally acts upstream of the activator Gal4 by controlling the degradation of the inhibitor Gal80. In cells grown with glucose, Gal80 binds to the activation domain of Gal4 and prevents it from activating transcription. Upon galactose induction, Mediator initiates the degradation of Gal80 via its interaction with the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase component Skp1. Therefore, Mediator actually orchestrates its own recruitment to the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter by regulating the activity of Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

          <p>(A) The protein kinase SNF1 senses the absence of glucose and phosphorylates Mig2. Phosphorylated Mig2 is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases SCF<sup>Das1/Ufo1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Lim1">[37]</xref>. SNF1 also signals Mediator the absence of glucose via the Snf1-Srb11 interaction. Mediator transduces the signal to the E3 ubiquitin ligases SCF<sup>Mdm30/Ufo1/Das1</sup> via the Srb7-Skp1 interaction. SCF<sup>Mdm30/Ufo1/Das1</sup> ubiquitinate Gal80 via the interaction of Gal80 with the F-box proteins Mdm30, Ufo1, and Das1. (B) Poly-ubiquitinated Gal80 and Mig2 are degraded by the 26S proteasome.

In galactose-induced cells lacking Mdm30, Gal4 is no longer ubiquitinated and no longer degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Muratani2">[20]</xref>. One could argue that changes in the proteolytic stability of Gal4 or in its mono-ubiquitination status might have been the cause for the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotypes that we have observed for the various <italic>H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A</italic>, <italic>skp1</italic>, <italic>mdm30</italic>, <italic>srb7</italic>, and <italic>snf1</italic> mutant strains described here. Therefore, it is important to note that our claim that the degradation of Gal80—and not the degradation of Gal4—is required for the transcriptional activation of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes is not just based on a simple correlation between the proteolytic stability of Gal80 and the inability of the cell to activate transcription of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene, but on functional suppression. The additional gene deletion of <italic>GAL80</italic> fully suppressed the transcriptional defects of the <italic>H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A</italic>, <italic>skp1</italic>, <italic>mdm30</italic>, <italic>srb7</italic>, and <italic>snf1</italic> mutant strains. This means that in the absence of Gal80, Gal4 activated transcription in all these mutant strains just fine, which demonstrates that any effects that these strain mutations might have had on Gal4 were not relevant for Gal4's function as a transcriptional activator. Therefore, while mono-ubiquitination of Gal4 was certainly affected in the <italic>H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A</italic> strain (since endogenous wild-type ubiquitin had been replaced with H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A), Gal4-H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A fully activated transcription of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene in the absence of Gal80, suggesting that H<sub>10</sub>UbD58A still protected Gal4 from the UAS-stripping activity of the 19S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Archer1">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, Gal4 fully activated transcription in cells lacking both Mdm30 and Gal80, which argues that Gal4 does not have to be degraded to become transcriptionally active. In addition, we have generated a galactose-stable Gal80 derivative that inhibited galactose induction in otherwise wild-type cells, which means that we have presented evidence for our claim that galactose induction requires Gal80 degradation that did not rely on a mutant strain background.</p>
      <p>The deletion of the three F-box protein-coding genes <italic>MDM30</italic>, <italic>DAS1</italic>, and <italic>UFO1</italic> completely abolished galactose induction of <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Lim1">[37]</xref>). Das1 and Ufo1 (but not Mdm30) also target the repressor Mig2 for galactose-induced protein degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Lim1">[37]</xref>. However, the additional gene deletion of <italic>MIG2</italic> did not increase galactose induction of <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA in the <italic>ΔUFO1</italic> strain and had only a very small effect on the galactose induction of the <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA in the <italic>ΔDAS1</italic> strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Lim1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, an additional target for Das1 and Ufo1 had been proposed, and we have now shown here that Gal80 is this functionally relevant target, as Gal80—like Mig2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Lim1">[37]</xref>—became stable in galactose-induced cells lacking Das1 and Ufo1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s007">Figure S7A and S7B</xref>), and the additional gene deletion of <italic>GAL80</italic> suppressed the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of both the <italic>ΔDAS1</italic> and the <italic>ΔUFO1</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s007">Figure S7C</xref>). We are proposing that a critical concentration of the three F-box proteins Mdm30, Das1, and Ufo1 is required for the galactose-stimulated protein degradation of Gal80. If any one of these three F-box proteins is missing, the concentration of the remaining two F-box proteins is insufficient for targeting of Gal80; Gal80 is not degraded and excess Gal80 prevents Gal4 from activating the <italic>GAL</italic> genes under inducing conditions. In support of this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g007">Figure 7</xref>), we were able to show that the <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype of <italic>ΔDAS1</italic> cells was suppressed by the over-expression of Ufo1 and Mdm30 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s007">Figure S7E</xref>).</p>
      <p>Gal3 sequesters Gal80 in the cytoplasm upon galactose induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Sellick1">[14]</xref>. The gene deletion of <italic>GAL3</italic> had caused a <italic>gal</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotype that was suppressed by the additional gene deletion of <italic>GAL80</italic>, but the protein degradation of Gal80 was still stimulated in galactose-induced cells lacking Gal3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s015">Figure S15</xref>), indicating that instable Gal80 was not sufficient to allow Gal4 to activate transcription in the absence of Gal3. On the other hand, sequestration of Gal80 into the cytoplasm by endogenous levels of Gal3 was not sufficient to allow Gal4 to activate transcription in the presence of stable Gal80. Apparently, sequestration of Gal80 into the cytoplasm by Gal3 and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation of Gal80 are both required for the galactose induction of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes.</p>
      <p>Contrary to a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001290-Muratani2">[20]</xref>, we found that the deletion of the gene encoding the F-box protein Mdm30 abolished galactose induction of the <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA. We have grown the cells in glucose liquid media prior to the switch to galactose liquid media—which is consistent with the switch in carbon sources conducted for the plate assay—while Muratani et al. grew the cells in raffinose liquid media prior to the switch to galactose liquid media. In order to determine if this difference in protocols was the cause for the difference in results, we performed the galactose induction with cells that had been pre-grown in raffinose, and we found that in this case, galactose-induced protein degradation of Gal80 and galactose induction of <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA relative to <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA were restored in the <italic>ΔMDM30</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s013">Figures S13B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s014">S14</xref>). One other remarkable difference between the two growth protocols is the speed of induction. Galactose induction of <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA relative to <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA takes 4 h if the cells are pre-grown with glucose and only 1 h if the cells are pre-grown with raffinose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s016">Figure S16</xref>). Consistently, cycloheximide chase assays demonstrate that Gal80 is more rapidly degraded in galactose-induced cells when the cells had been pre-grown with raffinose instead of with glucose (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001290-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001290.s014">S14B</xref>). The half-life of Gal80 in galactose-induced <italic>BY4741ΔW</italic> cells was approximately 1 h when the cells had been pre-grown with glucose and only half an hour when the cells had been pre-grown with raffinose. The correlation of the kinetics of galactose-induced Gal80 destruction and <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA production suggests that the degradation of Gal80 is the rate-limiting step for the galactose induction of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene.</p>

          <p>hSrb7 interacts with hSkp1 in vitro and in vivo. (A) The Split-Ubiquitin assay. Two proteins of interest X and Y are fused to the N-terminal half of ubiquitin and to the C-terminal half of ubiquitin extended by the RUra3 reporter, Nub and Cub-RUra3, respectively. The protein interaction between X and Y brings the two halves of ubiquitin into close proximity, which causes Ubiquitin-specific proteases (Ubps) to cleave off RUra3, which is subsequently degraded by the enzymes of the N-end rule. The protein interaction between X and Y can therefore be selected for on plates containing 5-fluoro orotic acid (FOA), as Ura3 (orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase) converts FOA into toxic fluoro uracil. (B) <italic>JD52</italic> cells expressing the indicated fusions were 10-fold serial diluted, titrated onto the depicted plates, and incubated for 3 d. Protein interaction is revealed by growth on the FOA plate and lack of growth on the uracil-depleted plate. (C) GST fusions purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> extracts with glutathione beads were incubated with <italic>E. coli</italic> extract containing H6-HA-hSrb7 (lanes 2, 3) and with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> extract containing Nub-HA-hSkp1 (lanes 5, 6). Precipitates were washed five times and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-HA antibody. (D) The human Split-Ubiquitin system. Two proteins of interest X and Y are fused to the N-terminal half of ubiquitin and to the C-terminal half of ubiquitin extended by the RGpt2 reporter, Nub and Cub-RGpt2, respectively. The protein interaction between X and Y brings the two halves of ubiquitin into close proximity, which causes Ubiquitin-specific proteases (Ubps) to cleave off RGpt2, which is subsequently degraded by the enzymes of the N-end rule. The protein interaction between X and Y causes sensitivity to hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymine (HAT) media and resistance to 6-thioguanine (6TG). (E) Human HT1080HPRT<sup>−</sup> fibroblast cells stably expressing hSrb7-Cub-RGpt2 and Nub (left panels) or hSrb7-Cub-RGpt2 and Nub-hSkp1 (right panels) were placed into control media (top panels), into HAT media (middle panels), or into media containing 6TG (bottom panels). In HAT media, the cells require functional Gpt2 (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) enzyme, whereas 6TG media counter-selects against Gpt2 function. Growth in 6TG media and lack of growth in HAT media indicates that hSrb7 interacts with hSkp1 inside the tissue culture cells.</p>
