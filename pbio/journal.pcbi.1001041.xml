<p>The sinoatrial node (SAN) is a complex structure that exhibits anatomical and functional heterogeneity which may depend on: 1) The existence of distinct cell populations, 2) electrotonic influences of the surrounding atrium, 3) the presence of a high density of fibroblasts, and 4) atrial cells intermingled within the SAN. Our goal was to utilize a computer model to predict critical determinants and modulators of excitation and conduction in the SAN. We built a theoretical “non-uniform” model composed of distinct central and peripheral SAN cells and a “uniform” model containing only central cells connected to the atrium. We tested the effects of coupling strength between SAN cells in the models, as well as the effects of fibroblasts and interspersed atrial cells. Although we could simulate single cell experimental data supporting the “multiple cell type” hypothesis, 2D “non-uniform” models did not simulate expected tissue behavior, such as central pacemaking. When we considered the atrial effects alone in a simple homogeneous “uniform” model, central pacemaking initiation and impulse propagation in simulations were consistent with experiments. Introduction of fibroblasts in our simulated tissue resulted in various effects depending on the density, distribution, and fibroblast-myocyte coupling strength. Incorporation of atrial cells in our simulated SAN tissue had little effect on SAN electrophysiology. Our tissue model simulations suggest atrial electrotonic effects as plausible to account for SAN heterogeneity, sequence, and rate of propagation. Fibroblasts can act as obstacles, current sinks or shunts to conduction in the SAN depending on their orientation, density, and coupling.</p>

<p>It is well known that a small structure in the atrium called the sinoatrial node (SAN) is the pacemaker for the heart. However, the complexity and heterogeneity intrinsic to this structure has made it difficult to determine some aspects of sinoatrial node function. Here we use a computational approach, based on experimental data, to tease out the individual contributions of cellular and tissue heterogeneities and the effect of fibroblasts and atrial cells on sinoatrial node function. The computational models suggest that the complex features of the intact sinoatrial node can be reconstructed with a relatively simple model. Our simulations also predict that the presence of non-cardiac cells in the node likely contribute to its function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The sinoatrial node (SAN) is a complex heterogeneous tissue and its function may depend on this complexity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett1">[1]</xref>. Measurements from intact rabbit SAN have shown heterogeneity of electrophysiological properties from the center to the border of the atrium including gradual morphological changes in action potentials (AP), a decrease in maximum diastolic potential (MDP), an increase in peak overshoot potential (POP), an increase in upstroke velocity (UV) and a decrease in pacemaker potential slope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Bleeker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett2">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Some studies of the SAN describe a discrete-region model of SAN organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Bouman1">[4]</xref>, comprising a central region of small primary pacemaker cells surrounded by a zone of larger transitional cells. Kodama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Kodama1">[5]</xref> observed AP variability in small balls of tissue isolated from SAN, and suggested a transition in ion channel expression as the cause. An additional series of articles in rabbit have reported that AP characteristics, current density, Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and connexin density are cell-size dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Zhang1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>More recently, Lyashkov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Lyashkov1">[8]</xref> identified three morphologically distinct SAN cells. However, experiments on enzymatically dissociated cells of all three types revealed <italic>no</italic> significant variations in APs, cycle length (CL), Ca2+ cycling or channel expression. Other studies have also failed to detect size-dependent (i.e. cell type dependent) differences in isolated SAN cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Michaels1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Verheijck1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>From these disparate camps, two distinct hypotheses have arisen to explain intact SAN heterogeneity. The first is that the SAN has two specific cell types, central cells and peripheral cells, each with distinct electrophysiological characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett3">[6]</xref>. The second hypothesis suggests that all observed heterogeneity in the intact SAN results from electrotonic coupling effects - cells in the SAN near the atria will be strongly affected and modified by the atrium. Here we used a computational modeling approach to build distinct models based on the existing contrasting data sets that support the two hypotheses, and attempted to simulate experimentally measured properties of isolated SAN cells <italic>and</italic> characteristics of intact SAN tissue.</p>
<p>We then used the computational model to probe other anatomical factors that likely contribute to the observed function and heterogenetity in the SAN. It has been observed that fibroblasts constitute a larger fraction of the SAN, than atrial or ventricular tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Camelliti1">[11]</xref>. Anatomical studies of the rabbit SAN suggest a disorganized “mesh” of SAN cells arranged around “islands” of fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Camelliti1">[11]</xref>. Fibroblasts form functional gap junctions with myocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Camelliti1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Miragoli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Rook1">[13]</xref>. Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggest that electrically coupled fibroblasts alter impulse SAN conduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Miragoli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Rook1">[13]</xref> and that fibroblasts may affect the spontaneous activity of the SAN cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Kamkin1">[14]</xref>. Fibroblast density increases with age and may play a role in ageing-induced bradycardia or sick sinus syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-deMarneffe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Shiraishi1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Atrial cells are also dispersed throughout the SAN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Camelliti1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Dobrzynski1">[17]</xref> and it is unclear how these cells may influence SAN excitability. Verheijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Camelliti1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Dobrzynski1">[17]</xref> hypothesized that the gradual increase in density of atrial cells from the SAN center toward the atria causes a gradual increase in atrial electrotonic influence that underlies the transition from nodal to atrial action potentials.</p>
<p>Our computational modeling approach allowed us to examine how sources of heterogeneity in the SAN including cellular differences, gradients in coupling, fibroblasts and atrial myocytes in the SAN affect excitation and conduction. Our tissue simulations suggest electrotonic effects as plausible to account for SAN heterogeneity. Uncoupled fibroblasts act as obstacles to conduction in the SAN and, when coupled slow conduction by acting as current sinks, or shunt electrical activity between regions, depending on the orientation, density and coupling strength. Our model simulations also revealed only minor effects of atrial cells in the SAN.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The Kurata rabbit SAN central cell model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Kurata1">[18]</xref> was used as the base model for cell and tissue simulations in this study because it incorporates: 1) intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and a subsarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion compartment, 2) the novel pacemaker current <italic>I<sub>st</sub></italic>, 3) Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent inactivation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel 4) accurate activation kinetics of <italic>I<sub>Kr</sub></italic>, 5) revised kinetic formulations for 4-AP-sensitive currents (<italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>sus</sub></italic>). The Kurata model reproduces AP waveforms, ionic currents, effects of ion channels blockers and differential effects of BAPTA and EGTA on pacemaker frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Kurata1">[18]</xref>. Please refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref> for details.</p>
<p>Effects of vagal stimulation were incorporated into the model in order to investigate the experimentally observed pacemaker shift in response to ACh application as we have done previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Protas1">[19]</xref>. The concentration of ACh was chosen to approximate the experimentally observed effect of ACh on SAN cells, where maximum diastolic potential is hyperpolarized by 10 mV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Campbell1">[20]</xref>. This concentration (1×10<sup>−5</sup> M) results in effects on I<sub>Ca,L</sub> and I<sub>f</sub>, and I<sub>K</sub>. All tissue level simulations are described in full detail in the online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>
<p>We modeled the sick sinus syndrome associated P1298L Na+ channel mutation, by modifying I<sub>Na</sub> properties according to experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Benson1">[21]</xref>. We incorporated a 13.5% negative shift of the inactivation curve and implemented the same percentage changes of the fast and slow inactivation time constants (τ<sub>fast</sub> increased by a factor of 2, τ<sub>slow</sub> increased by a factor of 3.6) as observed experimentally. The maximal Na<sup>+</sup> channel conductance was reduced by 44% to reproduce the reduction in I<sub>Na</sub> as recorded experimentally.</p>

<title>Effect of coupling on pacemaker site location</title>
<p>First, we constructed a “non-uniform” radially symmetric tissue model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), containing central and peripheral model cells based on experimental data that support this view (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). We incorporated a linear gradient of cell-to-cell coupling from the center to the periphery of the SAN based on histological studies that show spatial gradients of gap junctions, resulting in a 10-fold increase in density from SAN center to periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Bleeker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-MassonPevet1">[23]</xref>. A schematic is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, where low coupling is white and the gradient of increasing coupling toward the periphery is indicated by degree of shading.</p>

<p>We tested a range of linear gradients spanning the experimental estimate (10-fold), from 5-fold to 15-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-MassonPevet1">[23]</xref>. We used the measured average intercellular coupling value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Verheule1">[24]</xref> in the SAN center of 7.5nS (white). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows simulations of SAN excitation in the non-uniform model under conditions of shallow (from 7.5 nS in the center to 37.5 nS in periphery - 5-fold larger G<sub>Gap</sub> in periphery, left) and steep (from 7.5 nS to 112.5 nS -15-fold larger G<sub>Gap</sub>, right) gradients. In both cases we observed initiation of pacemaking in the periphery – a result that is not consistent with experimental observations, where central pacemaking is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g001">Figure 1B</xref> left, pacemaker site is bold). We were not completely surprised by this finding since in our single cell simulations the peripheral cell has a faster intrinsic excitation frequency (See Figure 2C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>). We postulated that electrotonic coupling to the atrium might make peripheral cells less excitable by acting as a large current sink.</p>
<p>However, our simulations suggested this is not the case, and that no degree of “physiological” coupling shifted pacemaking to the SAN center in the non-uniform model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, open circles). Moreover, the CL in the non-uniform model was 234 ms, which is markedly shorter than the experimentally observed values of 361±38 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001041-t001">Table 1</xref>). The upstroke velocity (UV) of action potentials in the periphery (60.7 V/s) was too large and maximum diastolic potential (MDP) in the periphery was too negative and outside of the measured range (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001041-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to be sure that the results presented above did not depend on the specific conductance values for each current, we performed a sensitivity analysis of pacemaker location to 10% perturbations (encompassing the experimental measurement ranges) in all ionic conductances. The pacemaker location was robust to increases or decreases in any conductance – peripheral pacemaking was always observed for the non-uniform model. The methods and results are contained in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>
<p>We next used the uniform model incorporating data that supports the hypothesis that <bold><italic>no</italic></bold> intrinsic differences exist between central and peripheral cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Lyashkov1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Michaels1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Verheijck1">[10]</xref> and that observed differences in the intact SAN derive from proximity of cells to the atrium. This is supported by data in single cells where no differences in AP properties in large versus small cells isolated from the SAN were observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Lyashkov1">[8]</xref>. The 2D “uniform” model contains only central cells connected to the atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2B</xref> illustrates the pacemaker site for values of G<sub>Gap</sub> gradients for the non-uniform (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and the uniform model. Electrical initiation in the first 15 cells is central pacemaking. Although the non-uniform model did not simulate central pacemaking for any values tested, the uniform model simulated central pacemaking over a wide range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, filled circles), beginning with a coupling gradient of 5×. Simulations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2C</xref> using the uniform model with a G<sub>Gap</sub> gradient of 10× <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Bleeker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-MassonPevet1">[23]</xref>. We performed the same sensitivity analysis as described above and found that central pacemaking was robust to changes in all conductances and always observed for the uniform model.</p>
<p>One of the important manifestations of the heterogeneous SAN is the shift of the pacemaker site in response to different innervations. In the case of vagal stimulation, the pacemaker shifts towards the periphery of the SAN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Shibata1">[25]</xref>. Therefore, in order to mimic vagal stimulation in both our non-uniform and uniform models, we incorporated the recorded changes to ACh-activated K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>K,ACh</sub>), I<sub>f</sub> and I<sub>Ca,L</sub> as we have done previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Protas1">[19]</xref>. In the rabbit SAN, fine nerve processes form a basket around the pacemaker cells at the normal leading pacemaker site, but there are few or no visible fibers in the periphery of the SAN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Roberts1">[26]</xref>. Following these data, we have applied the effects of vagal innervation only in SAN “central cells” (i.e. cells #1–15). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2D</xref> shows that simulated vagal stimulation resulted in a shift in the pacemaker site in the uniform model to the periphery (cell #20) compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, pacemaker site at cell #6), consistent with experiments. In the non-uniform model, on the other hand, simulated vagal stimulation resulted in a slight shift of the pacemaker site within the periphery of the SAN (from cell #19 in control to cell #22 under vagal stimulation, not shown).</p>
<p>The mechanism for the shift of the pacemaker site under vagal stimulation is as follows: During vagal stimulation, an increase in I<sub>KACh</sub> results in a 10 mV hyperpolarization of the MDP in the central region of the SAN. ACh also partially inhibits I<sub>Ca,L</sub>, and shifts the activation curve of the hyperpolarization-activated current, If, towards more negative potentials. This leads to a slowing of diastolic depolarization and consequently pacing frequency. Cells in the periphery, which are unaffected by vagal stimulation have a faster intrinsic frequency and thus drive pacemaking.</p>

<title>Effects of increased peripheral coupling</title>

We thus assessed effects of increased peripheral coupling on the SAN by incorporating an additional multiplicative factor for peripheral coupling between 1 and 4 in cells #15–30.

<p>Central cells are not affected by the increase in peripheral coupling.

Neither island distribution (filled squares in each column denote five different fibroblast distributions as shown in Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>) nor fibroblast island size (islands composed of 2×2 (small), 4×4 (medium) and 6×6 (large) fibroblasts are shown as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, respectively) largely affected SACT. 50% fibroblast density with 2×2 islands could not be obtained within the constraint that islands not touch islands (asterisk in panel A). With large plentiful fibroblast islands (6×6) and clustered near the atrium (50% fibroblast density in right panel), the atrium failed to excite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) (see Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref> for fibroblast distributions – here, distributions 3 and 5 failed to excite the atrium). A fibroblast barrier near the atrium caused a mismatch between availability of depolarizing charge (source, the SAN) and charge required for excitation (sink, the atrium). The intrinsic excitation frequency of the SAN was unaffected by the presence of fibroblasts (302ms) in all simulations at G<sub>Gap</sub> = 0 nS (not shown).</p>
<p>Next, we explored the effect of the strength of coupling between myocytes and fibroblasts on impulse propagation in the SAN by setting G<sub>Gap</sub> between myocytes and fibroblasts to 1, 3 and 6 nS, from the measured myocyte-fibroblast coupling range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Jacquemet1">[34]</xref>.

With a fibroblast density of 10%, conduction was slowed, but additionally varying island size (compare panels A, B and C), island distribution (compare columns in individual panels) or coupling between myocytes and fibroblasts (note clustering of symbols) did not have large additional effects on SACT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g005">Figure 5, A–C</xref>). However, when we increased fibroblast density to 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g005">Figure 5, D–F</xref>), island distribution affected conduction time (SACT).

<p>Increasing fibroblast density to 50% revealed how coupling (G<sub>Gap</sub>) affects conduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g005">Figure 5, G–H</xref>). In most distributions with 50% fibroblast density, when G<sub>Gap</sub> is large (6 nS, circle) SACT is shorter (compared to G<sub>Gap</sub> = 3 nS, denoted by “X” or 1 ns, filled triangle). Electrical impulses pass through a tightly coupled fibroblast island faster than when weakly coupling. As in the uncoupled simulations (for G<sub>Gap</sub> = 0 nS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), distributions #3 and #5 (see Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>) failed to excite the atrium for weak coupling (G<sub>Gap</sub> = 1 nS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g005">Figure 5H</xref>).

<title>Effect of interspersed atrial cells in the SAN</title>
<p>Verheijck E. et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Verheijck1">[10]</xref> have observed atrial cells interspersed in the SAN and suggested a “mosaic” model of SAN and atrial cells for SAN organization. In the mosaic model, the percentage of atrial cells varies from 63% in the periphery to 22% in the center. We incorporated a random distribution of atrial cells with a density of 22% in the center increasing gradually to 63% in the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Verheijck1">[10]</xref> (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, atrial cells in blue) connected via G<sub>gap</sub> as in the neighboring nodal cells (there is no evidence for atrial specific gap junction channel (Cx43) presence in the SAN). Our simulations suggest that atrial cells have minor effects on electrical properties and behavior of the SAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). CL and SACT in our mosaic model are longer (322 ms, 32.6 ms, respectively) compared with control (302 ms, 13.9 ms) because MDP is more hyperpolarized when atrial cells are present in the SAN. UV in the center is slower in the mosaic (4.2 mV/ms compared with 6 mV/ms in control). In contrast, UV is faster in the periphery (18 mV/ms compared with 13.8 mV/ms), consistent with experimental observations (see Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>). Interspersed atrial cells also shorten APD in both central and peripheral regions of the SAN owing to the influence of I<sub>K1</sub> – repolarization alleviates I<sub>K1</sub> rectification leading to reduced resistivity, which increases the electrotonic influence of the atria during repolarization and during the diastolic interval (see also Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g007">Figure 7C</xref> shows the propagation of an impulse generated in the central region of the SAN through a peripheral region of increased coupling (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2</xref>) into the atrium as generated by the mosaic model.

We observe mutation induced slowing of beating frequency and conduction velocity from the SAN to the atria, which becomes dramatic in the presence of ACh. Because no Na<sup>+</sup> current is present in the SAN cells, the mutation effect results from the loss of Na<sup>+</sup> channel function in atrial cells only. Interspersed atrial cells within the SAN that are affected by the mutation are less excitable and consequently draw more current from neighboring SAN cells (left panels of A and B, show effect of mutation on interspersed atrial cells within the SAN alone). This results in a slowing of pacemaking. Due to mutual entrainment in the SAN region we observed a slowing in heart rate in all cells. The presence of vagal stimulation dramatically exacerbates the mutation effects – by additionally slowing diastolic depolarization (and thus pacing frequency) in SAN cells (panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Note that when the mutation is also incorporated into atrial cells (right panels of A and B), atrial action potential duration is increased. This is a result of the mutation-induced reduction in the peak overshoot potential in the atrial cells (38.35 mV versus 24.29 mV with the mutation) that reduces the driving force of repolarizing K+ currents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>One goal of this study was to test two existing hypotheses for heterogeneity of the intact SAN. The first derives from a series of studies (reviewed by Boyett MR <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett1">[1]</xref>), which suggests the SAN is composed of central and peripheral cells that differ in intrinsic electrical properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Zhang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Kurata1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Cloherty1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Garny1">[37]</xref>. Our Kurata <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Kurata1">[18]</xref> based central and peripheral cell models reproduced single cell experimental data supporting the “multiple cell type” hypothesis (Figure 1 and Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>), but did not simulate observed tissue behavior. No values within the range of physiological coupling were sufficient to initiate pacemaking in the center of the SAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The second hypothesis suggests that the SAN is composed of electrically uniform nodal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Lyashkov1">[8]</xref>, which is supported by data where no differences in APs, Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling or current densities were observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Lyashkov1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Michaels1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Verheijck1">[10]</xref>. Thus, we generated a “uniform model” of only central cells connected to the atrium, which simulated central pacemaking initiation and impulse propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) consistent with experiments. Simulated behavior reproduced experimental parameters (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001041-t001">Table 1</xref>) (see also Table 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>) and AP morphology (Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001041.s001">Text S1</xref>). Our tissue simulations suggest atrial electrotonic effects as plausible to account for heterogeneity, activation sequence and rate of propagation of the SAN. Gap junctional coupling and inwardly rectifying properties of I<sub>K1</sub> currents in the atrium generate a current sink, which depresses and delays depolarization of the periphery, allowing central cells (cells 1–15) to lead pacemaking.</p>
<p>From the center to periphery to atrium, AP upstroke velocity, peak overshoot potential (POP) and MDP increase, while APD and pacemaker potential slope are reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett1">[1]</xref>. The atrium delays the depolarization of the periphery by lengthening diastolic depolarization (reducing pacemaker potential slope) and lowering peripheral MDP, which alleviates inactivation of <italic>I<sub>Ca,T</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) causing increased UV and POP. The decrease in APD along the conduction pathway is attributable to the shorter APDs in atrial cells, especially by alleviation of I<sub>K1</sub> rectification as the cells repolarize, causing a repolarization gradient which “pulls down” plateaus of nearby cells leading to repolarization in the direction opposite to depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Fink1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>We used the model to address the role of fibroblasts in the SAN as they account for nearly 50% of the SAN cell density in rabbit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Kohl2">[32]</xref>. Our simulations support evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Fahrenbach1">[35]</xref> that fibroblasts are a current sink by <italic>hyperpolarizing</italic> the SAN (as opposed to depolarizing neighboring myocytes in atrium and ventricles) causing a decrease in DD slope, an increase in CL and slower conduction. This is consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in spontaneously beating murine atrial cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Fahrenbach1">[35]</xref> and in atrial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Kamkin2">[38]</xref> and ventricular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Miragoli1">[12]</xref> cells, where an increase in fibroblast density caused attenuation of spontaneous activity and increased conduction time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The study by Fahrenbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Fahrenbach1">[35]</xref> showed that the electrical interaction between fibroblasts and myocytes in co-cultured monolayers reduced frequency in a ratio-dependent but coupling-independent manner.</p>
<p>Our simulations results suggested three distinct parameter regimes: 1) the first is when fibroblasts were only barriers to conduction (G<sub>gap</sub> = 0 nS), which caused an increase in SACT alone as fibroblast density increases. An increased fibroblast density provided the atrium less SAN cells (sources) to pull current from, thus enhancing the atrial loading effect and opposing depolarization in SAN cells. This manifested as a more hyperpolarized SAN cells with a longer DD phase that delays excitation. 2) When fibroblasts were coupled to SAN cells, there was an increase in both SACT and CL with increasing fibroblast density. Here, in addition to the decrease in electrical source for the atrium, the coupled fibroblasts acted as additional current sinks, which further reduced the DD slope and lengthened the DD phase. 3) At very high fibroblast density (50% or more), we observed an increase in SACT with low intercellular coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g006">Figure 6 G–H</xref>). This is because electrical impulses readily pass through a tightly coupled fibroblast island - fibroblasts as electrical shunts.</p>
<p>The presence of atrial cells in the SAN region was also investigated. Unlike previous model studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Cloherty1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Cloherty2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Zhang2">[40]</xref> that did not support the mosaic model as a plausible model of SAN organization, our simulations suggest only modest effects of experimentally observed density of atrial cells on SAN function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001041-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated the effects of the familial sick sinus syndrome (SSS) mutation P1298L in our mosaic model and found that Na<sup>+</sup> current need not be present in the sinus node to observe the reduction in pacing frequency and slowed conduction that are hallmarks of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Benson1">[21]</xref>. Because no Na<sup>+</sup> current is present in the sinoatrial node cells, the mutation effect results from the loss of Na<sup>+</sup> channel function in atrial cells only. Interspersed atrial cells within the SAN that are affected by the mutation, are plagued by reduced excitability, causing them to act as a current sink as they require more current from the neighboring SAN to activate. This causes slowing of pacemaking and reduced conduction velocity of the impulse to the atrium. Due to mutual entrainment in the SAN region a slowing in pacemaker frequency is observed in all cells, which becomes much more dramatic in the presence of vagal stimulation. Sinoatrial node to atrial conduction time was also markedly increased with vagal stimulation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite different model representations, we observed very similar effects of the SSS mutation to those recently reported in the Butters et al. paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Butters1">[41]</xref>. The mechanism as described in their study is also consistent – an increase in the current sink attributable to atrial cells - is the culprit.</p>

<title>Comparison to previous model studies</title>
<p>When we began this study, we found that the widely used central and peripheral cell models reproduced measured single cell properties from experiments that supported the existence of two distinct cell populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Zhang1">[7]</xref>. But, in our hands, without a number of unjustified parameter modifications these cell models could not be coupled together and reproduce observed widely agreed upon tissue properties of the SAN, including central pacemaking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Bleeker1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Close inspection of the existing literature led us to suspect that a number of other groups that have attempted a heterogeneous reconstruction of the SAN with central and peripheral cells also failed. Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Zhang1">[7]</xref> first developed mathematical models of central and peripheral SAN cells and a 1D gradient model of the SAN, which were subsequently modified by Garny et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Garny1">[37]</xref> in tissue simulations. The existing models that contain both cell types are rife <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Boyett4">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Garny1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Butters1">[41]</xref> with parameter modifications (by starkly isolating peripheral cells and altering their conductance properties to make them more “central” like) to shift pacemaking to the center and “make it work”. These modifications of SAN single cell model parameters made them less representative of experimentally determined single cell activity.</p>
<p>When we considered that cellular properties from the SAN were more uniform than had been previously reported and built a model based on those data, we could reproduce measured cell AND tissue properties in the SAN without any parameter modification. We hope that this study will put to rest much of the “wiggly jiggly” with parameters that has been done with SAN tissue models over the years – we show that a simple model composed only of central cells can reproduce measured SAN properties – both in single cells and in tissue. Most importantly, our uniform model reproduced experimental tissue properties without arbitrary parameter modifications.</p>
<p>A very recent study by Butters et al. appears to be largely consistent with the results that we present here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Butters1">[41]</xref>. Although distinct “peripheral” pacemaking cells are included in their 2D SAN tissue model, these cells are present at very low density, surrounded by atrial cells or non-excitable regions (block zone), and do not appear to be present in the conduction pathway of the excitable impulse generated in the SAN center. In the Butters model, peripheral cells have apparently been “uncoupled” from the pacemaker by isolating very small low-density clusters within large atrial or inexcitable sinks. This seems consistent with our findings – a heterogeneous model of distinct central and peripheral cells will fail to evoke central pacemaking. We speculate that removing the peripheral cells from the simulation would have no effect on the results from the Butters paper.</p>
<p>In an early study to probe propagation in the SAN, Joyner and van Capelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Joyner1">[42]</xref> constructed a radially symmetric simplified 2D single cell type SAN model and adjoining atrial tissue. Their model predicted that driving the atrium required an SAN five times larger than reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-MassonPevet1">[23]</xref>. In our model, SAN drove the atrium regardless of size (not shown). Joyner and van Capelle also reported that atrial excitation required partial uncoupling of the SAN from the atrium. Again, no such modifications were required with our model. Joyner and van Capelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Joyner1">[42]</xref> noted that a gradual increase in coupling allowed the SAN to successfully drive the atrium. Here, our simulations support the notion that an increase in intercellular coupling from center to periphery is a prerequisite.</p>

<title>Limitations of this study</title>
<p>In future studies, different geometric configurations (such as the block zone, interdigitations between the SAN and atrial tissue border, interweaving cells in the center etc.) could be incorporated into the model. Although mechanosensitive currents in fibroblasts have been described in the SAN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Kohl1">[22]</xref>, the intrinsic feedback mechanisms controlling the currents are still controversial and so we did not apply descriptions of mechano-electrical feedback in our model fibroblasts. A very recent study in atrial fibroblasts observed TRPM7 channels that account for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in atrial fibroblasts and are markedly upregulated in patients with atrial fibrillation where they may underlie pathological fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001041-Du1">[43]</xref>. This new finding is not accounted for in our study. Finally, in this study we have neglected the effects of sympathetic stimulation of the SAN. Clearly, sympathetic innervation will constitute an important component of future studies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we showed that a relatively simple model is sufficient to represent many observed properties in the SAN. Our tissue model simulations suggest that the atrial load is a primary determinant of heterogeneity of the SAN, sequence and rate of propagation. In addition, we show fibroblasts as obstacles, current sinks, or shunts to SAN conduction depending on distribution, density and coupling.</p>
