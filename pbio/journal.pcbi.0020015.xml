Genome annotations comprise an invaluable resource for answering such questions because they describe the essential parts of a gene and their relationships to one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b001">1</xref>]—information that is missing from protein and transcript sequence files.</p><p>Although the origins and mobility of introns are still subjects of debate, previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b003">3</xref>] have established that just as amino acid sequences change over time, so do gene structures. Over comparatively short evolutionary timescales, introns lengthen and shorten [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b004">4</xref>]; and over longer timescales the number and positions of introns in orthologous and paralogous genes can change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b005">5</xref>]. These facts suggest that the intron–exon structures of genes may provide a novel source of evolutionary information irrespective of the mechanistic details of intron origin and dispersal. Indeed, several studies have already employed them for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b008">8</xref>].</p><p>The utility of gene structures as materials for phylogenetic analyses, however, depends upon their independence from the forces driving protein sequence evolution. If, for example, intron–exon structures are strongly influenced by selection at the protein level, then using them for phylogenetic investigations is largely pointless, as the same information could have been more easily gained from protein analyses. Also needed is a better understanding of the rates at which different aspects of gene structures evolve. Clearly, more slowly evolving aspects of gene-structure—intron positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b011">11</xref>], for example—are best suited to probing deep phylogenetic relationships, whereas more rapidly evolving components—such as intron lengths—are better suited for investigations of more recent events. Here too, comparison to protein evolution is also essential. If intron positions change more rapidly than protein sequences do, their power to resolve ancient relationships will be limited, even if they evolve independently of proteins.</p><p>In order to address these issues, we have characterized the number, position, and length of introns and exons in 11 individual genomes representing four phyla. These data provide a panoramic perspective from which to investigate the evolution of gene structures on a variety of timescales—from the less than 5 million years since the divergence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila simulans</named-content> and <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> to the more than 500 million years that have elapsed since the Cambrian explosion.</p><p>We show that evolution of intron lengths and positions is largely—though not completely—independent of protein sequence evolution. Thus, gene structures provide a source of information about the evolutionary past independent of protein sequence similarities. We use this fact to investigate the accuracy of the protein clock and to explore the utility of gene structures as a means to resolve deep phylogenetic relationships within the animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Development of an Open-Source Software Library for Comparative Genomics</title><p>In order to facilitate the use of genome annotations as substrates for computational analyses, we developed an open-source software library (CGL) for comparative genomics using genome annotations.

The resulting repository is unique in that no single database or genome project maintains or distributes all of these annotations.</p><p>The Bilaterian animals are generally classified as either protostomes or deuterostomes. In deuterostomes, the blastopore lip becomes the anus, whereas in the protostomes it becomes an anterior oral structure. The two lineages are believed to have last shared a common ancestor more than 500 million years ago, and the nematodes may have diverged from both lineages even earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b024">24</xref>]. We chose the genomes included in this study in such a way as to facilitate inquiries into the evolution of gene structure across various timescales using a minimum number of genomes. Accordingly, we chose to analyze the genomes of three deuterostomes, <italic>H. sapiens, M. musculus,</italic> and <italic>C. intestinalis,</italic> and an equal number of protostomes: <italic>D. melanogaster, A. gambiae,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>. This dataset also contains a deep split in both the protostome and deuterostome clades. <italic>C. intestinalis,</italic> a Urochordate, is believed to have diverged from the Craniata—the phylum to which humans and mice belong—about 500 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b026">26</xref>]; likewise among the protostomes, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. gambiae</named-content> are believed to have diverged from one another approximately 250 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b026">26</xref>]. The dataset thus contains a number of deeply divergent animal genomes, making it ideal for the investigation of long-term trends in the evolution of gene structures. Inclusion of the human and mouse genomes makes possible investigations of more rapidly changing aspects of gene structure, as they are believed to have diverged from one another about 70 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>In order to survey gene evolution during even shorter time intervals, we also included in our dataset five recently sequenced but unannotated genomes: <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. simulans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b027">27</xref>], <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. yakuba</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b027">27</xref>], <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. ananassae</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b028">28</xref>], <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b029">29</xref>], and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. virilis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b028">28</xref>]. These five <italic>Drosophila</italic> species are believed to have diverged from the <italic>melanogaster</italic> lineage around 5 million, 13 million, 44 million, 55 million, and 63 million years ago, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b030">30</xref>]. Because CGL can extract a wide array of information pertaining to the evolution of gene structure even from incompletely assembled and unannotated genomes, this effectively gave us a dataset of 11 genomes for our analyses. The inclusion of these provisionally assembled and unannotated genomes also allowed us to examine the utility of unfinished genomes for analyses of gene evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intron–Exon Structure in Six Animal Genomes</title><p>As our collection of annotated genomes contained more than 100,000 annotations, we sought first to survey and summarize the contents of each genome's annotations with regards to gene structure. We choose three basic measures: intron length, exon length, and intron density. These measures provide a concise summary of the similarities and differences in intron–exon structure for the six annotated genomes. Placing these data in their phylogenetic context allows trends in the evolution of gene structure to emerge.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Intron length.</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows the distribution of intron lengths in each of the six annotated genomes. The fact that the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> distribution is bimodal has been noted before, and used to classify its introns based upon their lengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b031">31</xref>]—here termed class-I (&lt;100 nucleotides [nt]) and class-II (&gt;100 nt). Two trends emerge when these genomes are compared. First, there is a pronounced shift in modes between the deuterostome and protostome distributions. Indeed, the relative proportion of introns falling into either intron class is more or less reversed between the two animal clades; most protostome introns are class-I, whereas most deuterostome introns are class-II. Second, introns are not merely longer in the deuterostomes; instead, the shift toward longer introns in these genomes appears to have occurred at the expense of introns of intermediate length. These data suggest that selection on intron lengths may be bimodal, with variability in the lengths of the two modes due to differences in the lengths and numbers of transposons characteristic of each genome.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020015-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020015.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Global Overview of Gene Structure in Six Annotated Animal Genomes</title><p>(A) Intron length.

All six exon-length distributions have similar modes. Mean coding-exon lengths, on the other hand, differ substantially between the protostome and deuterostome genomes. The mean coding-exon length is 149, 149, and 152 nt in the human, mouse, and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. intestinalis</named-content> genomes, respectively, whereas it is 364, 365, and 210 nt in the <italic>D. melanogaster, A. gambiae,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> genomes, respectively. The longer means associated with the protostome distributions reflect the general paucity of introns in these genomes (see following section on intron density). The fact that all six exon-length distributions have such similar modes, despite their dissimilar mean lengths, suggests that that intron spacing may be under similar selective pressure in all six genomes.</p><p>One process that might explain the longer exons characteristic of the protostome genomes is retro-transposition-mediated gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b032">32</xref>]. Because this process results in intronless copies of existing genes, each event will tend to stretch the distribution of exon lengths, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g002">Figure 2</xref> toward the right. Although the two insect genomes are enriched for intronless genes as compared to human and mouse, this is not true of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> genome. This fact argues against such a process. Thus, these data support a model whereby introns are being lost (or gained) from genes in piecemeal fashion within all six genomes.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020015-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020015.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Cumulative Distribution Functions Illustrating Proteome-Wide Trends in Protein Similarity</title><p><italic>x</italic>-axis, bits/aligned position; <italic>y</italic>-axis, cumulative fraction of HSPs having that number of bits/aligned amino acid pair or less.

Although in principle, genome-wide fluctuations in protein lengths might also affect this measure, this does not appear to be the case. To control for this possibility, we recalculated the intron densities for each of the six genomes, using only conserved portions of each annotated protein (unpublished data); the resulting distributions (discussed below) were essentially unchanged, demonstrating that changes in intron density reflect differences in intron numbers, not changes in protein lengths. Intron density thus provides a precise definition with which to distinguish intron-rich from intron-poor genes.</p><p>While intron density is an attribute of a single annotated transcript, when applied to entire annotated genomes it can also be used to provide a summary statistic regarding the distribution of introns within a genome. Consistent with the exon-length distributions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, the three deuterostome genomes are more intron-rich than the protostome genomes. Deuterostome mean intron-densities are 1.53, 1.47, and 1.42 introns/100 amino acids in the human, mouse, and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. intestinalis</named-content> genomes, respectively; and 1.21, 0.61, and 0.58 for the <italic>C. elegans, D. melanogaster,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. gambiae</named-content> genomes, respectively.</p><p>To explore these data more closely, we also examined the frequency distributions of intron density in each of the six annotated genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). As was the case for intron length, the deuterostome intron-density distributions are bimodal; thus these genomes contain two classes of annotated genes: one intron-rich, the other intron-poor. This, however, may be partially a consequence of pseudo-genes having been annotated as genes in these genomes, as the intron-poor peak largely (but not entirely) disappears if intronless genes are excluded from the calculation. By comparison to the deuterostome genomes, most insect genes are intron-poor. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> distribution is unimodal and distinctively different from those of the other five animals.</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>C make it clear that the ratio of intron insertion to deletion has varied in a lineage-dependent fashion in the course of animal evolution. Moreover, the shape of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. gambiae</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> distributions suggests that there may be a long-term trend in the <italic>Diptera</italic> toward intron loss. This process of intron loss appears to have occurred in a largely piecemeal fashion: when intronless genes are excluded from the calculation, the resulting dipterian intron density distributions are essentially unchanged from those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>C. We also examined the intron density distribution of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Apis mellifera</named-content> genome. Its distribution (unpublished data) is similar to that of <italic>C. elegans,</italic> a finding also consistent with large-scale intron loss in the <italic>Diptera</italic>.</p><p>No matter what the ancestral animal distribution may have looked like, the diversity of the present-day intron density distributions makes it certain that extensive remodeling of intron–exon structures has occurred in at least some of these genomes since the six animals last shared a common ancestor. Several lines of evidence suggest that this process has been a slow one. Current estimates of the rate of intron insertion and deletion in animal genomes have placed it at less than one event/gene/200 million years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b011">11</xref>]. Each of the animal genomes in our study contains tens of thousands of introns; this fact, together with the low intron indel rate, means that a vast period of time will have to elapse before any fluctuation in the ratio of intron insertion to deletion will act to alter the global distribution of introns within a genome. Intron density distributions are thus likely to be among the more slowly evolving attributes of any animal genome. The two insect distributions serve well to illustrate this point: their intron density distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) mirror each other to a remarkable degree despite nearly 250 million years of independent evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b026">26</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>A Survey of Proteome-Wide Patterns of Protein Similarities</title><p>Next, we sought to characterize and compare the six annotated proteomes to one another with respect to protein similarities.

As a first step, we preformed an all-against-all BLASTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b034">34</xref>] search of the six annotated proteomes, and recovered sets of pair-wise reciprocal best hits. From each BLASTP hit, we then selected the highest-scoring high-scoring segment pair (HSP) to avoid complications arising from overlapping sequence alignments. These reciprocal best-hit best HSPs provide nonidentical but intersecting sets of putative orthologs with which to examine patterns of protein evolution. A strength of this approach is that it makes available the largest possible set of putative orthologs for subsequent analyses. This means that gene families restricted to a subset of the proteomes will be included, as will more rapidly evolving proteins that lack clear orthologs over all evolutionary distances.

An additional strength of the approach is that it lends itself in a natural fashion to bootstrap analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b044">44</xref>]. Bootstrap values for each node in the tree can be obtained by randomly and repeatedly resampling a subset of the HSPs from each pair-wise comparison of proteomes, constructing a new tree using these data, and then ascertaining how frequently the resulting trees contain the same nodes as the consensus tree (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for more details).

Because CGL provides an easy means to simultaneously investigate amino acid similarities and intron–exon structures, we were able to investigate genome-wide trends in intron–exon structures using the very same HSPs that we used for our analyses of protein similarities.</p><p>Cursory examination of these HSPs makes clear two important facts. First, genome-wide trends in intron–exon structural similarities roughly parallel those of phylogeny and protein similarity.

Summarizing similarities in intron–exon structures as simple percentages, however, fails to account for the fact that intron densities vary between genomes. As our earlier characterization of intron densities revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> genome is relatively intron poor: its mean intron density is less than half that of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and human genomes. Not correcting for this factor introduces a bias into the percentages, and this fact must be considered when subjecting these data to more rigorous analyses.</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>Quantifying similarities in intron–exon structures.</title><p>In order to address differences in intron density, we formulated a more exacting, though less intuitive, definition of intron–exon structural similarity that takes intron density into account. To do so, we calculated a log odds ratio (LOD) score for each set of concatenated reciprocal best-hit best HSPs in toto, wherein the ratio of the observed number of aligned splice junctions to the expected frequency was used as a measure of global similarities in intron positions for two genomes. To obtain the expected frequency of aligned introns, we multiplied the frequencies of introns within query and subject portions of the concatenated alignment. Thus this measure of intron–exon similarity controls for the differing frequencies of introns in the different genomes.

Because both trees were constructed using exactly the same HSPs, the two trees shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref> naturally complement one another: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>A summarizes the proteome-wide patterns in amino acid similarities, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>B genome-wide similarities in the intron–exon structures of those very same annotated genes.

If protein sequence conservation had no impact on gene structures, then each of the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g004">Figure 4</xref> would be straight, horizontal lines, and the differences in their y-intercepts would reflect time since last common ancestor. In actual fact, the negative slopes of the curves imply that protein sequence conservation is acting to slow the evolution of intron–exon structures. Among human–mouse reciprocal best-hit best HSPs having 65%–70% amino acid identity, 90% of their introns are aligned, whereas fewer than 70% of introns are aligned in human–mouse reciprocal best-hit best HSPs having 40%–45% amino acid identity.

Thus, it appears that protein sequence conservation is acting to slow the rate at which intron–exon structures change. It should be kept in mind, however, that some portion of this trend may be due to the power of the reciprocal best-hit approach to identify orthologous genes, and the accuracy of the protein alignments themselves. Less well-conserved proteins may be less accurately aligned to one another than highly conserved proteins, with the consequence that their gene structures also appear less well conserved. On the balance then, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g004">Figure 4</xref> suggest that a significant portion of intron–exon structural evolution is proceeding independently of protein conservation, though protein sequence conservation is acting to slow its rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Controlling for the impact of protein conservation.</title><p>The finding that the rate of change in a gene's intron–exon structure is influenced by selection on the protein it encodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g004">Figure 4</xref>) means that the phylogenetic trees produced using intron–exon structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) and proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) are not entirely independent of one another.

To answer this question, we developed a means to construct a phylogenetic tree of intron–exon structures free of this complication. To do so, we made use of the same procedure we used to construct <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>B; only this time, we restricted the reciprocal best-hit best HSPs used to construct each pair-wise concatenated alignment such that the overall amino acid similarity of each concatenated alignment was fixed at a preselected value of 1.25 bits/aligned amino acid pair (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This restriction allowed us to control for the braking effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g004">Figure 4</xref>) exerted by protein sequence conservation on the evolution of intron–exon structures, as in each case the resulting pair-wise concatenated alignments had exactly the same degree of protein sequence conservation (approximately 50% identity). However, because no such restriction was placed on them with respect to similarities in their intron–exon structures, they were free to vary in this regard. The resulting unrooted tree based upon protein similarities alone is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g005">Figure 5</xref>A—its star topology is a consequence of our having held protein similarities constant.

Our analyses further characterize the evolution of intron lengths. As a first step toward these investigations, we used a reciprocal best-hit approach to identify sets of human and mouse orthologous paralog pairs that we term “quartets.” Each quartet consists of four genes: a pair of human paralogs and their corresponding mouse orthologs, all of which share the same intron–exon structure as judged by the positions of their annotated splice junctions relative to the protein alignments of their reciprocal best-hit best HSPs. In total, we were able to identify 1,265 quartets.

Likewise, the weaker correlation characteristic of paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g006">Figure 6</xref>B) is consistent with the duplication events producing these paralogous genes having occurred much more than 70 million years ago.</p></sec><sec id="s2g3"><title>A possible clock.</title><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g006">Figure 6</xref> suggest that changes in intron lengths might be used as a clock to date speciation and gene duplication events. These data, however, are inadequate to either prove or disprove such a hypothesis. Although it is possible to think of the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g006">Figure 6</xref> as the result of a decay process whereby orthologous intron lengths following speciation events, and paralogous introns lengths following duplication events, gradually become less similar to one another over time, showing that this is actually the case requires intermediate time points.</p><p>To further investigate these questions, we turned to the six <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes in our collection.

The insect distribution has an abundance of pairs located at the origin and stretching along the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axes, producing an arrowhead-like structure at the graph's origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). The vertebrate distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), lacks this feature, and instead is characterized by a central bulge. In order to better understand these features of the two distributions, we examined the repeat content of the orthologous intron sets using RepeatMasker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b047">47</xref>].</p><p>In general, the transposon load of the vertebrate introns is higher than that of the insects, and much of the central bulge is due to the presence of additional LINE elements in either the human or mouse member of the pair (unpublished data). This is in sharp distinction to the two insects. Although some of the larger off-diagonal intron pairs in the insect distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) contain a transposon in one or both members of the pair, in general there are far fewer transposons in the insect introns, and there are no cases wherein both members of an insect–intron pair contain the same transposon, an event that is quite common among human–mouse pairs.</p><p>Although transposons seem to explain the central bulge in the human–mouse distribution, they do not explain the details of the <italic>melanogaster–pseudoobscura</italic> distribution, since most of the intron pairs that comprise the arrowhead-like portion of the insect distribution are entirely transposon-free. Simple repeats and repetitive sequences also do not appear to play an important role in structuring this portion of the distribution, as there is no obvious tendency for the longer partner of the pair to contain additional low-complexity sequences (unpublished data). We also investigated the possibility that the arrowhead region might be an artifact of the assembly process. Although it is difficult to rule out this possibility, gaps in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> assembly did not seem especially over-represented in this portion of the distribution; moreover, given the mature state of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> assembly, it is inconceivable that there is sequence missing from a large number of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> introns. Instead, we believe that the arrowhead-like portion of the insect distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g007">Figure 7</xref>A is simply a consequence of selection pressures for short intron lengths in the <italic>Drosophilae</italic>. Certainly, the tight distribution of insect intron lengths shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref> will guarantee that an intron of any length in one <italic>Drosophila</italic> species will tend to be paired with an ortholog in another species whose length lies near the mode, a fact that will tend to produce the arrowhead portion of distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g007">Figure 7</xref>A. This hypothesis may also explain why the distributions of human–mouse orthologous introns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g006">Figure 6</xref> lack the arrowhead, as the variance in intron lengths is much greater in these two vertebrate genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>The preceding observations imply that the rate at which intron pairs leave the diagonal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g007">7</xref> will be influenced by the global distribution of intron lengths within a genome. Attempts to use orthologous intron length correlations as a clock to date speciation events must address this issue, as accurate time estimates will be obtained only if the distribution of intron lengths is similar for every genome under examination. To address this point, we used CGL to determine the intron length distribution for each of the six <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes in our collection, and found it to be essentially the same in all of them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020015-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>No doubt, other less easily measured factors also affect the rate at which intron lengths evolve within a species. If transposon load and/or rates of transposition, for example, vary greatly within two genomes, correlations in the lengths of orthologous introns will be a poor indicator of time since last common ancestor. Rather than attempt to measure the impact of a host of factors on intron lengths, we chose instead to ask a related question. Namely, how constant is the decline in the correlation in orthologous intron lengths over time? Doing so allowed us to directly assess not only whether hypothetical differences in transposition rates actually do act to modify the rates at which length correlations among homologous <italic>Drosophila</italic> introns decline with time, but also if any other factors that we have failed to consider thus far might influence the process as well.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows the length distributions of inferred orthologous intron pairs for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> and each of the five other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species in our collection of genomes.

Intron lengths vary greatly among the six annotated genomes, yet when placed in their phylogenetic context general trends emerge. Every deuterostome genome in our collection is characterized by a predominance of class-II (&gt;100 nt) introns, whereas class-I (&lt;100 nt) introns predominate in the protostome genomes. The similarity in the human and mouse distributions suggests that these distributions change slowly over periods of tens of millions of years. Our examinations of intron lengths within the <italic>Drosophilae</italic> support the same conclusion. Moreover, these data suggest that introns do not simply grow longer and shorter over evolutionary timescales, but rather that the relative proportion of introns belonging to either class grows and shrinks over periods of hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>In order to further investigate the evolution of intron lengths, we used a transitive reciprocal best-hit strategy to assemble a dataset of genes we term quartets. Each quartet consists of four genes: a pair of human paralogs and their mouse orthologs. In theory, the orthologous members of each quartet share a more recent common ancestor than do the paralogous members of the quartet. The strong correlation in intron lengths characteristic of orthologous quartet members demonstrates that intron lengths within the vertebrates remain correlated for tens of millions of years following speciation events. Our comparisons of orthologous and paralogous intron lengths in the <italic>Drosophilae</italic> show this to be true of these genomes as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>An Intron-Based Molecular Clock</title><p>To measure the rate at which intron lengths change, we examined them in the context of the protein clock. Our results show that correlations in the lengths of orthologous introns have declined at a constant rate within the <italic>Drosophilae</italic> during the past 60 million years. We also demonstrate that change in intron length is largely independent of protein evolution. These two results mean that intron lengths provide a molecular measure of time independent of the protein clock. Moreover, we show that the information necessary to employ the intron clock can be extracted from incompletely sequenced genomes. As the distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g008">Figure 8</xref> demonstrate, so long as the average contig length exceeds the average intron length, CGL can identify large numbers of orthologous introns even in low-coverage, partially assembled genomes. This result thus also serves to illustrate the ability of CGL to make use of existing annotations in order to extract useful information from unannotated, provisionally assembled genomes—a difficult-to-use but rapidly growing resource for comparative genomics.</p><p>The intron and protein clocks complement one another in a number of ways. Rates of change among protein sequences are reasonably constant for any given set of orthologous genes across phyla but vary widely among different gene families. On the other hand, our results show that the speed of the intron clock may vary between phyla, but not between gene families within a genus. These facts mean that the intron clock is well suited for investigating the evolutionary history of gene families. To see why, consider that a collection of genes all having the same intron–exon structures and intron lengths are likely the result of recent duplication events, regardless of whether they encode rapidly or slowly evolving proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Large-Scale Trends in Intron–Exon Structures</title><p>Our analyses of gene structures demonstrate that change in intron–exon structures is subject to greater lineage-specific variation than is protein sequence evolution. The jagged right-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>B serves to illustrate this fact; by comparison, protein sequence evolution is much more uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Our investigations of intron density distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) support a similar conclusion and also provide some indication as to the nature of these rate variations.

Moreover, our results show that intron–exon structures evolve largely independently of protein sequences. This is a significant finding, as it means that intron–exon structures offer a source of phylogenetic information independent of protein sequences. Thus, similarities in gene structures can be used to test conclusions drawn from comparative genomic analyses based upon protein sequence similarities. Nevertheless, the greater variability in their rates is cause for caution. Certainly, there is nothing in our data to suggest that phylogenetic trees based upon intron–exon structures should take precedent over protein-based analyses when the two contradict one another.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Intron Densities</title><p>The large numbers of introns and low rate of intron insertion and deletion characteristic of animal genomes make it likely that intron density distributions are among the more slowly evolving traits of any animal genome.

The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. simulans</named-content> W501 assembly (15 March 2004) was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dpgp.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.dpgp.org</ext-link>; the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. yakuba</named-content> assembly was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/seqmgr/yakuba" xlink:type="simple">ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/seqmgr/yakuba</ext-link> on 15 March 2004; the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. virilis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. ananassae</named-content> assemblies were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rana.lbl.gov/drosophila" xlink:type="simple">http://rana.lbl.gov/drosophila</ext-link> on 21 June 2004 and 30 June 2004, respectively; the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> assembly is as used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b029">29</xref>].</p><p>Reciprocal best-hit best HSPs were recovered from proteome-versus-proteome BLASTP searches using WU-BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b055">55</xref>] cut off: E = 10<sup>−5</sup>; wordmask = seg of the two corresponding nonredundant multi-fasta files. For each search, the database size (WU-BLAST parameter Z) was fixed to the size of the combined nonredundant protein multi-fasta file for all six genomes. Details of the specific analyses are given below.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">1</xref>B summarizes the frequencies of unique intron and unique coding-exon lengths, respectively, for each of the six annotated genomes. When calculating intron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), in cases where the gene produced more than one transcript but the protein produced by one transcript was a perfect substring of another's, the intron density of the transcript encoding the longer protein was used; if a gene encoded two or more transcripts, both producing two different proteins, the intron density of both was used. For purposes of display, each transcript's intron density was multiplied by 100 and placed in one of 11 bins; these are denoted by the circles on the trend lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figure 1</xref>C. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the reported BLAST bit score of each reciprocal best-hit best HSP was divided by the length of the shorter aligned sequence (query or subject), and the cumulative distribution function is plotted. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g002">2</xref>, the resulting data histograms are plotted as curves in order to better illustrate trends, and to facilitate display of data from all six genomes on the same figure. Curves were “smoothed” using Microsoft Excel so that closely overlapping curves did not obscure one another in the figures.</p><p>The tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>A was created using the same sets of reciprocal best-hit best HSPs used to produce <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g002">Figure 2</xref>. The protein alignment portion of each pair-wise set of HSPs was concatenated, and the sum of their bit scores was divided by the length of the resulting concatenated alignment to derive an average number of bits/aligned amino acid pair <italic>(H)</italic> for each pair-wise proteome comparison. Inter-proteome distances were calculated by exponentiation of this value, e.g., D = 2<sup>−<italic>H</italic></sup>. The resulting 6 × 6 distance matrix was then used to produce a neighbor-joining tree using Phylip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b043">43</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>B was produced using the same procedure, except that rather than calculate <italic>H,</italic> instead, a related value, <italic>I</italic> = log<sub>2</sub>(P<sub>qs</sub>/(P<sub>q</sub>*P<sub>s</sub>)) was used, where P<sub>qs</sub> is the observed frequency of aligned splice junctions (to the same aligned amino acid pair), and P<sub>q</sub> and P<sub>s</sub> are the frequency of splice junctions in the query and subject portions of the concatenated alignment, respectively. Both trees were bootstrapped by repeating the tree-building process 100 additional times using concatenated alignments of the same length; these were produced by randomly resampling the HSPs with replacement.</p><p>To produce <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g004">Figure 4</xref>, all human–mouse, human–<italic>Ciona,</italic> human–<italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> and human–<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. intestinalis</named-content> reciprocal best-hit best HSPs, containing at least one intron in either the query or the subject sequence, were binned by percent amino acid identity (<italic>x</italic>-axis); the average fraction of aligned introns in each bin is denoted by the circle on the trend line. Each of the bins contains at least 100 HSPs from each of the four pair-wise comparisons. To facilitate display of multiple datasets, lines connect data points.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g005">Figure 5</xref> was constructed using the same procedures as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g003">Figure 3</xref>, but the following procedure was used to obtain a set of concatenated alignments all having the same <italic>H</italic> (1.25 bits/aligned position). First, the reciprocal best-hit best HSPs were sorted by percent identity and the value of <italic>H</italic> was calculated for the HSP collection in toto. Next, an HSP was dropped from the beginning of the sorted list, stored as HSP<sub>a</sub>, and <italic>H</italic> was recalculated and stored as (<italic>H</italic><sub>1</sub>). HSP<sub>a</sub> was returned to the list, and an HSP was dropped from the end of the sorted list, stored as HSP<sub>b</sub>, and <italic>H</italic> was recalculated and stored as (<italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>). Depending upon which value (<italic>H</italic><sub>1</sub> or <italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>) was closest to the target value of 1.25 bits, either HSP<sub>a</sub> or HSP<sub>b</sub> was permanently dropped from the list, and the process was repeated until the value of <italic>H</italic> for the remaining HSPs converged upon the target value ± 0.005 bits. This value was then used to produce the tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g005">Figure 5</xref>A. <italic>I</italic> was then calculated using this set of HSPs to produce the tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g005">Figure 5</xref>B.</p><p>To extract orthologous introns from unannotated genomes, each annotated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> protein was searched against a genome assembly using WU-TBLASTN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b055">55</xref>] (cut off: E = 1e<sup>−5</sup>; wordmask = seg). For all searches, the database size (Z) was set to 128,000,000 nt, the approximate size of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> euchromatic genome. CGL was then used to infer whether or not the details of the resulting TBLASTN HSPs of the best hit to the target genome were consistent with the presence of an intron in the target genome at the same position as an annotated splice junction on the <italic>melanogaster</italic> protein. Orthologous introns were counted as found only if the portion of the TBLASTN alignment flanking each inferred intron junction had greater than 25% identity and was at least 15 amino acids long—and only then if the putative intron began with the sequence GT and ended with an AG dimer; the procedure was thus quite stringent. The length distributions of these introns are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020015-sg001">Figure S1</xref>. Current <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> annotation standards forbid the creation of an annotation having an intron less than 40 bases in length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b019">19</xref>]. We adopted the same rule when constructing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g008">Figure 8</xref>, and thus excluded every case in which the inferred intron was less than 40 nt in length. It is worth noting that we did identify some introns smaller than 40 bp in the unannotated genomes; however, upon closer inspection, most but not all appeared to be due to either assembly artifacts or pseudo-genes. To facilitate display of multiple datasets, the resulting histograms are plotted as lines. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and the panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g008">Figure 8</xref> were produced by plotting the length of the annotated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> intron on the <italic>x</italic>-axis and the length of its inferred ortholog on the <italic>y</italic>-axis. Introns containing repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020015-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) were identified using RepeatMasker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b047">47</xref>] together with the BDGP transposon library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020015-b056">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020015-sg001" mimetype="application/photoshop" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020015.sg001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Annotated and Inferred Intron Lengths for Six <italic>Drosophila</italic> Species</title><p>All intron lengths are inferred, with the exception of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>.</p><p>dana, <italic>D. ananassae;</italic> dmel, <italic>D. melanogaster;</italic> dpse, <italic>D. pseudoobscura;</italic> dsim6, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. simulans</named-content> (strain 6); dvir, <italic>D. virilis;</italic> dyak, <italic>D. yakuba. x</italic>-axis, intron length (log <sub>10</sub>); <italic>y</italic>-axis, frequency.</p><p>(2.1 MB PSD)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020015-sg002" mimetype="application/photoshop" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020015.sg002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Neighbor-Joining Tree of Pair-Wise Correlations in Orthologous Intron Lengths</title><p>Pair-wise Spearman correlation coefficients were used as a similarity measure.
