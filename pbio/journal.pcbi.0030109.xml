The dynamic interplay between pathogen and host can have one of three outcomes: death of the host, persistent disease, or recovery. To understand and influence this complex system, it is imperative that we identify the subset of key components and regulatory interactions whose perturbation or tuning leads to significant functional changes. Mathematical modeling can assist in this process by integrating the behavior of multiple components into a comprehensive network model, and by addressing questions that are not yet accessible to experimental analysis.</p><p>We used two species of the genus <italic>Bordetellae</italic> as model organisms because (1) they are examples of pathogens that successfully overcome the defenses of their mammalian hosts, (2) their genomes are completely sequenced, and (3) two closely related species of <italic>Bordetellae</italic> provide a comparative model to understand how virulence factors modulate immune responses. The <italic>Bordetellae</italic> are small, Gram-negative coccobacilli, some of which colonize the respiratory tracts of their hosts, adhering to ciliated epithelia and spreading via respiratory droplets. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> are two very closely related species that have different host ranges and cause different diseases in their hosts. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> naturally infects wild and domesticated animals, including leopards, koala bears, cows, dogs, rabbits, and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b005">5</xref>], and causes a persistent disease typified by atrophic rhinitis in pigs and by kennel cough in dogs. <italic>B. pertussis,</italic> which evolved from a <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content>–like progenitor, causes whooping cough (pertussis) in humans and is endemic in much of the world. Whooping cough is an acute illness characterized by severe coughing that can become spasmodic, and in some cases leads to death. Although the human pathogen does not cause persistent infection, its rapid spread within relatively dense and mobile human populations is apparently sufficient to allow transient infections to circulate on an ongoing basis, allowing the bacteria to survive within a population.</p><p>The different persistence strategies of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> are surprising in light of their high genetic relatedness. The <italic>Bordetella</italic> strains mainly evolve through loss of genes and acquisition of insertion sequences. The two strains of <italic>Bordetellae</italic> studied in this paper share 3,394 genes with a synonymous substitution rate of 0.021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b006">6</xref>]. The majority of known virulence factors, including adhesins (filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA], pertactin, and fimbriae) and toxins (adenylate cyclase toxin [ACT] and dermonecrotic toxin) are expressed by both <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <italic>B. pertussis.</italic> Despite this, the genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> is 30% smaller than that of <italic>B. bronchiseptica,</italic> due in part to the loss of numerous sizable multigenic regions (e.g., the 22-kb genomic region required for the assembly of a predominant antigen, O-antigen). Interestingly, there also appear to be a number of genes present but not expressed by one pathogen or the other (e.g., the genes encoding pertussis toxin [PTX] are only expressed by <italic>B. pertussis;</italic> see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030109-t001">Table 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b012">12</xref>]).

Bacteria and the components of the immune system (i.e., immune cells and cytokines) were represented as network nodes; and interactions, regulatory relationships, and transformations among components were represented as directed edges starting from the source (regulator) node and ending in the target node. We incorporated regulatory relationships that modulate a process (or an unspecified mediator of a process) as edges directed toward another edge. The regulatory effect of each edge was classified into activation or inhibition, and is represented by an incoming black arrow or an incoming red blunt segment, respectively, in the figures. Since not all processes involved in natural <italic>B. pertussis</italic> clearance are known or addressable through the mouse infection model, we extended the set of known interactions by putative interactions based on general immunological knowledge.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030109-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030109.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The Consensus Network of Immunological Steps and Processes Activated upon Invasion by <italic>Bordetellae</italic> Species</title><p>Network nodes denote components of the immune system, and edges represent interactions and processes.

However, we did separately include the set of virulence factors identified in the literature as modulating immune responses in a species-specific manner. The resulting network had 18 nodes common in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <italic>B. pertussis;</italic> two species-specific nodes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> (O-antigen and the type III secretion system [TTSS]), two species-specific nodes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> (PTX, and a combined node for FHA and ACT). Here, we first describe the network common to both species, illustrating the sequence of processes activated after bacterial invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g001">Figure 1</xref>), followed by a description of the species-specific nodes in the two bacteria.</p><p>The first immune mechanisms that respond to Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–mediated recognition of bacteria and the alternative complement pathway. Both species express lipopolyssacharide (LPS) that is recognized by TLR4 receptors on respiratory epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs). TLR4-mediated signaling in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as LPS activates the production of cytokines and chemokines. Many of these, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and TNF-β, are proinflammatory and recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to the site of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b013">13</xref>]. Complement-activated PMNs produce cytokines, which in turn recruit more phagocytes. Following the commencement of phagocytosis, DCs (the main antigen-presenting cells included in the network) present antigens to T0 cells (naive T cells). Signal transduction networks activated during this interaction induce cytokines, leading to the differentiation of T0 cells into either T helper type 1 (Th1) cells or Th2 cells. Th1/Th2 cells also produce the cytokines required for T cell differentiation, leading to a positive feedback in the differentiation process. We denote the common cytokines inducing differentiation of T0 cells to Th1 (or Th2) cells and produced in turn by Th1 (or Th2) cells as Th1 (or Th2)–related cytokines (Th1RCs or Th2RCs). These cytokines are mutually inhibitory in that Th1RCs (such as IFN-γ and IL-12) inhibit the production and function of Th2RCs (for example, IL-4 and IL-10), and vice versa. Some Th2RCs, such as IL-10, are anti-inflammatory, and inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines (PICs), reducing the recruitment of PMNs. The balance between the production of Th1RCs and Th2RCs plays an important role in the time course of the immune responses.</p><p>Th2 cells activate the clonal expansion of B cells, which in turn produce antibodies against bacterial antigens. Opsonization of bacteria by complement-fixing antibodies leads to the activation of the classical complement pathway. PMNs express complement receptors that recognize complement-coated bacteria as well as Fc receptors that recognize the Fc region of antibodies bound to bacterial antigens; both mechanisms result in the activation of PMNs. In general, the classical complement pathway can directly lyse bacteria; however, this mechanism is found to be weak for <italic>Bordetellae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b015">15</xref>]. Therefore, we did not include bacterial lysis in the network. Th1 cells produce a set of cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-β, and IL-2, which activate phagocytes to ingest and kill bacteria. PICs and Th1RCs attract more phagocytes to the site of infection, where they are activated and eliminate antibody-bound bacteria. Thus, the Th2- and Th1-mediated adaptive responses constitute a positive feedback to phagocytes for antigen-specific elimination of the pathogen. We assume that the main mechanism of natural clearance of the <italic>Bordetellae</italic> is via phagocytosis by activated phagocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b015">15</xref>].</p><p>Bacterial virulence factors such as LPS, PTX, TTSS, FHA, and ACT modulate these host immune processes at several levels. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> LPS contains long repeats of O-antigen that inhibit the activation of the alternative complement pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b016">16</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> expresses a TTSS that induces the necrosis of PMNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b018">18</xref>]. The TTSS is known to inhibit the activation of Th1RCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b017">17</xref>]; specifically, the TTSS in association with ACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b019">19</xref>] inhibits IFN-γ production during the first week of the infection, thus inhibiting the differentiation of T0 cells into Th1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b021">21</xref>]. Consequently, IL-10 (a Th2RC) is produced, facilitating the differentiation of T0 cells into Th2 cells. In a <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> infection, the alternative complement pathway is active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b022">22</xref>]; however, early recruitment of PMNs is inhibited by the activity of PTX, and thus PMN activation and phagocytosis are delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b023">23</xref>]. Like <italic>B. bronchiseptica, B. pertussis</italic> has also developed mechanisms for the suppression of Th1-related responses. FHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b024">24</xref>] and ACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b025">25</xref>], in association with LPS, stimulate IL-10 production by DCs, transiently inhibiting IL-12 and Th1 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b026">26</xref>]. ACT also enhances DC activation and maturation, promoting the early differentiation of T0 cells into T regulatory 1 (Tr1) and Th2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b027">27</xref>]. As Tr1 and Th2 cells have a functionally similar role, we represent them as a single node. Note that although the immunomodulation due to the synergistic activity of TTSS and ACT (in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content>) and FHA and ACT (in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content>) appear similar, their exact target of action is different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b027">27</xref>]. Thus, both pathogens have evolved strategies to suppress antigen-specific Th1 responses during the acute phase of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b028">28</xref>], modulating the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses to their favor.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Dynamic Model</title><p>During the course of infection, the time-dependent expression of specific virulence factors and/or immune components results in a differential infection time course in the two species.

The network's nodes were assumed to have two qualitative states: 0 (off) and 1 (on), corresponding to a baseline (below-threshold) and high (above-threshold) concentration or activity, respectively. The state change of each node was described by a Boolean transfer function <italic>F</italic> that depends on the state of the nodes connected to it by directed edges and on its own state. The transfer functions were developed from the knowledge of the nodes directly upstream of each target node in the network, and augmented with dynamic information from the literature and basic immunology when available. The state of target nodes having a single activator and no inhibitors follows the state of the activator with a delay. Often, the target node is regulated by more than one pathway. We used the AND operator whenever synergy between two (or more) nodes is absolutely necessary to activate the target node. When either of nodes connected to the target node could activate it, the OR operator was used. For inhibition, we used the AND NOT operator, requiring a low level or inactivity for the inhibitor in order for the activation of the target node. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030109-t002">Table 2</xref> lists the transfer functions of each node, and a detailed justification of each transfer function is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-se001">Text S1</xref>.</p><p>The transfer functions define a discrete dynamic system in which iteration determines the evolution of the state of nodes.

				</p><p>We extended the general Boolean framework to incorporate known quantitative information by introducing decay rates for cytokines (Th1RCs and Th2RCs) and virulence factors (FHA/ACT and TTSS) and a threshold for the duration of DC activity required for T0 cell differentiation and the duration of phagocytosis necessary for clearance (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We performed a systematic search in parameter space to determine the parameter regions that satisfy the following two criteria derived from the literature: (1) reaching bacterial clearance under normal conditions and (2) association of bacterial clearance from the lower respiratory tract with Th1-related activity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-se002">Text S2</xref> for a detailed parameter analysis).

These processes include ligand–receptor binding, signal transduction, cytokine production, cell differentiation, and cellular chemotaxis, and span a range of time scales. We incorporated inequalities between two process durations as updating one node before the other in each round of update. Candidate inequalities were accepted only if the resulting dynamics of the model did not contradict experimentally known temporal information (e.g., that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> infections of mice with an initial dose of ~5 × 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units [CFUs] are reproducibly cleared from the lung by days 70 and 50, respectively; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-sg001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-st002">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-st003">S3</xref> for a compilation of known temporal information). First, to incorporate the fact that the residential epithelial cells are first to recognize bacteria, epithelial cells were always updated before DCs in both species. The implementation of this criterion decreased the standard deviation of the clearance time distribution to 0.88 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> (μ = 24) and 1.07 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> (μ = 22) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A).</p><p>Second, because cytokine regulation is important in directing the course of infection and because only limited information was available on the timing of cytokine production and decay, we explored all possible relative durations for the synthesis of the three cytokine classes (PICs, Th1RCs, and Th2RCs), and found that updating Th1RCs before Th2RCs and Th2RCs before PICs led to a significant narrowing of the clearance time distributions (μ = 27, σ = 0.62 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and μ = 22, σ = 0.64 in <italic>B. pertussis;</italic> see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). The first part of this condition implies that either the Th1RCs are produced faster than the Th2RCs or Th1RCs are sensed faster than Th2RCs during the interaction between T0 cells and DCs. The validity of this assumption is supported by the experimental observation that in the absence of the immunomodulating virulence factors TTSS/ACT and FHA/ACT, IFN-γ (a Th1RC) is produced before IL-10 (a Th2RC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b027">27</xref>]. The condition on PICs was necessary only for their second, adaptive immunity–related activation, and implies that the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines by Th2-related cytokines is released later than their inhibition of Th1RCs (Th1-related cytokines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b022">22</xref>]. The cytokine timing criterion described above was also necessary to reproduce the known earlier clearance of certain mutant bacteria (described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-st003">Table S3</xref>; see Systemic Effects of Deletions and Comparison with Experimental Results for more information).</p><p>Third, to incorporate the fact that the activation of the recruited phagocytes and consequent phagocytosis of bacteria are complex multistep processes, the corresponding nodes were updated penultimately and last, respectively, in each step. After the implementation of these conditions, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> were cleared on a single time step, the 26th and 21st, respectively, in all 1,000 simulations. Thus, the sequence of update orders incorporated in the model offers predictions on the population level differences in the relative time scale of the immune processes. Experimental testing of the timing inequalities expressed by our update criteria can potentially elucidate the possibilities for variation in the clearance time scale of natural infections. The next step was to analyze the activity of each node during our in silico pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Three Phases in the In Silico Pathogenesis</title><p>To represent a previously uninfected host encountering bacteria, we started the dynamic simulation with initial state (at time step <italic>t</italic> = 0) of all nodes at 0 (off), except for bacteria that were assumed to be at 1 (on). We observed three distinct temporal patterns common to all 1,000 simulations with asynchronous update, allowing us to identify three phases in the course of infection: innate responses, including PIC production and the recruitment of PMNs and DCs (phase I); B cell– and antibody-mediated responses (phase II); and Th1-related responses leading to a significant activation of phagocyte recruitment and activation, and ultimately leading to bacterial clearance (phase III). To illustrate these phases of pathogenesis, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g003">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g005">5</xref> we present subsets of the network of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g001">Figure 1</xref>, additionally including species-specific virulence factors; these figures delineate the processes that are most active in the three infection stages within each of the two organisms and indicate timing information whenever an estimate was available (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-st004">Table S4</xref> for a compilation of active nodes in each phase). The experimental data support the existence of distinct responses in these three phases. For example, in the bacterial growth curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g006">Figure 6</xref>, the bacterial numbers increase exponentially in the first 7 d of infection (our phase I), after which an immune-mediated decline is observed. While the second and third phases do not clearly separate on the bacterial growth curves, there is ample evidence for the existence of both humoral (Th2-related) adaptive immunity (our phase II) and cellular (Th1-related) adaptive immunity (our phase III) in in vivo infections by wild-type strains. Moreover, both for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <italic>B. pertussis,</italic> recovery from infection was associated with the development of pathogen-specific Th1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b034">34</xref>]. The long-term steady state of our model after the clearance of bacteria indicates all immune components in an unperturbed (subthreshold) state, with the exception of the two antibody nodes. This steady state is a simplified representation of immunological memory. In the following, we present the in silico time course by focusing on the activity of seven selected nodes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g007">Figure 7</xref>, wild-type [WT]), and we describe the experimental observations supporting our results.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030109-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030109.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Phase I of In Silico Pathogenesis</title><p>Depicts innate immune responses leading to activation of DCs, phagocytes, and PICs during the first week of the infection by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> or <italic>B. pertussis.</italic> Bacterial virulence factors are shown as red squares, and edges corresponding to inhibition are in red.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030109.g003" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><fig id="pcbi-0030109-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030109.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Phase II of In Silico Pathogenesis</title><p>Depicts Th2-related responses, including antibody production and humoral responses to the infection by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> infections.

This induces the differentiation of T0 cells to Th2 cells, which facilitates antibody production by B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g007">Figure 7</xref>; Bb, WT, Ag–Ab complex). Due to the activation of complement-fixing antibodies, complement is active in this phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g007">Figure 7</xref>; Bb, WT, Complement). Th2RCs suppress the production of PICs, inhibiting PMN recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g007">Figure 7</xref>; Bb, WT, PIC, Th2RC). Indeed, IL-10 (a Th2RC)–producing cells are observed in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content>–infected mice in the second week after inoculation, due to the inhibition of IFN-γ (a Th1RC)–producing cells by TTSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b020">20</xref>].

Indeed, IL-10 is produced through TLR4 signaling in response to ACT and peaks at 24 h after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b026">26</xref>]. B cells are activated by Th2 cells on the fourth or fifth time step, which is followed by the production of antibodies. The production of Th1RCs is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g007">Figure 7</xref>; Bp, WT, Th1RC) due to the presence of Th2RCs. Antibodies produced in this phase neutralize PTX; however, PMNs are not recruited yet due to the Th2RCs' inhibition of PICs and of Th1RCs. Macrophage activity is also below threshold due to the same inhibition, indicating a lesser pathology of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> than of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> in the simulation.

We can thus infer that due to the Th1RC inhibition by FHA/ACT, the first DC infiltrate leads to T0 cell differentiation into Th2 cells. Phase III starts on the 15th time step in the simulation. Following Th1RC production, macrophages and PMNs are recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g007">Figure 7</xref>; Bp, WT, Recruited PMNs) and activated by antibody-opsonized bacteria, leading to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> clearance on the 21st time step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g007">Figure 7</xref>; Bp, WT, Bacteria; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B for the experimental time course of PMNs).

Further quantitative experimental information will be necessary to analyze the relative contribution of Th1RCs and PICs in phagocyte recruitment.

The secondary infection with the same or different species (cross-infections) allowed us to better understand the complex pathogen–host interplay and to generate testable predictions.

This representation of the secondary challenge is not simply a continuation of the primary infection. Although the state of the node “bacteria” does not change at the time of the second challenge (it already is on), the second challenge can lead to the reactivation of certain cytokines and virulence factors that have previously decayed during the primary infection. We modeled three scenarios: first, reinfection of diseased hosts, by using a secondary initial state corresponding to time step 9, in phase II, for both <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <italic>B. pertussis.</italic> Second, we modeled the infection of convalescent hosts by a secondary initial state corresponding to time step 21 for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and time step 18 for <italic>B. pertussis,</italic> in phase III (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g007">Figure 7</xref> for the state of key nodes at these time steps).

We found that the only case of faster clearance is secondary infection of convalescent hosts in the presence of antibody cross-reactivity, a result confirmed by preliminary experiments (Wolfe DN and ETH, unpublished data).</p><p>We also studied secondary infections of immune hosts by using an initial condition where antibodies are active, a state that approximates immunological memory. It is known that memory T cells and B cells are also generated after an infection; however, these cells require reactivation, and the mechanisms involved are not understood. The capacity of memory B cells to proliferate faster after priming and to produce antibodies with increased affinity could not be incorporated in our current qualitative model. Our approximation thus serves as an upper limit of immunological memory. We found similar results as in the case of prior treatment with antibodies (i.e., <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> was cleared by the sixth time step, but there was no early clearance of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content>). This latter result suggests the possibility of reinfection of previously vaccinated individuals, probably associated with a subclinical disease but a nonzero transmission probability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b042">42</xref>].</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Analysis of the effect of active nodes.</title><p>To find the minimum number of immune components that must be active at the beginning of a secondary infection by an identical or cross-reacting species to enable early clearance, we turned off the active nodes of the secondary initial state in phase III one by one. We found that only one active immune component, namely one of the two groups of antibodies, is required, since Th1RCs produced early in the secondary infection (due to the absence of TTSS or FHA/ACT) recruited phagocytes that were activated by antibodies and cleared the bacteria. Thus, the minimum condition for the early clearance is that the node “Th1RC” and one of the antibody nodes are on and that TTSS (in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content>) or FHA/ACT (in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content>) is off. This early clearance is based on antigen recognition by the antibodies from the primary infection, similar to earlier clearance in the presence of serum antibodies. Interestingly, our model predicts that the most active phagocytes in secondary infection of convalescent hosts are different from the phagocytes responsible for serum antibody–mediated clearance; namely, the former are macrophages activated by Th1RCs, while the latter are neutrophils recruited by PICs and activated by antibodies. Thus, although macrophages are not required for the clearance of a single infection (see Deletion of other immune components), they play a crucial role in the early clearance of secondary infections of convalescent hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Experimental observations validate model predictions.</title><p>To test the prediction of earlier clearance of a secondary infection, we performed follow-up experiments where a <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> or <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> second challenge was given on day 49 after inoculation. This reinfection of convalescent hosts corresponds to a secondary initial condition of phase III in our simulations. As shown by the open circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g006">Figure 6</xref>, the secondary infections of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> were cleared in 15 d.

These approaches allow us to manipulate components that are experimentally detectable, and they increase our knowledge about individual immune mechanisms and related responses. In the present study, we synthesized these separate sets of information into an integrated network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g001">Figure 1</xref>) that gives a comprehensive view of the system. Immunological studies often focus on model organisms; however, the results ultimately need to be applicable to the natural host. We overcame such limitations by constructing unbiased (consensus) networks such as that represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030109-g001">Figure 1</xref> and adding on pathogen-specific mechanisms as specific nodes and edges. Although the edges of the network are based on information from experimental observations, the network is more than the sum of its parts because it enables the evaluation of the direct and indirect effects of perturbing each node. Constructing such consensus models has the potential for accelerating new discoveries in a field; such advances are sorely needed for <italic>B. pertussis,</italic> which is still persistent in human populations in part because the information about human-specific immune responses is limited. Though our network analysis is dependent on the definition of the nodes and edges, it is flexible enough to describe the system under study accurately.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Dynamic Simulation</title><p>The network-based dynamic model enabled us to analyze the time course of the immunological responses and bacterial clearance. Dynamic modeling usually employs continuous or discrete methods. For continuous models, detailed information about the interaction kinetics, rate constants, and component concentrations is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b044">44</xref>]. Previous models of immunological response to pathogen invasion, mostly based on ordinary differential equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b046">46</xref>] or cellular automata models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b047">47</xref>], have focused on the interaction between a few cell types, cytokines, and pathogens. The kinetic parameters of these models were estimated by comparison of pathogen and/or cytokine concentration time courses from experiments and models. By focusing on a small subset of the immune response, these models do not reflect the diversity, complexity, and long-range feedbacks present in pathogen–host interactions, and thus may lead to unrealistic results. In our comprehensive network model, several nodes represent populations of cells or families of cytokines, and edges represent whole signal transduction pathways; thus, the molecular-level description of each node would need quantitative knowledge of complex subnetworks, knowledge that is currently missing. The fact that we have limited knowledge, even at the coarse-grained level presented here, does not allow us to use continuous methods.</p><p>The qualitative dynamic descriptions we use, in addition to being the practical choice, are well suited for networks that need to function robustly despite changes in external and internal parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b049">49</xref>]. Qualitative discrete modeling such as ours has been previously successfully implemented in gene regulatory networks and signal transduction networks for predicting the dynamic trajectory of biological circuits and for accessing the reliability of gene regulatory networks in signal processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b050">50</xref>]. In the study of immunological responses, this approach has been implemented in small networks for the analysis of T cell activation and anergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b051">51</xref>] and for the analysis of lymphocyte subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b052">52</xref>]. Here, a comprehensive network was constructed to study the immunological responses at the systems level, and the dynamic model of this network was successfully validated.</p><p>The ingredients (node states, transfer functions) of our dynamic model refer to the node (component) level, and there is no explicit control over pathway-level effects. Moreover, the combinatorial transfer functions we used are, to varying extents, conjectures, informed by the best available experimental information. For example, FcγR, C3, and Th1-mediated activation of phagocytes might have a complex, partly redundant, and partly synergistic relationship, as there is a requirement for both the recruitment and activation (by at least one mechanism) of phagocytes in the natural clearance of both <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> and <italic>B. pertussis.</italic> Our assumption for the node “activated phagocytes” allowed all three processes mentioned above to contribute towards bacterial phagocytosis, and the dynamic model allowed us to analyze the temporal separation between contributions to phagocytosis by these three processes. As the model's dynamics is an emergent, systems-level property, and our choice of parameters was based on the normal time course, an agreement between experimental and theoretical results of node disruptions is not inherent, and provides a validation of the model. Indeed, our model agrees with experimental results on numerous negative or positive perturbations in immune mechanisms (such as the deletion of B cells or adoptive transfer of antibodies).</p><p>We incorporated possible stochastic differences within individual host responses by randomly sampling update orders, and incorporated known relative temporal information on interactions and processes as restrictions on the order of update; for example, epithelial cells were always updated before dendritic cells. At a molecular level, we can interpret the restrictions on the order of updates either as restrictions on the relative duration of processes or on the time required to activate their target nodes. For example, updating Th1RCs before Th2RCs either means that the signal transduction pathway activating Th1RCs is faster or that Th1RCs once produced can activate downstream processes more quickly than can Th2RCs. Moreover, the orders of updates also gave an insight into the regulatory processes; for example, we find that a slow phagocytosis process ensures better, more reproducible bacterial clearance. The model identified two possible oscillatory behaviors of Th1RCs and Th2RCs: short oscillations in the absence of modulating factors, and the switch-like behavior in the presence of those modulating factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Virulence Factors</title><p>Our network model gives insight into how virulence factors change the course of innate and adaptive immune responses, and allows the comparison of species-specific virulence factors. For example, both the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> O-antigen and the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> PTX inhibit early immune responses, assisting bacterial multiplication and survival. Our directed network representation allows for tracing the sequence of immune responses following recognition of the pathogen. The O-antigen interacts with host components earlier in this sequence (in the pseudodynamic sense introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b053">53</xref>]) than does PTX, as it inhibits bacterial recognition, while PTX disables the recruitment of immune cells that recognize bacteria. However, the inhibitory effect of PTX is ultimately more effective since it gives <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> a means to resist the effect of serum antibodies. Comparing the way in which the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> TTSS and the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> FHA/ACT modulate T helper cell balance gives insight into why the TTSS gene is not expressed in <italic>B. pertussis.</italic> The TTSS causes necrosis of PMNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b017">17</xref>], which is possibly a side effect of the evolution of the TTSS's primary role to modulate cytokines, and which ultimately leads to a stronger immune response. Unlike <italic>B. bronchiseptica,</italic> the milder pathology during <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> infection allows it to modulate immunity silently.</p><p>The model also provides insight into regulatory mechanisms of antigens and suggests differential regulation of virulence factors by two distinct mechanisms: (1) immune-mediated neutralization/elimination, or (2) decay due to bacterial gene regulation or to a reduction in bacterial numbers. The conclusion that the effects of the secreted factors ACT and TTSS are longer lasting than the effects of PTX is supported by the observation that PTX does not modulate cytokines or chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b023">23</xref>]. The model also predicts that the decay rates of the (effect of) Th2RCs, TTSS, and FHA/ACT are similar. Results of new experiments will lead to further refinement of the model; for example, the speculations that the LPS containing O-antigen decreases host cells' access to other factors such as adhesins, or that it facilitates secretion of toxins, can be incorporated if supported by dynamic evidence.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Pathogenesis</title><p>One of the most important contributions of our model is the identification of the pathogenesis phases. The definition of three infection phases is preferable to using exact timing because specific processes can have different durations in different hosts, and timing results obtained in model organisms might not be directly applicable to the pathogens' natural hosts. The time scale of processes in our dynamic model does not correspond exactly to the experimentally observed timing in mice infections, but the transition from one phase to another is captured. Comparing the model and experimental time scales, we estimate that one time step corresponds to 1–2 d of infection. The time span of the third phase is shorter in the model than in experiments because quantitative differences cannot be reproduced in the present qualitative model; or equivalently, the implicit bacterial concentration threshold of our model is higher than the experimental detection threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Implications</title><p>Models such as this allow the efficient use and logical representation of available information. We extracted host- and pathogen-specific processes from the experimental literature, and used overlapping information, such as the modulation of Th1 and Th2 cell types, from other host–pathogen systems. Our model allows the identification of new relationships and the making of new predictions that would be difficult to derive from less formal analysis. First, the logical network representation of the pathogen- and host-related information will allow microbiologists and immunologists to see the knowledge gaps in the results from different laboratories and appreciate the synergy between the pathogen and the host. For example, the role of FHA in cytokine balance and its possible synergy with TTSS and ACT has not been studied in the ancestral pathogen <italic>B. bronchiseptica.</italic> Second, the timing constraints and parameters derived from our dynamic model give predictions regarding the time scales of several of the processes. Experimental testing of our results on the degradation of toxins and cytokines (or their effects) will be able to establish the mechanism responsible for this degradation. Third, and perhaps most important, the model is able to predict the outcome of perturbations not yet explored experimentally and to direct future experimental efforts. A considerable amount of sustained manual effort is necessary to study immunological processes by traditional techniques. Modeling leads to efficient ways for analyzing the effect of knockout mutations, as it is straightforward to delete certain components in the model and observe the consequences on bacterial clearance and activation/inhibition of immunological components. While our model lacks quantitative kinetic and spatial detail, it can serve as a scaffold to which experimentalists and modelers can add future results on the regulation between immune components and bacterial mechanisms as they become available.</p><p><italic>Bordetella</italic> evolution is leading to the frequent emergence of new strains and species. Our simulations of cross-infections with or without cross-immunity constitute the first step toward modeling the within-host effects of newly emerged <italic>Bordetella</italic> species. Such simulations can be extended to incorporate different combinations of known virulence factors, or to explore putative new virulence factors, providing reasoned expectations prior to costly and time-consuming animal experiments. As population-level dynamics are shaped by within-host interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b042">42</xref>], models such as ours can increase our understanding of the population-level effects of specific molecular evolution. Infections by two different strains or species can result in a similar outcome (e.g., persistent disease) in terms of bacterial clearance, but have different pathological effects. These species-specific aspects can be readily studied in our model by systematically comparing the simulated dynamics of the immune system in the two species. Comparison between models of different strains and species will allow us to recognize crucial virulence mechanisms and can give us insight into the evolution of new virulence mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Medical Implications</title><p>The present study led us to the identification of the three phases in <italic>Bordetella</italic> infections. Putative medical treatments can thus be evaluated in silico by simulating them through adding/removing or activating/inhibiting certain nodes and studying their effect on these three phases. Qualitative conditions (e.g., for cytokine regulation) provided by such models can be used in the future to detect the phase of infection in patients, and ultimately to predict recovery and design medication. Some of the manipulations of the model (e.g., the deletion of FHA/ACT) result in early clearance of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> in the simulation. Our study of minimal components necessary for early clearance of a secondary infection suggests that Th1RCs along with antibodies can be used as a prophylactic measure. We believe that these and other such observations will be useful for the control of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> and could be applied to other diseases.</p><p>This study addresses the goals of systems biology by effectively encapsulating prior knowledge to generate a mechanistic and predictive understanding at the systems level. Understanding at the network level is necessary for formulating detailed quantitative models of within-host disease dynamics. Our methodology can be extended to other respiratory pathogens, and ultimately to pathogens in general. The outputs of within-host models serve as inputs to broader-scale epidemiological models; for example, the effect of host immune components (intrinsic factors) was shown to be important in cholera epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b055">55</xref>].

Thus, the transfer function for TTSS is TTSS<italic><sup>*</sup></italic> = Bacteria AND NOT <inline-formula id="pcbi-0030109-ex007"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030109.ex007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
					; similar transfer function applies to FHA/ACT. Thus, the condition for an above-threshold concentration of TTSS or FHA/ACT nodes (state 1) is the presence of their activators at the previous time point, combined with the absence (subthreshold concentration) of TTSS or FHA/ACT τ<italic><sub>TTSS</sub></italic> or τ<italic><sub>FHA/ACT</sub></italic> time points ago, respectively. Note that it is possible that other virulence factors such as PTX also exhibit uncatalyzed decay/inactivation, but this decay rate is probably smaller than their removal rate by active immune mechanisms. The crucial difference between the effect of secreted factors PTX, on one hand, and ACT and TTSS, on the other hand, is that PTX does not modulate chemokine and cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b023">23</xref>]. Hence, PTX is less likely to have long-lasting effects after its neutralization, unlike ACT and TTSS. Our description of the latter nodes allows us to capture such longer-lasting effects of the nodes by using a decay time longer than one time step.
				</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Cytokine regulation.</title><p>The decision between generating Th1 cells or Th2 cells is determined by a group of cytokines produced during the interaction of antigen-presenting cells and T cells. How the balance between Th1 cells and Th2 cells maintained in the presence of double-negative feedback between Th1-related cytokines and Th2-related cytokines is still unknown. Our modeling of the double-negative feedback between Th1RCs and Th2RCs led to different dynamic outcomes in asynchronous and synchronous algorithms. Asynchronous algorithms gave advantage to the process that is activated earlier (an example of bistability), whereas in the synchronous algorithm synchronous oscillations of Th1RCs and Th2RCs were observed (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030109-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-se001">Text S1</xref> for the Boolean transfer functions of these nodes and to Dynamic simulation for the algorithm). To remove the dependence on the order of update of the asynchronous method in the consensus <italic>Bordetellae</italic> model (without specific virulence factors), we assumed that Th1RCs/Th2RCs decay after a period τ<italic><sub>Th1RC</sub></italic>/τ<italic><sub>Th2RC</sub></italic>. We found that the value of these decay times is dependent on bacterial virulence factors (refer to Parameter analysis and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030109-se002">Text S2</xref> for details). We chose the decay times such that (1) in the species-specific models incorporating TTSS/FHA (in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content>) and FHA/ACT activity (in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content>), a reproducible switch (i.e., activation of Th2RCs followed by Th1RC activation) is observed; and (2) in the consensus model (absent specific virulence factors), there is more than one such switching. Alternative activation of Th1RCs and Th2RCs is found in many disregulations, for example in allergies and allografts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b060">60</xref>], when the balance between Th1RCs and Th2RCs is not directly modulated, and is also predicted by other models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030109-b061">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Parameter analysis.</title><p>In this section we analyze the realistic range of the threshold parameter <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> and the decay constants τ<italic><sub>TTSS</sub></italic>/τ<italic><sub>FHA/ACT</sub></italic>.

Experiments performed at shorter time intervals around the expected clearance time than the customary sampling at days 28, 50, and 70 will be necessary to better elucidate this parameter.

Clearance was delayed by one time step with each unit increment. When τ<italic><sub>TTSS</sub></italic> &gt; 15 or τ<italic><sub>FHA/ACT</sub></italic> &gt; 18, bacteria were not cleared.

Hence, we used τ<italic><sub>FHA/ACT</sub></italic> = 12 and τ<italic><sub>TTSS</sub></italic> = 15<italic>.</italic> The result that the composite action of the nodes FHA/ACT and TTSS decreases below threshold levels after 12 and 15 time steps, or after nine to 12 time steps of active antibody response, suggests that these nodes have a longer effect than other independently acting virulence factors such as PTX and O-antigen. A possible mechanism in support of this suggestion is damage to cellular systems; for example, TTSS permeabilizes cell membranes, which require a longer time to heal even after the toxin can be neutralized by antibodies.
