<p>G-quadruplex DNA is a four-stranded DNA structure formed by non-Watson-Crick base pairing between stacked sets of four guanines. Many possible functions have been proposed for this structure, but its <italic>in vivo</italic> role in the cell is still largely unresolved. We carried out a genome-wide survey of the evolutionary conservation of regions with the potential to form G-quadruplex DNA structures (G4 DNA motifs) across seven yeast species. We found that G4 DNA motifs were significantly more conserved than expected by chance, and the nucleotide-level conservation patterns suggested that the motif conservation was the result of the formation of G4 DNA structures. We characterized the association of conserved and non-conserved G4 DNA motifs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> with more than 40 known genome features and gene classes. Our comprehensive, integrated evolutionary and functional analysis confirmed the previously observed associations of G4 DNA motifs with promoter regions and the rDNA, and it identified several previously unrecognized associations of G4 DNA motifs with genomic features, such as mitotic and meiotic double-strand break sites (DSBs). Conserved G4 DNA motifs maintained strong associations with promoters and the rDNA, but not with DSBs. We also performed the first analysis of G4 DNA motifs in the mitochondria, and surprisingly found a tenfold higher concentration of the motifs in the AT-rich yeast mitochondrial DNA than in nuclear DNA. The evolutionary conservation of the G4 DNA motif and its association with specific genome features supports the hypothesis that G4 DNA has <italic>in vivo</italic> functions that are under evolutionary constraint.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>DNA can form structures other than the traditional double helix. The G-quadruplex, a stable four-stranded structure formed by guanine-rich DNA, is one such alternative structure. Sequence motifs with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4 DNA motifs) are found in the genomes of many species. However, since such motifs can occur by chance, it is not known which sequence regions form G-quadruplexes <italic>in vivo</italic>, and if formed, how they function. Evolutionary conservation of a sequence across species provides evidence of a biologically important function. We found that G4 DNA motifs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are more conserved than expected among related fungi, and the patterns of this conservation suggest that many of the motifs form functional G-quadruplexes. We explored potential functions of the G-quadruplex by identifying significant associations of motifs with annotated genome features. Our analysis corroborated and refined previous hypotheses about the importance of G-quadruplexes in telomeres and gene promoters, and suggested intriguing additional roles in double strand break processing and the mitochondria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA primarily exists as a double helix. However, DNA can also adopt other structural conformations that have the potential to play critical roles in a range of biological processes. One such structure is G-quadruplex DNA (G4 DNA structure), which was discovered in the late 1980s when biochemical experiments demonstrated that oligodeoxynucleotides that contain four separated runs of two, three, or four guanines (G-tracts) can spontaneously form four-stranded structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Sen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Sundquist1">[2]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). G4 DNA structures consist of stacked planar G-quartets that are held together by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding between four guanines from each of the G-tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The guanines can come from a single nucleic acid strand (intra-molecular) or multiple strands (inter-molecular), and the strands may be oriented in a parallel or anti-parallel orientation. G4 DNA structures are compact, highly stable under physiological pH and salt conditions, resistant to degradation by nucleases, and can have melting temperatures even higher than that of duplex DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Burge1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Stegle1">[4]</xref>. G4 DNA structures can be formed from runs of two guanines, but they are less stable than those with longer runs.</p>

<p>The G4 DNA structure is of considerable interest because of its potential to influence a variety of biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Burge1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Maizels1">[5]</xref>. For example, telomeric DNA in most eukaryotic organisms consists of G-rich repeated sequence ending with a 3′ single stranded G-rich overhang that can form G-quadruplexes <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Sen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Sundquist1">[2]</xref>. The first direct evidence for the presence of G4 DNA structures <italic>in vivo</italic> came from studies using G4 DNA-specific antibodies to detect intermolecular structures at ciliate telomeres where their formation and dissolution are cell cycle regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Paeschke1">[6]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Schaffitzel1">[8]</xref>. However, as described in detail in this paper, telomeric DNAs are not the only chromosomal sequences with the ability to form G4 DNA structures.</p>
<p>Because experimental characterization of the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of G4 DNA structures has proved difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Lipps1">[9]</xref>, especially at non-telomeric loci, genome-wide computational analyses have played an increasing role in the identification of regions that have the potential to form G4 DNA structures (G4 DNA motifs). The distribution of G4 DNA motifs has been investigated in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref>, human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Huppert1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Todd1">[12]</xref>, and a number of prokaryotic genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Rawal1">[13]</xref> in the hope that the patterns of occurrence will provide insight into the functional roles of these structures. In each case, a computational search for variations of the G4 DNA motif, usually four tracts of three or more guanines separated by loop regions of any nucleotide, was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Across a wide range of species, G4 DNA motifs were found in telomeres, G-rich micro- and mini-satellites, near promoters, and within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Eddy1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Nakken1">[16]</xref>. In the human genome, genes that are near G4 DNA motifs fall into specific functional classes; for example, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have particularly high or low G4 DNA forming potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Cogoi1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Verma1">[19]</xref>. Recently, human G4 DNA motifs were reported be associated with recombination prone regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Mani1">[20]</xref> and to show mutational patterns that preserved the potential to form G4 DNA structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Nakken1">[16]</xref>. Computational analysis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> identified several hundred G4 DNA motifs, and found them to be significantly associated with promoter regions and to a lesser extent with open reading frames (ORFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref>. Thus, studies in a wide range of organisms have led to the proposal that G4 DNA structures affect multiple cellular processes beyond their roles at telomeres. However, direct support for formation and function of G4 DNA structures <italic>in vivo</italic> is still largely unavailable.</p>
<p>In this study, we integrated genome sequence data, experimental analysis, and computational exploration of genome annotations to investigate the conservation and function of G4 DNA structures in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Evolutionary conservation across related species has played a vital role in defining functional elements such as genes and regulatory sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Cliften1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Kellis1">[22]</xref>. We identified sequence motifs with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and six other fungal species and assessed the evolutionary sequence conservation of the motifs across these seven species. We found that G4 DNA motifs and the nucleotides comprising them were more evolutionarily conserved than expected by chance; however, they were not as strongly conserved as genes and many known regulatory sites. Additionally, the patterns of nucleotide conservation within the motifs indicated that the evolutionary constraint was likely the result of pressure to maintain the ability of these motifs to form G4 DNA structures. This analysis provides strong evidence that many computationally identified G4 DNA motifs form functional G4 DNA structures <italic>in vivo</italic>. To characterize possible functions for the structures, we evaluated the association of conserved and non-conserved G4 DNA motifs with a range of genomic features. These tests corroborated previous observations of the significant associations of G4 DNA motifs with gene promoters and rDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref>, and suggested several new potential biological functions, such as roles in double strand break repair and in the mitochondrial genome.</p>

<title>Preliminaries</title>
<p>The genome-wide occurrence of sequence motifs with the potential to form G-quadruplex DNA in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was identified previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref>, but the presence of a predicted motif in a DNA sequence does not imply that it forms a G4 DNA structure <italic>in vivo</italic>. Sequences with the potential to form G4 DNA structures occur frequently by chance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Huppert1">[11]</xref>. The conservation of a motif across related species provides evidence that the motif is under evolutionary constraint and suggests that it serves some function.</p>
<p>To characterize the conservation of G4 DNA motifs in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Cherry1">[23]</xref> across closely related species, we defined a set of candidate DNA regions using an algorithm similar to those used previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Eddy1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Huppert3">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Yadav1">[25]</xref>. We sought DNA regions with at least four tracts of three or more consecutive guanines (G-tracts) separated by loop regions of limited length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). We considered loop length thresholds in the range of 5 to 50 nucleotides (nt). Unless otherwise stated, all results are based on the set of motifs with loops of 25 nt or less. (The genome locations of these G4 DNA motifs are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000861.s001">Dataset S1</xref>.) This threshold was selected to include the longest previously reported loop in a G4 DNA structure (22 nt) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Bourdoncle1">[26]</xref>. Regions containing more than four G-tracts separated by less than a given loop length threshold were counted as a single motif. (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for a comparison of our motif definition with previous approaches.) In this paper, “G4 DNA motif” refers to DNA sites that match this sequence pattern, and “G4 DNA structure” refers to the G-quadruplex DNA secondary structure potentially formed by sequences containing the G4 DNA motif.</p>
<p>We analyzed the sequence conservation of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> G4 DNA motifs across the genomes of seven <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

The overall number of G4 DNA motifs found in each of these species was within a factor of two of the number found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000861-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Due to lack of available sequence data and the difficulty of aligning repeat-rich regions from telomeric and mitochondrial DNAs, G4 DNA motifs in these regions were not included in the conservation analysis. In addition, we only considered motifs found in one complete copy of the rDNA repeat.

<p>The number of non-telomeric, nuclear G4 DNA motifs found in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome increased with the maximum length allowed for the loop regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). For example, there were 54 motifs with all loops less than or equal to 10 nt, and 552 G4 DNA motifs with loops less than or equal to 25 nt. This increasing pattern is similar to that observed in a previous analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref> that placed an explicit limit on motif length and did not constrain the loops.</p>

<p>We evaluated the conservation of the G4 DNA motifs on both the motif-level and nucleotide level.

The number of motifs conserved across all <italic>sensu stricto</italic> yeasts also increased with the maximum allowed loop length, but compared to shorter G4 DNA motifs, a smaller fraction of the long motifs exhibited this deep conservation. At the 25 nt loop length threshold, 64% (324 of 507) of the alignable G4 DNA motifs were conserved in at least one other species, and 7% (34 of 507) were conserved across all of the <italic>sensu stricto</italic> species. The latter group will be referred to as the “conserved” G4 DNA motifs. (The genome locations of all conserved G4 DNA motifs are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000861.s002">Dataset S2</xref>.)</p>
<p>The number of G4 DNA motifs conserved between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and each of the six other related fungi is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>. As expected, the number of conserved motifs roughly followed the evolutionary distances between the species: each of the <italic>sensu stricto</italic> species had considerably more conserved motifs than the two more distantly related species (<italic>S. castellii</italic>, <italic>S. kluyveri</italic>).</p>
<p>Significantly more G4 DNA motifs were conserved than expected between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and five of the six related species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> for p-values). For example, 206 motifs were conserved between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>. The expected number of motifs conserved between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and a genome with the sequence content and evolutionary distance of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> is 174. The expected number of conserved motifs was estimated by generating 10,000 random genomes and their corresponding alignments to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> using an evolutionary model that maintained the substitution probabilities and evolutionary distance between each species pair, but had no explicit pressure to maintain the motifs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Only three out of the 10,000 random genomes yielded as many conserved motifs as were observed. However, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> G4 DNA motifs were not more conserved than expected with <italic>S. kluyveri</italic>, the most distant and most GC-rich species considered. The greater GC content of this species made it more likely that a G4 DNA motif would be conserved by chance than in species with a GC content similar to that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<title>Nucleotide conservation patterns in G4 DNA motifs indicate pressure to maintain the G4 DNA structure</title>
<p>The above results suggest that G4 DNA motifs are more conserved across species than expected. However, these findings do not explicitly tie this conservation to the formation of the G4 DNA structure. It is possible that the motifs are conserved due to associations with other genomic features that are responsible for the observed evolutionary conservation. These possibilities can be distinguished by considering G4 DNA motif conservation at the nucleotide level.</p>
<p>In the nucleotide level analysis, each individual nucleotide position in the sequence alignments was assigned a value that quantified its evolutionary conservation. We compared the evolutionary conservation of different sets of nucleotides from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> G4 DNA motifs and the surrounding sequence regions. The nucleotide conservation scores were taken from the phastCons program, which assigns each alignment column a value between zero and one that represents the posterior probability that the position is conserved according to a phylogenetic Hidden Markov Model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Siepel1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Siepel2">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>The nucleotides of 308 of the 507 alignable G4 DNA motifs (61%) were more conserved than the 100 nucleotides on either side of the motif. This conservation was significantly greater than that expected by chance (p = 7.394×10<sup>−7</sup>, binomial test). In a similar test that pooled nucleotides across G4 DNA motifs, we found that the average conservation of all the nucleotides over all of the motifs was significantly higher than the average conservation of all positions in neighboring regions within 100 nt on either side (p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup> for difference, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000861-t002">Table 2</xref>). This p-value was so low because there were thousands of nucleotides representing the two groups being compared. In both of these tests, nucleotides in G4 DNA motifs were significantly more conserved than neighboring nucleotides. In addition, the motif nucleotides were also significantly more conserved (p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test) than the average conservation of all nucleotides in the alignments.</p>

The first comparison demonstrates that nucleotides in G4 DNA motifs are significantly more conserved (bold) than those in the surrounding sequence positions (<italic>p</italic>&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>). The second comparison demonstrates that within G-tracts of G4 DNA motifs, disruptive positions are significantly more conserved than non-disruptive positions (<italic>p</italic> = 2.365×10<sup>−9</sup>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
<p>Analyzing nucleotide conservation patterns also allowed us to demonstrate that the conservation of the motifs is likely due to evolutionary pressure to maintain the ability to form G4 DNA structures. The G4 DNA motif consists of four tracts of at least three guanines separated by short loop regions that can contain any nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). If a motif forms a functional G4 DNA structure, we would expect mutations that disrupt G-tracts to be more rare than those that maintain G-tracts, since the disruption of a G-tract prevents the formation of the G4 DNA structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Nakken1">[16]</xref>. Thus, we compared the conservation of disruptive and non-disruptive nucleotide positions within G-tracts. In the motif, a minimum of three guanines in a G-tract is required for stable G4 DNA structure formation, but many G-tracts have more than three guanines. For example, in a G-tract of four G's (GGGG), a mutation of the first or last guanine (non-disruptive positions) would not break the G4 DNA motif pattern while a mutation in either of the two middle positions (disruptive positions) would prevent formation. We compared these two types of G-tract nucleotides in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and found that disruptive positions were significantly more conserved than non-disruptive positions (0.670 v. 0.631, p = 2.365×10<sup>−9</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000861-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The motif-level conserved G4 DNA motifs exhibited similar nucleotide conservation patterns. The average conservation of conserved motif nucleotides was significantly greater than that of the surrounding nucleotides (0.722 v. 0.652, p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>). The disruptive positions showed an even greater difference in nucleotide conservation with the non-disruptive positions (0.778 v. 0.641, p = 1.987×10<sup>−6</sup>).</p>

<title>The distribution of conserved and non-conserved G4 DNA motifs in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome</title>
<p>Disregarding the G-rich telomeres, the distribution of G4 DNA motifs across the 16 yeast nuclear chromosomes was relatively constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Chromosome XVI had the lowest density of G4 DNA motifs with 0.034 G4 sites per kb of sequence, while chromosome VI had the highest at 0.067 per kb. G4 DNA motifs were found across the entire length of most chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The longest stretch of the genome without a G4 DNA motif was a 180 kb ORF-rich region on the right arm of chromosome IV (1062535–1242537). A region on the right arm of chromosome VI had the highest density of G4 DNA with seven G4 DNA motifs within ∼16 kb (182580–199009). This region contains a variety of functional elements, including an autonomously replicated sequence (ARS), tRNA genes, several ORFs, and a Ty1 retrotransposon.</p>

<p>The G4 DNA motifs conserved in all of the <italic>sensu stricto</italic> species were also distributed across the genome. At least one was found on each chromosome, except for chromosome V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). These motifs occurred in a range of genomic contexts; 11 out of 34 were found in ORFs. This is significantly fewer than expected by chance (q&lt;0.0001). Four motifs were conserved across all seven species. Two of these were in the coding regions for the mature ribosomal DNA, and two were within the ORFs of conserved genes (MEP3, an ammonium transporter; PBP1, a protein involved in response to glucose deprivation). Since each of these conserved G4 DNA motifs was in a region likely constrained for other functional reasons, we cannot attribute their conservation to their ability to form G4 DNA structures.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>The length and physical properties of conserved and non-conserved G4 DNA motifs</title>
<p>Conserved G4 DNA motifs were on average longer and had more G-tracts than non-conserved motifs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000861-t003">Table 3</xref>). Non-telomeric, non-mitochondrial G4 DNA motifs ranged in length from 17 to 162 nt with an average of 54.3±16.8 nt (± standard deviation), while the average conserved motif was 63.3±28.3 nt (p = 0.137, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). When interpreting these statistics, it is important to note that regions with more than four G-tracts in close proximity were counted as a single G4 motif. These sites have the potential to form several different G4 DNA structures; this was found in 50% (17/34) of the conserved motifs but in only 22% (120/552) of all G4 DNA motifs (p = 1.58×10<sup>−4</sup>, Fisher's exact test). Reflecting this pattern, conserved G4 DNA motifs had an average of 5.1±1.9 G-tracts, while all motifs had only 4.3±0.8 (p = 1.47×10<sup>−5</sup>). The G-tracts within conserved G4 DNA motifs were also longer (3.7±1.4 nt) than average (3.3±0.8 nt) (p = 3.65×10<sup>−10</sup>). In contrast, the average loop length was shorter among the conserved motifs (10.8±6.9 nt) than in all motifs (12.2±7.2 nt) (p = 0.0169). G4 DNA structures can vary in the number of stacked G-quartets they contain. This number is determined by the number of consecutive guanines found over the G-tracts of the G4 DNA motif. As expected based on the greater average G-tract length in conserved G4 motifs, the average number of stacked G-quartets is greater for conserved motifs (3.3±0.4) than overall (3.0±0.2) (p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>). However, the vast majority of G4 DNA motifs (both conserved and non-conserved) only have the potential to form structures with three stacked G-quartets. Finally, as noted above, disruptive positions in conserved G4 motifs showed a greater difference in nucleotide conservation as compared to non-disruptive positions than did non-conserved G4 motifs.</p>

<title>Associations between G4 DNA motifs and genome features</title>
<p>To investigate potential functional roles of G4 DNA motifs, we computed the association between the motifs (both conserved and non-conserved) and an extensive set of functional genomic features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000861-t004">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000861.s003">Datasets S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000861.s004">S4</xref>). An earlier analysis of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome computed the enrichment of G4 DNA motifs in yeast promoters and ORFs by generating random sets of promoters and ORFs based on a position-specific transition matrix and found that both classes of sequences were enriched in G4 DNA motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref>. Here we greatly extend this earlier analysis by quantifying the association of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> G4 DNA motifs with more than 40 genome features and gene classes that includes those curated by the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (SGD), along with many other experimentally determined genome features that have not yet been annotated in the SGD. (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for the full list.) We developed a new genome-wide method to assess the significance of the association (and lack of association) between G4 DNA motifs and genome features that takes into account their lengths and chromosomal distributions (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). To account for the testing of multiple association hypotheses, we control the false discovery rate (FDR) and report a q-value for each test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Benjamini1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Storey1">[30]</xref>. In this context, q-values are analogous to p-values and can be interpreted as the minimum false positive rate at which an association can be called significant.

(Both of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> H2A genes are the equivalent of the H2AX variant in more complex cells; in yeast, H2A is phosphorylated but not replaced in response to DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Downs1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Foster1">[34]</xref>). The positions of these sites in cells that have not been exposed to DNA damaging agents mark regions of the genome that are particularly susceptible to breakage, which likely occurs mainly as a result of impaired DNA replication. The occurrence of G4 DNA motifs was significantly associated with genome wide sites of high γ-H2AX binding (q&lt;0.001). This finding was originally based on genome wide γ-H2AX binding sites identified using a high-density whole genome array (M. Grunstein, personal communication); however, it also held for sites of high γ-H2AX binding determined using a genome wide ChIP on Chip array (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The reported q-values are based on our ChIP-chip analysis.</p>
<p>DNA double strand breaks occur much more often in meiotic than in mitotic cells, where they are initated via the action of the Spo11 nuclease and lead to meiotic recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Keeney1">[35]</xref>. Using a genome-wide map of preferred meiotic DSB sites, determined by identifying single-stranded DNA formed at meiotic DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Buhler1">[36]</xref>, we found a significant association between G4 DNA motifs and these experimentally determined meiotic DSB sites (q&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>The 34 G4 DNA motifs conserved across the <italic>sensu stricto</italic> species maintained the significant associations with TF binding sites (q&lt;0.001), double promoters (q&lt;0.001), and the rDNA (q&lt;0.001). However, for these conserved motifs, the associations with DSBs (q = 1.0), γ-H2AX binding sites (q = 0.335), and dubious ORFs (q = 0.162) were not significant. Though these associations did not pass the significance threshold, each of these features was among the strongest associations for conserved motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000861.s004">Dataset S4</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, we identified genome features that were significantly under-associated with G4 DNA motifs; that is, they overlapped with G4 DNA motifs significantly less than expected by chance. For all nuclear, non-telomeric G4 DNA motifs, the only significant under-associations were with essential ORFs (q = 0.032) and the first 100 nucleotides upstream of ORFs (q&lt;0.001). The conserved G4 DNA motifs are associated with both ORFs and coding sequences significantly less than expected (q&lt;0.001 for both). This is particularly notable given the high conservation of these regions.</p>
<p>As described above, we observed significant associations between G4 DNA motifs and promoter regions and TF binding sites. G-rich regulatory motifs have been shown to be largely responsible for the enrichment of G4 DNA motifs in regions upstream of transcription start sites in human genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Eddy1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Huppert2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Todd2">[31]</xref>. We explored the effect of known TF binding sites in yeast on the significant association between G4 DNA motifs and promoter regions by examining the overlaps of G4 DNA motifs and the 3328 known TF binding sites as defined in SGD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Harbison1">[32]</xref>. G4 DNA motifs and TF binding sites were significantly associated (q&lt;0.001). Moreover, the significant association of G4 DNA motifs and promoter regions held when the motifs that directly overlap TF binding sites were not considered (q = 0.001). Thus, this association is likely not due solely to the presence of G-rich TF recognition sites in yeast promoters.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial G4 DNA motifs</title>
<p>A previous analysis of the G4 DNA motifs in the yeast genome did not consider the mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref>. We found that mtDNA had an order of magnitude more G4 DNA motifs per kb (0.373) than any of the nuclear chromosomes (0.034–0.067). This high density is surprising because the yeast mtDNA is far more AT-rich than the nuclear genome (83% AT in mtDNA compared to 62% AT genome-wide). The distribution of the G4 DNA motifs across the mtDNA was biased towards regions that do not encode ORFs, rRNA, or tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Only two of the 32 mitochondrial G4 DNA motifs overlapped an ORF, and none of the motifs overlapped tRNA or rRNA genes (q&lt;0.001 for this amount of overlap with mitochondrial features). Due to the lack of sequence information for the mtDNA in other fungi, we were not able to analyze the evolutionary conservation of the mitochondrial G4 DNA motifs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The complementary computational and experimental analyses presented here address the evolutionary conservation and potential function of G4 DNA motifs throughout the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome. We identified G4 DNA motifs across seven yeast species and found that the motifs are significantly more conserved than expected and are associated with specific functional features of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Evolutionary conservation of G4 DNA motifs</title>
<p>The evolutionary conservation of a G4 DNA motif provides insight into the probability of its formation and function <italic>in vivo</italic>. We determined the conservation in location and sequence of G4 DNA motifs in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome among six other fungal species. A significant number of G4 DNA motifs were conserved in location between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and all but the most distantly related fungal genome considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Of the over 500 non-telomeric, nuclear G4 DNA motifs, 64% were conserved in at least one other fungal genome, and 34 motifs (7%) were conserved across the <italic>sensu stricto</italic> species.</p>
<p>Positional conservation of G4 DNA motifs does not necessarily imply that the ability to form G4 DNA structures is responsible for the evolutionary constraint. However, the nucleotides in the motif sequences were more conserved than surrounding positions and nucleotides within motifs whose mutation would likely disrupt the ability to form G4 DNA structures were significantly more conserved than other motif nucleotides. This pattern suggests that the observed evolutionary conservation is related to the motif itself rather than to some overlapping feature, and provides substantial evidence for evolutionary pressure to maintain the formation of G4 DNA structures.</p>
<p>Examining the conservation of G4 DNA motifs across six species at a range of evolutionary distances from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) allowed us to compare the degree of conservation of G4 DNA motifs relative to other genomic features. When analyzing the conservation of ORFs and potential regulatory sequences, considering distant species is often necessary to highlight functionally relevant conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Cliften1">[21]</xref>. G4 DNA motifs are less conserved than ORFs and appear to have qualitatively similar levels of conservation with transcription factor binding sites. It was previously shown that 13% of the representative <italic>S. cerervisiae</italic> Gal4 transcription factor binding sites were conserved across the <italic>sensu stricto</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Kellis1">[22]</xref>. In contrast, 7% of G4 DNA motifs were conserved across this evolutionary distance, and very few were conserved beyond the <italic>sensu stricto</italic> species. Lack of conservation does not necessarily imply lack of function; G4 DNA motifs that are not evolutionarily conserved could still form functionally important G4 DNA structures <italic>in vivo</italic>. The presence or absence of G4 DNA structures could generate species-specific differences in functions affected by the structure, such as transcription, replication, or recombination. It is also possible that our definition of conservation, which requires overlapping motifs in sequence alignments, missed patterns in which the specific location of the motif is not as important as its general location relative to other genomic features. For example, the presence of a G4 DNA motif anywhere upstream of an ORF could be more relevant than its specific position within the upstream region.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Potential functions for G4 DNA motifs suggested by our analysis</title>
<p>We investigated potential functions of G4 DNA motifs by searching for significant associations between the genomic location of the motifs and more than 40 genome features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000861-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Some of the associations we found, including those with promoters and rDNA, were maintained when we considered only evolutionarily conserved G4 DNA motifs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000861-t004">Table 4</xref>). The associations with other features such as DSB sites, recombination hotspots, and dubious ORFs, were not maintained across the <italic>sensu stricto</italic> species. It is possible that frequent changes in the locations of these features could explain their lack of conservation. For example, recombination hotspots may change rapidly between species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Winckler1">[39]</xref>, and dubious ORFs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> may actually be functional ORFs in other species. It is also possible that we could not detect these associations because of the small number of conserved motifs and large number of hypotheses tested. Overall, our findings corroborated the previously identified G4 DNA motif enrichment in promoter regions and the rDNA repeat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref>. The known enrichment of G4 motifs in ORFs was refined to show that it may be driven by regions, such as dubious ORFs, that are not confirmed as protein coding. Furthermore, we discovered a number of new associations, such as the significant association of G4 DNA motifs with TF binding sites and non-essential genes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unexpected and novel finding of our analysis was the strong association of G4 DNA motifs with sites of frequent DSBs in both unperturbed mitotic and meiotic cells. As there is a significant overlap of preferred DSB sites in mitosis and meiosis (q&lt;0.001), it is possible that G4 structures have a common function in both cell types. The presence of G4 DNA structures at preferred DSB sites suggests two non-exclusive possible functions. First, the formation of G4 DNA structures during DNA replication could increase the probability of DSBs. The formation of these structures during replication when DNA is transiently single stranded could slow or even stall fork progression, leading to DSBs. From yeast to humans, telomeric DNA impedes fork progression during standard semi-conservative DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Ivessa1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Sfeir1">[42]</xref>. In mammals, this effect is suggested to be due to formation of G4 DNA structures. In addition, mutations in FANCJ, a DNA helicase that unwinds G4 structures <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Kruisselbrink1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Wu1">[45]</xref>, and whose mutation is implicated in a number of human diseases, results in chromosomal deletions in regions with G4 DNA motifs (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hiom1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Wu2">[47]</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, G4 DNA motifs may be associated with DSBs because they have a role in DSB processing. One of the initial steps in DSB repair is processing of the break to generate 3′ single-stranded tails. Formation of a G4 DNA structure in these tails could recruit the DNA damage machinery and influence downstream events. Indeed, several <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> repair and recombination proteins have activities that affect G4 DNA structures. The Mre11 nuclease, which is one of the first proteins recruited to DSBs, binds and cleaves G4 DNA structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Ghosal1">[48]</xref>. The Sgs1 DNA helicase, which has important roles in repair and recombination, unwinds G4 DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Huber1">[49]</xref>, and Hop1, a protein that is critical for the synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, binds and promotes the formation of G4 DNA structures <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Anuradha1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Muniyappa1">[51]</xref>. Meiotic DSBs are created by the topoisomerase-like protein Spo11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Keeney1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Diaz1">[52]</xref>, but no DNA sequence preference for Spo11 action has been identified. If Spo11 acts at G4 DNA structures, this preference may have been missed by motif finding programs due to the varying size and sequence of loops in G4 DNA motifs.</p>
<p>Another important and unexpected finding from our analysis is the high density of G4 motifs in the AT-rich mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Due to the lack of mtDNA sequence data for most of the species used for our conservation analysis, we could not assess the evolutionary conservation of the mitochondrial G4 DNA motifs. The occurrence of these motifs with respect to annotated genome features was very different from what was observed for nuclear DNA, as only two out of the 32 motifs overlapped a feature (q&lt;0.001). mtDNA exhibits a high frequency of spontaneous mutation and recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Pon1">[53]</xref>. G4 DNA motifs in the mtDNA may influence recombination or repair within the mtDNA, because formation of the G4 DNA structure could lead to DSBs (as discussed above for nuclear DNA). In particular, the distribution of mitochondrial G4 DNA motifs suggests that they could help limit recombination in the mtDNA to non-genic regions.</p>
<p>Several helicases, including human BLM, WRN, and FANCJ, that function throughout the genome, can unwind G4 DNA structures. Mutation of the human versions of these helicases causes inherited diseases characterized by genome instability and increased cancer risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-London1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Huber1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Ribeyre1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Popuri1">[55]</xref>. It is intriguing that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pif1 helicase, which also unwinds G4 DNA structures <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Ribeyre1">[54]</xref>, affects the maintenance and replication of telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Schulz1">[56]</xref>, rDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Ivessa1">[40]</xref>, and mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Foury1">[57]</xref>—three DNA regions with particularly high densities of G4 DNA motifs. A role for the Pif1 helicase in promoting genome stability by acting at G4 DNA structures is supported by our recent finding that Pif1 is preferentially associated with both G4 DNA motifs and preferred sites of mitotic DSBs <italic>in vivo</italic> (KP, JAC, and VAZ, in preparation).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Yeast provides an ideal system in which to study predicted G4 DNA motifs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Now that potential sites of G4 DNA structures have been identified in yeast and mapped relative to genomic features, they can be mutated to determine their contribution to specific functions, such as transcription, replication fork movement, and DSB formation. The conserved <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> G4 DNA motifs identified here are especially attractive for experimental characterization. In addition, the computational techniques applied to locate and analyze these motifs are general, and could easily be used in comparative evolutionary analyses of G4 DNA motifs in other organisms, such as flies and human.</p>

<title>Identification and filtering of G4 DNA motifs</title>
<p>We performed a regular expression search on the DNA sequence of each <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromosome to find sequence patterns with the potential to form G4 DNA structures. All instances of four or more G-tracts separated from one another by short loop regions were identified. Loop length thesholds between 5 and 50 nt were considered, but unless otherwise stated the results in the paper are based on a 25 nt loop length limit. Sequence regions that contained more than four G-tracts separated by loops were combined into a single motif; these sequences have the potential to form one of several topologically distinct G4 DNA structures. Source code for the search program is available from the authors by request. The genomic location and sequence of all motifs is available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000861.s001">Dataset S1</xref>.</p>
<p>In previous studies, two different constraints have been placed on the G4 DNA motif pattern when searching for matching sequences. The most common approach has been to limit the length of the loop regions between G-tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Huppert1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Rawal1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Yadav1">[25]</xref>. Other authors have placed a limit on the overall length of the motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Hershman1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Eddy1">[14]</xref>. We choose to use the more commonly used loop length threshold approach, because only constraining motif length can result in relatively short motifs with one long loop and two very short loops. However, there is a large degree of overlap between the motifs defined by these two approaches, and our feature association tests produced very similar results on motif length limited sets (data not shown).</p>
<p>Telomeric DNA in most organisms, including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, consists of repetitive G-rich DNA sequence that is conducive to forming the G4 DNA structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Maizels1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Rhodes1">[63]</xref>. Our search identified 80 G4 DNA motifs in the ∼141 kb of subtelomeric and telomeric sequence identified in SGD. However, due to the difficulty of sequencing and processing telomeric regions, they are under-represented in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome sequence. As a result, the conservation of telomeric G4 DNA motifs is difficult to quantify. All analyses in this paper are limited to non-telomeric G4 DNA motifs. Similarly, the sequence of chromosome XII in the SGD datababase contains only two copies of the rDNA (ribosomal DNA) repeat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Johnston1">[64]</xref>, while cells contain ∼150 rDNA repeats. We consider only one rDNA repeat, and the G4 DNA motifs found therein, in our analysis. After these filtering steps, 552 of the 668 initial G4 DNA motifs remained.</p>
<p>Conservation analysis could be performed only if the sequence of interest could be aligned to a homologous region in another species. Therefore, we limited our analysis to the 507 of the 552 non-telomeric, non-mitochondrial <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> G4 DNA motifs found in genomic regions that were aligned to a corresponding DNA region in at least one of the six other species in the multiz alignments from the UCSC Genome Browser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Kent1">[65]</xref>. (The conservation of mitochondrial G4 DNA motifs could not be analyzed, because the sequences of the mitochondrial genomes are not available for many of the species considered here.)</p>

<title>Conservation of G4 DNA motifs across species at the motif level</title>
<p>The alignments obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser consist of blocks of sequence from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome sequence that can be aligned to one or more other yeast species. For each G4 DNA motif in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that is in such a region, we scanned the aligned sequence from the other species for the G4 DNA motif pattern. If a motif was found that overlapped the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> motif, then the motif was said to be conserved in the current species. The conserved motif was not required to be identical to the overlapping <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> motif.</p>
<p>Once the conservation of each G4 motif was determined, we computed whether or not the number of motifs conserved between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and each species was greater than would be expected by chance. We obtained an empirical p-value for the observed number of conserved motifs by “evolving” each aligned <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> sequence block according to a local nucleotide transition matrix that reflected the observed probabilities of nucleotide change between the pair of aligned sequences. We generated 10,000 such evolved sequences with the same length, substitution probabilities, and evolutionary distance, and scanned each for a G4 motif that overlaps the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> motif. These steps provided the background distribution from which we calculated an empirical p-value for the observed number of conserved G4 motifs between each pair of species. We performed the same test, using the global nucleotide transition matrix determined by considering all alignments between the two species, and the results were similar, but with smaller p-values.</p>

<p>For each nucleotide position in the alignments containing <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> G4 DNA motifs, we considered conservation scores calculated by the phastCons package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Siepel1">[27]</xref>. We compared the average conservation scores of positions within the G4 DNA motif to those in an immediate neighborhood of 100 bases on either side of the motif. We also compared the conservation of disruptive and non-disruptive positions within the G-tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Nakken1">[16]</xref>. The statistical significance of the difference between these sets of conservation values was computed using the Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney U) test as implemented in R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Team1">[66]</xref>.</p>

<title>G4 DNA motif associations with genomic regions</title>
<p>To investigate potential functional roles of the G4 DNA structure, we analyzed the association of G4 DNA motifs with other known genome features. Given a query set of genome regions (e.g., G4 DNA motifs) and a reference set (e.g., all promoter regions), the number of overlaps between the reference and query sets was determined. For most features we considered the strand on which it occurred when determining associations. However, this information was not available or relevant for all features. We also considered associations of the G4 DNA motifs with expanded forms of some genomic features, e.g., with a window of 500 nucleotides on either side of a short feature such as an Autonomously Replicating Sequence (ARS). If a window was used in determining a given association, it is reported in the text.</p>
<p>The number of overlaps between two sets of genome regions expected by chance depends on their length and distribution across the chromosomes. To evaluate the significance of the observed number of overlaps between two sets of genome regions, we generated 1,000 random region sets that matched the number and length distribution of the query set at the chromosome level. That is, if the query set consisted of three G4 DNA motifs on chromosome I, then each of the 1,000 random query region sets had three randomly placed regions on chromosome I of the corresponding lengths. For each set of randomly placed query regions, we calculated the number of overlaps with the reference region set. We then compared the number of observed overlaps to the random distribution of overlaps to obtain an empirical p-value for the association of the regions. The false discovery rate (FDR) control as implemented in the R q-value package was used to produce q-values that account for the multiple comparisons.</p>

<title>Genome wide γ-H2AX analysis</title>
<p>For the genome wide γ-H2AX analysis, DNA was chromatin immunoprecipitated using anti-H2A phosphoS129 (Abcam polyclonal Ab #ab15083). DNA was amplified and labeled according to the instructions described in the Agilent Yeast ChIP on chip analysis protocol v9.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chem.agilent.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.chem.agilent.com</ext-link>). Briefly, after PCR amplification of ChIP DNA, DNA was labeled and purified according to the manufactures handbook using Cy3- or Cy5-coupled dUTP using the BioPrime Array CGH Genomic Labeling Module (Invitrogen, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.invitrogen.com</ext-link>, Cat No 18095-011). For our genome wide association we used the microarrays from Agilent Technologies (Cat No G4486A).</p>
<p>Labeled DNA (2.5 µg of Cy3 labeled input DNA and Cy5 labeled ChIP DNA) together with 10× Agilent Blocking Agent and 2× Agilent Hybridization buffer, were prepared for hybridization. Arrays were hybridized at 65°C for 18 h at 20 rpm. After hybridization, the array slides were washed according to the Agilent SSPE Wash protocol and scanned with an Agilent Microarray Scanner. Data extraction, including dye normalization and spatial detrending, was done using the default settings of the Agilent Feature Extractor. The resulting log<sub>2</sub> ratio of Cy3 and Cy5 signal in each feature was used to determine the location of chromatin immunoprecipitaed DNA. Genome wide γ-H2AX analysis was repeated three times, and peaks were defined using a p-value threshold of 10<sup>−4</sup>. The γ-H2AX binding sites are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000861.s005">Dataset S5</xref>.</p>

<title>Formation and analysis of G quadruplex DNA structures</title>
<p>Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by IDT (USA). The concentrations of all oligodeoxynucleotides were estimated using extinction coefficients provided by the manufacturer. All sequences tested are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000861-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>. Formation of the G4 DNA structure was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000861-Bachrati1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>G4 DNA structure formation was confirmed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Before and after the formation of the G4 DNA structure, oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′ labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and γ<sup>32</sup>P-ATP, resolved by 12% non-denaturing PAGE, and visualized using phosphoimaging.</p>
<p>Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was recorded on a 62DS AVIV spectropolarimeter using a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette in a reaction volume of 900 µl. Scans were performed at 25°C over a wavelength range of 210–350 nm with a scanning speed of 500 nm/min, a response time of 1 s, 1 nm data pitch and 1 nm bandwidth.</p>
