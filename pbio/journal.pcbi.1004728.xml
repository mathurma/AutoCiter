<abstract>
<p>The rapidly expanding body of available genomic and protein structural data provides a rich resource for understanding protein dynamics with biomolecular simulation. While computational infrastructure has grown rapidly, simulations on an <italic>omics</italic> scale are not yet widespread, primarily because software infrastructure to enable simulations at this scale has not kept pace. It should now be possible to study protein dynamics across entire (super)families, exploiting both available structural biology data and conformational similarities across homologous proteins. Here, we present a new tool for enabling high-throughput simulation in the genomics era. <bold>Ensembler</bold> takes any set of sequences—from a single sequence to an entire superfamily—and shepherds them through various stages of modeling and refinement to produce simulation-ready structures. This includes comparative modeling to all relevant PDB structures (which may span multiple conformational states of interest), reconstruction of missing loops, addition of missing atoms, culling of nearly identical structures, assignment of appropriate protonation states, solvation in explicit solvent, and refinement and filtering with molecular simulation to ensure stable simulation. The output of this pipeline is an ensemble of structures ready for subsequent molecular simulations using computer clusters, supercomputers, or distributed computing projects like Folding@home. <bold>Ensembler</bold> thus automates much of the time-consuming process of preparing protein models suitable for simulation, while allowing scalability up to entire superfamilies. A particular advantage of this approach can be found in the construction of kinetic models of conformational dynamics—such as Markov state models (MSMs)—which benefit from a diverse array of initial configurations that span the accessible conformational states to aid sampling. We demonstrate the power of this approach by constructing models for all catalytic domains in the human tyrosine kinase family, using all available kinase catalytic domain structures from any organism as structural templates. <bold>Ensembler</bold> is free and open source software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2. It is compatible with Linux and OS X. The latest release can be installed via the <monospace>conda</monospace> package manager, and the latest source can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/choderalab/ensembler" xlink:type="simple">https://github.com/choderalab/ensembler</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Proteins are the workhorses of the human body, and are involved in essentially every biological process. Many diseases are caused by proteins malfunctioning. To understand how a protein functions, it is necessary to know its physical properties. The field of structural biology provides many techniques for determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein. The dynamics of a protein, i.e. the way it moves, are of equal importance, but are more difficult to uncover with traditional experimental techniques. Computer simulations are an effective alternative method for understanding protein dynamics, but require experimental structural information as a starting point. While recent advances in genomics and experimental techniques have provided a wealth of such structural data, the appropriate software for using this data effectively has been lacking. To tackle this problem, we have developed a software package called <bold>Ensembler</bold>, which allows a user to automatically select appropriate experimentally derived structures for a given protein or family of proteins, and to use them to prepare a series of simulations. The resultant simulation data can then used to investigate the dynamics of the protein(s) in question, and their involvement in disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent advances in genomics and structural biology have helped generate an enormous wealth of protein data at the level of amino-acid sequence and three-dimensional structure. However, proteins typically exist as an ensemble of thermally accessible conformational states, and static structures provide only a snapshot of their rich dynamical behavior. Many functional properties—such as the ability to bind small molecules or interact with signaling partners—require transitions between states, encompassing anything from reorganization of sidechains at binding interfaces to domain motions to large scale folding-unfolding events. Drug discovery could also benefit from a more extensive consideration of protein dynamics, whereby small molecules might be selected based on their predicted ability to bind and trap a protein target in an inactive state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have the capability, in principle, to describe the time evolution of a protein in atomistic detail, and have proven themselves to be a useful tool in the study of protein dynamics. A number of mature software packages and forcefields are now available, and much recent progress has been driven by advances in computing architecture. For example, many MD packages are now able to exploit GPUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref003">3</xref>], which provide greatly improved simulation efficiency per unit cost relative to CPUs, while distributed computing platforms such as Folding@home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref004">4</xref>], Copernicus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref006">6</xref>], and GPUGrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref007">7</xref>], allow scalability on an unprecedented level. In parallel, methods for building human-understandable models of protein dynamics from noisy simulation data, such as Markov state modeling (MSM) approaches, are now reaching maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref010">10</xref>]. MSM methods in particular have the advantage of being able to aggregate data from multiple independent MD trajectories, facilitating parallelization of production simulations and thus greatly alleviating overall computational cost. There also exist a number of mature software packages for comparative modeling of protein structures, in which a target protein sequence is modeled using one or more structures as templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>However, it remains difficult for researchers to exploit the full variety of available protein sequence data (in simulating groups of related proteins) and structural data (exploiting multiple structures for each protein and its homologs/orthologs) in simulation studies in molecular simulations, largely due to limitations in software architecture. For example, the preparation of a biomolecular simulation is typically performed manually, encompassing a series of fairly standard (yet time-consuming) steps such as the choice of protein sequence construct and starting structure(s), addition of missing residues and atoms, solvation with explicit water and counterions (and potentially buffer components and cosolvents), choice of simulation parameters (or parameterization schemes for components where parameters do not yet exist), system relaxation with energy minimization, and one or more short preparatory MD simulations to equilibrate the system and relax the simulation cell. Due to the laborious and manual nature of this process, simulation studies typically consider only one or a few proteins and starting configurations, though notable exceptions exist, such as the Dynameomics effort of Daggett and coworkers in which over 100 proteins have been simulated so far using a single initial configuration for each [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref015">15</xref>]. Worse still, studies (or collections of studies) that <italic>do</italic> consider multiple proteins often suffer from the lack of consistent best practices in this preparation process, making comparisons between related proteins unnecessarily difficult.</p>
<p>The ability to fully exploit the large quantity of available protein sequence and structural data in biomolecular simulation studies could open up many interesting avenues for research, enabling the study of entire protein families or superfamilies within a single organism or across multiple organisms. The similarity between members of a given protein family could be exploited to generate arrays of conformational models for related sequences, which could be used as starting configurations to aid sampling in MD simulations. The conformations captured in structures of related members has been shown to provide useful information about the conformations accessible to all members of the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref017">17</xref>], though energetic differences between individuals will modify the populations and dynamics of individual conformational states. This approach would be highly beneficial for many MD methods, such as MSM construction, which require global coverage of the conformational landscape to realize their full potential, and would also be particularly useful in cases where structural data is present for only a subset of the members of a protein family. It would also aid in studying protein families known to have multiple metastable conformations—such as kinases—for which the combined body of structural data for the family may cover a large range of these conformations, while the available structures for any individual member might encompass only one or two distinct conformations.</p>
<p>Here, we present the first steps toward bridging the gap between biomolecular simulation software and <italic>omics</italic>-scale sequence and structural data: a fully automated open source framework for building simulation-ready protein models in multiple conformational substates scalable from single sequences to entire superfamilies. <bold>Ensembler</bold> provides functions for selecting target sequences and homologous template structures, and (by interfacing with a number of external packages) performs pairwise alignments, comparative modeling of target-template pairs, and several stages of model refinement. As an example application, we have constructed models for the entire set of human tyrosine kinase (TK) catalytic domains, using all available structures of protein kinase domains (from any species) as templates. This results in a total of almost 400,000 models, and we demonstrate that these provide wide-ranging coverage of known functionally relevant conformations. By using these models as starting configurations for highly parallel MD simulations, we expect their structural diversity to greatly aid in sampling of conformational space. We further suggest that models with high target-template sequence identity are the most likely to represent native metastable states, while lower sequence identity models would aid in sampling of more distant regions of accessible phase space. It is also important to note that some models (especially low sequence identity models) may not represent natively accessible conformations. However, MSM methods benefit from the ability to remove outlier MD trajectories which start from non-natively accessible conformations, and which would thus be unconnected with the phase space sampled in other trajectories. These methods essentially identify the largest subset of Markov nodes which constitute an ergodic network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>We anticipate that <bold>Ensembler</bold> will prove to be useful in a number of other ways. For example, the generated models could represent valuable data sets even without subsequent production simulation, allowing exploration of the conformational diversity present within the available structural data for a given protein family. Furthermore, automation of simulation preparation provides an excellent opportunity to make concrete certain “best practices”, such as the choice of simulation parameters, approach to the treatment of protonation states, treatment of cofactors and structural ions, and pre-simulation refinement and equilibration procedures. While the current version of <bold>Ensembler</bold> only codifies some of these choices as default parameters, its modular nature allows additional stages to be easily added in the future.</p>

<title>Target selection and retrieval (A)</title>
<p>The first stage entails the selection of a set of <italic>target</italic> protein sequences—the sequences for which the user is interested in generating simulation-ready structural models. This may be a single sequence—such as a full-length protein or a construct representing a single domain—or a collection of sequences, such as a particular domain from an entire family of proteins. The output of this stage is a FASTA-formatted text file containing the desired target sequences with corresponding arbitrary identifiers.</p>
<p>The <monospace>ensembler</monospace> command-line tool allows targets to be selected from UniProt—a freely accessible resource for protein sequence and functional data (uniprot.org) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref020">20</xref>]—via a UniProt search query. To retrieve target sequences from UniProt, the subcommand <monospace>gather_targets</monospace> is used with the <monospace>--query</monospace> flag followed by a UniProt query string conforming to the same syntax as the search function available on the UniProt website. For example, <monospace>--query ‘mnemonic:SRC_HUMAN’</monospace> would select the full-length human Src sequence, while the query shown in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pcbi.1004728.box001">Box 1</xref> would select all human tyrosine protein kinases which have been reviewed by a human curator. In this way, the user may select a single protein, many proteins, or an entire superfamily from UniProt. The program outputs a FASTA file, setting the UniProt mnemonic (e.g. <monospace>SRC_HUMAN</monospace>) as the identifier for each target protein.</p>

<title>Box 1. Ensembler command-line functions used to select targets and templates</title>
<p>The commands retrieve target and template data by querying UniProt. The query string provided to the <monospace>gather_targets</monospace> command selects all human tyrosine protein kinases which have been reviewed by a curator, while the query string provided to the <monospace>gather_templates</monospace> command selects all reviewed protein kinases of any species. The <monospace>--uniprot_domain_regex</monospace> flag is used to select a subset of the domains belonging to the returned UniProt protein entries, by matching the domain annotations against a given regular expression. In this example, domains of type ‘Protein kinase’, ‘Protein kinase 1’, and ‘Protein kinase 2’ were selected, while excluding many other domain types such as ‘Protein kinase; truncated’, ‘Protein kinase; inactive’, ‘SH2’, ‘SH3’, etc. Target selection simply entails the selection of sequences corresponding to each matching UniProt domain. Template selection entails the selection of the sequences and structures of any PDB entries corresponding to the matching UniProt domains.</p>

<p>In many cases, it will be desirable to build models of an isolated protein domain, rather than the full-length protein. The <monospace>gather_targets</monospace> subcommand allows protein domains to be selected from UniProt data by passing a regular expression string to the <monospace>--uniprot_domain_regex</monospace> flag. For example, the above <monospace>--query</monospace> flag for selecting all human protein kinases returns UniProt entries with domain annotations including ‘Protein kinase’, ‘Protein kinase 1’, ‘Protein kinase 2’, ‘Protein kinase; truncated’, ‘Protein kinase; inactive’, ‘SH2’, ‘SH3’, etc. The regular expression shown in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pcbi.1004728.box001">Box 1</xref> selects only domains of the first three types. If the <monospace>--uniprot_domain_regex</monospace> flag is used, target identifiers are set with the form <monospace>[UniProt mnemonic]_D[domain index]</monospace>, where the latter part represents a 0-based index for the domain—necessary because a single target protein may contain multiple domains of interest (e.g. <monospace>JAK1_HUMAN_D0</monospace>, <monospace>JAK1_HUMAN_D1</monospace>).</p>
<p>Target sequences can also be defined manually (or from another program) by providing a FASTA-formatted text file containing the desired target sequences with corresponding arbitrary identifiers.</p>

<title>Template selection and retrieval (B)</title>
<p><bold>Ensembler</bold> uses comparative modeling to build models, and as such requires a set of structures to be used as templates. The second stage thus entails the selection of templates and storage of associated sequences, structures, and identifiers. These templates can be specified manually, or using the <monospace>ensembler gather_templates</monospace> subcommand to automatically select templates based on a search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or UniProt. A recommended approach is to select templates from UniProt which belong to the same protein family as the targets, establishing homology and some degree of sequence identity between targets and templates.</p>
<p>The <monospace>ensembler gather_templates</monospace> subcommand provides methods for selecting template structures from either UniProt or the PDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb" xlink:type="simple">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb</ext-link>), specified by the <monospace>--gather_from</monospace> flag. Both methods select templates at the level of PDB chains—a PDB structure containing multiple chains with identical sequence spans (e.g. for crystals with non-crystallographic symmetry giving rise to independent conformations of the protein within the asymmetric unit) would thus give rise to multiple template structures.</p>
<p>Selection of templates from the PDB simply requires passing a list of PDB IDs as a comma-separated string, e.g. <monospace>--query 2H8H,1Y57</monospace>. Specific PDB chain IDs can optionally also be selected via the <monospace>--chainids</monospace> flag. The program retrieves structures from the PDB server, as well as associated data from the SIFTS service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts" xlink:type="simple">www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref021">21</xref>], which provides residue-level mappings between PDB and UniProt entries. The SIFTS data is used to extract template sequences, retaining only residues which are resolved and match the equivalent residue in the UniProt sequence—non-wildtype residues are thus removed from the template structures. Furthermore, PDB chains with less than a given percentage of resolved residues (default: 70%) are filtered out. Sequences are stored in a FASTA file, with identifiers of the form <monospace>[UniProt mnemonic]_D[UniProt domain index]_[PDB ID]_[PDB chain ID]</monospace>, e.g. <monospace>SRC_HUMAN_D0_2H8H_A</monospace>. Matching residues then extracted from the original coordinate files and stored as PDB-format coordinate files.</p>
<p>Selection of templates from UniProt proceeds in a similar fashion as for target selection; the <monospace>--query</monospace> flag is used to select full-length proteins from UniProt, while the optional <monospace>--uniprot_domain_regex</monospace> flag allows selection of individual domains with a regular expression string (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pcbi.1004728.box001">Box 1</xref>). The returned UniProt data for each protein includes a list of associated PDB chains and their residue spans, and this information is used to select template structures, using the same method as for template selection from the PDB. Only structures solved by X-ray crystallography or NMR are selected, thus excluding computer-generated models available from the PDB. If the <monospace>--uniprot_domain_regex</monospace> flag is used, then templates are truncated at the start and end of the domain sequence.</p>
<p>Templates can also be defined manually. Manual specification of templates simply requires storing the sequences and arbitrary identifiers in a FASTA file, and the structures as PDB-format coordinate files with filenames matching the identifiers in the sequence file. The structure residues must also match those in the sequence file.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Template refinement (C)</title>
<p>Unresolved template residues can optionally be modeled into template structures with the <monospace>loopmodel</monospace> subcommand, which employs a kinematic closure algorithm provided via the <monospace>loopmodel</monospace> tool of the Rosetta software suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref023">23</xref>]. We expect that in certain cases, pre-building template loops with Rosetta <monospace>loopmodel</monospace> prior to the main modeling stage (with MODELLER) may result in improved model quality. Loop remodeling may fail for a small proportion of templates due to spatial constraints imposed by the original structure; the subsequent modeling step thus automatically uses the remodeled version of a template if available, but otherwise falls back to using the non-remodeled version. Furthermore, the Rosetta <monospace>loopmodel</monospace> program will not model missing residues at the termini of a structure—such residue spans are modeled in the subsequent stage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Alignment and comparative modeling (D)</title>
<p>In the modeling stage, structural models of the target sequence are generated from the template structures, with the goal of modeling the target in a variety of conformations that could be significantly populated under equilibrium conditions.</p>
<p>Modeling is performed using the automodel function of the MODELLER software package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref025">25</xref>] to rapidly generate a single model of the target sequence from each template structure. MODELLER uses simulated annealing cycles along with a minimal forcefield and spatial restraints—generally Gaussian interatomic probability densities extracted from the template structure with database-derived statistics determining the distribution width—to rapidly generate candidate structures of the target sequence from the provided template sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>While MODELLER’s automodel function can generate its own alignments automatically, a standalone function was preferable for reasons of programming convenience. As such, we implemented pairwise alignment functionality using the BioPython <monospace>pairwise2</monospace> module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref026">26</xref>]—which uses a dynamic programming algorithm—with the PAM 250 scoring matrix of Gonnet <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref027">27</xref>], though other choices of scoring matrices available within the module can be selected. The alignments are carried out with the <monospace>align</monospace> subcommand, prior to the modeling step which is carried out with the <monospace>build_models</monospace> subcommand. The <monospace>align</monospace> subcommand also writes a list of the sequence identities for each template to a text file, and this can be used to select models from a desired range of sequence identities. The <monospace>build_models</monospace> subcommand and all subsequent pipeline functions have a <monospace>--template_seqid_cutoff</monospace> flag which can be used to select only models with sequence identities greater than the given value. We also note that alternative approaches could be used for the alignment stage. For example, multiple sequence alignment algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref028">28</xref>], allow alignments to be guided using sequence data from across the entire protein family of interest, while (multiple) structural alignment algorithms such as MODELLER’s <monospace>salign</monospace> routine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref025">25</xref>], PROMALS3D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref029">29</xref>], and Expresso and 3DCoffee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref031">31</xref>], can additionally exploit structural data. <bold>Ensembler’s</bold> modular architecture facilitates the implementation of alternative alignment approaches, and we plan to implement some of these in future versions, to allow exploration of the influence of different alignment methods on model quality.</p>
<p>Models are output as PDB-format coordinate files. To minimize file storage requirements, <bold>Ensembler</bold> uses the Python <monospace>gzip</monospace> library to apply compression to all sizeable text files from the modeling stage onwards. The restraints used by MODELLER could potentially be used in alternative additional refinement schemes, and <bold>Ensembler</bold> thus provides a flag (<monospace>--write_modeller_restraints_file</monospace>) for optionally saving these restraints to file. This option is turned off by default, as the restraint files are relatively large (e.g. ∼400 kB per model for protein kinase domain targets), and are not expected to be used by the majority of users.</p>
<p>At this time, the alignment and modeling functions cannot be used to model non-standard amino acids, though we plan to be able to provide this functionality in future versions. Note that the Ensembler functions for target and template selection only include standard amino acids which match the UniProt canonical isoform sequence, and thus any set of targets and templates selected this way should be compatible with the Ensembler alignment and modeling functions.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Filtering of nearly identical models</title>
<p>Because <bold>Ensembler</bold> treats individual chains from source PDB structures as individual templates, a number of models may be generated with very similar structures if these individual chains are nearly identical in conformation. For this reason, and also to allow users to select for high diversity if they so choose, <bold>Ensembler</bold> provides a way to filter out models that are very similar in RMSD. The <monospace>cluster</monospace> subcommand can thus be used to identify models which differ from other models in terms of RMSD distance by a user-specified cutoff. Clustering is performed using the regular spatial clustering algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref009">9</xref>], as implemented in the MSMBuilder Python library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref018">18</xref>], which uses mdtraj [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref032">32</xref>] to calculate RMSD (for C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> atoms only) with a fast quaternion characteristic polynomial (QCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref035">35</xref>] implementation. A minimum distance cutoff (which defaults to 0.6 Å) is used to retain only a single model per cluster.</p>

<title>Refinement of models and filtering of poor models by simulation (E)</title>
<p>A number of refinement methods have been developed to help guide comparative modeling techniques toward more “native-like” and physically consistent conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref037">37</xref>]. Both short [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref037">37</xref>] and long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref038">38</xref>] molecular dynamics simulations have been employed for this purpose. Here, we utilize short molecular dynamic simulations for two purposes: both to slightly relax the initial comparative models and to eliminate those comparative models that result in highly implausible conformations. This is especially critical here due to the inclusion of even very low sequence identity template structures. We stress that the limited refinement by molecular simulation here is primarily intended as initial relaxation and filtering stages, where implausible models might cause simulations to immediately fail, crash, or generate implausibly high energies or unstable dynamics. Exploration of conformational dynamics to derive MSMs, for example, will inevitably require orders of magnitude more simulation effort—very likely tens of microseconds to milliseconds of aggregate dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p><bold>Ensembler</bold> thus includes a refinement module, which uses short molecular dynamics simulations to refine the models built in the previous step. As well as improving model quality, this also prepares models for subsequent production MD simulation, including solvation with explicit water molecules, if desired.</p>
<p>Models are first subjected to energy minimization (using the L-BFGS algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref039">39</xref>], followed by a short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with an implicit solvent representation. This is implemented using the OpenMM molecular simulation toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref002">2</xref>], chosen for its flexible Python API, and high performance GPU-acclerated simulation code. The simulation is run for a default of 100 ps, which in our example applications has been sufficient to filter out poor models (i.e. those with atomic overlaps unresolved by energy minimization, which result in an unstable simulation), as well as helping to relax model conformations. As discussed in the Results section, our example application of the <bold>Ensembler</bold> pipeline to the human tyrosine kinase family indicated that of the models which failed implicit solvent MD refinement, the vast majority failed within the first 1 ps of simulation.</p>
<p>The simulation protocol and default parameter values have been chosen to represent current “best practices” for the refinement simulations carried out here. As such, the simulation is performed using Langevin dynamics, with a default force field choice of Amber99SB-ILDN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref040">40</xref>], along with a modified generalized Born solvent model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref041">41</xref>] as implemented in the OpenMM package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref002">2</xref>]. Any of the other force fields or implicit water models implemented in OpenMM can be specified using the <monospace>--ff</monospace> and <monospace>--water_model</monospace> flags respectively. The simulation length can also be controlled via the <monospace>--simlength</monospace> flag, and many other important simulation parameters can be controlled from either the API or CLI (via the <monospace>--api_params</monospace> flag). The default values are set as follows—timestep: 2 fs; temperature: 300 K; Langevin collision rate: 20 ps<sup>−1</sup>; pH (used by OpenMM for protonation state assignment): 7. We also draw attention to a recent paper which indicates that lower Langevin collision rates may result in faster phase space exploration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>For some studies, it may be useful to specify the protonation states of individual amino acids, rather than rely only on automatic protonation state assignment by OpenMM. The user can do this by listing the residue numbers and their protonation states in a configuration file (<monospace>manual_overrides.yaml</monospace>). The necessary formatting for the configuration file is specified in the software documentation, and a template file is written when initializing an <bold>Ensembler</bold> project. Protonation states are specified by naming the appropriate residue variant type in the force field, e.g. <monospace>‘ASH’</monospace> for an aspartic acid residue, as opposed to the aspartate base <monospace>‘ASP’</monospace>. Any residues which do not have specific protonation states listed in the configuration file will have protonation states assigned automatically by OpenMM. Note that <bold>Ensembler</bold> currently only supports residue definitions provided by the forcefield definition files—it does not yet have the ability to derive new forcefield parameters for uncommon amino acids, cofactors, or ions not provided by the forcefield.</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Solvation and NPT equilibration (F)</title>
<p>While protein-only models may be sufficient for structural analysis or implicit solvent simulations, <bold>Ensembler</bold> also provides a stage for solvating models with explicit water and performing a round of explicit-solvent MD refinement/equilibration under isothermal-isobaric (NPT) conditions. The solvation step solvates each model for a given target with the same number of waters to facilitate the integration of data from multiple simulations, which is important for methods such as the construction of MSMs. The target number of waters is selected by first solvating each model with a specified padding distance (default: 10 Å), then taking a percentile value from the distribution (default: 68th percentile). This helps to prevent models with particularly long, extended loops—such as those arising from template structures with unresolved termini—from imposing very large box sizes on the entire set of models. The TIP3P water model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref043">43</xref>] is used by default, but any of the other explicit water models available in OpenMM, such as TIP4P-Ew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref044">44</xref>], can be specified using the <monospace>--water_model</monospace> flag. Models are resolvated with the target number of waters by first solvating with zero padding, then incrementally increasing the box size and resolvating until the target is exceeded, then finally deleting sufficient waters to match the target value. The explicit solvent MD simulation is also implemented using OpenMM, using the Amber99SB-ILDN force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref040">40</xref>] and TIP3P water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref043">43</xref>] by default. The force field, water model, and simulation length can again be specified using the <monospace>--ff</monospace>, <monospace>--water_model</monospace>, and <monospace>--simlength</monospace> flags respectively. Further simulation parameters can be controlled via the API or via the CLI <monospace>--api_params</monospace> flag. Pressure control is performed with a Monte Carlo barostat as implemented in OpenMM, with a default pressure of 1 atm and a period of 50 timesteps. The remaining simulation parameters have default values set to the same as for the implicit solvent MD refinement.</p>

<title>Model validation with MolProbity score</title>
<p><bold>Ensembler</bold> provides a function for validating model quality and filtering models using MolProbity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref046">46</xref>]—a widely used tool for validation of protein models, which provides a numerical score derived from features such as steric clashes between atoms, bond geometry, Ramachandran angles, sidechain rotamer outliers, backbone deviations, and the presence of cis-peptides. This function is accessed via the <monospace>validate</monospace> subcommand, which for a given target will output a text file containing a list of model IDs sorted by validation score. The optional <monospace>--modeling_stage</monospace> flag specifies which of the three main Ensembler modeling stages to validate—the initial comparative modeling stage, the implicit MD refinement stage, or the explicit MD refinement stage. If this flag is not used, Ensembler defaults to selecting the latest stage for which models have been generated. The output text file can be used to filter models based on validation score, for example by using the <monospace>package_models</monospace> subcommand. Protein model validation is a challenging problem and an active area of research for many groups, including the developers of <bold>Ensembler</bold>. We plan to implement further validation methods in future versions of Ensembler.</p>

<sec id="sec012">
<title>Packaging</title>
<p><bold>Ensembler</bold> provides a packaging module which can be used to prepare models for subsequent downstream use, such as the use of distributed or cluster computing resources for the generation of MSMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref010">10</xref>]. The <monospace>package_models</monospace> subcommand currently provides functions (specified via the <monospace>--package_for</monospace> flag) for compressing models in preparation for data transfer, or for organizing them with the appropriate directory and file structure for production simulation on the distributed computing platform Folding@home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref004">4</xref>]. The module could easily be extended to add methods for preparing models for other purposes. For example, production simulations could alternatively be run using Copernicus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref006">6</xref>]—a framework for performing parallel adaptive MD simulations— or GPUGrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref007">7</xref>]—a distributing computing platform which relies on computational power voluntarily donated by the owners of nondedicated GPU-equipped computers.</p>
<p>An important use of the packaging stage is to filter models based on model quality. At the current time, the available filtering options are based on either target-template sequence identity or MolProbity validation score. The <monospace>package_models</monospace> subcommand includes optional flags for specifying a sequence identity cutoff (so that only models with a target-template sequence identity above the specified percentage are chosen), a MolProbity validation score cutoff (to choose only models with lower validation scores, which indicate better model quality), or a MolProbity validation score percentile (to choose only models with validation scores lower than the value at the given percentile).</p>
<p>Models can also be exported into trajectory files for the purpose of performing structural analyses across model ensembles using tools like MDTraj [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref032">32</xref>]. This is done using the <monospace>mktraj</monospace> subcommand, which writes model coordinates for a given target to a Gromacs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref048">48</xref>] XTC format trajectory (chosen for its wide usage and data compression). Each frame in the trajectory represents a single model, and models are sorted in descending order of target-template sequence identity. Also output for each target are a PDB coordinate file (for use as a topology input file) and a CSV file containing model IDs (in the same order as the frames in the trajectory file) and other data such as target-template sequence identity. Using the <monospace>--modeling_stage</monospace> flag, models can be selected from any of three Ensembler modeling stages—after the initial comparative modeling stage, after implicit MD refinement, or after explicit MD refinement. If this flag is not used, Ensembler defaults to selecting the latest stage for which models have been generated.</p>
<p>We stress that, despite evidence suggesting that there is a correspondence between solution-state dynamics and structural diversity of related template proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref016">16</xref>], all models—especially those derived from low sequence identity templates—are not necessarily representative of conformations thermally accessible to the template proteins of interest. Care must be exercised in the use and analysis of these models.</p>

<title>Modeling of all human tyrosine kinase catalytic domains</title>
<p>As a first application of <bold>Ensembler</bold>, we have built models for the human TK family. TKs (and protein kinases in general) play important roles in many cellular processes and are involved in a number of types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref049">49</xref>]. For example, a translocation between the TK Abl1 and the pseudokinase Bcr is closely associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref050">50</xref>], while mutations of Src are associated with colon, breast, prostate, lung, and pancreatic cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref051">51</xref>]. Protein kinase domains are thought to have multiple accessible metastable conformation states, and much effort is directed at developing kinase inhibitor drugs which bind to and stabilize inactive conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref052">52</xref>]. Kinases are thus a particularly interesting subject for study with MSM methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref053">53</xref>], and this approach stands to benefit greatly from the ability to exploit the full body of available genomic and structural data within the kinase family, e.g. by generating large numbers of starting configurations to be used in highly parallel MD simulation.</p>
<p>We selected all human TK domains annotated in UniProt as targets, and all available structures of protein kinase domains (of any species) as templates, using the commands shown in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pcbi.1004728.box001">Box 1</xref>. This returned 93 target sequences and 4433 template structures, giving a total of 412269 target-template pairs. The templates were derived from 3028 individual PDB entries and encompassed 23 different species, with 3634 template structures from human kinase constructs.</p>
<p>The resultant models are available as part of a supplementary dataset which can be downloaded from the Dryad Digital Repository (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7fg32" xlink:type="simple">10.5061/dryad.7fg32</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Ensembler modeling statistics</title>
<p>Crystallographic structures of kinase catalytic domains generally contain a significant number of missing residues (median 11, mean 14, standard deviation 13, max 102) due to the high mobility of several loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top), with a number of these missing spans being significant in length (median 5, mean 7, standard deviation 6, max 82; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g003">Fig 3</xref>, bottom). To reduce the reliance on the MODELLER rapid model construction stage to reconstruct very long unresolved loops, unresolved template residues were first remodeled using the <monospace>loopmodel</monospace> subcommand. Out of 3666 templates with one or more missing residues, 3134 were successfully remodeled by the Rosetta loop modeling stage (with success defined simply as program termination without error); most remodeling failures were attributable to unsatisfiable spatial constraints imposed by the original template structure. There was some correlation between remodeling failures and the number of missing residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top); templates for which remodeling failed had a median of 20 missing residues, compared to a median of 14 missing residues for templates for which remodeling was successful (when excluding templates with no missing residues).</p>

<title>All tyrosine kinases</title>
<p>To evaluate the variety of template sequence similarities relative to each target sequence, we calculated sequence identity distributions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g004">Fig 4</xref>. This suggests an intuitive division into three categories, with 355712 models in the 0–35% sequence identity range, 51330 models in the 35–55% range, and 5227 models in the 55–100% range. We then computed the RMSD distributions for the models created for each target (relative to the model derived from the template with highest sequence identity) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g005">Fig 5</xref>, to assess the diversity of conformations captured by the modeling pipeline. Furthermore, to understand the influence of sequence identity on the conformational similarities of the resulting models, the RMSD distributions were stratified based on the three sequence identity categories described above. This analysis indicates that higher sequence identity templates result in models with lower RMSDs, while templates with remote sequence identities result in larger RMSDs on average, recapitulating the observation made years ago by Chothia and Lesk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref054">54</xref>].</p>

When stratified by the same sequence identity ranges as above, the mean scores were as follows: 2.96 (55–100% sequence identity), 3.13 (35–55% sequence identity), 3.24 (0–35% sequence identity). This indicates that models with lower target-template sequence identities tend to be lower quality according to MolProbity analysis, as would be expected.</p>

<p>The Abl1 renderings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g007">Fig 7</xref> indicate one high sequence identity model with a long unstructured region at one of the termini, which was unresolved in the original template structure. While such models are not necessarily incorrect or undesirable, it is important to be aware of the effects they may have on production simulations performed under periodic boundary conditions, as long unstructured termini can be prone to interact with a protein’s periodic image. Lower sequence identity models (in transparent white or red) indicate much greater variation in all parts of the structure. We believe the mix of high and low sequence identity models to be particularly useful for methods such as MSM building, which require thorough sampling of the conformational landscape. The high sequence identity models could be considered to be the most likely to accurately represent true metastable states. Conversely, the lower sequence identity models could be expected to help push a simulation into regions of conformation space which might take intractably long to reach if starting a single metastable conformation.</p>

<title>Comparison with known biochemically relevant conformations</title>
<p>To evaluate the models of <italic>Src</italic> and <italic>Abl1</italic> in the context of the published structural biology literature on functionally relevant conformations, we have focused on two residue pair distances thought to be important order parameters for the regulation of protein kinase domain activity. We use the residue numbering schemes for chicken Src (commonly employed in the literature even in reference to human Src) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref057">57</xref>] and human Abl1 isoform A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref060">60</xref>] respectively; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004728.s001">S1 Text</xref> for the exact sequences and numbering schemes used.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g008">Fig 8</xref> shows two structures of <italic>Src</italic> believed to represent inactive (PDB code: 2SRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref056">56</xref>] and active (PDB code: 1Y57) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref057">57</xref>] states. One notable feature which distinguishes the two structures is the transfer of an electrostatic interaction of E310 from R409 (in the inactive state) to K295 (in the active state), brought about by a rotation of the <italic>α</italic>C-helix. These three residues are also well conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref061">61</xref>], and a number of experimental and simulation studies have suggested that this electrostatic switching process plays a role in a regulatory mechanism shared across the protein kinase family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref063">63</xref>]. As such, we have plotted the distance between these two residue pairs for the <bold>Ensembler</bold> models for <italic>Src</italic> and <italic>Abl1</italic>, as well as <italic>Flt4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The models all show strong coverage of regions in which either of the electrostatic interactions is fully formed (for models across all levels of target-template sequence identity), as well as a wide range of regions in-between (mainly models with low sequence identity). We thus expect that such a set of models, if used as starting configurations for highly parallel MD simulation, could greatly aid in sampling of functionally relevant conformational states. The <italic>Flt4</italic> models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g008">Fig 8</xref>c) are of particular note, as there are no available crystal structures of the kinase domain of this TK protein (which is involved in tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref064">64</xref>]), yet the models generated here include structural motifs which are conserved and of known importance to other proteins of the same family.</p>

<p>We recognize that the current version of <bold>Ensembler</bold> has a number of limitations that bound its domain of applicability: support for nonnatural amino acids is currently rudimentary and confined to those already appearing in the forcefield; cofactors cannot currently be automatically modeled in; ligands, cofactors, and nonnatural amino acids cannot yet be automatically parameterized; protonation state assignment is limited to selection of the most populated state based on the intrinsic p<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> or user-specified overrides; the modeling of missing loops is rudimentary, relying on the subsequent dynamics for relaxation; there is not yet support for modeling of distinct domains from different templates, or the use of multiple templates to model a single domain. Nevertheless, there are a great number of use cases for this first version of an automated tool for simulation preparation at the superfamily scale. To expand this domain of applicability, there are a number of obvious additions and improvements which we plan to implement in future versions of <bold>Ensembler</bold>.</p>
<sec id="sec028">
<title>Template remodeling</title>
<p>The lack of crystallographically-resolved regions of template structures presents a challenge to deriving structures from these templates by comparative modeling, especially in kinases, where loops are frequently unresolved. Improvements over the Rosetta-based strategy described here are likely possible, especially given the number of modeling failures observed in the template refinement stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004728.g003">Fig 3</xref>). An alternative approach could be to re-refine complete-chain template structures to the experimentally-derived electron density or scattering data deposited in the RCSB using methods capable of exploiting the scattering data and crystallographic symmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref065">65</xref>]. Even if definitive placement of these unresolved regions is impossible, plausible locations constrained by weak scattering data and strong steric exclusion of crystallographic neighbors may provide a great deal of useful information, especially when combined with forcefield priors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref066">66</xref>].</p>

<title>Protonation states</title>
<p>Some amino acids can exist in different protonation states, depending on pH and on their local environment. These protonation states can have important effects on biological processes. For example, long timescale MD simulations have suggested that the conformation of the DFG motif of the TK Abl1—believed to be an important regulatory mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref067">67</xref>]—is controlled by protonation of the aspartate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref068">68</xref>]. Currently, protonation states are assigned simply based on pH (a user-controllable parameter). At neutral pH, histidines have two protonation states which are approximately equally likely, and in this situation the selection is therefore made based on which state results in a better hydrogen bond. It would be highly desirable to instead use a method which assigns amino acid protonation states based on a rigorous assessment of the local environment. We thus plan to implement an interface and command-line function for assigning protonation states with MCCE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref071">71</xref>], which uses electrostatics calculations combined with Monte Carlo sampling of side chain conformers to calculate pKa values.</p>

<sec id="sec031">
<title>Cofactors, structural ions, and ligands</title>
<p>Many proteins require the presence of various types of non-protein atoms and molecules for proper function, such as metal ions (e.g. Mg<sup>+2</sup>), cofactors (e.g. ATP) or post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, methylation, glycosylation, etc.), and we thus plan for <bold>Ensembler</bold> to eventually have the capability to include such entities in the generated models. Binding sites for metal ions are frequently found in proteins, often playing a role in catalysis. For example, protein kinase domains contain two binding sites for divalent metal cations, and display significantly increased activity in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref072">72</xref>], the divalent cation with highest concentration in mammalian cells. Metal ions are often not resolved in experimental structures of proteins, but by taking into account the full range of available structural data, it should be possible in many cases to include metal ions based on the structures of homologous proteins. We are careful to point out, however, that metal ion parameters in classical MD force fields have significant limitations, particularly in their interactions with proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref073">73</xref>]. Cofactors and post-translational modifications are also often not fully resolved in experimental structures, and endogenous cofactors are frequently substituted with other molecules to facilitate experimental structural analysis. Future extensions to <bold>Ensembler</bold> could transfer cofactor and ion coordinates from homologous proteins in which these components are resolved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec032">
<title>Post-translationally modified amino acids and other molecules without forcefield parameters</title>
<p>A major challenge in the preparation of simulations of proteins of interest is the wide variety of post-translational modifications possible that are often functionally or structurally relevant. Often, forcefields lack parameters for these residues, or for other cofactors or ligands that might be vital to probing the relevant structural dynamics of these systems. While tools such as Antechamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref074">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref075">75</xref>] can rapidly generate small molecule parameters in an automated manner, the parameterization of polymeric residues or covalently attached cofactors is much more challenging. In addition, small molecule forcefields are generally tied to specific corresponding protein and nucleic acid forcefields, meaning that different procedures may be needed to generate consistent parameters.</p>

For example, the set of all human protein kinase domains listed in UniProt have a median length of 265 residues (mean 277) and a standard deviation of 45, yet the minimum and maximum lengths are 102 and 801 respectively. The latter value corresponds to the protein kinase domain of serine/threonine-kinase <italic>greatwall</italic>, which includes a long insertion between the two main lobes of the catalytic domain. In principle, such insertions could be excluded from the generated models, though a number of questions would arise as to how best to approach this.</p>

<title>Markov state model (MSM) construction and model utility</title>
<p>We are actively utilizing <bold>Ensembler</bold>-generated models to seed the construction of Markov state models (MSMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref010">10</xref>]. While the observation that high sequence identity templates are likely to reflect accessible solution-phase conformations suggests that a number of these models occupy thermally accessible regions of configuration space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref016">16</xref>], many models—especially those derived from very low sequence identity templates—are likely to be highly unrepresentative of conformations populated at equilibrium by the target protein. It is likely that even with hundreds of microseconds to milliseconds of aggregated dynamics, many of these poor quality models will remain trapped in inaccessible and irrelevant regions of configuration space. Standard approaches to MSM construction now employ an <italic>ergodic trimming</italic> step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004728.ref019">19</xref>] to prune away disconnected minor regions of configuration space, and this step is expected to be essential in the successful construction of MSMs using <bold>Ensembler</bold>-derived models.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We believe <bold>Ensembler</bold> to be an important first step toward enabling computational modeling and simulation of proteins on the scale of entire protein families, and suggest that it could likely prove useful for tasks beyond its original aim of providing diverse starting configurations for MD simulations. The code is open source and has been developed with extensibility in mind, in order to facilitate its customization for a wide range of potential uses by the wider scientific community.</p>
