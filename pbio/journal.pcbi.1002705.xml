        <p>Catalytic loop motions facilitate substrate recognition and binding in many enzymes. While these motions appear to be highly flexible, their functional significance suggests that structure-encoded preferences may play a role in selecting particular mechanisms of motions. We performed an extensive study on a set of enzymes to assess whether the collective/global dynamics, as predicted by elastic network models (ENMs), facilitates or even defines the local motions undergone by functional loops. Our dataset includes a total of 117 crystal structures for ten enzymes of different sizes and oligomerization states. Each enzyme contains a specific functional/catalytic loop (10â€“21 residues long) that closes over the active site during catalysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the available crystal structures (including apo and ligand-bound forms) for each enzyme revealed the dominant conformational changes taking place in these loops upon substrate binding. These experimentally observed loop reconfigurations are shown to be predominantly driven by energetically favored modes of motion intrinsically accessible to the enzyme in the absence of its substrate. The analysis suggests that robust global modes cooperatively defined by the overall enzyme architecture also entail local components that assist in suitable opening/closure of the catalytic loop over the active site.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Protein loops have critical roles in ligand binding and catalysis. An unresolved issue in this context is the extent to which the intrinsic dynamics of proteins predispose loops to perform their molecular function. In this work, we (i) critically examine the structural changes undergone by functional/catalytic loops based on a set of enzyme crystal structures in the presence/absence of a ligand, and (ii) examine to what extent those motions are correlated with, or driven by, the global modes that are predictable using simplified, physics-based models. Using a dataset of 117 structures for ten enzymes of different sizes and oligomerization states, we show that the collective modes defined by the protein topology favor loop rearrangements in reasonable agreement with those experimentally observed upon activation. These results suggest that simple but robust motions encoded by the entire architecture, not the local binding site only, assist in binding of the ligand, positioning of the catalytic loop, and/or sequestration of the catalytic site, which in turn, enable efficient catalysis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>An issue yet to be resolved is the extent to which the intrinsic dynamics of proteins predispose them to ligand binding. Is there any correlation between local functional events such as loop rearrangements involved in ligand binding and the collective motions intrinsically accessible to the protein prior to ligand binding? To what extent do the structure-encoded global modes of motions (e.g. domain opening/closing, exposure or burial of active sites, cooperative conformational switches in allosteric proteins) simultaneously engage loop motions that facilitate functional interactions? Or, are loop reconfigurations mainly induced on a local scale by the ligand?</p>
      <p>Notably, two different views have been advanced in recent years in linking protein dynamics and function: (i) enzyme structural flexibility affects its catalytic reactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-HenzlerWildman1">[1]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Bhabha1">[4]</xref>, (ii) catalysis is independent of collective dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Olsson1">[5]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Adamczyk1">[7]</xref>. The second view is supported by the limited mobility of catalytic residues in the collective motions of the protein (due to the requirement of precise positioning for chemical reactivity). Recent studies show that the preorganization of the active site is a rate-limiting factor in catalysis, while conformational dynamics help reorganize structural elements near the catalytic site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Torbeev1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The global motions of enzymes, also called slowest or softest due to their low frequency or small effective force constants, have been shown in numerous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Tama1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Bahar1">[10]</xref> to be robustly defined by the evolutionarily selected fold. It is conceivable that these structure-encoded modes play a role in facilitating the enzymatic activity, for example, by favoring structural changes that enable efficient recognition and binding of the substrate/ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Bakan1">[11]</xref>. There is experimental evidence that the loss of conformational motion affects the enzymatic mechanism, even though the structure and electrostatics are preserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Bhabha1">[4]</xref>, while recent work showed that electrostatic preorganization, not conformational motions, makes the largest contribution to catalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Adamczyk1">[7]</xref>. Our examination of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) collective dynamics suggests that there is a coupling between the global dynamics of the molecule and the local motions of the catalytically active loop 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Kurkcuoglu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Cansu1">[13]</xref>. As illustrated in the Supporting Information (SI) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s001">Figure S1</xref>, the experimentally observed closure of loop 6 over the ligand is in accord with the essential/principal mode of motion observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TIM; furthermore this first principal mode extracted from MD by essential dynamics analysis (EDA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Amadei1">[14]</xref> is in agreement with the global (softest, lowest frequency) mode predicted for the dimer using the anisotropic network model (ANM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Doruker1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Atilgan1">[16]</xref>. Collective monomeric counter-rotations, which are not evident in experimental data, appear to be coupled to the functional loop's opening/closure over the active site. Moreover, experiments for TIM indicate that loop closure is not ligand-gated and emerges as an intrinsic motion of the apo enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Williams1">[17]</xref>. While these observations signal a role of global dynamics in facilitating functional loop motions, there has been no systematic study of enzyme dynamics in relation to loop motions to establish the generality of these observations, apart from a recent study by Jernigan and coworkers where attention has been invited to the importance of slow modes for functional loop motions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Skliros1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>With the rapid accumulation of both apo and liganded structures (usually open and closed forms, respectively) for a given protein in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Berman1">[19]</xref>, and with the development of analytical models and tools for rapid estimation of intrinsic dynamics, we are now in a position to (i) critically examine the structural changes undergone in recognition loops and/or catalytic sites based on structurally resolved proteins in the presence/absence of a ligand and (ii) examine to what extent those motions are correlated with, or driven by, the global modes that are predictable using simplified, physics-based models.</p>
      <p>To this aim, we focus on a series of enzymes, where loop motions relevant to function have been experimentally detected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002705-t001">Table 1</xref>). In each case, we have a set of structures containing the apo and ligand-bound forms, which differ particularly in their loop regions. As listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002705-t001">Table 1</xref>, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between the open and closed forms varies in the range 0.9â€“3.9 Ã… (after optimal superposition of the open and closed structures to eliminate rigid-body translations and rotations), while the loop RMSD varies between 3.5 and 14.5 Ã…; and the tip residues of the loops are displaced by 6.7 to 25.0 Ã… between the open and closed conformations. On the other hand, the internal RMSDs of the loops, obtained after structural alignment of the isolated loops, are lower than 5.5 Ã… (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002705-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the large displacements of the loops on the proteins are to a large extent due to the rigid-body displacements, which may be coupled to the collective motions of the enzymes. Notably, four out of ten enzymes (TIM, protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), L-lactate dehydrogenase and 3-dehydroquinase) exhibit almost a rigid-lid type closure with a loop internal RMSD less than 2 Ã… (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002705-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>The approach we undertake is the following: (i) to determine the dominant conformational changes of the functional loops by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) of the available crystal structures for each enzyme as well as by direct examination of two structures representatives of the open and closed forms (see Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s006">Text S1</xref>), (ii) to determine collective modes of motion of a representative unliganded member using the ANM, and (iii) to examine the overlap between functional loop reconfiguration derived from experimental data and structure-based motions predicted by the ANM, as explained in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Bakan1">[11]</xref>. Additionally, we will extract essential motions from MD simulations for PTP and TIM as two case studies to further establish the correlation, if any, between computationally predicted loop motions, and those experimentally observed. We will show that a few well-defined, energetically accessible collective modes of motions encoded by the entire architecture, not by the local binding site only, favor suitable repositioning of the catalytic loop, which in turn, enable the predisposition of the active site to catalytic activity.</p>

        <title>Overview of dataset, method of approach, and results</title>
        <p>Calculations were performed for a dataset of 117 structures from the PDB corresponding to 10 enzymes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002705-t001">Tables 1</xref> and S1), with 2 to 28 structures resolved in different forms per enzyme. Among them, <italic>Hha</italic>I methyltranferase (M. <italic>Hha</italic>I) is a DNA-binding enzyme; and all others bind ligands of various sizes. They contain <italic>s</italic>â€Š=â€Š10â€“21 residue long loops that close over the active site during reaction. By this means, a catalytic residue located on the loop is correctly positioned in the active site and the site is protected from solvent during catalysis.</p>
        <p>We compare two sets of data generated for each enzyme: <italic>experimental</italic>, derived from the structures known for the enzyme; and <italic>computational</italic>, predicted for a representative unliganded structure (indicated as open structure in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s006">Text S1</xref>). Of interest is to assess the correspondence, if any, between the experimentally observed (local) loop motions, and the predicted loop motion as driven by the soft (global) ANM modes. As a metric, we use the overlap <italic>O<sub>1j</sub></italic>â‰¡|<bold><italic>p</italic></bold><italic><sup>(1)</sup></italic>. <bold><italic>u</italic></bold><italic><sup>(j)</sup></italic>| between the dominant motion inferred from experiments (expressed by <italic>3N</italic>-dimensional unit directional vector, <bold><italic>p</italic></bold><italic><sup>(1)</sup></italic>, also called PC1 if obtained by PCA or deformation vector if calculated from the difference between open and closed forms; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) and the <italic>j<sup>th</sup></italic> eigenmode <bold><italic>u</italic></bold><italic><sup>(j)</sup></italic> predicted by the ANM. <italic>O<sub>1j</sub></italic> varies by definition in the range [0, 1]. An overlap close to 1 means that the experimentally observed structural change is essentially driven by the mode <italic>j</italic>. Another metric is the <italic>cumulative overlap</italic>, a summation over a subset of p modes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), describing the fractional contribution of <italic>p</italic> modes to the (experimentally) observed deformation.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s002">Figure S2</xref> displays the <italic>O<sub>1j</sub></italic> values for the slowest 40 modes (bars) and their <italic>cumulative overlap</italic> (curve) for each enzyme. In six out of ten enzymes, there is at least one mode with an <italic>O<sub>1j</sub></italic>&gt;0.4, and a cumulative overlap of 0.7 or higher is attained in 7/10 cases, suggesting that the soft modes facilitate, if not enable, functional loop motions.</p>
        <p>We further made a direct assessment of the orientational correlation between the loop motions observed in experiments and those predicted by computations. To this aim, we evaluated the correlation cosine <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002705.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, between the <italic>3s</italic>-dimensional subvectors <bold><italic>p</italic></bold><sub>s</sub><sup>(<italic>1</italic>)</sup> and <bold><italic>u</italic></bold><sub>s</sub><sup>(<italic>j</italic>)</sup> corresponding to the loop regions of <bold><italic>p</italic></bold><italic><sup>(1)</sup></italic>and <bold><italic>u</italic></bold><italic><sup>(j)</sup></italic>. O<italic><sub>1j</sub><sup>loop</sup></italic> will be shortly called <italic>loop overlap</italic>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002705-t002">Table 2</xref> shows that a loop overlap of 0.57â‰¤O<italic><sub>1j</sub><sup>loop</sup></italic>â‰¤0.86 is achieved by at least one mode (among the softest 10; written in parentheses) in each examined enzyme (<italic>column 2</italic>). <italic>Column 3</italic> lists the softest mode that yields a loop overlap higher than 0.5; and <italic>column 4</italic>, the modes, among the softest 10, that yield a loop overlap of 0.5 or higher.</p>

A general trend of decreasing loop overlap with increasing mode number is observed for all enzymes.</p>
        <p>As a further test, we compared weighted-average loop overlaps, calculated for the softest 10 modes, to those accomplished by randomly generated modes. To that aim, we evaluated the <italic>difference</italic> Î”&lt;O|<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>&gt;<italic><sub>p</sub></italic>â€Š=â€Š&lt;O|<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>&gt;<italic><sub>p</sub><sup>ANM</sup></italic>âˆ’&lt;O|<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>&gt;<italic><sub>p</sub><sup>random</sup></italic> at the loop region of <italic>s</italic> residues, and repeated the calculations for all successive windows of <italic>s</italic> residues along the protein sequence. The goal was to test whether the resulting â€˜difference profilesâ€™ as a function of residue (sliding window) index would distinguish the loop regions as regions of high overlap with ANM softest modes (e.g. <italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š10 of them). The difference profiles presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s004">Figure S4</xref> clearly indicate that for the most part the catalytic loop regions (the positions of which along the sequences are indicated by red stars and dashed vertical lines) are distinguished by their high overlap with slow modes, in support of the correlation between structure-encoded soft modes and functional loop reconfigurations. The last column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002705-t002">Table 2</xref> shows that the <italic>enhancement factor</italic> calculated as the ratio &lt;O|<italic><sub>s</sub></italic><sub>â€Š=â€Š<italic>loop</italic></sub>&gt;<italic><sub>p</sub><sup>ANM</sup></italic>/&lt;O|<italic><sub>sâ€Š=â€Šloop</sub></italic>&gt;<italic><sub>p</sub><sup>random</sup></italic>. Notably, the enhancement factor varies between 1.8â€“16.1, with PTP exhibiting the smallest enhancement, and L-lactate dehydrogenase, the largest.</p>
        <p>In summary, in each studied protein, at least one of the top-ranking (energetically favorable) 10 collective modes predicted by the ANM yields a high loop overlap, and the weighted-average overlap achieved by these soft modes at the loop region is enhanced by a factor of 6.0 on average (over 10 proteins) compared to randomly generated modes. These data further support the view that the seemingly â€˜localâ€™ loop reconfigurations inferred from experimental data are not decoupled from the global modes intrinsically encoded by the overall structure. On the contrary, global modes generally exhibit higher overlaps with the functional loop motions than local (high frequency) modes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s003">Figure S3</xref>) or random modes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

One important feature of PTPs is the WPD loop, which carries the conserved catalytic residue Asp356 (in YopH) and closes over the active site upon binding of the substrate (open and closed conformations of the loop are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002705-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

          <title>Overlap with ANM predictions</title>
          <p>The overlap between experimental data (PC1) and the ANM modes is calculated to detect any correlation between loop closure and the slow modes. We performed ANM calculations for open structure with PDB identifier 1YPT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Stuckey1">[22]</xref>. ANM mode 2 (ANM2) yielded highest overall overlap (0.41, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s002">Figure S2</xref>) with PC1. We depict fluctuations along ANM2 using arrows (<italic>green</italic>) pointing in the loop closure direction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002705-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. In the close-up view, ANM2 arrows are compared to the loop closure observed in crystal structures (<italic>dark orange arrows</italic>). As to the WPD loop overlap, two out of 10 slowest modes exhibit correlation cosines above 0.5 (0.72 for mode 6, and 0.51 for mode 2; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002705-t002">Table 2</xref>). Further, slowest 10 ANM modes yield an overlap enhancement of 1.8 relative to random modes, which is actually the lowest enhancement factor in the dataset. Finally, cumulative overlap (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) plots show that 20 modes (2.4% of all modes) explain 60% of the structural variance.

          <title>MD results</title>
          <p>We also performed a 50 ns MD run of the apo enzyme. Similar to ANM results, the highest correlation with PCA1 achieved by individual EDA modes is 0.44. However, the loop overlap values achieved by the essential modes at the low frequency region of the spectrum are considerably higher than those at the intermediate and high frequency ranges, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002705-g001">Figure 1D</xref>. These results are in accord with previous 10 ns MD simulations on YopH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Hu1">[26]</xref>. Essential modes consistently show WPD loop's half-closure in apo form. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002705-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, the time evolution of the distance between active site residue Val407 and loop residue Gln357 is plotted, showing that the loop has a tendency to occasionally move towards the closed conformation (indicated by the blue horizontal bar), although it never reaches the closed form. Note that these runs are performed for the unliganded PTP so as to assess the conformational dynamics of the enzyme in the absence of ligand binding. The â€˜incompleteâ€™ closure of the loop in simulations may thus result from the lack of interactions, (mainly electrostatic, between the charged residues on the loop and the ligand) which would otherwise stabilize the closed state. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002705-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, snapshots from every 2.5 ns are shown to display halfway closed loop configurations from the simulation. Overall, an intrinsic feature of PTP functional dynamics is the flexibility of WPD loop to fluctuate in the functional direction, confirmed by both ANM and MD results.</p>

          <title>MD results</title>
          <p>Our previous 60 ns MD simulation performed for chicken TIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Cansu1">[13]</xref> exhibited loop 6 closure, consistent with experimental data. Global deformations that were not apparent in crystal structures have been observed therein to accompany the loop closure. Specifically, the first mode from EDA of the trajectory (with 34% contribution to overall motion) revealed a counter-rotation of the two subunits accompanied by the proper closure of loop 6, again consistent with ANM results. Here we performed an independent MD simulation (100 ns long) on TcTIM apo structure and focused on the distance between the loop and a relatively immobile residue. The results plotted as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002705-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), show multiple opening/closure events in both subunits (only subunit A shown). Snapshots taken every 10 ns indicate various loop conformations between open and closed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002705-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). EDA analysis further confirms that the counter-clockwise rotation of the two subunits in the first mode (with 36% contribution) is coupled to the loop closure event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The high correlation between the first three modes from EDA and ANM of TcTIM further support the robustness of the results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002705.s001">Figure S1Bâ€“C</xref>). These findings consistently highlight the coupling between the global counter-rotation of the subunits in the first mode and the loop closure.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Proteins undergo a broad range of motions under physiological conditions, spanning from local to global changes in conformations. Among them, the most probable motions, also known as the softest modes, are usually highly collective, i.e., they drive the cooperative motions of entire domains/subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Bahar1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Bahar2">[33]</xref>. Many activities of proteins are achieved, on the other hand, by relatively localized motions, such as loop reconfigurations that accompany ligand binding. A common behavior in all enzymes studied here was the occurrence of the catalytic loop reconfiguration based on the available apo and bound structures. This observation has commonly leaded to the hypothesis that loop motions are triggered by ligand binding.</p>
      <p>Given that loop motions are not collective in nature, but seemingly confined to short segments on the backbone, they might be attributed to local, rather than global dynamics. Many studies focused on such â€˜regions of interestâ€™ implicitly assuming that the loop reconfiguration observed is predominantly determined by local interactions. Our analysis demonstrates, however, that the local conformational changes observed in experiments at functional loops are not independent of the soft modes of motions intrinsically favored by the architecture. On the contrary, at least in the examined dataset, the soft modes do contribute (more than local high frequency modes) to the reconfiguration of the loops along directions stabilized upon ligand binding.</p>
      <p>The top-ranking ANM modes are by definition collective modes of motions known to be highly robust against sequence and structure variations. The correlation between experimentally observed structural changes at the catalytic loops and these modes suggests the evolution of the enzymatic architecture to facilitate the predisposition of the catalytic loop to enzymatic activity. Our previous and current MD simulations on TIM from two different species consistently indicate high mobility and almost full opening/closure of loop 6 in both subunits of the homodimer. In contrast, only half-closure and restricted mobility is observed for the WPD loop during PTP simulations. Evidently, there are other factors that also affect catalytic loop dynamics in terms of reaching the closed state, or the state â€˜pre-disposedâ€™ to catalytic activity. One factor may be the favorable electrostatic interactions provided by the substrate (not included in our simulations). Another factor proposed to facilitate loop closure is the presence of the conserved, glycine-rich loops interacting with the active-site loop in previous MD simulations on enolase, Î² 1,4-galactosyltransferase and lipase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Gunasekaran1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Navarro1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that our study does not contradict the critical role of electrostatic interactions in catalysis pointed out earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Olsson1">[5]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Adamczyk1">[7]</xref>, and in fact, our earlier work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Yang1">[36]</xref> showed that the catalytic site, once assuming the â€˜activeâ€™ conformation, is mechanically constrained to maintain its precise geometry required for chemical reactivity. On the other hand, conformational flexibility comes into play, and plays an important role to our view, in facilitating the binding of the substrate, and in favoring the reconfiguration of the active site into its form prone to catalysis, hence the significant role of conformational flexibility in accomplishing catalysis observed in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-HenzlerWildman1">[1]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Bhabha1">[4]</xref>. In a sense, the structure-encoded flexibility, or the suitable reorientation of the catalytic loop (as shown here to be favored by intrinsic collective motions) is a prerequisite for the ensuing catalytic activity which requires the appropriate chemical (and, in particular, electrostatic) organization.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that the ANM modes are purely based on native contact topology, or geometry. No residue-specific interactions are taken into consideration. The collective dynamics is essentially controlled by uniform spring-like potentials; and these potentials in turn account for the Gaussian fluctuations/distributions of inter-residue distances- the underlying assumption of the theory of elastic networks, as originally set forth for polymer networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Flory1">[37]</xref>. As such, the directions of motions predicted by the ANM are those favored by elastic entropic effects (for a recent review see ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002705-Bahar1">[10]</xref>), and the structural changes initiated/favored by these entropic effects are likely to be complemented by enthalpic effects, including in particular electrostatic interactions with the bound ligand to shape and stabilize the final closed conformer. Yet, the he correlation with experimentally observed deformations suggests that these entropic effects play a significant role in defining the accessible mechanisms of ligand binding.</p>
