<title/>
<p>The pathway that regulates asymmetric cell division in Caulobacter involves a signaling kinase whose catalytic output domain has been repurposed as an input sensor of the phosphorylation state of the response regulator – a reversal of the conventional direction of information flow; this allows wiring of simple linear signaling pathways into complex eukaryote-like networks.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>One of the simplest organisms to divide asymmetrically is the bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>. The DivL pseudo-histidine kinase, positioned at one cell pole, regulates cell-fate by controlling the activation of the global transcription factor CtrA via an interaction with the response regulator (RR) DivK. DivL uniquely contains a tyrosine at the histidine phosphorylation site, and can achieve these regulatory functions <italic>in vivo</italic> without kinase activity. Determination of the DivL crystal structure and biochemical analysis of wild-type and site-specific DivL mutants revealed that the DivL PAS domains regulate binding specificity for DivK∼P over DivK, which is modulated by an allosteric intramolecular interaction between adjacent domains. We discovered that DivL's catalytic domains have been repurposed as a phosphospecific RR input sensor, thereby reversing the flow of information observed in conventional histidine kinase (HK)-RR systems and coupling a complex network of signaling proteins for cell-fate regulation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Across all kingdoms of life the generation of cell-type diversity is the consequence of asymmetry at the point of cell division. The bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> divides asymmetrically to produce daughter cells that have distinct morphology and behavior. As in eukaryotes, an unequal distribution of signaling proteins in daughter <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells triggers the differential read-out of identical genomes. A critical interaction between two protein molecules – a protein kinase (DivL) and a response regulator (DivK) – is known to occur exclusively in one daughter cell and to thereby regulate differentiation. However, mapping the observed signaling interconnections that drive asymmetric division has been difficult to reconcile with traditional models of bacterial signaling. Here we determine how DivL detects and processes this DivK signal. Although DivL has an architecture that is typical of histidine kinases, which normally act by regulating the phosphorylation state of the appropriate response regulator, DivL's essential functions do not require kinase activity and DivL does not add or remove phosphate from DivK. Instead we find that DivL has converted its output kinase domain into an input sensor domain that specifically detects phosphorylated DivK, and we identify key features of DivL that underlie this specificity. This novel reassignment of sensory functions reverses the conventional kinase-to-response-regulator signaling flow and logically couples linear signaling pathways into complex eukaryote-like networks to regulate cell development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell fate decisions driven by the spatial organization of signaling proteins are a hallmark of asymmetric divisions in systems as diverse as stem cells and bacteria. <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, a model system for localization-dependent signaling network studies, divides asymmetrically yielding two distinct daughter cells: a motile swarmer cell and a replication-competent stalked cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Cell division in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> is a stepwise process that includes a cytoplasmic compartmentalization stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Goley1">[1]</xref> during which the inner membrane closes to form a barrier between the incipient swarmer and stalked cell compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Judd1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Judd2">[3]</xref>. This event segregates crucial signaling proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Judd1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Wheeler1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Matroule1">[5]</xref> and culminates in the swarmer cell-specific activation of the global transcriptional regulator CtrA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Ryan1">[6]</xref>, which controls the expression of more than 100 genes involved in cell division and asymmetric polar organelle development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Laub1">[7]</xref>. The two daughter cells are distinguished by a compartment-sensing module composed of the response regulator (RR) DivK and two histidine kinases (HKs), DivJ and PleC, which differentially regulate the CtrA signaling pathway upon compartmentalization. DivJ and PleC respectively occupy the old and new cell poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Wheeler1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Matroule1">[5]</xref>. Prior to cell division, the cytoplasm contains a homogeneous mixture of phosphorylated (DivK∼P) and unphosphorylated DivK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Tropini1">[8]</xref>. In pre-divisional cells, however, PleC (positioned at the new pole) functions as a DivK phosphatase, while DivJ (positioned at the old pole) functions as a DivK kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Wheeler1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Matroule1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Paul1">[9]</xref>. In this way, compartmentalization promotes accumulation of unphosphorylated DivK in the incipient swarmer cell and DivK∼P in the incipient stalked cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Lam1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Jacobs1">[11]</xref>, providing unique cell-type markers.</p>

<title>A compartment sensing circuit regulates asymmetric cell division in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>.</title>
<p>(A) A cartoon of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> asymmetric cell division and the spatiotemporal localization of the essential regulatory components DivJ (blue), DivK (red), PleC (orange), CckA (brown), DivL (green), and CtrA (yellow). PleC serves as a DivK phosphatase localized at the new cell pole, while DivJ serves as a DivK kinase localized at the stalked cell pole. DivJ and PleC are physically separated upon compartmentalization, generating DivK∼P (full red circles) in the stalk compartment and DivK (open red circles) in the swarmer compartment. This compartment signal (DivK) selectively represses CtrA upon interaction with DivL thereby guiding distinct developmental programs for swarmer and stalked cells. (B) To promote cell differentiation, <italic>Caulobacter</italic> employs three distinct signaling modules: a compartment sensing module consisting of DivJ (HK), DivK (RR), and PleC (phosphatase), a differentiation module consisting of CckA (hybrid HK), ChpT (phosphotransferase), and CtrA (RR), and a cell-fate-switch module comprising the DivL pseudokinase that connects the compartment-sensing and differentiation modules. DivL activates the differentiation module when unbound (via CckA), but represses this module when bound to DivK∼P. (C) The domain organization of DivL in select α-proteobacteria that contain a putative DivK ortholog versus DivL domain organization in α-proteobacteria that do not contain a putative DivK ortholog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Brilli1">[19]</xref>. Based on comparative analysis, DivL(523–769) containing only the DHp-CA domains was selected as a minimal DivK interacting unit for crystallization trials.</p>

<p>In <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, the DivK phosphorylation state provides the basis for a regulatory switch that underlies divergent cell-fates upon cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Reisinger1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Iniesta1">[15]</xref>. This switch is achieved through the activity of the pseudokinase DivL, which activates the CckA-ChpT-CtrA phosphorelay pathway in the uncomplexed state and inhibits this phosphorelay when bound to DivK∼P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Tsokos1">[13]</xref>. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> work has shown that DivL has a binding preference for DivK∼P over unphosphorylated DivK, and genetic evidence suggests that the DivL-DivK∼P interaction leads to inhibition of the hybrid-HK CckA activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Tsokos1">[13]</xref>. Additionally, DivL appears to play a role in the regulation of CckA polar localization and autokinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Tsokos1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Iniesta2">[16]</xref>. Thus, DivL functions as a critical link that couples two distinct signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p> DivL has a predicted domain architecture that is typical of many HKs, consisting of multiple PAS domains fused to a C-terminal HK module that contains dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) and catalytic and ATP-binding (CA) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast to typical HKs, a conserved tyrosine (Tyr550) appears in place of the predicted phosphorylatable histidine throughout DivL homologs in α-proteobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Wu1">[17]</xref>, with the exception of the <italic>Magnetospirillum magneticum</italic> DivL that contains a non-phosphorylatable alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, DivL's essential functions <italic>in vivo</italic> do not require a phosphorylated DHp domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Reisinger1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Tsokos1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Iniesta2">[16]</xref>, and the CA domain is dispensable for activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Reisinger1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Christen1">[18]</xref>. Divergent α-proteobacteria that lack a DivK ortholog also frequently lack the catalytic domains (DHp-CA) of their DivL orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Brilli1">[19]</xref>. The co-evolution of DivK with the DHp-CA domains of DivL suggests that DivL and DivK may work together as a regulatory module within the cell-cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Brilli1">[19]</xref>. Despite the apparent connection between DivK and DivL in cell fate signaling, the molecular nature of the interaction between this unconventional HK-RR pair is poorly understood. To gain insight into this signaling system, we solved the crystal structure of the HK region of DivL at 2.5 Å resolution and interrogated the interaction between DivL and both DivK and DivK∼P. Our results show that <italic>Caulobacter</italic> has repurposed a conserved HK as a highly specific sensor module for a phosphorylated RR∼P.</p>

<title>DivL Binds Specifically to DivK∼P within the Core Cell-Cycle Signaling Circuit</title>
<p>Previous experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Tsokos1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Ohta1">[14]</xref>, and our results obtained from <italic>in vivo</italic> co-immunoprecipitation analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s001">Figure S1</xref>) all support an interaction between DivL and DivK. We employed a fluorescence polarization assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Mattison1">[20]</xref> to measure the binding affinities between DivL and DivK, as well as between DivK and other HKs in the compartment sensing signaling modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, PleC and DivJ) and the differentiation module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figures 1B</xref>, CckA and the ChpT histidine phosphotransfer protein, and 2). We fluorescently labeled DivK with a BODIPY dye and measured binding by mixing 10 µM of HK with 250 nM of labeled DivK or DivK∼P (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s001">S1</xref>, DivJ bound with similar affinity to both phosphorylated (K<sub>d</sub> = 16±3.2 µM) and unphosphorylated (K<sub>d</sub> = 8±2.1 µM) forms of DivK, whereas PleC preferentially bound to DivK∼P (K<sub>d</sub> = 2.4±0.9 µM) over DivK (K<sub>d</sub> = 26±30 µM). DivL(152–769) bound exclusively to DivK∼P with an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of 11±4.2 µM, and very limited binding to unphosphorylated DivK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s001">Figure S1</xref>). No binding of DivK to CckA or ChpT was observed regardless of the DivK phosphorylation state, even when the RR was present at concentrations as high as 100 µM. Thus, DivK or DivK∼P binds specifically to DivJ, PleC, and DivL with affinities within an order of magnitude of values reported for canonical HK-RR pairs (∼1 µM), while non-cognate pairs have binding affinities greater than ∼75 µM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Willett1">[21]</xref>. Thus, DivK impacts the CckA-ChpT-CtrA pathway without directly interacting with this set of signaling proteins.</p>

<title>Structure of DivL's HK region</title>
<p>To define the structural basis for the phosphorylation-dependent binding of DivK to DivL, we determined the crystal structure of DivL's HK region (residues 523–769, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g003">3</xref>) by the multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method using a gold derivative.

Asymmetric dimers were also observed in several recent HK structures (additional discussion included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s017">Text S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Wang1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Neiditch1">[29]</xref>. The dimer interface buries ∼3,900 Å<sup>2</sup> total surface area. Each DivL monomer (DivL-A and DivL-B) consists of a DHp domain with two helices, α1 and α2 (residue range 526–608; since the α1–α2 loop is disordered in the crystal structure we assigned the connectivity of the two DHp helices in each monomer as in other class I HKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Casino1">[23]</xref>), and a C-terminal CA domain with a highly conserved fold (residue range 609–758). The functionally important residue Tyr550 (colored in yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>) is located at the middle of the first DHp helix (α1).

<title>DivL Forms an Asymmetric Dimer</title>
<p>The CA domains of the DivL dimer are almost identical (RMSD of 0.64 Å for 144 C<sup>α</sup> atoms). However, the DHp domains display significant structural differences (RMSD of 3.4 Å for 80 Cα atoms), indicating that the DivL dimer is asymmetric. The conformational differences between two DivL monomers are best described as rigid-body movements of substructures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g003">Figure 3B–3D</xref>). Three rigid substructures can be identified in each monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), with each substructure representing a functional module. The largest substructure (residue range 591–758) consists of the CA domain and the “output helix,” which contains the C-terminal portion of α2 (α2C). The interface between α2C and CA is stabilized by clusters of highly conserved hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s003">Figure S3</xref>). A highly conserved CA domain and a very similar arrangement between α2C and CA can be identified in DivL, HK853, ThkA, and QseC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s003">Figure S3</xref>), suggesting that this structural arrangement is a conserved HK feature. The second substructure (“RR docking module”) consists of the C-terminal portion of α1 (α1C) and the N-terminal portion of α2 (α2N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g003">Figure 3B</xref>); the equivalent region in HK853 is involved in its cognate RR recognition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Casino1">[23]</xref>. The third substructure (“input helix”) consists of the first portion of α1 (α1N), which is connected to the N-terminal PAS sensor domains.</p>
<p>When two DivL monomers are superimposed about the RR docking module, the relative movements between the other two substructures become apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). The input helix in DivL-B is kinked more significantly around Tyr550 compared to DivL-A, resulting in a conformational change with respect to the Tyr550 side chain. This bending of the DHp helices is a common feature in many HKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Casino1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Wang1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Bick1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Mechaly1">[32]</xref>, due to the conserved residue Pro555 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Mechaly1">[32]</xref>. The “output helix+CA” module interacts and moves in tandem with the input helix, with a pivot point at the ATP binding site (proximal to Leu722). As a result, the bending of the input helix repositions the output+CA module with respect to the RR docking module, which may reflect HK conformational changes crucial for propagating long-range signals from the sensor domain to the catalytic domain or vise visa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s019">Movies S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s020">S2</xref> illustrates the “morphing” between the two DivL conformations) and illustrated as a cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g003">Figure 3D</xref>. The structural movements produce an additional contact interface between DHp and CA in DivL-A, resulting in an increase in the buried surface area (1,730 Å<sup>2</sup> total) compared to that of DivL-B (1,400 Å<sup>2</sup> total) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The asymmetry of the DivL dimer likely reflects some inherent conformational flexibility of DivL in solution, even though it could be induced by the crystal packing. The temperature factor (i.e., B-values) distribution supports the assertion that the DivL structure is highly flexible, save for the central four-helix bundle near Tyr550 where there is less conformational freedom (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<title>DivL Interacts with DivK∼P Via the RR Docking Interface</title>
<p>To build a computational model of the DivL-DivK∼P interaction, we compared the primary sequence of these proteins to the <italic>T. maritima</italic> HK-RR co-crystal structure of HK853-RR468 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Casino1">[23]</xref>. DivL's HK region shares 27% sequence identity with HK853, while DivK shares 36% sequence identity with RR468, the cognate RR for HK853. Strikingly, the surface of HK853 that directly interacts with RR468 is highly conserved in DivL, suggesting that the interaction between DivL and DivK is comparable to that observed between HK853 and RR468. Hence, we modeled a DivL-DivK∼P complex based on the HK853-RR468 co-complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g004">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s004">S4</xref>). The resulting model places complementary surfaces of DivL and DivK∼P together with favorable interactions, supporting the model's feasibility. In this model, Leu565 and Gly561of DivL interact with a hydrophobic patch on the DivK∼P surface formed by Leu17, Leu21, Pro106, and Ile107. Furthermore, Ala582 of DivL makes an additional hydrophobic contact with Leu13 of DivK∼P. Potential hydrogen bonds between DivL and DivK are also predicted, such as Tyr562OH with Leu13O and Leu17N, Arg553N1 and Ala84O, and His579Nε2 with Asp20Oδ2.</p>

<p>To interrogate the predicted interface, we introduced targeted mutations (R553A, T557N, Y562A, H579E, and Y550H) within DivL at the putative DivK∼P docking site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, highlighted in green) and measured the effect of each mutation on the DivL-DivK∼P interaction. Each mutant was selected based upon introducing a significant side-chain perturbation, with the exception of T557N, which was selected based upon the presence of Asn (N) at this position in the DivJ kinase sequence. Each of these mutant proteins was purified and subjected to gel-filtration, which indicated that each variant formed dimers in solution. Four mutations (R553A, T557N, Y562A, and H579E) resulted in significant loss of DivK∼P binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), with apparent dissociation constants measured to be 8–15-fold less than observed for wild-type DivL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s005">Figure S5</xref>), highlighting the importance of these residues for binding of DivK∼P to DivL and supporting the validity of the DivL-DivK∼P computational model. The Y550H substitution did not reduce the affinity of DivL for DivK∼P. Intriguingly, T557N did not improve DivL's binding affinity for unphosphorylated DivK and instead diminished affinity for both forms of DivK. This indicates that DivL may bind DivK in a slightly different manner than DivJ. We also did not discover any mutations within this binding surface that switched binding specificity from DivL-DivK∼P to DivL-DivK.</p>
<p>Due to the asymmetric nature of the DivL dimer, Tyr550 of the DivL-A subunit (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) is situated above the canonical phosphotransfer site (where the hydroxyl group may form hydrogen bond[s] with the phosphoryl group on Asp53 of DivK∼P), while in DivL-B (cyan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), both Tyr550 and the CA domain are displaced from the DivK active site (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This observation implies that conformational changes in DivL may impact affinity for DivK∼P. As a result, the asymmetric DivL dimer presents two different RR binding sites that share a common core surface but vary in the surface aspect involving Tyr550 and the ATP lid.</p>

<title>PAS Sensor Domains Enhance Binding Specificity towards DivK∼P</title>
<p>DivL exhibits extensive structural homology with the PAS-linked HK ThkA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Yamada1">[25]</xref>, and comparative analysis suggests that a conserved surface-exposed patch on the DivL CA domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s002">Figure S2</xref>) could participate in a similar PAS domain interaction as observed in the ThkA structure. Because a PAS-CA interaction potentially restricts CA domain movement, we analyzed binding of DivK to DivL in the presence and absence of one or more DivL PAS domains to determine whether they influence the interaction between DivK and DivL. For these studies, we constructed DivL mutants containing 3, 2, 1, or 0 PAS domains and measured DivL-DivK or DivL-DivK∼P binding for each construct as a function of DivL concentration (0–120 µM). To our surprise, removal of all DivL PAS domains almost completely eliminated specificity for DivK∼P: DivL containing three PAS domains (residues 152–769) was highly selective for DivK∼P (K<sub>d</sub> = 11 µM for DivK∼P and &gt;150 µM for DivK), whereas a DivL variant with no PAS domains (i.e., crystallization construct) bound phosphorylated and unphosphorylated DivK with similar affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 15 µM for DivK and 7 µM for DivK∼P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). DivL constructs containing three, and two PAS domains bind specifically to DivK∼P, while the 1-PAS domain DivL construct did not bind DivK∼P and may be less stable than other DivL constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These results indicate that DivL's PAS sensor domains play a critical role in DivK∼P selectivity.</p>

<p>Previously, a DivL mutant (A601L) was shown to disrupt the DivL-DivK∼P interaction and thereby leading to the upregulation of CckA kinase activity <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Tsokos1">[13]</xref>. Residue Ala601 lies at the interface between the input and output helices and away from the DivK∼P binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that the A601L mutation may impact DivL-DivK∼P binding through an allosteric effect rather than by modifying the docking site. Critically, this interface includes the C-terminal end of the DHp domain that has been shown to alter its structure by helical unwinding or bending to activate sensor kinases upon receiving a signal in the <italic>Bacillus subtillus</italic> HK KinA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Dago1">[33]</xref>. To determine whether the disruption of DivK∼P binding is due to perturbation of the RR module itself or of the arrangement of the PAS and CA domains with respect to the RR docking module, we evaluated the impact of A601L and a bona fide RR docking surface mutation (R553A) on DivK∼P binding to DivL that either contains or lacks PAS domains. We found that the R553A substitution disrupts DivK∼P binding regardless of whether the PAS domains are present. The DivL(A601L) variant binds DivK∼P and weakly to unphosphorylated DivK, but only when the PAS domains are deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The observed PAS-domain-sensitive DivK∼P binding to DivL(A601L) suggests that interdomain interactions influence the binding of DivK∼P to DivL and explains in part the requirement for the PAS domains in DivK∼P selectivity. Specifically, in the DivL-A conformation the output helix forms a three-helix bundle in association with the two input helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), whereas the output helix is isolated from the input domain in the DivL-B conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, modulations of interactions at the input-output helix interface likely alters the PAS and CA inter-domain arrangement with respect to the DivK∼P binding site.</p>

Structural analysis of the crystallized DivL conformation shows that both nucleotide-binding sites are either inaccessible or too small to accommodate ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Compared to other HKs, the DivL ATP lid mobility is more restricted since it is sandwiched between Tyr550 and the remainder of the CA domain. These results suggest that DivL has little intrinsic kinase activity compared to functional HK controls, which is consistent with our structural and nucleotide binding data.</p>

DivK∼P was generated by addition of His-DivJ, which was then purified by metal affinity chromatography. The remaining ATP in the DivK∼P reaction mixture was converted to ADP by incubation with hexokinase and glucose. DivK∼P phopho-aspartate stability was then compared over a 4 hour time frame in the presence of either PleC or DivL. We found that PleC reduced the DivK∼P half-life from 126 min to 8 min. However, the DivK∼P stability was increased in the presence of DivL (half-life &gt;700 min). Furthermore, restoration of a phosphorylatable histidine on DivL (DivL Y550H) has no impact on DivK∼P phosphostability. Therefore, we conclude that DivL does not function as a DivK∼P phosphatase.</p>

Consistent with previous reports, we observed stimulation of DivJ autokinase activity in the presence of DivK. In contrast, no DivL autophosphorylation was observed upon addition of DivK or DivK∼P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

<p>We expressed multiple <italic>divL-eyfp</italic> mutant alleles (Y550H, R553A, and A601L) grown in peptone yeast extract (PYE) media supplemented with xylose. Cell lengths were significantly longer in cells expressing Y550H, R553A, and A601L, while Y562A exhibited no obvious cell morphology defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Plating efficiency assays indicated growth defects ranging from very mild (Y562A) or moderate (Y550H) to severe in A601L cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, the R553A mutant was similar to Y550H on PYE plates with no xylose, but additional expression of the mutant by addition of xylose further inhibited the growth of the R553A mutant specifically, suggesting a dominant negative effect (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g007">Figures 7C</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s009">S9</xref>). Monitoring growth in liquid culture by optical density also revealed additional xylose induced expression of R553A was toxic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s009">Figure S9</xref>). In a mixed population of cells grown in minimal media, we observe that 42% of cells expressing DivL-eYFP exhibit an observable monopolar DivL population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s009">Figure S9</xref>), whereas only 20% of cells containing DivL-DivK∼P binding mutations (Y550H, R553A, and A601L) had an observable monopolar focus and the Y562A DivL mutant had a mild reduction (32%) in the proportion of cells with monopolar DivL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001979.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that two DivL-DivK∼P binding mutants, A601L and R553A, have severe impacts on cell fitness, while the Y562A mutation has a relatively mild effect even though DivK∼P binding is similarly affected by that substitution <italic>in vitro</italic>. Intriguingly, the strain containing the Y550H mutation exhibits clear growth and morphology defects despite the fact that DivK∼P binding to DivL is not disrupted in that background, suggesting that Y550H perturbs the activity of DivL in a distinct manner.</p>

<title>Transmitter Core Converted to a Sensory Module</title>
<p>Our structural and biochemical analysis showed that DivL lacks both kinase and phosphatase activity but still retains its ability to dimerize and bind DivK∼P specifically. The DivL mutant Y550H supports viability but impacts cell morphology, doubling time, and the subcellular localization of DivL. These defects suggest that the replacement of histidine by tyrosine is critical for optimal DivL function. We observed that DivL Y550H bound to DivK∼P with similar affinity as the wild type, indicating that the tyrosine substitution neither enhances nor diminishes DivK∼P binding. The Y550H mutation did not rescue autonomous autokinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, DivL(Y550H) autokinase activity can be stimulated by DivK∼P in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, the H to Y substitution in DivL does not perturb HK-RR binding but abrogates kinase activity. From these studies, we propose that the DivL pseudokinase has repurposed its catalytic HK fold to function primarily as a sensory module for a phosphorylated RR. Loss of catalytic function ensures orthogonal sensor function while preventing unwanted signal modification (i.e., inter-conversion of DivK and DivK∼P) that would compromise asymmetric cell division.</p>

<title>A Role for Histidine Kinase PAS Domains in Phosphospecific RR Recognition</title>
<p>Previous studies of two-component systems have highlighted the critical role of the RR docking module in determining HK-RR phosphotransfer specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Willett1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Weigt1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Blair1">[45]</xref>. Consistent with these studies, we identified four point mutations within the RR docking module that disrupt DivK∼P binding to DivL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, our results support the notion that DivL binds DivK∼P in a conserved manner similar to a canonical HK-RR pair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Casino1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Weigt1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Skerker1">[44]</xref>. However, a key question remains: how does DivL specifically recognize DivK∼P? The tyrosine or histidine side chain at position 550 could contribute to the specific recognition of the phosphoryl group on DivK directly, by forming a hydrogen bond. However, we do note that Y550F has been previously shown to specifically bind phosphorylated DivK over unphosphorylated DivK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Tsokos1">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, the DivL RR docking surface, which includes Tyr550, may be tuned to specifically recognize structural changes in DivK that are induced by phosphorylation. Here, we observed that the PAS sensor domain plays an unexpected role in phosphospecific discrimination of DivK∼P over DivK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g005">Figure 5</xref>). One possible role of the PAS sensor domain could be to directly sterically block unphosphorylated DivK binding while permitting DivK∼P binding, or perhaps more likely the DivL PAS domains could indirectly reconfigure the DivK binding site to promote phosphospecific binding. The PAS domain's role in phosphospecific RR binding is consistent with the finding that optimal WalK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Gutu1">[46]</xref> and ThkA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Yamada1">[25]</xref> phosphatase activity requires a PAS module. More generally, it appears that PAS sensor domains may regulate kinase/phosphatase activity by influencing the phosphospecific binding preference of an HK for its cognate RR.</p>

<title>Models for the DivL Cell-Fate Switch</title>
<p>Several recent biochemical studies of HKs have revealed that HKs transmit signaling information over a long-range through large-scale conformational changes in order to regulate activity. DHp conformational rearrangements, such as “twisting” (cogwheeling or rotation) and “bending” (kinking), can produce unique functional states that are crucial for HK regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Marina1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Wang1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Diensthuber1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Mechaly1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Wang2">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Lin1">[50]</xref>. Our rigid-body structural analysis of DivL suggests that interhelical bending could alter the relative position of domains that regulate DivL function. Indeed, our binding studies indicate that a mutation at the interface between two rigid bodies (A601L), disrupts DivK∼P binding in a PAS-domain-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, the A601L mutation causes a more severe phenotype than does the direct RR docking mutation Y562A. This suggests that A601L may be pleiotropic, perhaps simultaneously affecting upstream (i.e., DivK∼P binding) and downstream events (i.e., CckA inhibition). Residue Arg553 may also serve a switch-like role triggering conformational changes upon DivK∼P binding by interacting with DivK∼P in the complexed state, and in the uncomplexed state interacting with the output-helix residue Asp595 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, this model may explain why A601L and R553A have stronger impacts on cell fitness than the Y562A variant. Additionally, DivK∼P-dependent rescue of DivL autokinase activity in the presence of Y550H suggests that DivK∼P binding triggers conformational changes in DivL that are necessary for ATP binding and autokinase activity.</p>
<p>Thus, we propose a model in which the interaction between Tyr550 and the phosphorylation site of DivK∼P induces bending in the α1 helix of DHp, which is then propagated to the rest of the structure via rigid-body movements. As a result of the conformational change, the CA and PAS domains of DivL may re-position to allow formation of additional contacts with bound DivK∼P. In the absence of catalytic functions, we suggest that DivL exploits the underlying large-scale conformational re-arrangements of the HK-fold to function as a DivK∼P-modulated two-state molecular switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Asymmetric dimers have been proposed to represent important activation intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Wang1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Neiditch1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Eaton1">[51]</xref>, and it is conceivable that DivL undergoes a symmetric-asymmetric conformational switch upon DivK∼P binding. However, the mechanism by which DivK∼P-dependent conformational changes in DivL impact the CckA-ChpT-CtrA phosphorelay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Reisinger1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Tsokos1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Iniesta1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Iniesta3">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Pierce1">[52]</xref> remains unclear. It is plausible that DivL interacts directly or indirectly with CckA in the multi-protein polar complex, thus allowing the structural changes in DivL induced by DivK∼P to propagate to changes in CckA activity. Future experiments will focus on dissecting DivL's essential regulation of the CckA-ChpT-CtrA pathway.</p>

<title>Model for a repurposed pseudokinase that functions as a sensor for a phosphorylated RR.</title>
<p>In conventional two-component signaling systems, an HK receives a signal in the sensor region and ultimately promotes phosphorylation of a response regulator. In contrast, DivL repurposes its RR docking surface and canonical output domain as a sensory module for DivK∼P. Upon binding DivK∼P, DivL causes the repression of the CtrA differentiation pathway, potentially through conformational remodeling of the DivL PAS sensor domains.</p>

<title>Broadening the Wiring Possibilities of Two-Component Systems</title>
<p>A common bacterial signaling strategy is to wire two-component systems as simple orthogonal linear signaling arrays to limit cross-talk and maintain the integrity of signaling information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Capra1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Skerker1">[44]</xref>. Phosphorelay pathways offer a way to branch signaling pathways in order to enable multiple signaling inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Zapf1">[30]</xref> or outputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Blair1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Biondi1">[53]</xref>. Signaling directionality in the two-component systems from a kinase to a response regulator apparently limits bacterial signal processing capacity relative to more complex eukaryotic systems. Here, we demonstrated an exception to this paradigm in which loss of HK catalytic activity repurposes an output module as a phosphospecific RR input sensor, thereby reversing the flow of information observed in conventional HK-RR systems. This reversal allows DivL to couple two distinct signaling pathways by serving as an “output” for a compartment sensing pathway and an “input” for the differentiation phosphorelay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001979-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The extent to which nature utilizes this reversed signaling warrants further investigation. For example, it could allow transmission cytosolic stress signals to the periplasm via membrane-bound HKs. The presence of pseudokinases in two-component signaling systems therefore offers a general mechanism for coupling signaling pathways, reminiscent of complex eukaryotic signaling networks.</p>

Proteins were mixed in kinase buffer supplemented with 1 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mM NADH, 2 units of pyruvate kinase, and 6.6 units of lactate dehydrogenase. Reactions were performed in triplicate in 200 µl volumes and loaded into a clear, polystyrene 96-well plate. Reactions were initiated by the addition of protein, and absorbance at 340 nm was recorded every 10 seconds for a 30 minute period. The slope of a stable linear absorbance decay was measured to calculate ATP hydrolysis rates, using a NADH Kpath value of 3,248 OD M<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001979-Kiianitsa1">[63]</xref>. Background rates of ATP hydrolysis and NADH oxidation were measured and subtracted from observed ATP hydrolysis rates of all DivL constructs.</p>

<title>Autophosphorylation Reactions</title>
<p>CckA(70–691) and DivL(152–769) constructs at 5 µM were incubated for one hour at room temperature in kinase buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM ATP, 0.167 µCi/µl [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in a total reaction volume of 50 µl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, then loaded onto 12% Tris-HCl gels for electrophoresis. The radioactivity in wet gels was recorded on phosphor storage plate for 3 h, and then imaged on a Typhoon fluorescence imager (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitation of band intensities was measured using ImageJ and band intensities for three individual experiments were averaged. The mean intensity and standard deviation were plotted using Prism 6 software (GraphPad).</p>

<title>DivK∼P Dephosphorylation Assays</title>
<p>For DivK∼P phosphatase assays, DivK was incubated with 250 nM His-DivJ, 1 mM ATP, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> on Ni-NTA agarose resin for 40 min. DivK∼P was eluted and purified away from His-DivJ, followed by a second round of Ni-NTA purification. Purified DivK∼P was then incubated with excess hexokinase and glucose for 10 minutes to convert remaining ATP into ADP. Purified DivK∼P was then incubated with either PleC, DivL(152–769), or DivL(152–769) Y550H for varying amounts of time. Reactions were quenched with 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Gels were processed as described above in the autophosphorylation section. The mean intensity and standard deviation from three independent experiments were plotted using Prism 6 software (GraphPad).</p>

Solutions of DivL(523–769), DivL(523–769) Y550A, CckA (70–691) H322A, ChpT, and BSA at 10 µM protein concentration was mixed with 27.5 fmol of [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP in kinase buffer at room temperature. Empirically, we found a 30-minute period allowed adequate time for equilibration, while minimizing hydrolysis and release of ATP. Solutions were passed over a nitrocellulose membrane filter and washed three times with 1 ml of kinase buffer. Bradford assays indicated &gt;95% of protein remained bound to the nitrocellulose. Subsequently, nitrocellulose filters were submerged into scintillation fluid and scintillation counted to quantify bound [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP. [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP standard solutions were used to determine the specific activity and convert scintillation counts in fmol bound to the nitrocellulose. [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP only solutions were passed through nitrocellulose membranes to quantify non-specific binding.</p>

<title>Growth and Morphology Assays of DivL-DivK Binding Mutants</title>
<p> Each of the pXYFPC-<italic>divL</italic> mutant strains were transformed into <italic>Caulobacter</italic> NA1000 strain AA871 that is ΔdivL vanA::<italic>divL</italic>. In these strains the impact of <italic>divL</italic> mutant expression was evaluated by removal of vanillate from media to deplete wild-type <italic>divL</italic> from cells, and addition of xylose to express <italic>divL-yfp</italic> mutants. Mutant <italic>divL</italic> genes were examined in a strain where the native copy of <italic>divL</italic> was deleted, the WT <italic>divL</italic> placed under vanillate induction at the <italic>vanA</italic> locus, and a mutant <italic>divL-yfp</italic> was placed at the xylose-inducible <italic>xylX</italic> locus of the chromosome. Cells were grown for 24 h in PYE containing no vanillate and no xylose. Cells were then diluted in fresh, xylose-containing media to optical density at 600 nm (OD-600) of 0.02 (diluted to approximately 0.06 for efficiency of plating assays). The cells were then allowed to grow for several hours in the xylose until either being plated or imaged. For efficiency of plating assays, cells grew for either 0 or 6 hours after addition of xylose. Cells were spotted on PYE-agar plates in 3 µl volumes. The first, leftmost spot was spotted from the 0.06 OD-600 culture, and subsequent dilutions were made serially in 5-fold steps. The xylose content of the plates was varied from 0 to 0.3% w/v, and cells were plated from liquid media containing an equal amount of xylose. The plates were then grown at 28°C for 2 days and subsequently imaged. For liquid culture growth curves, we measured the OD-600 every 1–2 hours for 10 hours or until the culture reached saturation.</p>

Cell suspensions were then dried onto agarose pads (1.5% agarose in M2G) and imaged on a Leica DM 6000 B microscope with a HCX PL APO 100°—/1.40 Oil PH3 CS objective, Hamamatsu EM-CCD 15 C9100 camera and Metamorph (Molecular Devices). Both phase-contrast and fluorescence images were recorded. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop, and quantitative analysis of images was performed using ImageJ's cell-counter. For morphology assays, the cells were grown overnight in PYE and switched into fresh PYE with xylose. After 6 hours of xylose induction, cells were placed on a PYE-agar pad for imaging.
