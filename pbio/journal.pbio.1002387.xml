<abstract>
<p>The cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is initiated by the MRX/MRN complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 in yeast; Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 in mammals), which recruits the checkpoint kinase Tel1/ATM to DSBs. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the role of Tel1 at DSBs remains enigmatic, as <italic>tel1</italic>Œî cells do not show obvious hypersensitivity to DSB-inducing agents. By performing a synthetic phenotype screen, we isolated a <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> allele that sensitizes <italic>tel1</italic>Œî cells to genotoxic agents. The MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X complex associates poorly to DNA ends, and its retention at DSBs is further reduced by the lack of Tel1. As a consequence, <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells are severely defective both in keeping the DSB ends tethered to each other and in repairing a DSB by either homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). These data indicate that Tel1 promotes MRX retention to DSBs and this function is important to allow proper MRX-DNA binding that is needed for end-tethering and DSB repair. The role of Tel1 in promoting MRX accumulation to DSBs is counteracted by Rif2, which is recruited to DSBs. We also found that Rif2 enhances ATP hydrolysis by MRX and attenuates MRX function in end-tethering, suggesting that Rif2 can regulate MRX activity at DSBs by modulating ATP-dependent conformational changes of Rad50.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many tumors contain mutations that confer defects in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In both yeast and mammals, the MRX/MRN complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 in yeast; Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 in mammals) plays critical functions in repairing a DSB by either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). Furthermore, it recruits the checkpoint kinase Tel1/ATM. Although ATM is considered to be a tumor suppressor, up-regulation of ATM signaling promotes chemoresistance, radioresistance and metastasis. For this reason, cancer therapies targeting ATM have been developed to increase the effectiveness of standard genotoxic treatments and/or to set up synthetic lethal approaches in cancers with DNA repair defects. We aimed to identify the precise role of ATM/Tel1 in these processes. By performing a synthetic phenotype screen, we identified a mutation (<italic>rad50-V1269M</italic>) altering the Rad50 subunit of the MRX complex, which sensitizes cells lacking Tel1 to genotoxic agents. Genetic and biochemical characterization of MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X protein complex revealed that Tel1 promotes MRX association at DSBs to allow proper MRX-DNA binding that is needed for DSB repair. The role of Tel1 in promoting MRX retention on DSBs is counteracted by Rif2, which can regulate MRX activity at DSBs by modulating ATP-dependent conformational changes in Rad50. Our finding that MRX dysfunctions can be synthetically lethal with Tel1 loss in the presence of genotoxic agents suggests that ATM inhibitors could be beneficial in patients whose tumors have defective MRN functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most cytotoxic DNA lesions, because failure to repair them can lead to genome instability. DSBs can be repaired by either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). While NHEJ directly ligates the DNA ends, HR requires the 5‚Ä≤ ends of a DSB to be nucleolytically processed (resected) to generate 3‚Ä≤ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails that initiate HR by invading an undamaged homologous DNA template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Generation of DSBs activates a DNA damage response (DDR), which regulates DSB repair and coordinates it with cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref002">2</xref>]. In both yeast and mammals, the DDR is initiated by the MRX/MRN complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 in yeast; Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 in mammals), which recognizes unprocessed DSBs and activates the checkpoint kinase Tel1/ATM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref003">3</xref>]. MRX/MRN recruits Tel1/ATM to the DSB ends through its interaction with the C-terminal domain of Xrs2/Nbs1 and stimulates Tel1/ATM catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref004">4</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>MRX/MRN also plays critical functions in DSB resection and in maintaining the DSB ends tethered to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref009">9</xref>]. Several studies have shown that the MRX complex consists of a globular head domain from which the long coiled-coil domain of Rad50 protrudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref010">10</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref013">13</xref>]. The coiled-coil apex contains a CXXC amino acid motif that can dimerize via tetrahedral coordination of a zinc ion, thereby forming molecular bridges for keeping the DNA ends tethered to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref015">15</xref>]. Mre11 is active as an exo- and endonuclease in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref016">16</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref019">19</xref>] and initiates DSB resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref020">20</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref024">24</xref>]. The functions of MRX in end-tethering and DSB resection are regulated by Rad50, whose ATP binding and hydrolysis activities result in MRX conformational changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref025">25</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref028">28</xref>]. Mutants that promote the ATP-bound conformation of Rad50 exhibit a higher level of tethering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref029">29</xref>], indicating that end-tethering depends on this MRX conformation. In turn, the ATP-bound conformation sterically blocks the Mre11 nuclease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref029">29</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref032">32</xref>], whereas release from this ATP-bound state that occurs with ATP hydrolysis opens Mre11 nuclease active sites so that they can be engaged in DSB resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref013">13</xref>]. Thus, ATP hydrolysis triggers a switch between a closed state, in which Mre11 nuclease domain is occluded, to an open configuration with exposed Mre11 nuclease sites.</p>
<p>In addition to its role in DSB repair, MRX works in the same epistasis group of Tel1 to maintain telomere length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref034">34</xref>]. Interestingly, the lack of Tel1 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells causes telomere shortening and a decrease of MRX binding at DNA ends flanked by telomeric DNA repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref036">36</xref>]. On the other hand, telomere length is negatively regulated by Rif2, which is recruited to telomeric DNA ends by Rap1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref037">37</xref>]. Artificial tethering of Rif2 at DNA ends reduces the amount of telomere-bound Tel1, but not that of MRX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>]. This observation, together with the finding that Rif2 appears to compete with Tel1 for binding to the C-terminus of Xrs2 in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>], suggests that Rif2 interferes with MRX-Tel1 interaction to shelter telomeric ends from Tel1 recognition.</p>
<p>Although Tel1 is recruited to DSBs and participates in DSB end resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref038">38</xref>], its function in DSB repair remains enigmatic because Tel1-deficient <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells do not show obvious hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents and are not defective in checkpoint activation in response to a single DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref038">38</xref>]. To better understand the function of Tel1 in the cellular response to DSBs, we performed a genetic screen aimed at identifying mutants that require Tel1 to survive to genotoxic treatments. We found that the <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> allele makes <italic>tel1</italic>Œî cells hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. The MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X complex associates poorly to a DSB and the lack of Tel1 further reduces its retention at DSB ends. As a consequence, <italic>rad50-V1269M tel1</italic>Œî cells are severely defective in maintaining the DSB ends tethered to each other. These findings indicate that Tel1 promotes proper MRX association to DNA ends, and this function is required to support the end-tethering activity of MRX. The Tel1 function in promoting MRX retention to DSBs is counteracted by Rif2, which is recruited to DSB ends. Rif2 also enhances MRX ATPase activity and attenuates MRX function in end-tethering, suggesting that it modulates MRX function not only by inhibiting MRX association to DSBs but also by regulating ATP-dependent Rad50 conformational changes.</p>

<title><italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> Cells Require Tel1 for DNA Damage Resistance</title>
<p>To gain insights into the role of Tel1 at DSBs, we searched for mutations that caused hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents only in the absence of Tel1. For this purpose, <italic>tel1</italic>Œî clones were screened for decreased viability in the presence of camptothecin (CPT) and/or phleomycin. Hypersensitive <italic>tel1</italic>Œî clones that lost the DNA damage hypersensitivity after transformation with a plasmid containing wild-type <italic>TEL1</italic> were crossed to a wild-type strain followed by sporulation and tetrad analysis to verify that the DNA damage hypersensitivity was due to the combination of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî with a mutation in an unknown single gene. This procedure allowed us to identify five single-gene mutations belonging to three distinct allelism groups. Genome sequencing of the clone that showed the most severe synthetic phenotype and subsequent genetic analyses established that the mutation responsible for the DNA damage hypersensitivity of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî cells was a single nucleotide change in the <italic>RAD50</italic> gene, resulting in substitution of valine 1269 with methionine in the C-terminal ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Both <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic>Œî single mutant cells were as sensitive as wild type to phleomycin, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and low CPT doses, while the sensitivity to the same drugs was greatly increased in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating that the Rad50-V1269M variant requires Tel1 to support cell viability in the presence of genotoxic stress.</p>
<p>As Tel1 is a protein kinase, we asked whether the <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> allele also exacerbated the sensitivity to DNA damaging agents of cells expressing a Tel1 mutant variant (Tel1-kd) carrying G2611D, D2612A, N2616K, and D2631E amino acid substitutions that abolished Tel1 kinase activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref039">39</xref>]. Telomeres in <italic>tel1-kd</italic> cells are shorter than in wild-type cells and indistinguishable from those of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref039">39</xref>], indicating that these mutations abolish Tel1 function at telomeres. Surprisingly, the viability of <italic>tel1-kd rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells in the presence of DNA damaging agents was similar to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), suggesting that Rad50-V1269M mutant variant requires the presence of Tel1 but not its kinase activity to support cell viability in the presence of genotoxic stress.</p>

The V1269M mutation is very closed to the H-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), whose histidine residue has been proposed to promote ATP hydrolysis by positioning the first water molecule needed for the reaction and/or by forming a catalytic dyad with the Walker B glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref040">40</xref>]. Thus, we asked whether and how the <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> mutation affects MRX ATPase and/or DNA-binding activities. The Rad50 and the Rad50-V1269M proteins were purified to near homogeneity by following our published procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref018">18</xref>]. Purified Rad50 and Rad50-V1269M were then individually incubated with Mre11 and Xrs2, and the fully assembled complexes were separated from free proteins by gel filtration. Rad50-V1269M could be expressed to the same level as the wild-type protein, behaved well chromatographically, and yielded the same amount of trimeric complex with Mre11 and Xrs2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, the stoichiometry of the three components in the MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X mutant complex was very similar to that of the wild-type MRX complex.</p>

<p>As we reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref041">41</xref>], Rad50 hydrolyzed ATP only within the context of the MRX complex. The MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X mutant complex exhibited a reduced ATPase activity compared to wild-type MRX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), indicating that the <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> mutation affects ATP hydrolysis.</p>
<p>Aside from Xrs2 and Mre11, Rad50 also binds DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref041">41</xref>], and we found that Rad50-V1269M is compromised for DNA binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Subsequently, we examined DNA binding by MRX wild-type and MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X mutant complexes and noticed insignificant difference between the two complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). We note that the DNA binding deficiency of the Rad50-V1269M mutant may be masked by the DNA binding attribute of Mre11 and Xrs2 within the MRX complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>We next analyzed DSB association of Rad50-V1269M and MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). To generate a single DSB at a specific chromosomal locus, we used a strain expressing a galactose-inducible HO endonuclease. In this strain, induction of HO by galactose addition leads to the generation at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus of a single DSB that cannot be repaired by HR because the strain carries the deletion of the homologous donor loci <italic>HML</italic>Œ± and <italic>HMR</italic>a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref042">42</xref>]. Consistent with the finding that the Rad50-V1269M mutant variant is compromised in DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), the amount of Rad50-V1269M bound at the HO-induced DSB was lower than that of wild-type Rad50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Furthermore, although binding to DNA of the MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X mutant complex was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), the amount of Mre11 associated to the HO-induced DSB was significantly lower in <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This decreased Rad50-V1269M and MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X association to the DSB is not due to reduced protein levels or altered MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X complex formation. In fact, protein extracts from wild-type and <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells contained very similar amounts of Rad50, Rad50-V1269M, and Mre11 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Furthermore, equal amount of Rad50-V1269M and Rad50 could be immunoprecipitated with the Mre11 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). As MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X binding to DNA was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), these data indicate that the <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> mutation impairs MRX retention to DSBs.</p>

<p>Recent data indicate that MRX in the ATP-bound state promotes end-tethering, whereas ATP hydrolysis opens the MRX conformation to promote Mre11 nuclease activity and DSB resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref029">29</xref>]. As MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X exhibits reduced ATPase activity and MRX variants impaired in ATP hydrolysis are endonuclease-defective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref047">47</xref>], we asked whether <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells were defective in DSB resection. To monitor directly the generation of ssDNA at the DSB ends, we used strains expressing a galactose-inducible HO endonuclease, which generates at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus a single irreparable DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref042">42</xref>]. Resection of the HO-induced DSB renders the DNA sequence flanking the HO break resistant to cleavage by restriction enzymes, resulting in the appearance of resection intermediates that can be detected by Southern blot analysis with a probe that anneals to the 3‚Ä≤ end at one side of the break. Because resection was much slower in cells arrested in G2/M than in replicating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref048">48</xref>], HO was induced by galactose addition to cell cultures that were arrested in G2 with nocodazole and kept blocked in G2 by nocodazole treatment to detect even subtle differences in resection efficiency. Consistent with MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X deficiencies in ATP hydrolysis and DNA binding, <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> mutant cells showed a slight defect in DSB resection compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Importantly, the lack of <italic>TEL1</italic>, which caused per se a slight delay in DSB resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref038">38</xref>], did not reduce further the resection efficiency of <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells, as <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells resected the DSB with similar kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

<title>The Lack of Tel1 Impairs MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X Function in End-Tethering</title>
<p>MRX function in end-tethering is largely dependent on Rad50 coiled-coil domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref014">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, structural studies suggest that also DNA binding of the globular domain is important for end-tethering, possibly because it increases intercomplex hook-hook dimer formation by causing the Rad50 coils to become more rigid and parallel to one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref012">12</xref>]. As the MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X mutant complex was poorly recruited to the DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), we asked whether <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells were defective in keeping the DSB ends tethered to each other. To detect the association of broken DNA ends, we used a yeast strain where the DNA proximal to an irreparable HO-induced DSB can be visualized by binding of a LacI-GFP fusion protein to multiple repeats of the LacI repressor binding site (LacO) that are integrated on both sides of the HO cleavage site on chromosome VII at a distance of 50 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref043">43</xref>]. HO was induced by galactose addition to cell cultures that were arrested in G2 with nocodazole and kept blocked in G2 by nocodazole treatment in order to ensure that all cells would arrest in metaphase. The majority of wild-type cells showed a single LacI-GFP focus both before and after HO induction, indicating their ability to hold the broken DNA ends together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref045">45</xref>], <italic>tel1</italic>Œî cells showed a slight increase of two LacI-GFP spots at 1‚Äì3 h after HO induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). An increase of two LacI-GFP spots compared to the uninduced condition could be detected also in <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Strikingly, the number of cells showing two LacI-GFP spots after HO induction was greatly increased in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells compared to each single mutant, reaching a percentage similar to that observed in <italic>mre11</italic>Œî cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>The MRX complex has been implicated in sister chromatid cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref050">50</xref>], prompting us to evaluate whether the increase frequency of two LacI-GFP foci after HO induction in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells was due to end-tethering and/or cohesion defects. We therefore induced HO expression in Œ±-factor-arrested cells that were kept arrested in G1 by Œ±-factor in the presence of galactose. About 50% of G1-arrested <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells showed two LacI-GFP foci 1 h after HO induction similarly to <italic>mre11</italic>Œî cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4G</xref>), indicating that the appearance of two LacI-GFP foci in these cells is primarily due to defective end-tethering.</p>
<p>We also monitored the ability of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî, <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic>, and <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells to maintain cohesion between sister chromatids by determining formation of LacI-GFP foci in nocodazole-arrested cells in the absence of HO induction. Under these conditions, the amount of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî and <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells showing two LacI-GFP foci was similar to that found in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4H</xref>), indicating that cohesion is not affected by either the lack of Tel1 or the presence of Rad50-V129M variant. By contrast, a slight cohesion defect was detectable in nocodazole-arrested <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells, which showed a ~5% increase of two LacI-GFP foci compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the ability of the above strains to held together the DSB ends was determined by using target sequences integrated at a distance of 50 kb from the DSB, we also monitored end-tethering by using a strain expressing LacI-YFP and TetR-RFP fusion proteins, which bind LacO and TetO tandem arrays, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref051">51</xref>]. These arrays are integrated at a distance of 7 kb from the DSB that is generated by the endonuclease HO on chromosome III, with each kind of array marking one specific side of the break. The frequency of cells showing separated LacI-YFP and TetR-RFP foci dramatically increased after HO induction in G2-arrested <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g004">Fig 4I</xref>), confirming that <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells are defective in end-tethering. Thus, the absence of Tel1 severely reduces the end-tethering activity of MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X, indicating a role for Tel1 in supporting this MRX function.</p>

<title>The Lack of Tel1 Impairs MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X Function in DSB Repair by HR</title>
<p>The maintenance of the DSB ends tethered to each other is a relevant event in the repair of a DSB by both NHEJ and HR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref052">52</xref>]. Thus, we asked whether <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells were defective in HR and/or NHEJ. Among the HR pathways, single-strand annealing (SSA) is devoted to repair a DSB that is flanked by direct repeats and requires resection of the DSB ends followed by Rad52-dependent annealing of the resulting complementary ssDNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref053">53</xref>]. To investigate possible HR defects, we first monitored the ability of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells to repair a DSB by SSA. To this end, we used a strain carrying a galactose-inducible <italic>GAL-HO</italic> construct, as well as tandem repeats of the <italic>LEU2</italic> gene, with a recognition site for the HO endonuclease adjacent to one of the repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002387.s002">S1A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref054">54</xref>]. Galactose was added to G2-arrested cells to induce HO production and it was maintained in the medium so that continuously produced HO could re-cleave the HO sites eventually reconstituted by NHEJ. When kinetics of DSB repair was monitored by Southern blot analysis with a <italic>LEU2</italic> probe, accumulation of the 8 kb SSA repair product was slightly delayed in both <italic>tel1</italic>Œî and <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> single mutants, whereas it was severely defective in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002387.s002">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>).

<p>Because SSA repair pathway does not involve strand invasion and therefore does not require the recombination protein Rad51 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002387.s002">S1D Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref055">55</xref>], we also monitored the HR events that depend on the Rad51-dependent invasion and pairing of broken DNA ends with intact homologous sequences present on a sister chromatid or at an ectopic location in the genome. In the major HR pathway, the 3‚Ä≤-ended ssDNA tail invades an intact duplex homologous, creating a loop structure (D-loop) consisting of a region of heteroduplex DNA and displaced ssDNA. If this ssDNA anneals with the complementary sequence on the other side of the DSB (second end capture), subsequent extension and ligation result in the formation of a double Holliday junction intermediate, whose random cleavage yield an equal number of noncrossover (NCO) and crossover (CO) products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref053">53</xref>]. Alternatively, if the newly synthesized strand is displaced, it can anneal with the 3‚Ä≤ ssDNA end at the other end of the DSB. This event leads to the generation of NCO products in a process called synthesis-dependent strand-annealing (SDSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref056">56</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>To monitor CO and NCO formation, we used haploid strains that bear two copies of the <italic>MAT</italic>a sequence. A <italic>MAT</italic>a gene introduced in chromosome V can be cleaved by a galactose-inducible HO endonuclease and repaired by Rad51-dependent HR using a uncleavable <italic>MAT</italic>a donor on chromosome III that contains a single base pair substitution preventing HO cleavage (<italic>MAT</italic>a<italic>-inc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref059">59</xref>]. This repair event can lead to NCO and CO outcomes, with the proportion of COs being ~5% among the overall repair events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref059">59</xref>]. Galactose was added to induce HO production and then it was maintained in the medium to cleave the HO sites that were eventually reconstituted by NHEJ-mediated DSB repair. The 3 kb <italic>MAT</italic>a band resulting from NCO recombination events re-accumulated less efficiently in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells compared to both <italic>tel1</italic>Œî and <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> single mutant cells, which generated NCO products similar to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). Interestingly, while <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells showed decreased amount of NCOs compared to wild-type cells, the percentage of COs in the same cells was similar to that observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). As most of the NCO products are generated by the SDSA mechanism, this finding suggests that <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells are specifically defective in SDSA.</p>

<p>Because SDSA is thought to be the main mechanism responsible for mating type switching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref060">60</xref>], we investigated the ability of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells to switch the mating type.

<title>The Lack of Tel1 Impairs MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X Function in DSB Repair by NHEJ</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells were defective in NHEJ. To this purpose, we used the strains previously used to monitor DSB repair by SSA. HO expression was induced for 30 min by galactose addition and was then rapidly shut off by the addition of glucose to allow NHEJ-mediated repair of the DSB. To ensure that repair of the HO-induced DSB occurred mainly by NHEJ, HO was induced in G1-arrested cells that were kept arrested in G1 with Œ±-factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In fact, the low Cdk1 activity in G1 cells prevents resection of the HO-induced DSB and therefore its repair by SSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref062">62</xref>]. NHEJ-mediated DSB repair was severely affected in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells. In fact, the 14.5 kb uncut band resulting from NHEJ-mediated ligation of the DSB ends failed to re-accumulate in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>), which also showed the expected decrease of both the 2.5 and 12 kb HO-cut band signals due to DSB repair by NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Some defective re-accumulation of the 14.5 kb uncut band could be detected also in both <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic>Œî single mutant cells, although this defect was much less severe compared to that observed in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm the NHEJ defect, we used the <italic>GAL-HO</italic> strain, where HO induction by galactose addition generates a DSB at the <italic>MAT</italic>a locus. This strain lacks the homologous donor sequences <italic>HML</italic>Œ± and <italic>HMR</italic>a and therefore can repair the HO-induced DSB only by NHEJ. HO expression was induced for 30 min by galactose addition to G1-arrested cells and then shut off by glucose addition to allow DSB repair by NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). The <italic>MAT</italic>a sequence resulting from NHEJ repair events re-accumulated in wild-type cells but not in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), thus confirming a severe NHEJ defect.</p>
<p>Finally, we measured NHEJ efficiency also as the ability of the above cells to re-ligate a plasmid that was linearized before being transformed into the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref063">63</xref>]. Both <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic>Œî mutants showed only a slight reduction in the efficiency of plasmid re-ligation compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). By contrast, the re-ligation efficiency in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells dramatically decreased to a level similar to that found in <italic>dnl4</italic>Œî cells that lack the NHEJ enzyme responsible for DSB end ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Thus, DSB repair by NHEJ, which is only slightly affected by the lack of Tel1 or the presence of the Rad50-V1269M mutant variant, is lost in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells, indicating that Tel1 supports MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X function also in NHEJ.</p>

<title>Tel1 Promotes MRX Association to DNA Ends</title>
<p>A structural study has proposed that DNA tethering requires proper binding to DNA of the MRX globular domain to induce intercomplex hook-hook dimer formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref012">12</xref>]. The finding that the lack of Tel1 exacerbates the end-tethering defects of <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells raises the possibility that Tel1 supports MRX function in DNA tethering by promoting proper MRX association to damaged DNA. It has been previously shown that the lack of Tel1 decreases Mre11 binding at DNA ends flanked by telomeric DNA repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref036">36</xref>], whereas only a slight reduction of Mre11 association, if any, can be detected in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî cells at 1 kb from an HO-induced DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>]. However, since only a limited amount of MRX is bound at this distance from the DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>], we analyzed Rad50 and Mre11 association at 0.6 kb from the DSB, where Mre11 is strongly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The amount of Rad50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and Mre11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) bound at the HO-induced DSB ends was lower in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî cells than in wild-type cells, indicating that Tel1 promotes MRX association to DSBs. Consistent with the finding that the lack of Tel1 kinase activity did not exacerbate the DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), the association of Rad50 and Mre11 to DSBs was not affected in <italic>tel1-kd</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). The lack of Tel1 also reduced the association to the DSB of Rad50-V1269M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) and Mre11 in <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). The decreased DSB association of Rad50, Rad50-V1269M and Mre11 in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî compared to wild type was not due to reduced protein levels, as similar amounts of Rad50 and Mre11 could be detected in protein extracts prepared from wild-type, <italic>tel1</italic>Œî, <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). As MRX is required to load Tel1 on the DSB ends, these findings indicate that Tel1, once loaded onto the DSB by MRX, promotes MRX association/persistence in a feedback loop and this function is necessary to support the end-tethering activity of MRX.</p>

<title>Rif2 Is Recruited to DSBs and Counteracts Tel1 Function in Promoting MRX Association to DSBs</title>

<p>This Rif2 function was completely dependent on Tel1, as the amount of both MRX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) and MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) bound at the DSB decreased to similar levels in both <italic>tel1</italic>Œî and <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rif2</italic>Œî cells. Consistent with a previous finding that Rif2 competes with Tel1 for the binding to MRX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>], the interaction between Tel1 and MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X was strongly attenuated by Rif2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g008">Fig 8C</xref>).

<p>Consistent with a direct role of Rif2 in DSB metabolism, purified Rif2 turned out to bind dsDNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g008">Fig 8D</xref>).

As Rif2 physically interacts with MRX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>], we asked whether MRX may contribute to Rif2 binding at the DSB.

<p>The lack of Rif2 increased the association of MRX and MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X at DSBs in a Tel1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>), indicating that Rif2 counteracts the ability of Tel1 to enhance MRX association to DSB. If the lack of Rif2 suppressed the CPT hypersensitivity and the end-tethering defect of <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells by increasing the amount of MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X bound to the DSB, this <italic>rif2</italic>Œî-mediated suppression should require Tel1 and therefore <italic>rif2</italic>Œî should not be able to suppress the same defects in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells. However, we found that <italic>rif2</italic>Œî restored both end-tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>) and NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g009">Fig 9C</xref>), as well as DNA damage resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g009">Fig 9F</xref>) also of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells.

<title>Rif2 Enhances MRX ATPase Activity and Limits End-Tethering</title>
<p>The finding that the lack of Rif2 restores DNA damage resistance and end-tethering in <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells even in the absence of Tel1 suggests that Rif2 has other functions in regulating MRX activity besides limiting MRX recruitment to DNA ends. It has been proposed that ATP hydrolysis induces the change from a closed MRX complex, required for end-tethering, to an open configuration that promotes Mre11 nuclease activity and DSB resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref029">29</xref>]. Thus, we asked whether Rif2 attenuates MRX function in end-tethering by influencing its ATPase activity. The ATPase assay was performed in the presence of 200 nM of 100-bp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to fully activate MRX ATPase activity. Since efficiently shifting 10 nM of the same DNA requires at least 300 nM Rif2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), 2 ŒºM Rif2 was used to investigate the potential effect of Rif2-mediated DNA binding on ATP hydrolysis by MRX in reactions that contained 200 nM DNA. We found that the addition of purified Rif2 increased the ATP hydrolysis activity by both wild-type MRX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g010">Fig 10A</xref>) and MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). Since end-tethering requires the MRX ATP-bound state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref029">29</xref>], this finding suggests that the lack of Rif2 suppresses the hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents and the end-tethering defect of <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> and <italic>rad50-V1269M tel1</italic>Œî cells by increasing the time spent by MRX in an ATP-bound closed conformation.</p>

Plotted values are the mean value with error bars denoting s.d. (<italic>n</italic> = 3).

(E) Model for the roles of Tel1 and Rif2 in controlling MRX function at DSBs. In wild-type cells (left), Tel1 enhances MRX function by promoting MRX association to DSBs (black arrows). Proper MRX accumulation to DNA increases the number of productive intercomplex interactions between hook domains to maintain DNA strands in close proximity. Rif2 inhibits MRX accumulation at DSBs by counteracting MRX-Tel1 interaction (black bar-headed line) and enhances MRX ATPase activity (red arrows). In <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells (middle), the reduced amount of MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X bound at the DSB severely impairs end-tethering, HR and NHEJ.

<p>As an earlier study has shown that Rif2 binds to the C-terminus of Xrs2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>], we asked whether this Rif2-mediated regulation of MRX activity requires Rif2-MRX interaction. Interestingly, the lack of Rif2 cannot suppress the hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents of <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells carrying the <italic>xrs2-11</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g010">Fig 10D</xref>), which causes the lack of the Xrs2 C-terminal part and therefore of the MRX-Rif2 interaction. This finding suggests that regulation of MRX function by Rif2 requires its interaction with Xrs2. This requirement can be bypassed in vitro where these proteins are already in close proximity, as Rif2 can also enhance the ATPase activity of the MR complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g010">Fig 10C</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutants that promote the ATP-bound closed conformation of Rad50 exhibit a higher degree of tethering activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref029">29</xref>], and Rif2 enhances ATPase activity not only of MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X, but also of wild-type MRX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref>). If this Rif2 function is physiologically relevant also in a wild-type context, then <italic>rif2</italic>Œî cells should show improved efficiency of DNA tethering. We found that the percentage of <italic>rif2</italic>Œî cells showing two LacI-GFP spots was reproducibly decreased compared to wild-type cells, indicating that the tethering efficiency is higher in <italic>rif2</italic>Œî cells than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>). Furthermore, Rif2 limits DSB repair by NHEJ, as <italic>rif2</italic>Œî mutant cells re-ligated the BamHI-cut plasmid more efficiently than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). These observations, together with the finding that Rif2 enhances ATP hydrolysis by MRX, suggest that Rif2 regulates MRX function by promoting ATP-driven Rad50 conformational changes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We provide evidence that Tel1, once loaded to a DSB by the MRX complex, promotes/stabilizes MRX association to the DSB in a positive feedback loop. Tel1 exerts this function independenly of its kinase activity, suggesting that it plays a structural role in promoting/stabilizing MRX retention to DSBs. This Tel1-mediated control of MRX association can be important to ensure that MRX binding to DNA is end-specific and becomes crucial for cell viability after genotoxic treatment when MRX accumulation at DSBs is suboptimal, such as in <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> mutant cells. The <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> mutation impairs MRX association at DSBs and the lack of Tel1 reduces further the amount of MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X bound at DSBs. As a consequence, <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells are much more sensitive to genotoxic agents compared to each single mutant. This DNA damage hypersensitivity is not due to defective DSB resection. Instead, <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells are severely defective in keeping the DSB ends tethered to each other and in repairing a DSB by HR and NHEJ. Since the mainteinance of the DSB ends in close proximity is a relevant event in the repair of DSBs by both NHEJ and HR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref052">52</xref>], the low degree of end-tethering in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells can explain the poor ability of the same cells to repair a DSB by both repair mechanisms.</p>
<p>During HR, the second DSB end can be captured by the D-loop to form an intermediate with double Holliday junctions, whose random cleavage results in equal number of NCO or CO products. However, if the newly synthesized strand is displaced by the D-loop and anneals to the other DSB end, this results in NCO products by the SDSA mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref053">53</xref>]. Consistent with the finding that only some MRX functions are lost in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells, COs are generated with wild-type kinetics in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells, whereas formation of these repair products are impaired by the lack of any MRX subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref064">64</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells are specifically defective in the generation of NCO products, suggesting that these cells can be specifically impaired in SDSA. This observation raises the possibility that the function of MRX in keeping the DSB ends in close proximity can be particularly important to facilitate the annealing of the displaced strand to the other DSB end. By contrast, this function can be escaped when the second DSB end is already captured by the D-loop and the DNA intermediate is stabilized by the formation of a double Holliday junction.</p>
<p>MRX association to DNA has been shown to induce parallel orientation of the Rad50 coiled-coils that favours intercomplex association needed for DNA tethering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref012">12</xref>]. Our results support a model wherein Tel1, once loaded at DSBs by MRX, exerts positive feedback by promoting an end-specific association of MRX with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g010">Fig 10E</xref>). This Tel1-mediated regulation of DNA-MRX retention is important for proper MRX conformation needed for the tethering of broken DNA ends. Previous data have shown that the lack of Sae2 impairs end-tethering and increases MRX association to DSB ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref066">66</xref>]. These and our findings suggest that it is not the amount of MRX bound at DNA ends per se that simply dictates the integrity of end-tethering. Instead, a proper MRX-DNA interaction is required to allow the establishment of a productive MRX intercomplex association that is needed to maintain DNA strands in close proximity.</p>
<p>The amount of MRX and Tel1 bound at telomeres is lower than that found at DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref036">36</xref>]. This difference is due to a Rif2-mediated inhibition of Tel1 accumulation at telomeric ends, which has been proposed to protect telomeric DNA ends from over-elongation and checkpoint activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref067">67</xref>]. This Rif2 function in modulating MRX activity is not restricted to telomeric DNA ends. In fact, although the amount of Rif2 bound at an HO-induced DSB flanked by telomeric repeats is higher than that found at HO-induced DSB containing no telomeric sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref035">35</xref>], we show that the lack of Rif2 increases the association of MRX in a Tel1-dependent manner also to intrachromosomal DNA ends. As Rif2 competes in vitro with Tel1 for the binding to MRX, Rif2 can limit MRX association to DSBs by reducing MRX-Tel1 interaction. Consistent with a direct role of Rif2 at DSBs, Rif2 can bind DNA both in vitro and in vivo and its binding at DSBs is partially dependent on MRX.</p>
<p>We also found that the lack of Rif2 suppresses the DNA damage sensitivity and the end-tethering defects of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> double mutant cells. As <italic>rif2</italic>Œî increases MRX association to DSBs only in the presence of Tel1, the finding that Tel1 is not required for <italic>rif2</italic>Œî<italic>-</italic>mediated suppression of the <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> phenotypes suggests that Rif2 has other functions in regulating MRX activity besides limiting its association to DNA ends. Based on the characterization of Rad50 variants that either promote or destabilize the ATP-bound state, it has been proposed that the ATP-bound conformation of MRX promotes end-tethering, whereas release from this ATP-bound state by ATP hydrolysis is necessary to allow access to DNA of the Mre11 nuclease active site and subsequent DSB resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref029">29</xref>]. Our data show that Rif2 enhances the ATP hydrolysis activity of the MRX complex, suggesting that the lack of Rif2 might restore end-tethering and DNA damage resistance in <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells by increasing the time spent by MRX in the ATP-bound closed conformation. Consistent with this hypothesis, <italic>rif2</italic>Œî cells show an increased efficiency of both end-tethering and NHEJ compared to wild-type cells. The finding that the lack of Rif2 suppresses the end-tethering defect and the DNA damage hypersensitivity of <italic>tel1</italic>Œî <italic>rad50-V1269M</italic> cells without increasing MRX association at DSBs suggests that the transition between closed and open MRX conformations does not necessarily result in different amounts of MRX bound at DSBs.</p>
<p>Thus, we propose that Rif2 has a dual function in regulating MRX functions at DSBs: (i) it counteracts MRX association at DSBs by inhibiting MRX-Tel1 interaction; (ii) it enhances MRX ATPase activity, promoting the transition of the complex from a closed state, required for tethering, to an open state that unmasks Mre11 nuclease active sites and thus is competent for DSB resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002387.g010">Fig 10E</xref>). Interestingly, Rif2 is known to counteract NHEJ at telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref068">68</xref>]. Whether this Rif2 function depends on a Rif2-mediated regulation of MRX conformational changes is an interesting question that remains to be addressed.</p>
<p>Cancer therapies targeting ATM/Tel1 have been developed to increase the effectiveness of standard genotoxic treatments and/or to set up synthetic lethal approaches in cancers with DNA repair defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref069">69</xref>]. Interestingly, analysis of the mutational landscape in 7,494 sequenced tumors across 28 tumor types revealed that approximately 4% of all human tumors harbor mutations in the MRN/MRX complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref070">70</xref>]. Our finding that MRX dysfunctions can be rendered synthetically lethal with <italic>tel1</italic>Œî in the presence of genotoxic agents suggests that ATM inhibitors in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapy could be beneficial in patients whose tumors are defective in MRN function.</p>

Briefly, the clarified cell lysate from 38 g pellet prepared by sonication in 100 ml T buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.01% Igepal, and 1 mM DTT) containing 300 mM KCl and the protease inhibitor cocktail was mixed gently with 6 ml Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) to capture the (His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged Rif2. After washing extensively with 100 ml T buffer containing 1M KCl and 20 mM imidazole, bound proteins were eluted with 8 ml T buffer containing 150 mM KCl and 200 mM imidazole. The eluate was applied onto a SP Sepharose column (6 ml), which was developed with a 90 ml gradient of 50‚Äì350 mM KCl in T buffer. The peak fractions containing (His)<sub>6</sub>-Rif2 were pooled and then applied onto a Mono S column (1 ml), which was developed with a 30 ml gradient of 75‚Äì450 mM KCl in T buffer. After concentrating the pooled peak fractions to 1.5 ml in an Ultracel-30K concentrator (Amicon), the preparation (0.5 ml protein) was further fractionated in a Superdex 200 column (24 ml) in T buffer with 300 mM KCl. The highly purified (His)<sub>6</sub>-Rif2 protein (1 mg) was concentrated and stored in small portions at -80¬∞C.</p>

<title>ATPase and DNA Binding Assays</title>
<p>The ATPase assay was performed as described previously with the level of ATP hydrolysis being measured by thin layer chromatography and phosphorimaging analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref027">27</xref>]. Briefly, wild-type MRX or MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X (100 nM) and Rif2 (2 ŒºM) were used in the presence of 100-bp dsDNA (200 nM). The effect of Rif2 on the ATPase activity of the MR complex (100 nM) was examined as described above.</p>
<p>The DNA binding assay for Rad50 and MRX was slightly modified from that published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002387.ref027">27</xref>]. Briefly, wild-type Rad50 and Rad50-V1269M (50, 100, and 200 nM), wild-type MRX and MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X (10, 20, and 40 nM) were incubated with radiolabeled 70-bp dsDNA substrate (10 nM) in the reaction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 100 Œºg/ml BSA, 2 mM ATP) at 30¬∞C for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were resolved in a 0.3% agarose gel in SB buffer (10 mM NaOH, 40 mM boric acid, pH 8.0) on ice. The gel was dried and then subject to phosphorimaging analysis. To examine Rif2 for DNA binding activity, the indicated amount of purified Rif2 was incubated with radiolabeled 100-bp dsDNA substrate (10 nM) in the reaction buffer at 30¬∞C for 10 min, followed by the same analytical procedure described above.</p>

<title>Affinity Pull-Down Assay</title>
<p>Flag-tagged Tel1 was incubated with MRX or MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X in 30 Œºl T buffer containing 100 mM KCl for 2 h on ice. The reaction was mixed gently with anti-FLAG-M2 agarose resin (10 Œºl) for 2 h to capture Flag-tagged Tel1 and associated MRX or MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X. After washing the resin three times with 200 Œºl T buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then subject to western blot analysis. To determine the effect of Rif2 on the interaction between Tel1 and MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X, Flag-tagged Tel1 was incubated with MR<sup>V1269M</sup>X in the absence or presence of Rif2, and then subjected to affinity pull-down as described above.</p>
