      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>Myosin-II thick filament formation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is an excellent system for investigating the phenomenon of self-assembly, as the myosin molecule itself contains all the information required to form a structure of defined size. Phosphorylation of only three threonine residues can dramatically change the assembly state of myosin-II. We show here that the C-terminal 68 kDa of the myosin-II tail (termed AD-Cterm) assembles in a regulated manner similar to full-length myosin-II and forms bipolar thick filament (BTF) structures when a green fluorescent protein (GFP) “head” is added to the N terminus. The localization of this GFP-AD-Cterm to the cleavage furrow of dividing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells depends on assembly state, similar to full-length myosin-II. This tail fragment therefore represents a good model system for the regulated formation and localization of BTFs. By reducing regulated BTF assembly to a more manageable model system, we were able to explore determinants of myosin-II self-assembly. Our data support a model in which a globular head limits the size of a BTF, and the large-scale charge character of the AD-Cterm region is important for BTF formation. Truncation analysis of AD-Cterm tail fragments shows that assembly is delicately balanced, resulting in assembled myosin-II molecules that are poised to disassemble due to the phosphorylation of only three threonines.</p>

        <title>The Assembly of Bipolar Thick Filaments Is Regulated During Cell Division</title>
        <p>Myosin-II (hereafter referred to as myosin) is a hexameric protein composed of two heavy chains, two regulatory light chains, and two essential light chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The heavy chain consists of an N-terminal globular head that contains ATP and actin-binding sites, an α-helical neck that contains the light-chain binding sites, and finally a long α-helix that dimerizes with the α-helix of the other heavy chain to form the coiled-coil tail.</p>

In the coiled-coil tail, Ala 1 is red (1,348–1,530), the AD is blue (1,531–1,824), Ala 2 is purple (1,825–1,966), the C-terminal domain is green (1,967–2,116), and the remainder is black (819–1,347). Phospho-threonines (at positions 1,823, 1,833, and 2,029) are indicated by the letter T.</p>

Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are assigned –1, lysine and arginine are assigned +1, and all other a.a. are assigned 0. The average charge in (B) was determined with a window size of 14 a.a., and the average charge in (C) was determined with a window size of 28 a.a..

        <p>A bipolar thick filament (BTF) is a highly organized structure composed of individual myosin molecules. In vitro, myosin from the cellular slime mold <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Dictyostelium discoideum</named-content> assembles without the aid of a cofactor, demonstrating that the myosin molecule itself contains all the information needed to form a highly organized structure of a defined size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Clarke1">Clarke and Spudich 1974</xref>). While proteins that co-assemble with muscle myosin have been discovered in some cell types, no such proteins have been identified in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Barral1">Barral and Epstein 1999</xref>).</p>
        <p>In vivo, BTFs are important in a variety of cellular processes, including cell motility, chemotaxis, and development. In cytokinesis, BTFs provide the mechanical force to constrict an actin ring positioned at the midzone of the dividing cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-De1">De la Roche et al. 2002</xref>). In <italic>Dictyostelium,</italic> phosphorylation of myosin inhibits filament assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Kuczmarski1">Kuczmarski and Spudich 1980</xref>). Myosin is recruited to the cleavage furrow in the form of a BTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Sabry1">Sabry et al. 1997</xref>). After the BTF provides contractile force, a myosin heavy chain kinase is recruited that then drives the disassembly of the BTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Liang2">Liang et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
        <p>Phosphorylation of only three threonines in the 2,116-amino acid (a.a.) heavy chain of myosin is sufficient to inhibit BTF formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Vaillancourt1">Vaillancourt et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Luck-Vielmetter1">Luck-Vielmetter et al. 1990</xref>). These threonines have been mutated to aspartic acid (3xAsp myosin) to create a mimic of a fully phosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Egelhoff1">Egelhoff et al. 1993</xref>). 3xAsp myosin is assembly-incompetent in vitro, and the phenotype of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells expressing only 3xAsp myosin is similar to the myosin-null mutant, consistent with previous work demonstrating that BTF assembly is required for myosin function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-De3">De Lozanne and Spudich 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Knecht1">Knecht and Loomis 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Manstein1">Manstein et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Egelhoff1">Egelhoff et al. 1993</xref>). Mutation of the phosphorylation sites to alanines (3xAla myosin), in contrast, does not alter the filament formation properties of myosin in vitro. In vivo, 3xAla myosin is always assembled and therefore is a good mimic of an unphosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Egelhoff1">Egelhoff et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Yumura1">Yumura 2001</xref>). The doubling time of 3xAla cells is 17 h, whereas in wild-type cells it is 13 h, suggesting that thick filament disassembly is required for efficient cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Egelhoff1">Egelhoff et al. 1993</xref>).</p>

        <title>The Role of Charge Repeats in the Myosin Tail</title>
        <p>Myosin tails have a striking pattern of charged a.a., with an average positive charge over 14 a.a. followed by an average negative charge over 14 a.a. to form a 28-a.a. charge repeat throughout the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-McLachlan2">McLachlan and Karn 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-McLachlan1">McLachlan 1984</xref>). A second charge repeat found only in the C-terminal 68 kDa of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin tail occurs every 196 a.a. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Warrick1">Warrick et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Shoffner1">Shoffner and De Lozanne 1996</xref>). These repeating patterns can be visualized by considering the tail as a one-dimensional rod and calculating the average charge over a window of a.a. as a function of position in the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Shoffner1">Shoffner and De Lozanne 1996</xref>). A 14-a.a. window makes the 28-a.a. repeat apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), and a 28-a.a. window averages out the 28-a.a. pattern, making the 196 a.a. pattern more apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p>

        <title>The Myosin Tail Contains Functional Domains</title>
        <p>The C-terminal 68 kDa of the tail contains the 34-kDa assembly domain (AD; a.a. 1,531–1,824; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>, blue coiled-coil). The AD has salt-dependent solubility properties like full-length, wild-type myosin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-OaHalloran1">O'Halloran et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Shoffner1">Shoffner and De Lozanne 1996</xref>). However, unlike full-length myosin, which assembles into BTFs, the AD assembles into paracrystals having undefined size and number of elements. The AD also appears to be the minimal assembling portion of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin tail. C-terminal truncation of full-length myosin to a.a. 1,819 yields an assembly-competent myosin, whereas deletion of an additional 35 a.a. abolishes assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Lee1">Lee et al. 1994</xref>).</p>

        <p>Replacement of the catalytic domain and essential light chain binding domain of full-length <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin with green fluorescent protein (GFP) produces a chimera that is apparently indistinguishable from full-length myosin in its ability to form BTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Zang1">Zang and Spudich 1998</xref>). Therefore, the myosin head is not required for BTF formation. However, the contribution of a globular head to the assembly process has not been closely examined.</p>

        <title>Models of Regulation</title>
        <p>Several models have been proposed for the mechanism of myosin regulation. In this discussion, the hexameric myosin molecule will be referred to as a monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). A monomer-sequestering model was hypothesized based on the characterization of 3xAsp myosin in vitro by rotary shadowing electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Pasternak1">Pasternak et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Liang1">Liang et al. 1999</xref>) and in vivo by identification of myosin tail mutations that suppressed the 3xAsp phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Liang1">Liang et al. 1999</xref>). In this model, the coiled-coil tail bends and folds back on itself, sequestering the AD from other myosin molecules. It was further hypothesized that the bent conformation is stabilized by an intramolecular interaction between two regions of the tail rich in alanines in core positions of the heptad repeat. These coiled-coil regions, termed Ala 1 (a.a. 1,348–1,530) and Ala 2 (a.a. 1,825–1,966), are shown in red and purple respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>. A bias for alanines in core heptad positions is characteristic of antiparallel tetrameric coiled-coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Munson1">Munson et al. 1996</xref>), prompting the speculation that Ala 1 and Ala 2 form an antiparallel tetrameric coiled-coil in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.</p>
        <p>An alternative monomer-sequestering mechanism might be destabilization of the coiled-coil. Threonine 1,823 is located at the C terminus of the AD, and is predicted to be in the D position of the heptad repeat. The D position is in the core of the coiled-coil where the two strands interact closely. It is possible that phosphorylation of threonine 1,823 would cause a local disruption of the coiled-coil and perturb self-assembly by introducing negative charge into the hydrophobic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Luck-Vielmetter1">Luck-Vielmetter et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Liang1">Liang et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Nock1">Nock et al. 2000</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Nock1">Nock et al. (2000)</xref> showed that in full-length myosin, position 1,823 makes the largest contribution to the 3xAsp phenotype. However, the susceptibility of the myosin tail to proteolysis by chymotrypsin does not change with phosphorylation, arguing that large structural changes due to phosphorylation are unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Cote1">Cote and McCrea 1987</xref>).</p>
        <p>Another model postulates that regulation occurs at the level of assembly intermediates. The assembly pathway of full-length <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin consists of a nucleation phase followed by an elongation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Mahajan1">Mahajan and Pardee 1996</xref>). In the nucleation phase, a parallel dimer forms in which two myosin monomers self-associate in a parallel orientation with a 14-nm stagger.</p>
        <p>When two myosin monomers are offset by 14 nm, both the 28-a.a. and 196-a.a. charge repeats are aligned to maximize charge complementation between the two tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-De2">De Lozanne 1988</xref>). Threonine 1,823 is positioned within a cluster of positively charged a.a. that forms part of the 196 a.a. repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Luck-Vielmetter1">Luck-Vielmetter et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Nock1">Nock et al. 2000</xref>). The introduction of negative charge by phosphorylation of threonine 1,823 could disrupt critical charge-charge interactions required for assembly.</p>

        <p>Determining the mechanism of regulated assembly will help elucidate the largely uncharacterized mechanism of myosin recruitment to the cleavage furrow.

        <title>The AD-Cterm (3xThr) and (3xAsp) Tail Fragments Reconstitute Regulated Assembly</title>
        <p>We wished to test whether both the Ala 1 and the Ala 2 domains of myosin are necessary to regulate BTF assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Liang1">Liang et al. 1999</xref>) or whether the AD-through-C-terminal portion of the tail is sufficient for formation of regulated BTFs. We constructed a tail fragment that starts at the AD and extends to the end of the C terminus (AD-Cterm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), and therefore contains all three threonine phosphorylation sites but not the Ala1 region. We created both “wild-type” (AD-Cterm [3xThr]) and “3xAsp” (AD-Cterm [3xAsp]) versions; the latter construct had aspartic acids in place of the three threonine phosphorylation sites to mimic a constitutively phosphorylated state. We then compared the salt-dependent solubility of these tail fragments to full-length phosphorylated and unphosphorylated myosin to see whether AD-Cterm recapitulates regulated assembly.</p>
        <p>Thick filaments and paracrystals efficiently sediment upon centrifugation, whereas unassembled molecules remain soluble. Wild-type full-length myosin efficiently assembles in buffers of intermediate ionic strength (25–100 mM NaCl), while phosphorylated full-length myosin is unassembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Kuczmarski1">Kuczmarski and Spudich 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Cote1">Cote and McCrea 1987</xref>). Therefore, regulated assembly is biochemically defined as salt-dependent insolubility of unphosphorylated myosin and solubility of phosphorylated myosin. AD-Cterm (3xThr) and AD-Cterm (3xAsp) possess the same in vitro assembly properties as full-length unphosphorylated and full-length phosphorylated myosin, respectively, suggesting that this part of the tail contains all the information needed to regulate assembly in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p>

        <title>The Global Stabilities of AD-Cterm (3xThr) and AD-Cterm (3xAsp) Are Identical</title>
        <p>We next tested whether AD-Cterm (3xThr) and AD-Cterm (3xAsp) tail fragments form coiled-coils, similar to full-length myosin. The oligomerization state of the tail fragments was determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis, and the secondary structure was assessed by circular dichroism (CD). Neither tail fragment is expected to assemble in the buffers used for these studies, as they contain 500 mM NaCl. Sedimentation runs were carried out as a function of protein concentration, and equilibrium traces were obtained after 20 h of centrifugation. The profiles were fit to an equation describing the sedimentation behavior of a single, non-associating, ideal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The distribution of residuals around 0 suggests that the concentration distribution is well described by the model. The predicted molecular weight of the coiled-coil is 137 kDa, and the experimentally determined molecular weight ranged from 130 kDa to 160 kDa for the AD-Cterm (3xThr) tail fragment and 120 kDa to 150 kDa for the AD-Cterm (3xAsp) tail fragment. The range of molecular weights obtained for both tail fragments was due to an observed decrease in molecular weight as protein concentration was increased. This trend is a hallmark of non-ideality and has been observed for elongated, rod-like molecules such as DNA and skeletal muscle myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Tanford1">Tanford 1961</xref>). Far-UV CD spectra at 4 °C show that both tail fragments are α-helical with similar α-helical content as assessed by comparing mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm (θ<sub>222</sub>) (unpublished data). Therefore, both tail fragments behave as two-stranded coiled-coils in these assays.</p>
        <p>The sedimentation equilibrium analysis demonstrates that a direct comparison of coiled-coil stability can be made by thermal denaturation at 500 mM NaCl because neither tail fragment self-assembles to form larger species in this condition. Thermal melts are reversible and at equilibrium and far-UV CD spectra show both tail fragments are α-helical at the starting temperature of the melt (4 °C) and are random coil at the ending temperature (60 °C) (unpublished data). The melting temperature for the AD-Cterm (3xThr) and AD-Cterm (3xAsp) tail fragments at both protein concentrations are identical (29 °C at 50 μM and 28 °C at 2.5 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In summary, the AD-Cterm tail fragments behave as two-stranded coiled coils with similar thermal denaturation properties in high salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g002">2</xref>C). Therefore, the difference in assembly observed between the wild-type and 3xAsp tail fragments cannot be attributed to a failure of AD-Cterm (3xAsp) to fold into an α-helical two-stranded coiled-coil.</p>

        <p>To test whether the presence of a globular domain might induce AD-Cterm to form regulated, bipolar structures analogous to the thick filaments formed by full-length <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin, we attached a GFP molecule to the N terminus of AD-Cterm (GFP-AD-Cterm). Both GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr) and GFP-AD-Cterm (3xAsp) versions of this protein were made to mimic the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states of myosin, respectively.</p>
        <p>We assembled purified GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr) in buffer containing 50 mM NaCl with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and imaged them using EM. Bipolar structures first formed on a time scale of 2–5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), then bound together and reorganized to form larger, but less well-defined structures on a time scale of more than 10 min. This result is consistent with previous data on full-length <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin indicating that when it is prepared by dialysis rather than by rapid dilution as used here (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), it forms elongated structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Stewart1">Stewart and Spudich 1979</xref>). The bipolar structures have striations at their ends spaced 14.4 ± 2.9 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 25) apart, corresponding well to the 14.3-nm offset of full-length myosin heads in a BTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Stewart1">Stewart and Spudich 1979</xref>).</p>

The width of GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr) BTFs is 27 ± 6 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 63) at the center of the bare zone (area where heads are absent), close to the width of full-length myosin BTFs (33 ± 1 nm).

        <title>The AD-Cterm Tail Fragment Is Sufficient for Regulated Localization of Myosin</title>
        <p>To test the ability of GFP-tail fragments to localize to the cleavage furrow of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> in vivo, we expressed our constructs in myosin-null <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells. However, the GFP-tail fragments were vastly overexpressed in vivo (unpublished data). Introducing the 31-a.a. regulatory light chain (RLC) binding site between the GFP and tail fragment sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Zang1">Zang and Spudich 1998</xref>) produced expression levels similar to wild-type myosin (unpublished data). We expressed 3xThr, 3xAla, and 3xAsp versions of GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm in myosin heavy chain-null <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells. To ensure that the RLC did not interfere with filament formation, we assayed for assembly of the GFP-RLC-tail fusions in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cell extracts. As expected, the 3xThr and 3xAla GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm proteins were assembly-competent in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> extracts, while GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xAsp) was not (unpublished data), demonstrating that the RLC does not interfere with regulated filament formation.</p>

In 9 of 9 dividing cells, GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xAla) localized to the cleavage furrow and remained at the site of cleavage furrow formation in the resulting daughter cells (termed “back end”) after cytokinesis. In contrast, GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xAsp) did not go to the cleavage furrow in any of 11 observed dividing cells. GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xThr) localized to the furrow in 6 of 12 dividing cells, and in these six cells localization was apparent only in the very late stage of furrow formation and at the back end of the resulting daughter cells. In three cells, GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xThr) localization was clearly visible only at the back end of the resulting daughter cells, and in the remaining three cells no localization was clear. Thus, the AD-Cterm tail fragment is sufficient for localization, but does not localize as efficiently as full-length GFP-myosin (3xThr). The increased localization of GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xAla) is consistent with the overassembly and increased localization reported for full-length GFP-myosin (3xAla) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Sabry1">Sabry et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Robinson1">Robinson et al. 2002</xref>).</p>

        <p>Given the large contribution that a.a. 1,823, the penultimate a.a. in the AD, makes to the 3xAsp phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Nock1">Nock et al. 2000</xref>), we tested whether the AD could be regulated by this a.a. alone. The salt-dependent solubilities of the AD (1xThr) and a mutant in which threonine 1,823 had been changed to aspartic acid (AD [1xAsp]) were nearly identical in the sedimentation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">Figure 7</xref>A), which suggests that the AD can assemble but is not sufficient for regulated assembly.</p>

        <p>We attached a GFP “head” to the AD (1xThr) and, interestingly, this GFP-AD (1xThr) tail fragment had bulk sedimentation properties very similar to those of headless AD (1xThr), suggesting that the presence of a globular domain does not affect in vitro solubility, similar to AD-Cterm and GFP-AD-Cterm tail fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). The AD (1xThr) tail fragments are more salt-sensitive than AD-Cterm (3xThr) tail fragments, possibly because they have a shorter coiled-coil tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">7</xref>B). EM showed that GFP-AD (1xThr) formed structures of fixed size that were not true BTFs because they did not contain bare zones (unpublished data). This demonstrates that a globular head fixes the size of assembling myosin structures, while C-terminal sequence elements in the myosin tail may be required for proper formation of the bare zone.</p>

        <title>Regulated Assembly Cannot Be Reconstituted with Tail Fragments Smaller Than AD-Cterm</title>
        <p>To determine whether the entire 34-kDa portion of the tail C-terminal to the AD is required for regulated assembly, we generated a series of tail fragments that all start at the AD and are truncated at different positions within the C-terminal 34 kDa of the tail (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g006">Figure 6</xref> for constructs). The first such fragments that we examined started at the AD and included threonine 1,833, the second phosphorylation site (extended AD [2xThr]) and extended AD [2xAsp]). Unlike AD (1xThr) and AD (1xAsp), extended AD (2xThr) and extended AD (2xAsp) show a four-fold difference in solubility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). This is significantly less than the eight-fold difference in solubility of full-length unphosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin, respectively, and AD-Cterm (3xThr) and AD-Cterm (3xAsp), respectively.</p>
        <p>To test whether adding on a larger portion of the tail results in a greater degree of regulated assembly, we constructed tail fragments that start at the AD and end at a.a. 1,966, the end of Ala 2 (AD-Ala 2). As with other tail fragments, the aspartic acid variant of this construct is more soluble than its wild-type counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). Surprisingly, AD-Ala 2 (2xThr) exhibits inhibited assembly relative to shorter constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). This inhibition was not merely a consequence of where we truncated this tail fragment. A tail fragment was constructed that started at the AD and ended at a.a. 2,015 (AD-2015 [2xThr]). This construct contains an isoleucine in the C-terminal most heptad core position, making it less likely that the two strands of the coiled-coil will fray. Like AD-Ala 2 (2xThr), AD-2015 (2xThr) exhibits inhibited self-assembly (unpublished data). Furthermore, a far-UV CD spectrum of AD-Ala2 (2xThr) showed that it is α-helical (unpublished data), indicating that AD-Ala2 (2xThr) is structurally intact. All tail fragments truncated in the C-terminal 34 kDa of the tail exhibit altered assembly properties, while AD-Cterm (3xThr) and AD-Cterm (3xAsp) possess the same in vitro assembly properties as full-length, unphosphorylated, and phosphorylated myosin, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Cote1">Cote and McCrea 1987</xref>). These data suggest that the entire AD-Cterm tail fragment is required to reconstitute regulated assembly of BTFs.</p>

        <title>The Ala 1 Domain Stabilizes Assembly</title>
        <p>When the entire C-terminal domain is included in the AD-Cterm tail fragment, the inhibitory effect of Ala 2 is overcome. To test whether this stabilizing effect is specific to the C-terminal domain, we determined if Ala 1 could also stabilize assembly. A tail fragment was constructed that starts at Ala 1 and ends at Ala 2 (Ala1-Ala2 [2xThr]). The salt-dependent assembly of Ala1-Ala2 (2xThr) is more efficient than that of AD-Ala2 (2xThr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">Figure 7</xref>E) at 5 μM protein. Thus, Ala 1 can partially overcome the inhibitory effect of Ala 2, but not as robustly as the C-terminal domain. A tail fragment containing both Ala 1 and the C-terminal domain (Ala1-Cterm [3xThr]) assembles essentially the same as AD-Cterm (3xThr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g007">Figure 7</xref>E). All of these data indicate that the assembly reaction is delicately balanced, because the various domains of the tail make both favorable and unfavorable contributions to assembly.</p>

Because of the symmetry in this region of the myosin tail, the AD-Cterm-GFP (3xThr) and GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr) proteins can distinguish between assembly mechanisms that require specific a.a. in specific positions relative to the globular head versus assembly mechanisms that require a very general charge pattern to occur. AD-Cterm-GFP (3xAsp) was also created to test whether the same three threonines can regulate assembly of this myosin tail fragment.</p>

Similar to GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr), AD-Cterm-GFP (3xThr) formed clustered or larger structures when protein was assembled for more than 10 min prior to imaging, whereas BTFs were most prevalent when protein was assembled for 2–5 min. The striations at the ends of the AD-Cterm-GFP (3xThr) bipolar structures are spaced 14 ± 2 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 118) apart, consistent with the 14-nm spacing of full-length <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin. The AD-Cterm-GFP (3xThr) structures have a shorter bare zone than GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr) structures (62 ± 8 [<italic>n</italic> = 75] versus 85 nm), but a similar width to both GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr) and full-length myosin BTFs (32 ± 5 nm [<italic>n</italic> = 159] versus 27 nm and 33 nm, respectively). While the AD-Cterm-GFP (3xThr) structures differ slightly from those formed by full-length myosin and GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr), it is clear that the presence of the globular domain leads to a fixed length, even in C-terminally capped myosin tail fragments.</p>

        <title>Regulation of AD-Cterm and Full-Length Myosin Is Identical In Vitro</title>
        <p>The assembly properties of both AD-Cterm (3xThr) and AD-Cterm (3xAsp) closely parallel those of full-length unphosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Cote1">Cote and McCrea (1987)</xref>. These data represent a good basis for comparison to AD-Cterm, because the myosin was heavily phosphorylated (2:1 stoichiometry of phosphate:myosin heavy chain), and Cote and McCrea performed a gel filtration step to eliminate any contaminating actin. Other sedimentation data for full-length myosin compare favorably with the AD-Cterm data as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Kuczmarski1">Kuczmarski and Spudich 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Egelhoff1">Egelhoff et al. 1993</xref>). The parallel between the solubility of AD-Cterm and full-length myosin in vitro argues that AD-Cterm (3xAsp) is a good mimic of the phosphorylated state of full-length myosin and that all of the information necessary for regulated assembly is present in the AD-Cterm region of the myosin tail.</p>

        <title>Attaching a Globular Head to AD-Cterm Reconstitutes Regulated BTF Assembly</title>
        <p>The fact that GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr) forms BTFs whereas AD-Cterm (3xThr) does not, demonstrates that the mere presence of a globular head differentiates BTFs from paracrystals, and that neither the myosin head nor the S2 region of the myosin coiled-coil is critical for BTF formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Zang1">Zang and Spudich 1998</xref>; this study). While the presence of the globular head is critical for the size and shape of myosin structures in this study, it has no appreciable effect on the regulation of myosin BTF assembly. Furthermore, other cellular factors, with the exception of kinases and phosphatases, are not required for BTF formation, because the process can be completely reconstituted using recombinant, bacterially expressed protein.</p>

        <title>Regulation of GFP-AD-Cterm and Full-Length Myosin Is Similar In Vivo</title>
        <p>GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm tail fragments demonstrate regulated recruitment to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. While the localization of GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xThr) is less robust than full-length myosin, constitutively assembled GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xAla) always localizes to the cleavage furrow in cytokinesis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xAsp) fails to localize (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These data are consistent with other observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Sabry1">Sabry et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Shu1">Shu et al. 2003</xref>) indicating that assembled myosin constructs localize to the cleavage furrow while unassembled myosin constructs do not.</p>
        <p>The difference in localization efficiency between full-length myosin and GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xThr) might be due to differences in degree of assembly. The critical concentration of full-length myosin is estimated to be less than 20 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Mahajan1">Mahajan and Pardee 1996</xref>). One might expect the critical concentration of assembly for GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xThr) to be higher than full-length myosin, because full-length myosin has a longer tail. Likewise, the critical concentration of GFP-RLC-AD (1xThr) is expected to be higher than that of GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xThr). This argument may explain why GFP-RLC-AD-Cterm (3xThr) recruitment is less efficient than full-length myosin, and why GFP-RLC-AD (1xThr) does not go to the furrow at all (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, beads that are approximately the same length as the BTFs formed from full-length myosin do not localize to the cleavage furrow. Together with the previous in vivo localization data, this result argues that the majority of the information necessary for localization of BTFs to the cleavage furrow is in the AD-Cterm portion of the myosin tail, and that localization to the cleavage furrow is an active process, possibly involving another cellular factor that recruits myosin. It may be that this factor recognizes the charge repeats that distinguish assembled myosin BTFs from unassembled myosin. Consistent with this model is the localization of chimeric myosin molecules to the cleavage furrow in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Shu2">Shu et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Shu3">Shu et al. 2002</xref>).

This result has been confirmed in vivo by deleting Ala 1 from both full-length wild-type and 3xAsp myosin (W. Liang and JAS, unpublished data). <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells expressing the Ala 1 deletions as their sole source of myosin were phenotypically indistinguishable from cells expressing their full-length counterparts.

        <title>Regulation Does Not Occur by Conformational Disruption of the Coiled-Coil</title>
        <p>The CD and analytical ultracentrifugation data show that AD-Cterm (3xAsp) has not simply failed to fold into a two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil. These data are consistent with rotary shadowed electron micrographs of full-length 3xAsp and phosphorylated myosin. Gross destabilization of the coiled-coil would result in a single-headed myosin, and none have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Pasternak1">Pasternak et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Liang1">Liang et al. 1999</xref>). Global destabilization might result in a section of the tail unfolding, lowering resistance to thermal denaturation. However, thermal melts show that the melting temperature of AD-Cterm (3xThr) and AD-Cterm (3xAsp) are identical (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Local destabilization of the coiled-coil seems unlikely, because one of the chymotrypsin cleavage sites is close to threonine 1,823, which is in a core position of the heptad repeat, yet the proteolytic susceptibility of the myosin tail does not change upon phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020356-Cote1">Cote and McCrea 1987</xref>).</p>
        <p>Small numbers of assembled AD-Cterm (3xAsp) paracrystals were seen in electron micrographs of samples (unpublished data). These paracrystals, although quite rare, possess a 14-nm periodicity similar to the wild-type tail fragment. Consistent with this observation, approximately 10% of 3xAsp myosin sediments at 50 mM NaCl, demonstrating that regulation of assembly is not an all-or-none process. Together with the CD data, this result indicates that AD-Cterm (3xAsp) is structurally and functionally intact. Rather than being conformationally disrupted, the 3xAsp tail fragment fails to assemble because the critical concentration for assembly is higher than that of the wild-type tail fragment.</p>

          <title>The role of the 196 a.a. charge repeat in assembly</title>
          <p>The fact that AD-Cterm-GFP forms BTF-like structures with heads on the outside and tails in the center demonstrates the role of the 196-a.a. charge repeat in assembly. This charge repeat is symmetric in the AD-Cterm region of the tail (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). If the 196 a.a. charge repeat is a major driving force of assembly, then BTF formation should be independent of whether a globular head is positioned on the N or C terminus of AD-Cterm. Since globular heads are clearly visible on the outer edges and not in the center of AD-Cterm-GFP (3xThr) structures, local interactions between a.a. in these filaments must be different than local interactions in filaments formed from GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr) and from full-length myosin. Further structural characterization is required for a model that describes the packing of the coiled-coils within these filaments, but these data are consistent with the overall large scale charge character of the tail being important for forming BTFs.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, AD-Cterm-GFP (3xThr) structures are shorter than GFP-AD-Cterm (3xThr) filaments, and the bare zones are smaller as well. This may be because C-terminal sequence elements in the myosin tail may be required for proper formation of the bare zone and thereby determine the exact morphology of the BTF.</p>

          <title>The assembly reaction is delicately balanced.</title>
          <p>The truncation analysis provides evidence of a delicate balance between forces that drive assembly and disassembly of myosin tails. This is most strikingly demonstrated by the observation that Ala 2 was actually found to inhibit the assembly of AD, while Ala 1 and the C-terminal domain help to drive assembly. We propose that that this delicate balance is related to the 196-a.a. charge repeat in the tail. The attachment of Ala 2 (purple, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>) to the AD (blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>) adds a large cluster of negative charge onto the end of this tail fragment. Assembly might be inhibited because a proper balance of charge is required for efficient self-assembly. This balance is restored by addition of either the C-terminal portion of the tail (green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>) or Ala 1 (red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020356-g001">Figure 1</xref>), because both of these domains possess clusters of positive charge.</p>
          <p>Because the charge repeats likely play a role in each step in the assembly pathway, a small effect, such as the introduction of negative charge at key points in the molecule, could have a large effect on overall self-assembly. The threonine phosphorylation sites are positioned near the positive clusters of charge at the end of AD and in the C-terminal domain, suggesting that regulation by phosphorylation might have its largest effect on this charge pattern.</p>

Internal NdeI and NcoI sites were eliminated from the GFP-UV gene by Quikchange mutagenesis (Stratagene), and the modified GFP-UV gene was subcloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) using NcoI and NdeI (GFP-UV-pET28a). Tail fragments were subcloned into GFP-UV-pET28a using NdeI and NotI.</p>
          <p>To create C-terminal GFP fusions, the 5′ and 3′ ends of GFP-UV in the GFP-UV-pET28a vector were modified by PCR. The 5′ primer eliminated the N-terminal 6xhistidine tag and introduced a SacI site. The 3′ primer eliminated an internal SacI site and introduced a 6xhistidine tag, followed by a stop codon, followed by a NotI site. Quikchange mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to eliminate the stop codon immediately before the SacI site in the AD-Cterm tail fragments contained in pET21a. The modified GFP-UV was subcloned into this vector using SacI and NotI. All DNA sequences were verified.</p>
