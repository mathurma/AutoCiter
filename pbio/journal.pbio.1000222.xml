<p>Organisms have evolved a bewildering diversity of mechanisms to generate the two sexes. The honeybee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) employs an interesting system in which sex is determined by heterozygosity at a single locus (the Sex Determination Locus) harbouring the <italic>complementary sex determiner</italic> (<italic>csd</italic>) gene. Bees heterozygous at Sex Determination Locus are females, whereas bees homozygous or hemizygous are males. Little is known, however, about the regulation that links sex determination to sexual differentiation. To investigate the control of sexual development in honeybees, we analyzed the functions and the regulatory interactions of genes involved in the sex determination pathway. We show that heterozygous <italic>csd</italic> is only required to induce the female pathway, while the <italic>feminizer</italic> (<italic>fem</italic>) gene maintains this decision throughout development. By RNAi induced knockdown we show that the <italic>fem</italic> gene is essential for entire female development and that the <italic>csd</italic> gene exclusively processes the heterozygous state. <italic>Fem</italic> activity is also required to maintain the female determined pathway throughout development, which we show by mosaic structures in <italic>fem</italic>-repressed intersexuals. We use expression of Fem protein in males to demonstrate that the female maintenance mechanism is controlled by a positive feedback splicing loop in which Fem proteins mediate their own synthesis by directing female <italic>fem</italic> mRNA splicing. The <italic>csd</italic> gene is only necessary to induce this positive feedback loop in early embryogenesis by directing splicing of <italic>fem</italic> mRNAs. Finally, <italic>fem</italic> also controls the splicing of <italic>Am-doublesex</italic> transcripts encoding conserved male- and female-specific transcription factors involved in sexual differentiation. Our findings reveal how the sex determination process is realized in honeybees differing from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p>

<p>Sexual differentiation is a fundamental process in the animal kingdom, and different species have evolved a bewildering diversity of mechanisms to generate the two sexes in the proper proportions. Sex determination in honeybees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) provides an interesting and unusual system to study, as it is governed by heterozygosity of a single locus harbouring the <italic>complementary sex determiner</italic> gene (<italic>csd</italic>), in contrast to the well-studied sex chromosome system of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We show that the female sex determination pathway is exclusively induced by the <italic>csd</italic> gene in early embryogenesis. Later on and throughout development this inductive signal is maintained via a positive feedback loop of the <italic>feminizer</italic> (<italic>fem</italic>) gene, in which the Fem protein mediates its own synthesis. The findings reveal how the sex determination process in honeybees is realized by the regulation and function of two genes differing from <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 1845 Dzierzon reported that the sex in the honeybee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) is determined by the fertilization and non-fertilization of eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Dzierzon1">[1]</xref>, and this was more than 50 years before the discovery of sex chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-McClung1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Wilson1">[3]</xref>. Dzierzon's key observation was that a virgin queen that has not taken a mating flight (queens mate only while in free flight away from nest) produces only male progeny. From this result he inferred that unfertilized eggs develop into males, whereas fertilized eggs differentiate into queens and worker bees, which was later confirmed by cytological studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Petrunkewitsch1">[4]</xref>. The unfertilized eggs have a haploid set of 16 chromosomes when compared with fertilized eggs, in which 32 chromosomes were identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Nachtsheim1">[5]</xref>. Despite this, neither the fertilization process nor the haploid or diploid state of the eggs provides the sex determination signal in honeybees. This is shown by the regular occurrence of males in inbred crosses that are derived from diploid, fertilized eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Mackensen1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Woyke2">[9]</xref>. This finding led to the hypothesis of complementary sex determination in honeybees, a mechanism that was first provided by genetic studies in another hymenopteran insect, the parasitic wasp <italic>Bracon hebetor</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Whiting1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Whiting2">[11]</xref>. Fertilized eggs are either homozygous at the Sex Determination Locus (SDL) and differentiate into diploid males or are heterozygous and develop into females. The diploid males, however, don't survive in a bee colony as they are eaten by worker bees shortly after hatching from the egg. Fertile males are produced by the queen's unfertilized, haploid eggs that are hemizygous at SDL.</p>
<p>The single-locus nature of complementary sex determination in honeybees was confirmed by genetic linkage analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hunt1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye1">[13]</xref>, physical mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye2">[14]</xref>, and the genetic linkage map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hunt2">[15]</xref>. Part of the SDL was characterized by positional cloning and a fine scale mapping approach that led to the identification of the <italic>complementary sex determiner</italic> (<italic>csd</italic>) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye3">[16]</xref>. The gene encodes an SR-type protein and is a potential splicing factor. The <italic>csd</italic> gene satisfies the criteria of a primary signal of complementary sex determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye3">[16]</xref>: (1) <italic>csd</italic> exists in at least 15 allelic variants that differ on average in ∼3% of their amino acid residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann2">[18]</xref>, (2) females are heterozygous and diploid males are homozygous at the <italic>csd</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye3">[16]</xref>, and (3) the gene product is necessary for female development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye3">[16]</xref>. The latter has been shown in RNAi-induced knockdown experiments of <italic>csd</italic>. Females treated with <italic>csd</italic> dsRNA develop entire male gonads, whereas the treatment of males had no sex-transforming effect.</p>
<p>Disappointingly little, however, is known about the regulatory interactions and mechanisms that link sex determination to sexual differentiation. So far we have no evidence that SDL encodes another gene that, in conjunction with <italic>csd</italic>, operates to establish the sex determined state by heterozygosity. We have recently isolated the entire genomic region of SDL and identified the <italic>feminizer</italic> (<italic>fem</italic>) gene, which is the ancestral progenitor gene from which <italic>csd</italic> derived by gene duplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref> and lies 12 kb upstream of <italic>csd</italic>. The <italic>fem</italic> gene is required for female development as shown by the sexual transformation of the head of <italic>fem</italic>-repressed females. <italic>Fem</italic> activity is not achieved by heterozygosity. Instead, the <italic>fem</italic> pre-mRNAs are sexually processed into the productive female mode. In the current study we characterized the sex-transforming function of other candidate genes located at SDL. We then investigated the function of sex-determining genes in controlling all aspects of development. Our previous studies were restricted to the control of basic aspects of soma differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye3">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref>, but the signals that specify the sex of germ cells may differ from those utilized in the soma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Casper1">[20]</xref>. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the gene <italic>transformer</italic> (<italic>tra</italic>), which is the likely ortholog of the <italic>fem</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref>, is required for the sexual development of the soma but not directly for the sexual fate of germ line cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Marsh1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Schutt1">[23]</xref>. We repressed sex-determining genes in early embryogenesis and scored the sexual development of subtle soma and germ line characters. Finally, we analyzed the regulatory interactions of the sex-determining genes and addressed the question of how these interactions are utilized to maintain sexual fate throughout development. In a previous study we proposed that continuously expressed <italic>csd</italic> is a potential source of information to maintain sexual fate throughout development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye3">[16]</xref>. In order to study these regulatory interactions, we either repressed or expressed genes and assayed the sexual expression of target genes.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal how the regulation and function of the <italic>csd</italic> and the <italic>fem</italic> gene realizes the sex determination process throughout development.</p>

<title>Characterization of Genes Present in SDL</title>
<p>In our previous study we reported the full assembly of the SDL genomic region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref> in a high resolution mapping approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann4">[24]</xref>. The involvement of two SDL genes, <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>csd</italic>, in sexual development have thus far been characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye3">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref>. We hypothesized that this region may harbour additional genes that operate in conjunction with <italic>csd</italic> in the establishment of the primary sex determined state. Three other genes at SDL have been previously predicted, but their involvement in sex determination is unknown. Genes <italic>GB11211</italic> and <italic>GB13727</italic> are located upstream of the <italic>fem</italic> gene, whereas the gene GB30480 (corresponding to Ex4.8–5.8 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye3">[16]</xref>) is located downstream of <italic>csd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We explored whether the SDL harbours further genes. Potential exons were identified by exon-finding algorithms and homology searches to EST and gene databases. We also identified exons by RT-PCR experiments using cDNA synthesized from embryonic mRNA preparations. Exons testing positive in these experiments were combined, but no further transcription units beside the three previous predicted genes were identified. We extended cDNA fragments using RACE PCR, which resulted in the description of two transcripts (EU101387, EU101392), which corresponds to the two known genes, <italic>GB11211</italic> and <italic>GB13727</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). The same sequences were isolated from both males and females implying that the transcripts are not sex-specifically processed. We obtained 3,330 bases of the transcript of gene <italic>GB11211</italic>, which divides into four exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The 5′ end of this transcript has not been isolated by RACE PCR; thus additional translational start codons may lie upstream from the known transcribed sequence. This partial transcript encodes a 926 amino acid protein with partial similarity to a domain from a <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> hypothetical protein (LOC655741) of unknown function. We isolated 803 bases of the transcript of gene <italic>GB13727</italic>, which splits into six exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and which is located on the opposite strand from the other SDL genes. The 3′ end of the transcript has not been identified by our RACE experiments. The partial ORF encodes a protein of 193 amino acids. The protein contains a DUF2464 domain of unknown function that is conserved from worms to humans. No other mRNAs have been detected, suggesting that SDL harbours a total of five protein encoding genes. We studied the involvement of genes <italic>GB11211</italic>, <italic>GB13727</italic>, and <italic>GB30480</italic> in sex determination. We injected dsRNA into male and female syncytial embryos in order to repress transcripts of the new genes and recorded gonad differentiation of 5<sup>th</sup> instar larva. We used gonad differentiation as an informative indicator of sex determination as it is induced early in development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Beye3">[16]</xref>. We also analyzed the <italic>fem</italic> gene, for which we have no information on gonad differentiation, and <italic>csd</italic>, which served as a control for entirely switched gonad development. The syncytial female and haploid male embryos were obtained from single-male (drone) inseminated queens and virgin queens, respectively.</p>

<p>Our injections of dsRNAs targeted at repressing the function of the <italic>GB11211</italic> and <italic>GB13727</italic> genes produced individuals with unchanged gonad development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000222-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g002">Figure 2D–2G</xref>), suggesting that neither gene is required for sex determination. We confirmed the knockdown of these genes by showing a reduction of the amount of mRNAs in real time RT-PCR experiments (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.02 for <italic>GB11211</italic> dsRNAs and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 for <italic>GB13727</italic> dsRNAs treated embryos when compared with mock dsRNA treated controls). Our series of <italic>fem</italic> repression experiments induced by <italic>fem</italic> siRNAs produced 74% females whose gonads had entirely differentiated into male testes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000222-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). No sex-transformed effects occurred in <italic>fem</italic>-repressed males. The testes of <italic>fem</italic>-repressed females were smaller and contained fewer and shorter testioles in all cases, irrespective of whether we compared larvae of the same age or the same stage with the controls, suggesting that this difference is not just a slowdown of development caused by the effect of RNAi. Nevertheless, this finding extends our previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref> and suggests that <italic>fem</italic> gene products are also required for female gonad differentiation. Our series of <italic>csd</italic> knockdown experiments induced by siRNAs resulted in females with fully developed, normal-sized male gonads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000222-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). Males treated with <italic>csd</italic> siRNAs showed unchanged development. Knockdown of <italic>GB30480</italic>, the most downstream gene of the SDL locus, did not influence the differentiation of male or female gonads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000222-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g002">Figure 2L, 2M</xref>). Taken together, our knockdown experiments indicate that no mRNA-encoding genes at SDL other than <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>csd</italic> have sex determination functions.</p>

<title>The Role of <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>csd</italic> Gene in Soma and Germ Line Differentiation</title>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the <italic>tra</italic> gene—the proposed functional and structural ortholog of the <italic>fem</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref>—does not dictate the sexual fate of female germ cells, but controls all aspects of somatic differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Casper1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Marsh1">[21]</xref>. Combined with our results of smaller testis formation in <italic>fem</italic>-repressed individuals, we hypothesized that the <italic>fem</italic> gene of the honeybee is also not involved in the sexual differentiation of germ cells. To dissect the involvement of <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>csd</italic> in the sexual fate of either the germ or the soma, we injected <italic>fem</italic> or <italic>csd</italic> siRNAs into syncytial embryos, but in this study we reared individuals to the late pupal stage (P3). In these experiments we injected into embryos that were derived from two inbred and three non-inbred crosses. The inbred crosses naturally produce 50% diploid male and 50% female progeny, which we identified by genotyping <italic>csd</italic> alleles. This allowed us to compare the male-transformed characters of diploid females with wild type characters of diploid males. This is of importance as characters of haploid and diploid males can differ slightly.</p>
<p>Repression of the <italic>fem</italic> gene resulted in 74% and 85% of the females (derived from the non-inbred and inbred crosses, respectively) showing all aspects of male differentiation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000222-t002">Table 2</xref>). These pseudomales have fully developed internal male reproductive organs, including pairs of testes, mucus glands, and an endophallus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The pair of testes is, however, reduced in size when compared with those of diploid males. Upon microscopic analysis of sections of testicular tubules we observed elongated bundles, the spermatids, but no indication of the undifferentiated cell type that we found in sections of ovariole tissue from untreated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). In some sections we found empty testicular tubules (unpublished data) implying that some mature spermatids had already migrated into the seminal vesicles. The fully switched germ cells indicate that <italic>fem</italic> controls germ cell differentiation as well as the soma. The tibia and the first tarsus of sexually transformed female hind legs have a male-like shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Fig 3O</xref>) and lack the female-specific structures such as the pollen basket (unpublished), the pollen comb, and the pollen brush, which is composed of symmetrically arranged rows of bristles (see the hind leg of an untreated female <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3M</xref> for a comparison). In 7% of <italic>fem</italic> siRNA treated females derived from non-inbred cross (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000222-t002">Table 2</xref>) we found both disordered (male-like) and symmetrical (female-like) bristles adjacent to one another on the first tarsal segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3P</xref>). In addition, the individual in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3P</xref> lacks the female-specific lobe on the first tarsus but displays the pollen comb on the tibia. This suggests that these hind legs are composed of fully differentiated male and female structures. Knockdown of <italic>csd</italic> produced 76% females that displayed all the aspects of male differentiation in external and internal morphology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000222-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These pseudomales had fully developed male reproductive organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) and, in contrast to the <italic>fem</italic>-repressed individuals, testes of normal size. The hind legs showed the full spectrum of male structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3R</xref>). Upon examination of the cytology of testicular tubules we observed the structures of spermatids in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3K</xref>). The repression of <italic>fem</italic> or <italic>csd</italic> in diploid males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000222-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g003">Figure 3</xref>) does not affect the internal and external morphology, indicating that neither <italic>fem</italic> nor <italic>csd</italic> activity is necessary for male differentiation. These experiments imply that the paralogous gene pair <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>csd</italic> are required for controlling female differentiation of both the soma and the germ cells.</p>

<title>Identifying the Regulatory Relationships between <italic>csd</italic>, <italic>fem</italic>, and the <italic>Am-dsx</italic> Gene</title>
<p>Our analyses have identified <italic>csd</italic> and <italic>fem</italic> as different components of the sex determination pathway that are required for all aspects of female differentiation. The next obvious component of the pathway is the <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>) gene. <italic>Dsx</italic> is a transcription factor that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> controls the activity of the final target genes necessary for both male and female somatic differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Burtis1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Erdman1">[26]</xref>. The sex-specific activity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene is brought about by sexually processed transcripts encoding polypeptides that have male- and female-specific domains at their carboxyl-termini. The female splice pattern is mediated by the female Tra protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hoshijima1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Tian1">[28]</xref>, which is the proposed ortholog of the Fem protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref>. Previous studies have identified the ortholog, <italic>Am-dsx</italic>, in the honeybee genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Dearden1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cho1">[31]</xref> encoding an atypical zinc-finger domain, the so called OD1 domain. The gene expresses sex-specific mRNAs and presumably proteins. The central role of <italic>dsx</italic> orthologs in sexual differentiation of insects has been provided by the housefly <italic>Musca domestica</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hediger1">[32]</xref> and in the moth <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Suzuki1">[33]</xref>, but functional evidence for the honeybee are so far missing. In order to determine the regulatory interactions within the honeybee sex determination pathway, we generated pseudomales by the injection of <italic>csd</italic> or <italic>fem</italic> siRNAs and examined the sexual expression of <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>Am-dsx</italic> mRNAs in 5<sup>th</sup> instar larvae by RT-PCR targeting fragments that corresponds to female- and male-specific mRNAs. If the activity of the gene is repressed in females, we expect to find the male mRNAs of downstream components.</p>
<p>Pseudomales produced through the repression of <italic>csd</italic> predominantly displayed fragments that correspond to male <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>Am-dsx</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), implying that the production of female <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>Am-dsx</italic> mRNAs require <italic>csd</italic> activity. This finding is consistent with the expectation that <italic>csd</italic> is the primary signal that determines all aspects of female differentiation. <italic>Csd</italic> activity is, however, not required to induce male <italic>fem</italic> or <italic>Am-dsx</italic> mRNAs, indicating that the male transcripts do not require any sex-specifying signal and that this is the default regulatory state. The repression of <italic>fem</italic> also produced pseudomales that have male <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>Am-dsx</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The finding of male <italic>Am-dsx</italic> mRNAs in <italic>fem</italic>-repressed females indicates that <italic>fem</italic> activity is necessary to induce female <italic>Am-dsx</italic> mRNAs. The observation of male <italic>fem</italic> mRNAs also suggests that <italic>fem</italic> mRNA production was resumed in later developmental stages after <italic>fem</italic> activity was experimentally repressed in early embryos. From the presence of male mRNAs under conditions of resumed <italic>fem</italic> mRNA production, we conclude that the <italic>csd</italic> gene has lost its ability to direct the processing of <italic>fem</italic> into the female mode. Thus, it appears that in the absence of the female-specifying signal, the male variant is produced that is the default regulatory state.</p>

<title>Maintenance of the Sex Determined State</title>
<p>Our data so far indicate that the ability of <italic>csd</italic> to direct the processing of <italic>fem</italic> is restricted to a critical window in early development. This prompted us to investigate how the sexual state induced by the <italic>csd</italic> gene is maintained throughout development. Examination of the expression of <italic>fem</italic> during development indicates that female <italic>fem</italic> mRNAs are present in the late blastoderm stage and remain expressed throughout embryonic, late larval, and pupal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Together with our finding that <italic>csd</italic> is not employed to direct the processing of <italic>fem</italic> in late larvae and pupae, we conclude that an additional mechanism of regulation exists to maintain <italic>fem</italic> processing into the productive female mode in these late stages. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the sex determination gene <italic>Sex-lethal</italic> (<italic>Sxl</italic>) encodes a protein that directs the splicing of its own transcript into the productive female mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Bell1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Keyes1">[35]</xref>. This self-splicing loop maintains the female-determined state throughout development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cline2">[36]</xref>. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the medfly <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic> at the level of the sex-determining <italic>tra</italic> (<italic>Cc-tra</italic>) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Salvemini1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Pane1">[38]</xref>, a gene which has a common ancestry with the <italic>fem</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref>. These findings prompted us to hypothesize that a positive autoregulatory activity of <italic>fem</italic> provides the mechanism for maintaining the female-determined state and provides a source of a female-specific signal implementing the sexual development pathway. To test our hypothesis we transiently expressed the <italic>fem</italic> gene in males by injecting <italic>fem</italic> encoding mRNAs that we synthesized in vitro. We assayed the processing of the putative target—the endogenous <italic>fem</italic> mRNA—by RT-PCR amplifications. This experiment shows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g006">Figure 6</xref>) that expression of <italic>fem</italic> induces a partial switch from male into female mRNAs, suggesting that the provided <italic>fem</italic> activity trans-activates the endogenous <italic>fem</italic> gene. We conclude from this finding that expression of Fem protein induces its own synthesis by directing the processing of <italic>fem</italic> pre-mRNA into the productive female mode. This finding would establish a positive regulatory feedback loop at the level of the <italic>fem</italic> gene.</p>

<title>The Foundation of Complementary Sex Determination Is a Single Gene, <italic>csd</italic></title>
<p>Sex in the honeybee is determined by the heterozygosity and hemi/homozygosity at a single SDL. In this study we show that this genomic locus harbours five mRNA encoding genes but that only the <italic>csd</italic> gene fulfils criteria of a primary signal of complementary sex determination, implying that the molecular nature of complementary sex determination is <italic>csd</italic>. When <italic>csd</italic> is repressed in early embryogenesis in females, we see an entire switch into male development that affects all visible aspects of soma and germ line development. We see comparable effects in the soma and the germ line when we repress <italic>fem</italic> in females, which is located 12 kb upstream of <italic>csd</italic>. <italic>Fem</italic> mRNA is, however, sex-specifically processed in response to the heterozygous <italic>csd</italic> gene, suggesting that <italic>fem</italic> is a target that directly responds to the activity at the <italic>csd</italic> gene. We have not identified allelic variants of <italic>fem</italic> transcripts that could encode different allelic specificities within our crosses (unpublished data). We conclude that <italic>fem</italic> is the target of <italic>csd</italic> that implements male or female differentiation by a productive female, or a non-productive male splice variant. The three other mRNA encoding genes of SDL are not necessary for sex determination. Our experiments do not exclude the possibility that SDL harbours a non-mRNA encoding gene (such as a microRNA), but we find no evidence for such a gene. The exclusion of other sex-determining factors at SDL suggests that complementary sex determination entirely relies on heterozygous combination of the <italic>csd</italic> gene. The primary signal of the honeybee is a switch gene that has two regulatory states, the active female and the non-active male state. We propose that induction of the female pathway through gain of <italic>csd</italic> activity is due to the presence of two Csd proteins derived from different alleles. Lack of <italic>csd</italic> activity, and thus male development, results when Csd proteins are derived from the same allele. We hypothesize that activation in females relies entirely on the binding differences of Csd's RS- and asparagine/tyrosine-enriched domains. This region harbours elevated nucleotide polymorphism and has been proposed as the allele specifying domain in our population genetics analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann2">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>The heterozygous activation of <italic>csd</italic> has some analogy to self-incompatibility systems in plants and fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Nasrallah1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-McClure1">[41]</xref>, in which different alleles of a single locus initiate a developmental program, that in the case the S-locus system in plants controls the outgrowth of a pollen grain. Molecular studies in these systems revealed that the determination of heterozygous state relies on the operation of two separate but closely linked genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Nasrallah1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-McClure1">[41]</xref>. Our analysis indicates that the heterozygous state in the honeybee is processed by a single gene. The comparison suggests a novel mechanism of gene regulation to those previously identified.</p>

<title>The <italic>fem</italic> Gene Implements and Maintains Soma and Germ Line Development</title>
<p>In order to determine sex, the activity of heterozygous <italic>csd</italic> must implement sexually different activities to downstream genes. Our identification of the <italic>fem</italic> gene also allowed us to identify female-specific mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref>. Our analysis shows that the female <italic>fem</italic> mRNAs are required for all visible aspects of female morphology. Testes were, however, all smaller in <italic>fem</italic>-repressed females when compared with wild type diploid males or <italic>csd</italic>-repressed females. We speculate that the timing of <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>csd</italic> activity may affect differently gonad differentiation when we experimentally repress these genes. These testes form normally differentiated testicular tubules harbouring fully developed spermatids, implying that the <italic>fem</italic> gene also controls germ cell differentiation. Despite a common evolutionary origin, the <italic>tra</italic> gene of <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not dictate the sexual fate of germ cells and its function is restricted to the control of the soma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Marsh1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Schutt1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have used the sex-specific mRNAs as a phenotype to identify the interactions of sex-regulatory genes by assuming that genes affecting <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>Am-dsx</italic> splice patterns are operating upstream in the cascade. The <italic>Am-dsx</italic> gene, which is an ortholog of the <italic>dsx</italic> gene of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is another component of the sex determination whose mRNA is sex-specifically processed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Dearden1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cho1">[31]</xref>. Our analysis indicates that interactions occur at least at three levels of the cascade—<italic>csd</italic> controls splicing of <italic>fem</italic> pre-mRNA, and <italic>fem</italic> regulates the processing of <italic>Am-dsx</italic> pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The observation of the male variant of <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>Am-dsx</italic> mRNAs in the repression experiments implies that the female pathway is actively regulated and Csd protein directs splicing in <italic>fem</italic>, and Fem protein directs splicing in <italic>Am-dsx</italic> female mRNAs. The male pathway is the default regulatory state that does not require any sex-specifying control. This suggests that the male splice pattern of <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>Am-dsx</italic> results from the splice machinery that is present in both males and females. Our analysis does not preclude other levels of interactions. It is conceivable that the Fem protein is directly involved in the splicing process of <italic>Am-dsx</italic> transcripts given the apparent structural and functional relationship of these genes to the <italic>Drosophila tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cline1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Dearden1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cho1">[31]</xref>. To show a direct interaction between these levels of regulation requires detailed protein binding and splicing studies, however. Besides the succession of interactions, we find evidence for a positive regulatory feedback loop at the level of the <italic>fem</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We have demonstrated that provisioning of female <italic>fem</italic> mRNAs in males induces a partial shift in the processing of endogenous <italic>fem</italic> pre-mRNAs into the female mode. We conclude from this observation that the expression of <italic>fem</italic> establishes a positive feedback loop in which Fem protein induces—directly or indirectly—its own synthesis by splicing <italic>fem</italic> pre-mRNAs into the productive female mode. In males, <italic>fem</italic> activity would be absent and the pre-mRNA would be spliced into the non-reproductive male mode. We propose that the positive feedback loop would (1) generate stably determined states implemented by the commitment given by the primary signal <italic>csd</italic> and (2) maintain the determined state throughout development. That a positive feedback would generate stable determined states throughout development is demonstrated here by the finding of mosaic structures in <italic>fem</italic>-repressed females that have male or female characters, but not an intermediate phenotype. The mosaic intersexual phenotype is consistent with previous reports on a cell-autonomous sexual differentiation mechanism in the honeybee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Drescher1">[42]</xref>, but our data also provide evidence for the <italic>fem</italic> positive feedback loop as being the mechanism of stable determined cells.</p>

<title>The regulative hierarchy of honeybee sex determination in relation to other insect model species.</title>
<p>(A) Model for the honeybee sex determination pathway that controls both soma and germ cells. The heterozygous or homo-/hemizygous state of the <italic>csd</italic> gene determines whether Csd protein is active. Active Csd proteins, derived from different <italic>csd</italic> alleles in females, are splicing factors that direct the processing into female <italic>fem</italic> mRNAs. Female <italic>fem</italic> mRNAs (<italic>fem<sup>F</sup></italic>) are producing active Fem proteins that are required to mediate the splicing of <italic>Am-dsx</italic> pre-mRNA into the female mRNAs. The Fem protein has an additional positive feedback activity that directs the processing of <italic>fem<sup>F</sup></italic> mRNAs. Inactive CSD proteins, when derived from homo- or hemizygous <italic>csd</italic> alleles, result in a splicing of the <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> transcripts, which is the default male state (<italic>fem<sup>M</sup></italic>, <italic>Am-dsx<sup>M</sup></italic>). (B) Model for the sex determination pathway in <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Salvemini1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Pane1">[38]</xref>. The presence or absence of an unidentified factor <italic>M</italic> determines sex. In the absence of <italic>M</italic> the maternal provided <italic>Cc-tra</italic> gene product establishes an autoregulative loop in which Cc-Tra protein mediates the production of female <italic>Cc-tra</italic> mRNA. The Cc-Tra protein directs the splicing of <italic>Cc-dsx</italic> pre-mRNA into the female mode. The presence of <italic>M</italic> impairs the positive autoregulative loop of the <italic>Cc-tra</italic> gene products producing a default splicing pattern of <italic>Cc-tra</italic> transcripts, the male pre-mRNA. The male <italic>Cc-dsx</italic> mRNA is produced by default. (C) Simplified view of the somatic sex determination hierarchy in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cline1">[22]</xref>. The X∶A ratio determines whether <italic>Sxl</italic> is activated. Sxl protein in females is a splicing factor that directs the splicing of <italic>tra</italic> pre-mRNA into the female mode, resulting in the production of active Tra protein in females. Tra protein mediates the processing of female <italic>dsx</italic> mRNAs. In the absence of Sxl protein all these regulatory decisions do not occur and the male <italic>dsx<sup>M</sup></italic> is produced by default. The male and female <italic>dsx</italic> transcripts encode sex-specific transcription factors that have several target genes and are involved in various aspects of sexual differentiation.

<p>We also explored how the female state is established and reset to the default male state in early embryogenesis. This is important, as male development is only induced in the absence of <italic>fem</italic> activity and as constant activity of the positive feedback loop would lock eggs into the female determined state. Our developmental profile of <italic>fem</italic> mRNA expression indicates that transcription of <italic>fem</italic> starts expression to sizable amounts of mRNA of the male type when blastoderm is formed (∼12 h after egg deposition). This finding implies that the sex determined state is set to the default male regulatory mode by the onset of <italic>fem</italic> transcription in early embryogenesis. The female pathway is induced in late blastoderm stage (∼25–35 h after egg deposition) when the female mRNAs in females are produced.</p>
<p>We also provide evidence that <italic>csd</italic> is required only to initiate sex-specific differentiation early in development. When we transiently repressed <italic>fem</italic> activity, we found male <italic>fem</italic> mRNAs under conditions of resumed mRNA production in late female larvae, suggesting that <italic>csd</italic> is no longer able to induce the production of female <italic>fem</italic> mRNAs. We conclude from this finding that <italic>csd</italic> can implement the female pathway only during a critical period of development. Primary signals from other organisms are also needed for only a critical developmental window when the pathway is established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cline1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Sanchez1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Goodfellow1">[45]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cline1">[22]</xref> and possibly in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Sekido1">[46]</xref> the sex determined state that is established by the primary signal is maintained later on in development by a different mechanism. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, once the <italic>Sxl</italic> gene is activated in females by the primary signal (the X∶A ratio), the Sxl protein splices its own transcript into the productive female mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Bell1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Keyes1">[35]</xref>. This feedback splicing loop locks development into the female pathway as shown by mosaic intersexual analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cline2">[36]</xref>. Our data also suggest that there are separate mechanisms for initiating and maintaining the sex determined state in honeybees. While honeybees and <italic>Drosophila</italic> utilize the same strategy in the control of the sex determined state, they employ different molecules.</p>

<title>The <italic>fem/tra</italic> Gene Encodes Key Functions of Sex Determination that Are Ancestral among Holometabolous Insects</title>
<p>We have previously suggested, based on functional and some structural similarities, that the <italic>fem</italic> gene and the dipteran <italic>tra</italic> genes of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<italic>tra</italic>) and of the medfly <italic>Ceratitis</italic> (<italic>Cc-tra</italic>) have a common evolutionary origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Hasselmann3">[19]</xref> irrespective of the great amino acid sequence differences between their proteins. The knowledge of <italic>tra</italic> functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Cline1">[22]</xref> and <italic>Ceratitis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Salvemini1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Pane1">[38]</xref> and of <italic>fem</italic> studied here allows us to infer ancestral and derived functions within the <italic>fem</italic>/<italic>tra</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g007">Figure 7A–7C</xref>). <italic>Tra</italic> and <italic>Cc-tra</italic> gene produce sex-specific transcripts and the encoding female Tra protein directs the splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> pre-mRNA into the female mode, implying that this pathway is conserved over the last 130 million years among this group of dipteran insects. The phylogenetic position of the honeybee is at the base of holometabolous insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Savard1">[47]</xref> (including the Diptera [flies], Lepidoptera [moths, butterflies], and Coleoptera [beetles]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), representing over 270 million years of evolution.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the sex-determining genes <italic>fem</italic>, <italic>tra</italic>, and <italic>Cc-tra</italic> are activated by processing the pre-mRNA into the productive female mode. In all the three species the female <italic>tra</italic>/<italic>fem</italic> mRNAs encode the active gene product, which directs the splicing into female <italic>dsx</italic> mRNAs. The male part of this hierarchy is also conserved: in the absence of the sex-specific signal the male mRNAs of the <italic>tra/fem</italic> and the <italic>dsx</italic> gene is produced, which is the default regulatory state. We conclude that despite great variety of sex determination mechanisms in insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Nthiger1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Heimpel1">[50]</xref> the processing of sex-specific information by the <italic>tra/fem</italic> gene in these insects is conserved. This implies that the sex determination pathways of holometabolous insects converge at the level of the <italic>tra</italic> gene family. The <italic>fem</italic> and the <italic>Cc-tra</italic> gene of <italic>Ceratitis</italic> are required for germ-cell differentiation, whereas in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the function of <italic>tra</italic> is restricted to the soma, suggesting that the control of the germ sexual identity is ancestral. Our comparison further indicates that the maintenance of the sexual fate at the level of the <italic>tra</italic> gene family is ancestral. Our mosaic analysis suggests that <italic>fem</italic> has an additional function in maintaining sex throughout development. We find direct molecular evidence for this in the form of a feedback splicing loop in which Fem proteins mediate splicing of <italic>fem</italic> pre-mRNA into the productive female mode. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the female state is maintained via the positive feedback splicing loop of the <italic>Sxl</italic> gene, which operates as the next upstream regulator of the <italic>tra</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000222-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). The repression analysis of <italic>Cc-tra</italic> and putative binding sites of Tra/Tra-2 proteins are indicators of a positive feedback splicing loop operating in <italic>Ceratitis</italic> at the level of the <italic>Cc-tra</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Salvemini1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Pane1">[38]</xref>. This comparison indicates that the maintenance of sexual fate via a splicing loop of the <italic>tra</italic>/<italic>fem</italic> gene is most likely ancestral and that a self-splicing loop has been co-opted in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by the <italic>Sxl</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000222-Siera1">[51]</xref>. We infer that the maintenance of sexual fate in the sex determination pathway is a critical strategy in the development of a holometabolous insect. Taken together, the phylogenetic comparison suggests that the common ancestor of the <italic>fem</italic>/<italic>tra</italic> gene was employed in implementing and maintaining all visible aspects of sexual differentiation, while the upstream sex determination mechanism can vary. We conclude that the <italic>fem</italic>/<italic>tra</italic> gene is the ancestral key regulator of sex determination of holometabolous insects.</p>

Amplified fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000222.s001">Dataset S1, G</xref>) of endogenous <italic>fem</italic> were composed of exons 2-3-6 (size ∼560 bp) and exons 3 (size ∼400 bp) corresponding to the female and male transcripts, respectively.</p>
